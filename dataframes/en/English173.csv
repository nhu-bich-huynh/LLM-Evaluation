"These surveys, and the Commission did not see fit to continue - and we all know the reason why - shows that Europe is today being built by Eurocrats, with the agreement of governments, and that it is not the Europe of the people."
"Now we understand far better why the Treaty of Amsterdam, following on from the Treaty of Maastricht, has been drafted in such an obscure way, and why we find such esoteric provisions, hiding behind the protocol on subsidiarity, and which - but without clearly saying so - adopt the position of the European Court of Justice, on the claimed superiority of Community law over national constitutions."
"There is a reason for this obscurity."
"It throws simple citizens off track, and prevents any understanding of the real long term purpose of what the citizens are asked to ratify, and it allows those who are responsible - and the French Ministry of European Affairs was a recent example of this - to hide behind technical questions, to support the view that it would not be the right time to consult the people by holding a referendum."
"It is easy to understand the short term tactics behinds these manoeuvrings, but the longer term aims are not so easy to divine."
"People say that the federal construction, once completed, will be more effective than the Europe of the nations."
"But does anyone perchance believe that it will be possible to achieve efficiency by adopting purely technocratic procedures without the commitment and support of the people?"
"This is a pure illusion."
"In reality, there can be no efficient European construction unless it has the support of the people, and this is the reason why, whatever people say, the Europe of the nations is not only the most democratic of Europe's, but also the most efficient."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted yes to the report on the Amsterdam Treaty today."
"We have done so in the opinion that the report emphasizes many important Danish issues."
"Examples include better environmental protection, cooperation in the fight against unemployment, transparency and greater influence for the European Parliament."
"However, the report on the Amsterdam Treaty is problematical in some areas."
"It was therefore necessary to vote against some paragraphs in the report."
"In our view it is very regrettable that the European Parliament wants to try to put obstacles in the path of enlargement by demanding that all institutional reforms should be in place before enlargement begins."
"It has therefore been necessary for us to vote against these paragraphs."
"Another criticism of the report is the linking together of Denmark with Ireland and the UK with regard to the Schengen cooperation."
"Denmark participates in Schengen at an intergovernmental level, while both Ireland and the UK are totally outside the cooperation."
"We are therefore voting against it because it sends the wrong signals to the Member States about Denmark's involvement in the Schengen cooperation."
"The report also sets the scene for a further cooperation in the area of security and defence policy."
"It is the opinion of the Danish Social Democrats that the security and defence of Europe should be secured through membership of NATO and not through the WEU."
"We are therefore voting against paragraph 9, because we believe that it conflicts with the Danish reservations."
"The European Parliament is helping to make decision-making in the EU more democratic and transparent."
"We therefore support the fact that agricultural policy, among other things, is to come under joint decision-making in the European Parliament."
"However, we cannot support the inclusion of defence and foreign policy or legal and internal affairs, which are in the third pillar, under this procedure."
"The European Parliament is generally regarded as the big winner in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"An appropriate conclusion, in view of amongst other things the enlargement of the area in which the joint decision-making procedure is to be applied, and the required approval of Parliament for the appointment of the President of the European Commission."
"A large number of the European Parliament's wishes have not been granted, but the majority of this Parliament is sufficiently pragmatic to recommend to Member States that they ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"That, however, is not our advice to the Member States."
"The rapporteurs point out that the European Treaties, including the Treaty of Amsterdam, will not lead to a federal European state."
"This ideal is evidently out of fashion."
"Yet I cannot but interpret the new treaty which extends the powers of the Union in areas such as employment, social affairs, internal security, and defence, and which strengthens communal procedures, as a step in the direction of a European political union."
"This ambition has been superseded, in view of the future enlargement of the Union to an even more heterogeneous bond of 20 of maybe even more Member States."
"It is also problematic that no account was taken of the dissatisfaction of the citizens of the Member States about a governmental structure which has been imposed from above."
"The public support for 'Europe' has decreased considerably over the past few years, as shown in opinion polls, election results, and in the turnout for European elections."
"A treaty with a less ambitious estimation of what European government can do, would have been a better way to show the surplus value of European cooperation."
"A slimming down of the European portfolio would make European decision-making clearer, in the end, and would simplify the enlargement."
"The extension of the powers of the European Parliament is in our view not the best solution to the democratic deficit in European decision-making, after all."
"The awareness that Parliament functions at a considerable distance from the citizen is not getting through frequently enough."
"By definition, it has inadequate representative strength and legitimacy, partly as it has to represent an increasingly larger area via a limited number of members."
"Although the European Parliament fulfils a useful role in some areas, the national parliaments need to remain the main focus to their citizens."
"National parliaments will be looked at as a priority at the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We reject the Treaty of Amsterdam and that is why we have voted against the Méndez de Vigo/Tsatsos report."
"It is an understatement to say that the conclusions of Amsterdam were not a cause for jubilation and enthusiasm from European public opinion."
"As is the case for all compromises, the Treaty of Amsterdam leaves those who, like myself, are passionately interested in Europe and European construction, and have been for a score or more years, somewhat dissatisfied."
"Let it be said clearly: this treaty is not up to the challenges and ambitions of European construction, which should, in less than five years from now, have completed single currency, enlargement, the fight against employment, political Europe, and social Europe."
"But is that a reason to reject the treaty, and join the camp of those who are such constant adversaries of European construction?"
"I think not. If so, the cure would be worse than the illness itself!"
"Following on from Maastricht, Amsterdam has opened up a number of doors."
"We need to have no hesitation in using them and the new resources they make available to advance towards a Europe of citizenship which can combat unemployment and have a political existence on the world stage."
"It is up to we sincere Europeans to work for this!"
"But we also must demand that tomorrow's Luxembourg summit on employment should be concrete, strong, and active, and that the day after tomorrow, we need new institutional reform, so that the forthcoming enlargement takes place as it should, without disorganization or weakening."
"We have entered into a new stage with Amsterdam."
"Things might have been better, but the important thing now, is to prepare for the next step."
"Despite the fact the Alleanza Nazionale has made strong criticisms of the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference and later of the final draft of the Treaty of Amsterdam on several occasions, we have decided, owing to a sense of responsibility, to vote in favour of the report drawn up by the Committee on Institutional Affairs, as we have found that some of our negative positions on the treaty and some of our proposals to strengthen the pillars of the foreign and defence policy have proved essential for the Union to become a real political community of European States and peoples."
"Ours is therefore an act of good will, despite preferring the report to have been more decisive and complete on some points, such as the expansion of the Union and the rebalancing of its political and economic actions in respect of the South and the Mediterranean."
"We are now waiting for the actions to follow the words, particularly with regard to the importance of the ""unconditional approval' of the joint declaration made by Belgium, France and Italy, identifying the need for further institutional reforms, as a prerequisite to any expansion."
"Our vote in favour is therefore further confirmation of the vocation and political choice of the Italian Right, with the primary objective of creating a real political Europe."
"I regret that the resolution presented by the Committee on Institutional Affairs by the Parliament has not taken up the conclusions of the legal committee relating to the re-numbering of the treaty."
"The decision to re-number all of the articles in the treaty appears to me to be regrettable in two respects."
"As regards fundamentals, I fear that this may be an apparent simplification, which will in practice result in confusions and complications for the actual users of the treaty, who are the national administrations, professionals, etc.. Any reference to the treaty will lead to two-fold searching and checking, both with the old numbering and the new."
"As regards procedure, a reform on this scale should have been preceded by in-depth consultations with the people involved, and that was not the case."
"Only the European bars reacted spontaneously, by expressing their opposition to reform."
"But their protests were rejected summarily, in the name of an overhasty technocratic argument."
"The outcome of the revision of the Maastricht Treaty was far from satisfactory, since the political objectives that had been set were not met."
"As a convinced European, I deeply regret that having failed to rectify the Union's political defects prior to the essential enlargement, we now have to postpone to a new Intergovernmental Conference the resolution of such important institutional problems as the reduction of the number of Commissioners, the generalization of qualifiedmajority voting, etc. What greater indication of the Amsterdam summit's failure can there be than the fact that before the draft treaty is even ratified by the Member States we already talking about the essential need to amend it?"
"On the threshold of economic and monetary union, the Union has still not adapted its institutions to the forthcoming enlargement - which, by any reckoning, is seriously irresponsible."
"It still does not have a common defence policy, and it has still not clarified the treaties so that the citizens can understand them."
"Lastly - although some people wrongly believe that this a minor issue - the Amsterdam Treaty deliberately fails to include any reference to tourism, ignoring the fact that, amongst other things, tourism is the biggest source of job creation in the European Union."
"These necessarily brief remarks will explain why I abstained in the vote, although I wish to qualify that abstention by congratulating Mr Méndez de Vigo on his excellent work, for as the poet Machado said, the road is built as we go along."
"The motion for a resolution on the amendment of the Union Treaties submitted to the Plenary of the European Parliament by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, is, in my view, inadequate, ambiguous, irresolute and insensitive to public opinion and the role of the national parliaments."
"Admittedly, the amendments tabled have improved the motion, but the European Parliament, whose right to vote to approve or reject the revision of the treaties has not been recognized, has an obligation to point out the draft treaty's inadequacies in the fields of democratization, social rights and human rights. It also has an obligation to make clear that the Amsterdam Treaty does not make it possible to meet effectively the challenge of future enlargements, and leaves it up to the parliaments - or, as the case may be, the people - of the individual Member States to decide, in accordance with the conditions laid down, whether or not to ratify the new treaty."
"Instead of that, the report submitted to Parliament mixes criticism and calls for further changes and new methods with the specific recommendation that the fifteen Member States should rapidly ratify the treaty."
"Undoubtedly, the final assessment in the individual Member States will have to be made in accordance with the commitments undertaken by their respective governments. But the European Parliament, in my view, now has a duty to make its critical assessment in accordance with the positions that it maintained throughout the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Consequently, in view of the rejection of the amendments that I tabled along those lines, and with a sense of responsibility as a committed European, I voted against the Méndez de Vigo-Tsatsos report, although without prejudging the position that the Iniciativa per Catalunya MPs will adopt in the Spanish Parliament in due course."
"I am voting against this report, because the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow for the establishment of a true political pillar providing for the balanced completion of the monetary aspect of European Union."
"The Maastricht treaty wagered it would make moves towards a single currency on the basis of rigorous (actually, far too rigorous) economic convergence criteria, but that it would also consolidate political integration by providing for institutional reform for the purposes of improving the efficiency, democratic operations and role of the European Parliament."
"The IGC should also make it possible to develop European policy in social and labour relationships, fields which are critical to our peoples."
"We cannot but observe that the Maastricht bet has not paid off, and that the intended balance has not in fact been respected."
"Monetary union is going full steam ahead, whereas political Europe is getting bogged down powerlessly."
"This situation is all the more serious as our destiny is increasingly conditioned by the decisions taken by an independent European central bank, without there being any government with decision-making powers in the economic field over the major areas of choice affecting economic growth, European competitiveness, and employment."
"Hence, Europe is increasingly becoming an extensive financial and economic area which escapes all regulation or democratic control."
"Enlargement to the Eastern European countries will only increase the dilution of democracy."
"While the report proposes further institutional reform, prior to any enlargement, the European Parliament has not moved to a position where it can make this an effective and absolute condition."
"We have not achieved a situation where the Parliament can weigh with its influence on the future summit on employment at Luxembourg, and hence, in practice, move social Europe onwards."
"While the introduction of a reference to social affairs and employment in the new treaty is positive, the way this is formulated is ambiguous, as the treaty simply makes reference to the coordination of policies of employment, which remain national."
"In brief, once again, Europe has postponed political reinforcement, and has left the social question in abeyance, while monetarism and liberal dogma is enforced upon us in the form of constrictive criteria."
"Far from serving the ambitions of those who wish for a federal Europe, a Europe where the people can make their will felt, the treaty is a consecration of weakened nation states, without the construction of a true European political counter-power."
"It is unacceptable."
"The Amsterdam Treaty does not constitute the final step towards creating a United States of Europe, but its contents move in a direction which strengthens the EU's ambitions to develop into a federal state structure with superpower characteristics."
"Supranationality is being strengthened, border controls are being abolished and the EMU process with a common currency and central bank is being confirmed."
"Institutionally, it is the EU's supranational organs, the Commission, the Court of Justice and the European Parliament, which benefit from the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The losers are the Council of Ministers and the national parliaments."
"There is not a single sentence in the treaty which confirms that decision-making power is going to be transferred from the EU to the Member States."
"Questions of major concern for Nordic countries about employment, openness and the environment have at best been given well-meaning words, but ultimately these could be forced to capitulate to the supremacy of the single market."
"The so-called environmental guarantee is even a step backwards compared with the time when it was introduced."
"It is unacceptable for a new Intergovernmental Conference, which further strengthens the EU's federal character, to be made a condition for the eastern enlargement."
"We also find it unwarranted to give additional power to the larger countries if the EU is to be enlarged."
"Giving the European Parliament a right of assent for treaty amendments must be rejected."
"That would entirely remove the basis for the intergovernmental nature of the treaty."
"There is an obvious reason why the Amsterdam Treaty does not go as far as the most outspoken federalists in the EU had hoped."
"Public sympathy for EU federalism has probably never been as low as now."
"The peoples of Europe want to have cooperation, but not at the price of subordinating themselves to the EU's centralistic, bureaucratic and old-fashioned Acquis Communautaire."
"According to opinion poles in the Nordic countries, there is solid opposition to participation in EMU, i.e. the project which is in a way the engine for the creation of a federal state structure at the EU level."
"The basis for every society which wants to guarantee people jobs, a good education, a good environment, social justice and solidarity with the people of poor countries, is that its political system is popular and democratically legitimate."
"The EU will not have the ability to achieve that for the foreseeable future."
"We have voted no to the report."
"I wish to state that I have voted in favour of the Vigo report and in favour of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I am disappointed with what has been achieved in Amsterdam."
"What is most regrettable, Mr President, is that we must go through the whole process of ratification for what is a very small measure of progress."
"It will be difficult in Ireland, where a referendum is required, to generate enthusiasm for the Amsterdam Treaty."
"What I most regret is the failure to secure a proper reform of the way decisions are made; institutional reform as we call it."
"This failure has to be described to the people in plain language."
"It means that if we enlarge the Community then from that day on not only present Member States can prevent important decisions but even Slovenia or Estonia will be able to apply a veto and block important decisions in a whole range of Community policies."
"We are being irresponsible to agree to further enlargement in such circumstances."
"There is the danger of creating serious crisis and stagnation."
"The bigger the number of states the greater the danger of a crisis occurring."
"I welcome the extension of powers for the European Parliament."
"It is important that 70 % of all legislation will be by codecision between Parliament and the Council."
"The principle of democracy must be applied to the European Union as it is in all Member States."
"Finally, I want to make it clear that I am happy that we have made some progress in the area of common security and defence."
"All Member States have accepted the creation of a political union in ratifying the existing treaties, and that political union cannot be complete without the development of common defence arrangements."
"The Amsterdam Treaty makes common defence possible but provides for reluctant States to opt out."
"I am sure that in the short term my own State will decide to opt out."
"This is largely because the political establishment and the Irish media still insist, in all public discussion, on retaining the terminology of World War II and defining this question in terms of neutrality as was traditionally observed by the Irish State."
"On the other hand, when opinion polls in Ireland offered the question whether Ireland should help to defend a fellow Member State the majority replied positively."
"That is why I believe that I am representing the view of the vast majority of Irish people when I say I support the common defence policies because I believe that it is not the will of the Irish people that they should have all the benefits of membership while refusing to accept responsibility for security and defence."
"Treaty of Amsterdam, Amendment No 13: Text does not conform to the principle of Austrian neutrality."
"The main criteria to be used in the assessment of the Treaty of Amsterdam have been summarized in Amendment No 32 made by the I-EDN group."
"There are four such criteria. Let me review them."
"First criterion: respect for national democracy and constitutional rules of the Member States, within the framework of an association of sovereign states in which the national border is the one of greatest legitimacy for the democratic expression of the will of the people."
"Second criterion: reinforcing the role of national parliaments in the European decision-making process."
"Third criterion: the search of a more transparent Union."
"Fourth criterion: the need for enlargement, which requires at the institutional level the setting up of a variable geometry Europe based on differentiated cooperation."
"Now, what does the Amsterdam Treaty propose?"
"Bypassing national democracy, basing itself on individuals, against the peoples and Member States."
"The absence of any role for national parliaments, which are gradually to be deprived of their competency in decision-making at the European level."
"Opaque negotiations, ever more complex procedures, and weakened democratic control."
"Systematic communitarization in all fields, which itself raises so many obstacles on the path of the necessary enlargement."
"Open communitarization of the two intergovernmental pillars of the Maastricht treaty: justice and internal affairs; and indirect communitarization, by means of its financing, of common foreign and security policy."
"Far from being a harmless treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam is considerably accentuating the process of federalization and centralization of the European Union."
"Instead of making good the democratic deficit, it is increasing the democratic deficit."
"Instead of providing Europe with the dynamic flexibility which it needed to come through this historic stage of continental reunification, the Treaty of Amsterdam is pushing us up the cul de sac of federalism."
"In so doing, the date of effective enlargement is being postponed."
"For this reason, we shall resolutely militate against this very poor treaty, and promote an open concept of a variable geometry Europe."
"This will mean that at last we can welcome into a renovated Europe all the Member States which communist ideology had kept artificially separate."
"We will not accept that any other ideology, under whatever guise, should take over and erect a new Berlin Wall, and create two Europes."
"In spite of the fact that the European Parliament has institutionally guaranteed right of participation, nor any power of ratification, it is called on to give its opinion on what they call the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This is a treaty which has caused and will certainly continue to cause much ink to flow."
"This treaty, which President Juncker said it would be difficult to ratify, and which Jacques Delors did not correct the Maastricht errors enough, has in just a short space of time become a good treaty, one acceptable to all."
"When you remember that for more than two years, preparations for the intergovernmental conference in all European countries mobilized the best minds in the governments, parliaments, political parties, and other organizations, we are forced now to the conclusion that all these proposals and reactions have been a waste of time."
"How can we explain to our citizens that those with the most influence, in other words, our Heads of State and of Government, were able to get together on matters as important as the introduction of the euro and enlargement, but were unable to do so on themes regarded as rather minor, such as the composition of the Commission prior to the first wave of new members, or the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, or again, the use of majority voting."
"The bets laid on the future of Europe have only partially paid off, and in spite of all that, we've said yes to a treaty which does ducks the reforms essential to the proper operation of an enlarged European Union."
"With the greatest respect to our Heads of State, and to our ministers, I must say that I have difficulties accepting an agreement which leaves open practically all the questions essential to the proper functioning of European institutions, an agreement which does not say how the re-casting of regional aid and the new agricultural policy will actually take place."
"I also believe that the Treaty of Amsterdam might have helped public opinion better understand how Europe was to be built, and bring it closer to the construction of a Europe of citizens."
"Nothing like this has been done, on the contrary."
"The gulf between the words of the specialists and the words intended for the consumption of citizens has increased yet again."
"If, after all these criticisms, I am still prepared to vote in favour of this treaty, it is because the treaty confers a little bit more power on the European Parliament, thanks to which it will better play its role as a driving force in European construction."
"Despite the well-known improvements achieved by the Treaty of Amsterdam in the promotion of equality between women and men in Community assignments, and with the recognition of the importance of mainstreaming and active equal opportunities policies in all Community actions, through the amendment of article 3, I find it regrettable that article 118 places the European Parliament in a weaker position - as regards the fields of social security and the social protection of workers - than that of article 119 and that it makes it difficult to take decisions in favour of women because it demands unanimity on the Council."
"I consider that the enlarged role given to the Parliament in the process of adopting measures under article 119, and also the re-wording of article 119 to provide means of positive action, are encouraging."
"I would request that the co-financing rules be revised so that women's NGOs can play their part in the PRINCE programme, as unanimously approved by the Committee on Women's Rights, enabling the NGOs to include factors such as the value of work performed by volunteers and set-up costs when calculating their contributions."
"I therefore find it regrettable that none of the articles in Part III of the treaty explicitly defines measures designed to establish equality of rights between men and women in all aspects of life in principle and reality, and recommend that the Union be given a mandate next time the treaty is revised to carry out an express survey of all the fields in which sexual discrimination exists and follow up the political green light which has already been given in the present draft treaty, with regard to equality of opportunities and mainstreaming."
"Finally, I consider that before the next revision of the treaty the following points need to be developed:"
"article 119 should be extended in such a way as to provide a legal basis for equality between men and women which clearly goes beyond the field of employment; -article 6-A should be re-worded to give direct effect to the prohibition of sex-based discrimination, or at least to give the Parliament a greater role in determining the measures to be taken pursuant to that article; -the implications of including equality between women and men in articles 2 and 3 should be clarified from the legal point of view."
"I voted against the resolution on the Treaty of Amsterdam, as I agree with it to a large extent."
"Unlike the majority in this Parliament I take the criticism of the treaty seriously."
"The credibility crisis in which the EU finds itself, the arrival of EMU, the entry of the new Member States - a promise we must not go back on - necessitated a fundamental review of the treaty."
"The treaty was supposed to enable us to build on a political, social and ecological union in a democratic and bold way; the necessary complement to the union of market and money."
"It did not work."
"The most important part of the treaty review, preparing the Union for enlargement, was likewise not achieved."
"That is why we cannot advise Member States to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"That would be inconsistent in the light of our criticism."
"The treaty needs to be rewritten up again."
"The least the European Parliament could have done, was to defer its judgment on Amsterdam, and to put the government leaders under pressure to force them to adopt a new treaty review before the millennium, at the summit on enlargement in December."
"The major political groups of this House seem even to lack the courage to use our advisory role strategically, as argued by S.O.S Europe."
"Some, for instance the Dutch government, proclaim Amsterdam as a victory for the European Parliament. Yes, we will obtain more power in the main pillar."
"But a gaping democratic hole remains in place around agriculture and foreign trade. in Amsterdam foreign policy is' Brussels-ized a little more, but it has certainly become no more democratic."
"The idea of parliamentary control on foreign policy has perhaps been buried for good."
"Even worse is the fact that democratic control on asylum and immigration policy is being eroded further as a result of Amsterdam, while it is in this area that lives literally depend on careful policy including checks and balances."
"Neither the European Parliament nor the national parliaments look like they might have a grip on what will be concocted in the Council's fortress in Brussels."
"If this Parliament is truly concerned about the EU's democratic deficit - and not just its own power - then it should have called on the national parliaments to ensure parliamentary control in those policy areas in which the European Parliament stands powerlessly at the sides."
"If necessary, following the Dutch or Danish model, by chaining their ministers to parliamentary right of assent."
"This is not a step back in European unification, it is a rescue operation for a constitutional achievement which is being undermined by the present path of integration, because would not it be convenient for ministers and civil servants to be able to make decisions in Europe without having to deal with a parliament?"
"With the Amsterdam Treaty the EU is taking a big step in the direction of federalism."
"That is not what I wanted to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Today EU federalism has very little support among the citizens."
"The Union's centralism, bureaucracy and long-winded acquis communautaire are important reasons for this."
"The report from the Committee on Institutional Affairs contains little that is new and, in my opinion, is of little value."
"Above all I object to the growing demands for decision-making by qualified majority."
"This entails a serious weakening of democracy to the extent that the governments of the national states could be forced to adopt laws to which they are opposed."
"This democratic aspect is the whole reason why I am taking a stand against this report."
"Nor do I think that the European Parliament deserves to be given more decision-making within the EU system, partly because this increases supranationality within the EU and so weakens democracy, but also because of the Parliament's poor discipline and weak democratic roots."
"Political debate in Europe today is concentrated around elections to national parliaments. Only a very small political elite knows that the European Parliament does."
"The European Union should be a cooperation between independent states."
"We should build up a Europe of the democracies, not a United States of Europe."
"Unfortunately the European Union being built today is an EU of the market."
"It is the free movement of goods and services and open competition which now take priority over the demand for democratic roots and legitimacy."
"That is why I am voting against this report."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Council (B4-0901/97)."
"Question No 1 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0757/97)"
"Subject: The situation in Algeria"
"What consideration has the Council given to the situation in Algeria over the last few weeks?"
"I thank the President-in-Office for his answer, which I believe was correct and which demonstrated great respect for Algeria, although I am unsure that it was sufficient from the point of view of effectiveness."
"I believe that despite the difficulties, it is possible to take forward the peace process in Algeria."
"We must try to do so."
"And when we tackle this immediate objective, we shall realize that the peace process is inseparable from the fight against corruption."
"It is essential to take forward the process of halting the violence; and we must provide the maximum possible political and parliamentary support for this process, the initiative for which must come from Algeria itself."
"Thank you, Mr Wohlfart, but allow me to detain you within the scope of this question, as I have received two requests to put supplementaries."
"Before giving the floor to Mr von Habsburg, however, I shall use the powers invested in me by the Rules as President in the Chair to place on record my congratulations to him on his eighty-fifth birthday and my recognition of his work in Parliament."
"Mr von Habsburg, I have the honour of giving you the floor."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to thank you and say what a pleasure it is to work under your chairmanship, which is so good for this Parliament."
"I would like to ask the following question of the representative of the Council: do you really believe it is possible to reach honest democratization by eliminating those who represent the majority of the people?"
"It should not be forgotten that the original error from which all this has arisen, was the fact of an election which very clearly showed what the demands of the Algerian people were, and that election being cancelled. And it must be recognized that those who might have restrained the forces of violence have been singled out for elimination, because there were plenty of moderates in the FIS."
"Second question, would it not be good thing to carry out a policy of supporting the two moderate Arab countries which are on either side of Algeria, i.e. Tunisia and Morocco, insofar as increased support would create a situation which was more favourable in the future?"
"On behalf of the Council, I would first of all like to join in with the Presidency in congratulating the honourable Member who wears his age so well and, as I remember the hours of questions which we were involved in together, late into the night, some six years ago, I must say that the honourable Member has lost absolutely nothing of his verve."
"In response to the first question raised by Mr von Habsburg, I would say that if we were in 'It's a Knock-out' , the television game, yours would be the toughest question of them all."
"Of course, there was the government decision at the time to stop the electoral process."
"There is bound to be doubt as to whether this was the right approach."
"Personally, I have doubts about that, and I would like to say that, under the current circumstances, we must establish positive dialogue with all moderate elements, belonging to all the factions, once they have opted for democratization and for the rule of law."
"In the second instance, I fully understand your sympathy for the two neighbouring countries of Tunisia and Morocco, especially as we already answered a similar question, among others that you raised some months ago."
"You wish to prompt those two countries into giving a good example, as they are already doing."
"As part of the Euro-Mediterranean initiative, new partnership styles have rightly been adopted with these two countries, but the problem which arises is how, within the financial spending limits provided for in the next few years by the Commission, to achieve an equitable balance as regards interventions benefiting Tunisia and Morocco."
"Knowing Mr von Habsburg as I do, I have no doubt that he will take advantage of the next opportunity to raise this pertinent question with the Commission."
"Mr President, the interpreter in the German cabin has translated your congratulations to Mr von Habsburg and spoken of his 58th birthday."
"I only wanted to endorse the interpreter's judgement."
"Mr Posselt, as you will have noticed, we have excellent interpreting booths, which not only improve our speeches when they are translated, but are even able to determine our age in accordance with our appearance. And that is what they did for Mr von Habsburg."
"Ladies and gentlemen, after that pleasant and agreeable point of order, I would remind Mr Wohlfart that I said that we had two supplementary questions."
"The second is by Mr Wibe, who has just one minute, since it is not his birthday and I am unable to give him longer."
"Actually, I would like to agree with the doubts about the current policy expressed by Mr von Habsburg."
"For a long time people have taken it for granted that the terrible massacres in Algeria were carried out by Islamic groups."
"However, recently there have been very credible reports that in fact the Algerian government itself may have been involved in this."
"It is also known that the Algerian government has actively opposed attempts by international organizations to enter the country and investigate the facts."
"I would like to ask the Council whether this is not a lead which should be followed up, and whether we should not strongly urge the Algerian government to open the country to international organizations which would come in and investigate this."
"Let me say that I do not believe that these massacres are going to end if we simply continue to put the blame on people who we do not know are guilty, i.e. the Islamic parties."
"I certainly share the fears that have just been expressed by the honourable member, and as I know how concerned M. Poos, our Minister of Foreign Affairs, is with regard to this dossier, I can guarantee that this aspect of things will certainly be raised at the meeting with the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs."
"Furthermore, this is the purpose of this meeting, which is to send a message at once both clear and positive."
"Question No 2 by Hans Lindqvist (H0781/97)"
"Subject: Carriage of radioactive waste within the EU"
"I understand that a new Euratom Directive (No 96/29) on radioactive waste has been adopted, and will become law in the Member States by May 2000."
"Under the Euratom Treaty waste may be moved within the EU."
"It would in principle be open to Germany, France or the UK to store their nuclear waste in a waste dump in Sweden."
"So if Malå commune, which recently held a referendum on the final disposal of radioactive waste in its area, had said yes rather than no, would it also have been permissible to dump foreign waste there?"
"The directive also proposes that radioactive waste be diluted with other waste to bring it below the 'danger' limit values."
"Is this correct? If so, is there not a risk that there will be an increase in the carriage of radioactive waste and that countries with good primitive rock structures may become waste dumps for the whole of Europe?"
"Directives 96/29 Euratom setting basic standards relating to the health protection of the working population against the hazards of ionizing radiation, to which the honourable Member refers, and they represent, I would say, an overall approach to health protection, setting strict standards and giving better protection to all."
"These standards of protection naturally also apply to radioactive waste."
"In this context, the elimination, recycling, or re-use of radioactive substances or matter containing radioactive substances require prior authorization."
"Furthermore, the directive contains no provisions requiring mixing radioactive waste with other waste to bring down the levels of radioactivity to comply with standards."
"As regards the circulation of radioactive waste, the Council would like to remind this House that directive 92/3 Euratom relating to the oversight and control of the transfer of radioactive waste between Member States, and on entry to and exit from the Community, lays down a strict monitoring regime."
"Transfers between Member States can only take place on the basis of prior approval of the competent authorities in the recipient Member State."
"In more general terms, the Council specified in the resolution adopted on 19 December 1994 relating to radioactive waste management, that it believed that it was the responsibility of every Member State to see to it that radioactive waste produced on its territory was managed in an appropriate fashion."
"The Council also considers that optimal use should be made of installations at the national level, and that there should be more detailed examination of the various approaches possible which might, among other things, reduce transportation of radioactive waste."
"I hope it will be possible to convey that answer to those in my country who are concerned that shipments of radioactive waste are going to increase."
"I understand the answer to mean that, on the contrary, the Council's representatives are saying that there is no risk that radioactive waste could stray into any Member State which has not itself approved the import of shipments from other countries."
"That is, of course, good news."
"I hope that it will apply for a long time to come and that each country will decide for itself what shipments of radioactive waste from other countries it will accept."
"This is a positive response which I look forward to passing on in Sweden."
"However, I think the second answer was very unclear."
"I understood the directive to mean that it is quite clear that people intend to dilute radioactive waste with other waste to be able to get below the limits which apply for handling, transport and storage etc."
"I believe that my interpretation of this is correct, but if it is the case that this is also wrong and that the Council is right, I would also be pleased to convey that message to my country, Sweden."
"I think that I have so far as possible, on a very sensitive and very important subject for human health, tried to give answers to the various questions raised by the honourable Member."
"For my part, the most important thing is the provision laying down the responsibilities and competencies of the recipient Member State."
"This means that if in this particular case Sweden does not accept a transfer, it is thereby protected from possible storage of the radioactive materials which the honourable Member has alluded to."
"I would also say that this was the principle which was very vigorously defended by Sweden at the time of its membership negotiations, because it wanted to avoid pollution of its territory with nuclear waste."
"In this context it is worthwhile remembering that Sweden on the one hand, and the Community on the other hand, made a request to annex to the final membership agreement the following declaration: as regards the terminal portion in the cycle of nuclear fuel, it is the responsibility of each Member State to define its own policy."
"I think this is a clear position."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you know I come from Austria, a country where all nuclear questions are handled very sensitively."
"I must confess, to my shame, that I am not familiar with the 92/3/Euratom directive quoted by you."
"The question this raises for me, and which is no doubt interesting for many Austrians, concerns the passage of nuclear waste."
"Only the Member States of destination are ever referred to."
"Would it be possible under this guideline for a country like Austria to practically defend itself against the relevant substances being transported through it?"
"I am not just talking about the final disposal."
"I must admit, this is a question to which I would not wish to give a wrong answer."
"I would therefore propose to the honourable Member to give him a reply in writing as soon as possible."
"I hope the honourable Member understands the position I am in."
"I have two supplementary questions."
"The first concerns the explanation which the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers gave, and which is in the Swedish Treaty of Accession."
"Is it not the case that this explanation relates to the method to be used for terminal storage and that that is decided by people themselves, not by the waste that is to be terminally stored?"
"That is how I have understood this explanation until now."
"The second question is as follows: if we have a situation where Sweden, or some other country, refuses to accept a shipment of radioactive waste, will it be possible to challenge that decision in the Court of Justice?"
"Could the Court of Justice in that case overturn a Member State's decision to refuse to accept radioactive waste?"
"As regards the first part of the question, I have no further information."
"I would say that we would use the same procedure as was promised to Mr Habsburg."
"If there is a problem in Community law, the Court of Justice should be able, in my opinion, to deal with the matter."
"Question No 3 by Patricia McKenna (H-0787/97)"
"Subject: Mass arrests at the Amsterdam Summit"
"A recent report from the Coalition for a Different Europe estimates that at least 700 peaceful demonstrators were arrested during the Amsterdam Summit in June."
"Photographic evidence of police behaving aggressively towards the protestors has also been published."
"Between 200 to 300 demonstrators are reported to have been deported to other EU countries and there have been numerous reports of protestors being manhandled by police, including reports of women being subjected to body searches and accompanied to toilets by male police officers."
"Civil liberties groups throughout the EU have criticized the Dutch Police authorities for sanctioning the mass arrests of demonstrators."
"In October the Danish Foreign Minister, Niels Helvig said that the arrests were questionable."
"What action will the Council take on the basis of the reports of police misconduct at a vital EU event?"
"I already had an opportunity to reply to questions on this matter, which was raised by Mrs Gonzales and Mr Diaz, at the July session."
"The Council has never discussed the problem raised by the honourable Member in her question."
"I would like, for the sake of completeness, to draw your attention to the fact that maintaining public order on the territory of the Member States of the Union is the exclusive responsibility of the national police authorities."
"The honourable Member will therefore understand that the Council has no authority to take a position on something which is not part of the competencies conferred upon the Council by the treaties."
"First of all I would just like to say that a report was published yesterday by the independent Amsterdam Police Complaints Commission."
"They confirm that there was an inquiry, the three mass arrests were incorrect, and the criticism of the manner in which the arrested persons were treated was essentially very wellfounded."
"Regarding the Minister's response, it is quite clear that the Council is playing a role here, in that it is agreeing on the Europol Convention."
"Member States throughout the European Union are seeking agreement on policing throughout Europe and the Europol Convention."
"Europol, without political or judicial control, will have massive powers of collection of data, etc. It will be immune from the law."
"We are setting up a federal European police force that will carry out its police activities in Member States."
"The European Union has to address this and the dangers this will involve."
"I would like the Council's reassurance that at the next summit in Luxembourg we will not have mass arrests."
"It is a very dangerous precedent to set for members of the European public, that they cannot have the right to demonstrate and to highlight their concerns regarding what is happening in Europe."
"It is a fundamental right for people to be able to protest throughout the European Union. You cannot wash your hands of it and say 'Oh well, that is the individual responsibility of the Member State' ."
"Question No 4 by Per Gahrton (H-0794/97)"
"Subject: Strategy for relations with China"
"The visit to the USA by President Jiang Zemin of China raises the question of the West's future strategy for its relations with the world's most populous country."
"The basic question is: how will it be possible to cooperate and conduct trade whilst actively and effectively helping to advance the process of democratization and introduce fundamental universal human rights?"
"Some Chinese affairs experts believe it necessary to keep up strong, overt criticism of China for its failings in those areas, whilst others argue that silent diplomacy would be preferable."
"Norway's new government has opted for an overt, hard line, whereas some EU Member States have clearly decided to keep a low profile."
"What is the Council's current China strategy?"
"What plans are there for the EU to take action within the UN Commission on Human Rights?"
"The situation with regard to respect of human rights in China is a constant concern of the European Union."
"All countries in the European Union share the determination and objective of achieving a significant improvement in human rights in China."
"Following on from the 53rd session of the Commission of Human Rights of the United Nations in Geneva, the European Union undertook to re-examine its policy on China, from the points of view of human rights, with the aim of adopting a consistent approach."
"The question of human rights is on the agenda of the regular meetings between the European Union and China."
"The Luxembourg and Chinese Ministers of Foreign Affairs have had meetings on this subject in July, on the fringes of the post-ministerial meetings of the ASEAN, which took place in Kuala Lumpur, and on the fringes of the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 1997, in New York."
"In New York, there was agreement that the European Union and the People's Republic of China would renew dialogue on human rights at expert level, on the understanding that this dialogue would be without preconditions."
"Dialogue on the human rights between the European Union and China was first launched, I remind you, in 1994."
"Before the Luxembourg presidency, two meetings took place at the beginning of 1995 and at the beginning of 1996."
"Under our presidency, the first meeting took place at the end of October in Luxembourg, and the second meeting was scheduled for the beginning of December in Peking."
"This dialogue will enable us to examine all questions of interest to the two parties."
"Mr President, in this context, I must point out that China announced that it had signed the international pact on economic, social and cultural rights, and that work leading up to the signature of the international pact relating to civil rights and politics is continuing."
"You doubtless learned last Sunday, that China released Mr Wei Jingsheng earlier than expected, a gesture that was welcomed by the presidency."
"The case of Mr Wei Jingsheng had been regularly raised by the European Union, and recently in Luxembourg itself."
"Thank you for the answer which contained a lot of facts, but no news."
"The question is whether the release of Wei Jingsheng is the spark that could light a prairie fire in the form of further strong stands on human rights in China, whether it is the butterfly which will set off the hurricane which will really create change in China."
"There are many different opinions."
"A great deal has happened recently, partly at the latest party congress and partly during President Jiang's visit to the USA with the famous statement about a 'mistake' at Tiananmen Square."
"Now we also have the release of Wei Jingsheng."
"I wonder whether, against the background of these facts, the Council has any new strategy."
"Have you any interpretation of what is happening?"
"Is a hopeful change taking place in China or not?"
"What is the Council's interpretation?"
"Thank you, Mr Wohlfart, for your answers, and especially for your recommendation of patience, which is an absolutely essential virtue in this highly complex institution."
"And I must also request your patience as I ask you to maintain your attention on this question, since, pursuant to the Rules, I have received a request to put a supplementary from Mr Posselt, who has the floor for one minute."
"Mr President, I congratulate you on your brilliant response to China."
"I would just like to inquire by way of addition: we do not take an uncritical view of American foreign policy, of course, but actually a very critical one."
"Yet American foreign policy has done something very positive recently with the appointment of its own Tibetan envoy."
"I wanted to ask you whether the European Union is also planning to appoint a similar envoy, or how the question of Tibet is currently being handled in the Council."
"This is a very good question."
"Until now, this possibility, raised as it happens by the honourable Member, has still not been examined by the Council."
"But as the European Union already has a number of special envoys in place to defend the position of the European Union as a negotiator or mediator in various parts of the world and, given the political, economic, and cultural importance of a country such as China, but also the interest that we all have in the promotion of human rights and democratization, I believe that the suggestion merits our support, and at all events, I intend to present it at the time of a forthcoming General Affairs Council."
"I would first like to correct a choice of words in my previous contribution."
"The reports on massacres in Algeria which I spoke about do not implicate the Algerian government, but they do implicate the Algerian authorities."
"As far as the Council's reply is concerned, I would still like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether it is not reasonable for us to be able to introduce routine inspections in Sweden."
"This is an issue which rouses the entire Swedish people."
"We have never had salmonella in our country, thanks to the fact that we have had proper veterinary inspections."
"However, the treaty we have entered into is based on the idea that the certificates we receive from the exporting countries should be correct."
"Evidently they are not correct."
"In this case, surely, concern for human health must be the spirit of the treaty, so to speak, and must therefore allow Sweden to set up routine inspections when we import meat, as long as it continues to be the case that meat is infected in spite of the fact that people have certificates saying the opposite."
"Mr President, I will not conceal the fact that the question of salmonella contamination is of the greatest interest to myself as a trained doctor."
"It is also a matter of consumer protection, given that there are in Europe, as mentioned in the question, around one thousand people who die every year as a consequence of sammonelosis."
"The problem is therefore a relatively important one."
"As concerns the supplementary question, I have just said that the Commission's mission was to take the necessary measures and as necessary to present appropriate proposals to ensure compliance with rules for the protection of consumer health."
"This in my opinion should be of the utmost priority, alongside other rules whose purpose is to avoid the introduction into intracommunity trade of items adversely affecting the rules governing the internal market."
"If there is no wish to consider the possibility of changing the rules governing intra-Community trade in meat to overcome the disadvantages which have been raised in the questions, the best thing to do would certainly be to invite the Commission itself tomake a proposal to the Council in the proper way."
"Keeping salmonella out demands a lot of a country."
"Wherever it occurs, the whole flock or herd must be destroyed."
"That is also what happens."
"It is necessary, but it is expensive."
"How can we justify these costs when, in spite of veterinary certificates, of a lot of the meat being imported proves to contain large amounts of salmonella?"
"I am in favour of the European market for agricultural produce. It is good for consumers."
"But a precondition is that we are all able to rely on the fact that the food we buy is not a danger to health."
"We cannot do that today."
"Thousands of Europeans die each year from salmonella poisoning."
"As consumers we must be able to have confidence that the food we buy and eat is good for us."
"It is therefore in the interests of the whole of Europe for the Council to accept its responsibility to stop salmonella."
"After Mr Wohlfart's formal and uninvolved response, I am unable to trust the Council in this respect."
"If my ears do not betray me, and if I understand the honourable Member aright, he was not asking a question."
"He said that I had made a declaration which was fairly clear and straightforward, but he doubted that I was really convinced about the action to be undertaken, if I have understood things right."
"Is that it?"
"I thought the answer the Minister gave did not suggest there was any great will to tackle the problem of salmonella in Europe in its entirety."
"An awful lot needs to be done if we are to make Europe salmonellafree."
"We have succeeded in Sweden, but it cost us a great deal."
"What are you doing on the Council to ensure that other countries act in a similar, if expensive way and so eradicate salmonella?"
"Mr Wohlfart, Mr Cars, you are establishing a dialogue outside the framework of the Rules."
"I am extremely flexible in the Chair, but I would ask you to allow me to conduct the sitting so that I can at least justify the emolument that I receive for being here."
"I will not now take up all the time available for speaking by entering into a dialogue, and at all events, yours is the sole responsibility for directing the debate."
"If I understood the reasons for this question, the countries are known, and I would say that if you had a suspicion, I think that controls at point of destination, by sampling, are always possible."
"Furthermore I would add that if the Commission believes that the situation is becoming truly a matter of concern, it is the Commission's responsibility to make a proposal to the Council of Ministers, along the lines suggested by the honourable Member."
"Salmonella in itself is one problem."
"Even worse are the salmonella bacteria which have become resistant to antibiotics."
"I would like to know whether the Council is aware of the situation with regard to antibiotic-resistant salmonella bacteria in the EU, how they are being fought, how people are thinking of coping with this problem at all, and where they exist."
"I have not ducked an answer, but the Commission must give you a formal answer."
"However, as a doctor, I must point out that as regards resistance to antibiotics, the problem, unfortunately, is not limited only to the bacteria known as salmonella."
"It is due in fact to an unwarranted use of antibiotics."
"We could have a 24-hourlong debate on resistance to antibiotics, and I would be very pleased to have one day in private with Mrs Hulthén."
"As President, and also speaking as a doctor, however, I wish to say that the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is an indisputable fact. There are countless cases of this, including staphylococcus, the bacterium which causes infections that are treated with penicillin."
"However, that is a scientific matter, and we are examining the issue from the healthpolicy point of view. Mrs Thors therefore has the floor for one minute to speak on this issue."
"The problem with salmonella is due partly to the fact that we cannot rely on the inspections which have been carried out."
"My question is when does the Council really expect to have effectiveness so that the inspections which are carried out can be checked and we can rely on the certificates which exist."
"The questioners have emphasized this."
"On the other hand, we also know that we would not have the problem with infected turkey meat, for example, if the same rules which are now being introduced for beef - country of origin labelling - were to apply to all food products."
"Today it is impossible for us to label meat which comes from a country whose inspections we cannot rely on."
"I would also like us to be able to rely on the certificates which are issued in all parts of Europe."
"When does the Council expect to realize the intentions which are contained in the Commission's proposal on food legislation and which are being so hotly debated in the Member States?"
"The question of controls and subsequent protection of the consumer, and in this case protection of human life, is part of the Commission's remit."
"I would not wish to speculate further."
"I believe that if the Commission, with proof to hand, can demonstrate other more efficient means to react to the problem, it will be the Council's responsibility to take these decisions, and take its appropriate share of responsibility."
"As you see, this is a very important question for us in the North, especially in Sweden which has often been hit by infected meat."
"I have a follow-up question which I would like to have answered."
"If it is the case that Sweden's health authorities decide the risks of salmonella infection spreading in Sweden are too great, and, in spite of the fact that you say it is not allowed, they introduce random inspections or regular routine inspections, as mentioned in Mr Wibe's question, what will happen then?"
"What would be the result if Sweden still introduced routine border inspections?"
"Would we then receive a visit from the President-in-Office of the Council, or another representative of the Council, who would stop the inspections?"
"What would be the result of such a decision on the part of Sweden?"
"I did not fully understand the end of the sentence."
"I invite the honourable Member to repeat his question."
"If Sweden concludes that routine border inspections are necessary and introduces such inspections, in spite of the fact that you said that it was not allowed, what would happen then?"
"What would be the result of that for the Member State of Sweden?"
"I think we have possibly not understood one another."
"I said that if the authorities of a member country, in this case Sweden, had a suspicion, in this instance, they could set up controls."
"There is no prohibition on inspection if there are suspicions."
"I think in the way you express the reasons behind Mr Wibe's question made allusion to certain countries."
"It may be possible to establish a link, which would become the basis of a suspicion."
"Then the Swedish government is free to carry out inspections."
"I am not sure that the Council properly understands why we are so angry in Sweden and Finland, but it is of course due to the fact that this is a problem which has arisen through our becoming members of the European Union."
"We were promised that the problem would not arise."
"That is why we expect a little more commitment."
"I would like to ask what objectives actually exist."
"Is there an objective that the whole of the European Union should be as free of salmonella as Sweden and Finland were before their membership of the European Union?"
"We are a little suspicious, because the French ambassador in Sweden went public and said, more or less, that people can tolerate a little salmonella."
"These Swedes seem a bit wimpish, a bit hypochondriac and oversensitive."
"Salmonella is part of everyday life."
"I am not quoting word-for-word, but that was the impression he gave."
"In the light of this we desire a bit more commitment and an objective that salmonella shall also be eradicated in the rest of the Union."
"We are well and truly into salmonella!"
"Joking apart, I can assure the honourable Member that the presidency has understood perfectly well what is at issue."
"It would be a pity if a doctor did not understand what is at stake with the risk of salmonella."
"Trust me, I fully understand the scale of the problem raised here, because by the number of supplementary questions, I can see that it is a matter of grave concern in your countries."
"On the other hand, I do not know which ambassador you had in mind when you were speaking, but to me it does not appear that this ambassador had a very sophisticated understanding of medicine."
"This is a personal opinion."
"I can only repeat this."
"If the Commission, which gave an undertaking to carry out its homework on this, during the health council which was held in September this year, draws conclusions which are quite possibly those which you are coming to now, I believe it is the Commission's duty to accept its responsibilities, and out of concern for consumer health, to propose to the Council adequate and effective protection measures. The Council will then take its responsibilities."
"I have no doubt, in this particular case, that the Council will do just that."
"Question No 7 by Robin Teverson (H-0803/97)"
"Subject: Road hauliers"
"Will the Council confirm that it will take all possible measures to protect road haulage companies from industrial action in other Member States?"
"If action such as road blockades, set up in France last year and threatened again recently, does result in financial loss or physical hardship will they make sure that hauliers are compensated quickly and given all possible help?"
"First, the Council is fully conscious of the untoward consequences that road barricades had in France in 1996 on the free circulation of goods and persons in Europe."
"It is delighted at the outcome of the recent conflict between truckers and their employers."
"The Council remains convinced that, now as then, negotiation is the best way to cope with these and similar situations."
"I would also like to point out to the honourable Member that the Council took note of the actions undertaken by the Commission, which had responsibility for overseeing respect for free circulation within the single market, in regard to the French authorities and the authorities of the other Member States, for the purposes of facilitating a resolution of the conflict, of mitigating the effects of the barriers, and finally accelerating procedures for compensation for damage, if any, suffered."
"I am glad that the President-in-Office understands the great hardship this has caused a number of companies."
"My concern here is not just that compensation should be paid quickly - which has not happened at all in the past - but that a code of practice should be accepted by all Members of the Council."
"First of all this should ensure that roads are kept open during national disputes so that trade between European countries can continue to take place and foreign drivers are not affected, and then, if that fails, there is a code of practice which makes sure that financial compensation is always paid by the Member State concerned, and that compensation is paid quickly."
"Would the President-in-Office see whether such a code of practice could be agreed between Member States for any such future incidents?"
"Firstly, I would like to say that with a view to a solution to this strike, the COREPER at its meeting of 5 November last, looked at the possibility of calling an extraordinary Transport Council."
"Fortunately the tripartite negotiations in France made it possible to solve the problem, out in the field."
"But the questions which have been raised by earlier road blocks, involving the need to guarantee transit corridors and accelerate compensation procedures, have already been raised at the Council of Ministers of Transport, and in the General Affairs Council."
"For my part, I shall try to submit your proposal, relating to a code of good conduct, to my colleague Mme Delvaux, who has responsibility for the Council of Ministers of Transport, with a view to examining the possibility of adoption of a code of good conduct, as proposed by the honourable Member."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as you will see when we reach the subject of the European City of Culture - I am the Member for Valencia - the problem of the losses caused by road hauliers' strikes is a regular occurrence."
"Of the five hundred actions brought in the French courts, only one has been successful."
"This is because, like all courts, the French courts require two things: that it be clearly determined who is responsible; and that the losses be quantified."
"I believe that Community law can be extremely useful with regard to both those requirements."
"Firstly, the President-in-Office will surely agree with me that the free movement of goods is the very essence of the treaties."
"He will also agree that the Member States have a duty to ensure compliance with the treaties."
"And he will probably agree that all Member States are objectively responsible for dealing with the inadequate functioning of public services."
"The conclusion is that we must establish that the Member State in question is responsible by means of Community law."
"And, as regards quantification of the losses, I would propose that a Commission service be set up to assess the losses objectively in order to facilitate the work of the courts."
"At the very least, the witnesses would be considered expert witnesses under any of our legal systems, which are derived from the Justinian Code."
"I shall be extremely brief."
"The honourable Member has himself outlined the solution to the problem that he has just raised."
"It is now down to the Commission services to do their duty."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you were very polite in replying to my question, but your answer reminds me of the words of the owner of a house whose roof leaks every year: when it leaks, he says ""I had better do something about it' ; then, when the rain stops, he does nothing."
"And, the following year, the roof leaks again, and he has to put buckets under the drips, and so on. Do you not think, Mr President-in-Office, that, with regard to the interruption of road traffic as a result of industrial action, the Community, the free market, is like that house with a leaking roof, and that it is time for the Council to address the issue of the organization of road transport, the industrial problems and the broader question of compensation once and for all, and not wait to hold a special meeting of the Council, but adopt wide-ranging Community legislation?"
"You are caught between a rock and a hard place, as they say."
"You know that you must address your questions to the Commission, Mr Medina Ortega, and I expect to see you at Question Time to the Commission next month."
"Question No 8 by Maj Theorin (H-0805/97)"
"Subject: Legal rights of asylum-seekers"
"When an asylum seeker is refused entry and returned to his home country or another country outside the Schengen area that person must have a guaranteed right of appeal against the decision refusing him entry."
"This right should initially be guaranteed by the country the individual is returned to."
"If that State cannot guarantee that right it should be the country refusing entry."
"Are there any guarantees that a state refusing entry will offer asylum-seekers the right of appeal?"
"I shall now try to perform my duties."
"The Council resolution of 20 June 1995 on minimum guarantees for asylum procedures lists in detail the guaranteed rights which apply to the processing of asylum requests."
"As regards the rights of asylum seekers in matters of appeals and reassessments, reference should be made to paragraph 4 of the resolution, which deals with reassessments."
"The following paragraphs in my opinion give replies which adequately answer the question raised by the honourable Member."
"First, it is specified in paragraph 8, in the event of a negative decision against the asylum seeker, there should be a possible appeal to a tribunal or an appraisal organization which will make an independent decision on individual cases."
"I would also like to refer to paragraphs 15 and 16 of this same resolution which deals with the information given to the applicant regarding the decision, the reasons for the rejection, the possibility of reassessment of the decision and the deadlines applicable, and finally the availability of time to make an appeal."
"As regards paragraph 17, this paragraph lays down general principles allowing the applicant to stay in the territory so long as no decision has been taken regarding appeal and allowing the asylum seeker to make an appeal to the independent organizations mentioned in paragraph 8, and then be granted authorization, due to the special circumstances of his or her case, for temporary residence on the territory of a Member State, when the legislation of that state authorizes an exception to the general principle."
"With regard to manifestly groundless requests for asylum, I refer to paragraph 19 of the resolution which specifies that the Member States may, by derogation to the principle stated in paragraph 8, deny the right of appeal against the rejection of an application if, on a prior basis, instead of and in lieu of such procedure, an independent organization distinct from the authority examining the case, has confirmed the decision for rejection of the application.."
"According to paragraph 21, the Member States may lay down exceptions to the principles of paragraph 17 in limited cases."
"However, there must at least be a guarantee that the decision regarding the application shall be taken at a high level and that sufficient additional measures, such as an identical assessment confirming the validity of the original decision are made by another authority which is both central and has the necessary experience and knowledge in the field of asylum rights and refugees, prior to the enforcement of the decision."
"Finally, with regard to requests for asylum made at borders, I would refer you to paragraphs 23 and 24 of the resolution which guarantees that, first, any asylum seeker arriving at a border has the possibility of lodging an application for asylum, and that if a special procedure is applied for the purposes of undertaking an examination before the decision relating to entry, if the application is manifestly without foundation, no measure for deportation should be taken while the special procedure is underway, and finally that, if entry is refused and there is a derogation to the general principle of the suspensory effect of the appeals procedure, there must be a guarantee that the decision for refusal of entry is taken by a minister or by a comparable central authority, and that sufficient additional safeguard measures, such as the prior examination by another central authority, should provide an assurance that the decision taken is a just one."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply."
"The Schengen cooperation involves a more restrictive asylum policy for Sweden, which means more applicants are going to get a negative answer and be refused."
"When the chances of an asylum seeker being granted asylum are reduced, there really must not be any lack of legal certainty for him or her."
"Therefore it is important for us to have certain fundamental rights truly guaranteed."
"There must therefore be guarantees for the right to appeal."
"I am very grateful for the legal answer which I got from the minister."
"When I get the answer on paper I am going to go through it again and I will come back if I feel that the answer needs to be elaborated."
"In fact, I see no objection to providing supplementary information to the honourable Member in writing."
"I would simply add some words, as Schengen has been mentioned."
"I was myself a signatory to the convention of application."
"I can assure you that it was, as it happened, a difficult and painful exercise."
"But I can also say this. The principle of the first host country having responsibility of checking whether or not rights of asylum can be granted, is indeed applied, in theory; and it is also true that, for humanitarian reasons, the second country to which the political asylum seeker may make a request for asylum may still grant the asylum seeker that right."
"The rules are not as restrictive as they might appear at first sight."
"Question No 9 by Richard Howitt (H-0806/97)"
"Subject: Child labour in West Africa"
"Trafficking of children in West Africa is widespread and on the increase, involving the following countries: Benin, Togo, Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso and Gabon."
"Child trafficking particularly affects young girls from the south east of Togo who are in high demand to work as domestics in relatively wealthy areas around Lagos in Nigeria and Libreville in Gabon, both oil exporting countries."
"Also last year an illegal 'labour camp' for children was discovered in Lagos."
"The haggard, malnourished children found there were mostly from Togo."
"It is believed that an average of approximately 30 children are brought into Lagos every two months by brokers who scout for children in Benin and Togo."
"Is the Council aware of organized child trafficking practices in West Africa?"
"What action will the Council take to do something about this tragic situation?"
"Will the Council raise the issue of child trafficking with the Nigerian and Togolese government authorities?"
"The Council is not unaware of the fact that trafficking in children is a most unfortunate reality in a number of countries, and unfortunately not only in the countries that have been mentioned by the honourable Member."
"On 4 November, the political committee recommended that the question of kidnapping of children should be put on the agenda for political dialogue with the 27 countries concerned."
"On 31 October, seven Mauritanian nationals were arrested at the Bamako airport in Mauritania, when they were attempting to embark on a flight to the United Arab Emirates with nine children aged less than five years."
"The international combat against trafficking in children is conducted by the United Nations, who have designated a special rapporteur on the question of the sale of children."
"The European Union will continue to work towards an end to this odious practice, cooperating with the governments concerned and with non-governmental organizations also concerned by this question."
"I would also like, in this context, to point out that every year the European Union actively participates in drafting a United Nations resolution condemning trafficking in children and child labour, and calls on Member States to put an end to such practices."
"Finally, the European Union has made a commitment in favour of democracy and the protection of human rights."
"Indeed, article 5 of the first Lomé Convention explicitly states that the policies of the European Union in the field of cooperation and development are closely bound up with the respect for and the exercise of fundamental human rights and liberties."
"As signatories of Lomé IV, all countries cited by the honourable Member have declared their profound attachment to human dignity and human rights."
"The European Union expects all signatories of the Lomé Convention to fulfil their obligations."
"Thank you for your response."
"The labour camp in Lagos that I mention in the question was actually known by local residents as a slave dump or children market."
"People looking for cheap labour came to the camp and chose the children they wanted."
"Most went on to work as domestic workers, at market stalls or as shop assistants. Some washed vehicles or collected fares on minibuses."
"In addition, they faced physical abuses in the form of beatings from their employers or were at risk of sexual exploitation by the families employing them."
"A report by Anti-Slavery International found that 95 % of the child domestics were girls."
"Because of these stark facts, President-in-Office, I wonder whether your answer, while I agree with it in total, is enough."
"What do you expect to be the outcome of the political dialogue on 4 November, which you have described?"
"Although we have article 5 in the Lomé Convention, what will you do specifically to enact it in response to the countries that I have referred to in the question?"
"What more can Europe do?"
"First, the European Union would have an interest in giving Mrs Mary Robinson, the new High Commissioner for Human Rights, the responsibility of dealing with these very painful matters."
"I believe that she has the necessary authority to ensure that the voice of the United Nations is heard, and to remind the signatory countries of the various international conventions on human rights of their responsibilities, which I would say are elementary."
"Furthermore, as regards signatory countries of the Lomé Convention, it is on the one hand absolutely necessary for the European Union as such to denounce these occurrences most vigorously, and that it should say so to the relevant Member States who are signatories to the Lomé Convention."
"On the other hand, I am of the personal opinion that this is likely to be not enough."
"I shall nevertheless be free, during the Development Council which will be held a week on Friday in Brussels, under questions relating to the humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes region, to add an extra point to our discussions on child labour, which you have described in terms which cannot but make us profoundly sad."
"It shall then be the responsibility of the Commission to undertake further investigations and research, in close collaboration with the services of Mrs Robinson and the NGOs who are qualified in this field, so as to propose the appropriate measures which in my view are necessary, to the Council without unnecessary delay."
"Mr Howitt is requesting the floor for a point of order."
"I do not want to take up any more time except to genuinely thank the President-in-Office for what I regard as a very positive answer."
"I felt that so strongly, Mr Howitt, that I thanked the President-in-Office several times. I believe that his answer has raised everyone's awareness of this problem enormously."
"Thank you, once again, therefore, Mr Wohlfart."
"Question No 10 by Anna Karamanou (H-0809/97)"
"Subject: Council Recommendation of 2 December 1996 on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-taking process"
"On 2 December 1996 the Council, recognizing the democratic deficit that exists as regards the representation of women, adopted a Recommendation for the Member States with a view to ensuring the balanced participation of women and men in the decision-taking process."
"The Recommendation calls on each Member State to adopt an integrated strategy and to take all the necessary legislative, regulatory, administrative and other measures with a view to increasing the participation of women at all levels."
"Approximately one year after this Recommendation was issued, will the Council say:"
"What specific measures and programmes are being promoted by the Member States of the EU with a view to achieving the balanced participation of women and men at the decision-taking centres?"
"What steps have been taken and what efforts made to alert public opinion and the various public and private bodies concerned to the need to facilitate the access of women to Community and national political and decision-taking bodies?"
"In response to this question I would like to say that the recommendation of the Council, which dates back to 2 December last year, and which applies to the balanced participation of men and women in decision-making processes, lays down that the Commission will submit a report, both to the Parliament and to the Economic and Social Committee, for the first time three years after the adoption of said recommendation, and then on an annual basis, using the information supplied by the Member States."
"Consequently, given that the recommendation was adopted last year, the first report will be drafted only three years later, that is, at the end of 1999. In these circumstances, the Council is not in a position at this stage to make an inventory of measures and programmes in force in the Member States, as requested by the honourable Member."
"Mr President, I am in a position to know very well what is written in the final paragraph of the recommendation with regard to the obligations of the European Commission."
"However, my question is addressed to the Council, which I consider should be in a position to inform the European Parliament on the reception suffered by this recommendation at the hands of the Member States and on the progress of this recommendation."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office if he is satisfied with the representation of just half the population of Europe in the democratic institutions and in the centres of political decision-taking."
"Does he think that our democratic system works well when it indirectly excludes the equal and balanced participation of women in all decision-taking processes?"
"I must limit my assessment to the specific case of Luxembourg, because I know the interest that was raised by this initiative and by the recommendation of the Council, on 10 December last."
"Our government is conscious of the importance of the subject, given that, at the time of ministerial reshuffling, two years ago, we included as one of our political priorities the promotion of the role of women in Luxembourg society, by setting up a ministry for the advancement of women."
"As regards other countries, political consciousness is increasingly being awakened, and advances are being made."
"No later than last week, a very encouraging and positive judgement was handed down by the European Court of Justice in a manner consistent, I believe, with the wishes of the honourable Member."
"As regards the role of women, I am personally convinced that here, in this House, there are many women Members who are highly dynamic and who will not restrict themselves to advocating promotion of the role of women in this House only, but in their member countries also."
"As the time allotted to Question Time to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 23 will receive written answers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot close the sitting without thanking Mr Wohlfart, once again, for being good enough to put with the inconvenience of Parliament's timetable changes for two months running."
"Today, I wish to thank him especially, because I know that personal circumstances made it particularly difficult for him to be here."
"Thank you, Mr Wohlfart."
"Mr Posselt is requesting the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, it is not the usual problem with Question Time, instead I have something quite concrete today."
"For some time we have been receiving the Council's written replies relatively late."
"This is the fault of this House, however, because they are issued by the Council in good time as I understand it."
"I would therefore request that we get to receive the written replies this week in Strasbourg."
"Mr Posselt, I take note of your remarks and I shall look into this matter with the services responsible to see if what you propose is possible."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Action plan for the single market"
"The next item is the report (A4-356/97), by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission on the Action Plan for the Single Market (CSE(97)0001 - C4-0286/97)."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has examined this report and has given a highly favourable opinion on the work carried out, both by the Committee and by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate."
"I would like to make a few partly critical, but constructively critical, comments which I will hasten to make."
"The Committee, for example, noted with satisfaction how the Executive Commission intends to speed up investigations into the infringement of Community regulations and it is hoped that what has unfortunately happened several times in the past will not happen again, that is that reports have been dealt with after a long delay, or have not even received a reply."
"This also confirms the request made to the Commission on 11 December last year within the scope of the resolution on the Commission's programme of work for 1997, to take a decision whereby the Executive undertakes to apply to the Court of Justice for pecuniary sanctions to be imposed if a Member State has not taken the measures connected with the application of a Court judgment within a year, particularly in the sectors relating to the domestic market and the environment."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs is also asking the Commission and the Council and Member States to eliminate once and for all, in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, the frontier controls that are still obstructing the freedom of movement of persons and also reinforce all the measures permitting a larger number of European citizens to make use of the freedom of movement."
"It also pointed out the general nature of the actions relating to objective 4, particularly the protection of consumer rights, health and the environment and establishing a dialogue with citizens, and asks the Commission to develop more specific proposals in this connection."
"Finally, it confirmed how the objects of a better environmental protection and a braver consumer protection require a more marked action at Community level, as established in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the Commission's communication relating to the impact and efficacy of the single market."
"With these comments, the Committee on Legal Affairs expresses a favourable opinion on this action plan for the domestic market."
"And so I congratulate both Commissioner Monti and the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, I would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau."
"The internal market, ladies and gentlemen, does not exist in all areas yet, and that costs European business, large and small, year after year, a great deal of money."
"In particular the absence of an internal market for energy in which the right of free choice for business and the consumer is respected in the power and gas sector, is a significant obstacle."
"The gas market must be privatized as soon as possible and to a substantial extent."
"A tax on energy must be implemented throughout Europe, otherwise it will lead once more to market disruption."
"A second topic I would like raise on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy is the full exploitation of the opportunities for innovation and new technological developments."
"Often it is the small companies who are innovative, and who consequently are able to grow and therefore create more employment in Europe."
"That is what we have this summit for."
"An important requirement in all this is not only the completion of the market, but also the harmonization of legislation."
"The absence of European patent legislation, for instance, is a hindrance for small businesses in particular to make the most of the opportunities of the internal market."
"Small businesses do not have the necessary resources to register their new developments."
"The last point I would like to draw to your attention is the importance of a European market for information services."
"The European Union will only be able to derive full benefit from the development in the worldwide electronics trade if this is based on multilateral instead of bilateral agreements."
"But to achieve this the Union will have to do a great deal of work; also in the internal market as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a supporter of a free market economy it is a rare pleasure for me to present the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for my colleague and committed supporter of social policy Thomas Mann."
"In the opinion of the committee, the Commission has a key role to play in creating the social policy to develop a forward-looking economic and social community as a model for improving the European single market."
"The more clearly social aspects are built into it, the less room there is for doubt as to whether the model of success for the social market economy can actually be implemented at European level."
"In the committee's opinion, there is a need for action."
"First, action on the different tax systems which are an obstacle to trade and above all action to resolve the issue of frontier workers engaged in cross-border transport and double taxation."
"Second, in the committee's opinion the production factor in employment should be subject to tax relief while the environmental factor must be taxed in order to promote employment."
"Third, the committee supports the liberalization of public services. However, it also believes that a minimum of universal services must be maintained and that each round of job cuts should be cushioned with job-creating measures to make it socially acceptable."
"Fourth, European economic policy, which is based on the principles of a socially and environmentally-oriented market economy, needs to maintain qualified standards of protection which have grown up over the decades and which can be further developed at European level."
"Fifth, the Committee is convinced that pan-European employment agency networks and agreements on the recognition of educational qualifications and degrees and increased incentives to gain job experience within Europe are major building blocks for the single market."
"Only then - according to the Committee - will workers be able to support the European single market, Europe's national market as Mr von Wogau calls it, and I think that is important, as well as the promotion of self-reliance, to ensure the success of this single market."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Karl von Wogau for his balanced report, which very extensively deals with the issues of the single market in an analytical manner."
"The Commission also deserves thanks as the targets it has set to simplify single market regulations, bearing in mind the interests of the people, are worthy of our support."
"For the individual, the two big drawbacks in the ongoing activity of the single market are the spread of crime and the lack of information on the countless opportunities there are for freedom of movement."
"The single markets can operate only when our citizens stop feeling unsafe and when the fragile borders of opportunity are at last opened up to them."
"The bars to the single market, especially those which spring from criminal activity, are not going to be remedied in any one single way."
"We need cooperation between customs officers and police, for which Europol would be a marvellous tool, and we need more effective hi-technology for the dissemination of real-time data among the authorities."
"Because the Union's internal borders are disappearing, more standardized guarding procedures for our external borders need to be paid attention to."
"In preparing my statement on the report on single markets for the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs I particularly stressed the importance of exploiting technology in border control and the relay of information in order to increase the effectiveness of the single market being, as it were, invisibly monitored."
"I would like to approach the question of the exploitation of technology from the viewpoint of the individual also."
"For example, by listing vacant jobs on the Internet we might be able to ease the movement of a trained and qualified workforce within the Union."
"Research and innovation for Europe could also benefit greatly from the more fluid movement of a trained workforce."
"Besides, decisions made in the Union's institutions should be opened up to the people to a still greater extent via the information networks."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the issues related to tax in Mr von Wogau's report."
"On the eve of the employment summit I would like to point out what the biggest contribution in terms of tax might be in terms as a result of the shift of tax from labour to other sources, especially capital and energy."
"The intention to so is not new, of course."
"We find it in the Delors White Paper."
"There is only one element in this White Paper which actually deserves a great deal more attention at present."
"But despite the intention in the Delors White Paper it is obvious that in reality no shift from tax on labour to other sources is taking place; quite the reverse."
"This trend was set in motion in 1985, and, as we can see, is still continuing."
"But how can we adjust this trend?"
"I think the only option is to achieve a degree of harmonization in the area which is the most mobile, namely capital."
"Capital is the most difficult thing to tax as it is mobile."
"Since that is the case, most governments can tax the least mobile factor, namely labour."
"Limiting the mobility of capital can effectively only be done jointly, and only really be done by means of a certain degree of harmonization."
"The Commission has instigated this in the code of conduct which it recommends."
"It would be a good first step, I think."
"The Commission is being pragmatic by starting with taxation on interest, which will also apply to non-residents."
"In addition it is particularly urgent to discuss two elements from the Ruding Committee report, namely, firstly the harmonization of the corporation tax base, and a common minimum tariff for this corporation tax."
"Furthermore it is also urgent to arrive at an increased duty on energy, or the introduction of duty on energy sources which up until now have not been taxed at all."
"The Commission's recommendation in this direction must indeed be supported, as the von Wogau report states."
"I find it incomprehensible that this Parliament has not even devoted a first reading to this proposal, even though it dates back to May this year."
"The revenue resulting from the increased on duty on energy and from making tax on capital more effective, could be used to lower labour costs for the low paid and for low and unskilled labour could be lowered."
"Real profit can be made here."
"Mr President, Mr von Wogau, the rapporteur, has prepared a special resolution in which he points out what, in the opinion of Parliament, should be done to complete the internal market."
"After all, the fact that it does not operate very well yet, does not yet function as a true domestic market, is one of the major reasons why the European business community is lagging behind in its competitive position, and why economic growth in Europe is too slow."
"Of course, a great deal needs to happen at European level."
"My colleagues highlight all these issues."
"But I would also like to ask the Member States to pay attention to this problem."
"Often the Member States are the guilty party when it concerns late, wrong or divergent implementation of directives."
"Sometimes there is even a case of over regulation because Member States attach a host of extra national legislation onto EU directives."
"In addition to necessary new regulation, the Commission should concentrate on the improvement of the implementation, enforcement and simplification of European regulation."
"The Commission and Member States will have to agree a new time schedule."
"We know that it works in the European Union."
"We need a new 1992. I know that the Commissioner aims to have this ready in 1999, but I think that is a bit of a fantasy when considering the fiscal dossier."
"Nonetheless I think we need to set a realistic date."
"A new challenge, a new zest, that is what we need."
"If we do not succeed in completing the internal market, further integration will automatically fail to materialize."
"The new entrants do not want to be members of merely a free market, they want to be members of closely knit club which offers quality in a host of areas."
"This can only be achieved if the Member States keep to their agreements, and if the Commission take its role as guardian of the treaty seriously, even with respect to large Member States."
"Mr Commissioner, may I mention two sectors."
"I am thinking of the market for government contracts and of the insurance market for example, which are not by any means European markets yet, but are still very much national markets."
"A last remark."
"Large mergers in the field of accountancy seem to be occurring, very large accountancy firms which are sitting on top of the entire financial market."
"The concentration of power and the problems which arise out of this is one of the Commission's special responsibilities."
"What is the Commissioner's opinion on this?"
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Karl von Wogau on his report."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports him in his conclusions and, indeed, feels that he has carried out a very comprehensive assessment of the problems with the single market and the challenges which face us."
"My Group will not support Amendment No 8, which we believe to be protectionism in disguise."
"Clearly we are disappointed with the development of the single market."
"It seems that the Member States lack the political will to make it work properly."
"Indeed, they have even passed measures which detract from the acquis of the single market."
"It seems sometimes that the Commission lacks the courage of its convictions and its powers as guardian of the treaties to pursue cases of non-compliance with sufficient determination."
"The single market is essential for prosperity."
"We know from surveys that before 1993 compliance with customs controls was costing traders some ECU 7.5 billion every year - that is based on 1992 trade levels but expressed in today's money."
"That is equivalent to 1 % of the total value of trade between Member States at the time."
"We know that since 1 January 1993 the abolition of routine customs controls has cut costs by two-thirds, saving traders some ECU 5 billion per annum."
"However, compliance with transitional VAT and Intrastat systems is costly. That costs traders some ECU 2.3 billion per annum."
"There are similar cost savings to road hauliers since 1992 but residual waiting times at borders are still costing some ECU 50 million every year."
"Much money could be saved if the Commission could push the Member States into completing the single market effectively."
"The Member States bear the greatest brunt of the blame."
"Let me just give you one example from the United Kingdom, the state I represent: I have in my constituency a pensioner, called Mr Bill Smith."
"Bill Smith has just lost his fight to prevent 100 fine German cigars going up in smoke - not in his living room but in a UK Customs and Excise incinerator."
"UK officials have said they will destroy these cigars because Mr Smith has refused to pay £90 in duty."
"I took up the case when these cigars were impounded."
"Customs were claiming that since they were not imported personally the duty had to be paid."
"In fact they had been ordered from a tobacconist in Germany and duty had been paid at the point of sale."
"The UK Government claims that this is a distance-selling transaction, like the man-in-black case."
"It is clearly not."
"There are some parallels but the Commissioner who helped me early on in this case, and my efforts, have been unable to persuade UK customs to act justly."
"Until we can get that kind of problem sorted out Europe's citizens will never believe in the single market."
"Mr President, it is an indisputable fact that from 1993 to the Amsterdam summit last June, the construction of the single market has indeed made great strides."
"This is perhaps the reason why both the European Council and the European Commission, encouraged by the results of their policy, have moved towards setting up a very ambitious plan of action, with which they aspire to accelerate the pace and to deepen the content and operation of the European single market."
"This same philosophy is expressed in the report under debate, which pinpoints the immediate and specific objectives on which, according to the rapporteur, the action programme should concentrate its attention."
"However, the issue which does not preoccupy the European Council, the European Commission nor the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy at all is the account of the consequences of the single market on the working people and citizens in the peripheral and weaker countries of the Union and on the economies of these countries."
"If such a basic report existed, before moving to adopt a policy to speed up the further development of the internal market, we would discover that the single market and the economic policy that accompanies it are responsible to a very large extent for the tragic position to which the more than 20 million unemployed, the 21 million people with part-time work, the 14 million citizens of Europe who work with short-term contracts, the 10 million and more who do some form of atypical work, are reduced to."
"The single market and the concomitant Union policies are responsible for the disintegration of the public sector of the economy and for the formation, by means of mergers, of gigantic private monopolies, which are replacing state monopolies. They are responsible for the takeover in the air-transport sector by American airline companies and the total downgrading of the European ship-repair industry, which, in just a few years, has seen its productive capacity reduced by 87 % and limited to a much smaller share of the world market than South Korea."
"The single market and Union policies are responsible for the dramatic deterioration of the position of SMEs, who find support from the Union and from the Member States in words alone, and not in deeds."
"The single market, in concert with economic and monetary policy, and the intensely monetarist policies, are responsible for the imminent and palpable danger of the wholesale disintegration of the European social model."
"The answer to the question of who is to blame and who is to pay for the single market is, once again, in no doubt, Mr President."
"Big business is to blame, the workers will pay."
"Mr President, I very much fear that the insistence on speeding up this policy, the promotion of certain recommendations such as the acceleration of economic and monetary union, the strict adherence to the stability pact, the transfer of funding sources for social protection from work to taxes on the environment and energy, the application of VAT in the country of origin, will worsen the already well-known consequences of the single market and will add tens of millions of people to the ranks of the unemployed."
"Mr President, our group have given their support for Commissioner Monti's attempts to achieve some degree of organization in the single market and we also support his endeavours in this plan of action for a unified market."
"I would like to mention as an aside that this current struggle to end the duty free system is crucial."
"This is a situation where a certain practice is being subsidized to the tune of ECU two milliard a year."
"We cannot talk of a single market if we have to contend with this kind of thing."
"I hope we will be able to offer the Commissioner our support for this to be ended according to schedule."
"We are also fairly satisfied with Karl von Wogau's report."
"This actually brings the realization that the European economic policy is based on the principle of an ecologically and socially sound market policy."
"I believe that the European Union must work from this basis in the global arena also."
"Graham Watson, who represents the Liberal Democrat Party, said our Amendment No 8 is protectionism in disguise."
"I can assure you it is no such thing."
"We only wish to stress that a balance between the free movement of goods and considerations of health and safety is required."
"I hope the groups will support this motion."
"With the Summit Conference on Employment coming up next week, it is vital to discuss taxation."
"I think the report is very balanced in this respect."
"It really shows how essential it is to reduce the tax burden to improve the employment situation. I am in agreement with the ideas expressed by Alman Metten of the Social Democratic Party."
"Finally, I would like to turn your attention to the fact that the Court of Auditors yesterday said it was not at all satisfied with the way small and middle-sized companies are aided."
"The aid has not been gone to the right place."
"We must pay attention to this, because, quite rightly, these types of business must be aided by the internal markets."
"Mr President, the extensive action programme for the internal market is bound to have virtually everyone's agreement."
"It offers a choice of action points."
"Something for everyone."
"The programme is placed in the context of globalization of the economy, the eastward enlargement of the European Union and the fight against unemployment."
"There is a desire to address all of these developments with a series of measures."
"The strength of this proposal is at the same time its weakness."
"The Commission has bitten off more than it can chew."
"A number of debatable parts, such as the unification of rates of tax and duty, and the abolition of all types of border control within the European Union, definitely cannot be implemented in the short term."
"I advocate that the programme focuses above all on the first action point: an improvement in regulation, fewer laws, transparent procedures and more effective enforcement."
"People, business and government institutions will benefit directly."
"In view of the enlargement of the Union and the globalization of the economy, a large number of European laws have to be scrutinized anyway."
"This way you can kill two birds with one stone."
"I would like also to say something about to mention the slowness with which standards for products and processes are established."
"What ideas are being considered inside the European Commission to solve organizational problems in private standardization institutes?"
"Again on the subject of the action programme, it is better to tackle one thing well, than to deliver half measures on many issues."
"The original draft resolution by Mr von Wogau was very good and concise, but unfortunately it has been expanded by the Committee on Economic Affairs into a long wish-list which would leave even Santa Claus at a loss."
"I regret this."
"Mr President, it is absolutely essential to dismantle swiftly the many and varied barriers to a properly functioning single market which still remain."
"In this regard I should like to give Mr von Wogau's report my wholehearted support in terms of most of its details, in its basic philosophy and also in its justified reasoning."
"As stated in Section 11 of the report particular emphasis should be placed on ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises play a full part in the single market as there are fears that for various reasons this single market will for a time be an achievement from which big business gains most of the benefits."
"However, I cannot subscribe to the opinion expressed in Section 12 - although it is outside the scope of the report, it is mentioned in it - that the single currency is an essential part of the European national market."
"In this case I think the wish is father to the thought."
"When monetary union takes place on 1 January 1999, there will still be many areas, clearly illustrated in this report, where the single market will not have matured into a national market."
"I am rather of the opinion that to ensure a stable and healthy monetary union essential elements of the national market should be implemented before it begins and that the monetary union represents the culmination of the single market."
"With regard to the whole matter of transparency and comparability the combination of a uniform currency and an incomplete single market gives rise to fears of distortion of competition."
"I am thinking in particular of taxation, standards and the underlying social and environmental situation."
"In certain cases I also have serious reservations about the desire to coordinate economic policy."
"These tensions could take on such gigantic proportions that instead of fostering integration the euro could contribute to serious political destabilization."
"Mr President, the Delors 1992 programme for the single market was an inspiration for all Europe to embark upon Europe's big idea to get its people back to work."
"Commissioner Monti's recent analysis of the market provides evidence that the single market is working."
"Up to 900, 000 new jobs in the European Union are attributable to the functioning of the single European market."
"That is a real good news story."
"And now the Commission's action plan suggests how we can finish the job and move into the 'super league' of job creation."
"It is not quite true to say, as recital (c) of the von Wogau report suggests, that Europe's single market remains a jigsaw of 15 separate national markets."
"As each day passes the market becomes a reality."
"I believe there is much that we can do to hasten its progress and thus provide jobs."
"Thus, under taxation, the report calls for lower rates of VAT for labour-intensive SMEs."
"Codes of conduct to mitigate harmful cross-border competitive taxation should also be applied."
"Eliminating the frustrating incidences of the double taxation of frontier workers represents a tangible boost to the much misunderstood concept of labour mobility."
"In respect of providing a proper infrastructure for the single market to run on, it is indispensable for us to promote the laggardly implementation of the trans-European networks of transport, telecommunications and energy."
"Moving swiftly to secure a European air safety agency and concluding a new Eurocontrol convention are ready examples of what might be done to clear the clouds that obscure Europe's aerospace sector."
"Reinforcing such revolutionary transborder investment in the TENs is to secure the principle of a comprehensive and universal service concept in respect of Europe's public services."
"Such public service provision is, of course, the groundwork upon which pride in industry can build, create, develop and flourish."
"Company law still needs to be made a pan-European fact of life."
"The swift adoption of the European Company Statute, naturally involving the workforce, would achieve that desideratum."
"Simplifying and clarifying the legislative framework should also be our holy grail, provided that such pruning exposes even better the underlying principles of strengthening the productive social and environmental framework in which Europe's businesses can thrive and prosper."
"Future legislation should always pass the test of being easily understood and transparent in purpose and effect."
"Proper legislation frees and liberates; bad law cabins, cribs and confines."
"No-one is more guilty of passing bad laws or failing to monitor good ones than Member State governments."
"Still unable to grasp the concept of the single market, such national authorities should be put to the test of Commissioner Monti's single market scoreboard."
"Let us name and blame those countries that divert the flood of the market away from its natural channels by their use of the logjams of inconvenience."
"Moreover, this market must be made for the people, and not the other way round."
"Delivering a single market for the benefit of all citizens is an excellent chapter in the action plan."
"Europe's 120 million children must be particularly protected when the four freedoms of movement - people, goods, capital and services - range across Europe, for they are the inheritors of this market which, fashioned to the needs of all our citizens, will carry Europe dynamic, prosperous and 'job-full' into the realms of the next century."
"I congratulate Mr von Wogau on his report."
"Mr President, the final stage for the completion of a European single market relates to the introduction of economic and monetary union within the European Union."
"Notwithstanding the fact that Britain will not be joining a single European currency at the first stage the benefits of economic and monetary union for Ireland far outweigh any negatives."
"The principal benefit of a single European currency for Ireland is the prospect of a lower trend in interest rates."
"It also enhances the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment."
"Indeed, in Ireland recently we have created 130, 000 jobs by our participation in the European activity."
"A study carried out in Ireland recently came out with the fact that the impact of EMU on tourism, retailing, agriculture, manufacturing industry and financial services was excellent."
"It concluded that EMU participation by Ireland would yield a net benefit for the Irish economy in these sectors."
"I might conclude by saying that I would have preferred it if the British entered EMU at the first opportunity."
"However at present Ireland meets all the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, full qualification for EMU in terms of inflation and general government deficit etc. The Irish people have nothing to fear from joining up to the euro on 1 January 1999."
"Mr President, colleagues, I also support the action programme for the internal market and the von Wogau report."
"I would like to use my one minute, Mr Commissioner, to raise one point, which I know is close to both our hearts, and that is the issue of pensions and supplementary pensions in Europe."
"First of all there is the matter of pension funds which are not able to invest freely throughout in Europe, and in my opinion this means that an enormous job creation capacity is lost, because the restrictions for the pension funds and the insurers are too great."
"On the other hand there is the issue of portability of pensions, which is still a big problem for cross-border workers, but also a problem in connection with flexibilization of the labour market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, because of the Green Paper I am not convinces that this matter arising will be sorted out satisfactorily in this House, as we are still seeing some resistance to any liberalization on this point, particularly on the part the socialists."
"I think that there is a job for this Parliament, to implement the internal market in this area, too."
"Mr President, I would like to say that Mr von Wogau's report is interesting. It moves through the multiple layers that is the internal market and it is well-balanced."
"However, I would like to make the following four comments:"
"The first comment is that the single market, like the single currency, must be seen within the framework of a European Union which seeks to move at the same speed along the main roads that open up ahead of it."
"Success, the rush, the flight forward to a single market or to a single currency, when it is followed by delay and paralysis in other sectors such as, for example, the social sector, could only lead to distortions and to the self-entrapment of the European Union. But mainly, as is the case at least in certain areas of the European Union, it could undermine the morale and the support of the citizens of the European Union for the single internal market, which is the precondition par excellence of its success."
"The second comment I would like to make is that the single market may be generally advantageous for the European Union, but is not of equal advantage for all countries or for all regions of the European Union. As a result, from the moment we apply a programme until 2002, we must at the same time adhere to the programme of cohesion and support for the less developed regions of the European Union until 2002 and not have hesitations and back-tracking in that area."
"The third point I would like to stress is that the single market means the abolition of internal borders, but it also means the strengthening of the external borders of the European Union and I very much fear that such a charting of these borders does not exist bearing in mind the various problems that arise, at least in the eastern sector."
"As a result, a single market must move forward in parallel with the resolution of the political problems of the European Union."
"The fourth and final point is the subject of taxation."
"I think that the questions of lightening the tax burden of working people and of instituting an environmental tax are also very important."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr von Wogau, our rapporteur, has produced an excellent report on the Union internal market."
"I would like to congratulate him, and say personally that I agree wholeheartedly with his work and with the spirit of the main objectives he has set himself."
"Like him, I also believe that we need to do everything we can to ensure that, by 2002, we have a real, large-scale internal market."
"I also believe that, when the decision has been taken to bring this great market into being, anything which goes against the grain, and for which there is no good reason, will result in an accumulation of disadvantages in the field of border elimination, without any of the advantages."
"Hence I feel it is a must to harmonize both direct and indirect taxation, taxation on capital, and taxation on labour."
"I also feel it is absolutely necessary to ensure free movement of persons, while making sure that the Community has the means to combat delinquency, trafficking, terrorism and organized crime."
"And I feel we must develop major communications and energy infrastructures throughout the Union, without levelling down and without sacrifice of public service, wherever it exists."
"Hence, there must be a definitive settlement of trans-border problems, of which there are too many. In my region, they disgruntle everyone who has to cross the border to get to work."
"In conclusion, like the rapporteur, I agree with the completion of the great market and the single currency, and I want to emphasize that they are, in my view, an absolutely necessarily complement to a political Europe, a Europe endowed with solid institutions, a social Europe, a Europe resolutely combating unemployment, laisser-aller, speculative relocation of companies offshore, a Europe in favour of sustainable growth and of public services for the common good."
"Without these urgent complements, the great market, no matter how necessary, will not extract our Europe from unemployment or deep anxiety of our citizens. It will be quite the opposite, as everyone knows."
"And as you know, dear colleague and rapporteur."
"Mr President, I likewise congratulate the Commissioner on the initiative that has been taken and Mr von Wogau for his report."
"Now that everything has been said, may I put five questions in summary form."
"The first and second are these. In this case, unlike that of the Single Act (or 1992 Single Market), there is no quantification and no quantified objectives."
"Might I ask the Commissioner whether there will not be a Cecchini Report, because having some quantified targets always provides a measure of motivation?"
"The second question is whether there will not be a promotion of the sort that took place last time, because I think the success of the Single Act and the 1992 Single Market was the motivation that was produced for that market."
"Can we have a promotional incentive of the same type now?"
"Thirdly, I should like to ask whether the primary concern will not be the means of achieving the single currency?"
"And here, reverting very specifically to matters on which we have previously focused, whether there will not be a special effort to harmonize the taxation of capital, and deposits in particular?"
"Because, with the single currency, I am afraid that any difference in taxation will cause distortions in the market which might penalize the objective to be attained."
"Fourthly, also from the point of view of tax, Mr von Wogau talks about the need to do away with tax havens."
"I entirely agree: it is impossible to prevent distortions in competition with tax havens inside the European Union itself."
"And I would therefore ask the Commission whether there will be initiatives to abolish tax havens, and what they might be?"
"And, finally, with regard to the taxation of energy, although I recognize that this could have benefits, I would draw attention to the fact that it is a regressive form of taxation, it affects the poor more than the rich and it penalizes transport."
"I would ask whether these burdens will not be prejudicial to the internal market, since transport is essential to link the various areas of Europe together."
"To be specific, therefore, how can we reconcile a tax on energy, which is such a burden on transport, with the need to bring infrastructures and other resources closer together?"
"Mr President, it has been said this evening that the single market needs new impetus."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you, as many of you have understood, that this new impetus is here."
"The action plan proves it: it is a specific instrument which, unlike the Cecchini plan, does not propose quantitative objectives on final results but, more pragmatically, more incisively, objectives of timing on the implementation of means of actually establishing the single market - this is the very specific inspiration of the action plan - a single market which, as everyone has stressed, is an important condition for growth, employment and the proper functioning of economic and monetary union."
"I am happy to say that the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, to whom I offer my congratulations, considers the action plan to be a significant step towards the objective formed by the Heimatmarkt which is dear to him, dear to me, and which we are all working towards."
"Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity of this discussion on the von Wogau report to outline briefly this evening the steps taken forward so far, which the Commission will report to the European Council next month."
"You are aware that the action plan involves four strategic objectives, the first being the effective application of the Community regulations."
"I am pleased to say that the action plan is proving that it works: in fact, it established several deadlines, such as 1 October for the Member States to draw up a schedule for the transposition of Directives not yet transposed and a specific indication of the designated coordination centres, contact points, things that are apparently obscure but essential for the single market to work."
"Most of the Member States have given us their schedule for the transpositions and almost all of them have given us a list of coordination and contact centres."
"Mr Watson and Mr Harrison referred to the need, with an ever greater transparency, to urge the Member States to comply fully with the commitments assumed."
"This is the meaning of the internal market scoreboard, which has been published for the first time today: it is provided for in the action plan and is supported by your report; it is a live instrument that exists today and that will be presented twice a year."
"I am sure that not all of you will like it, because it sets out, state by state, not only the percentage of transposition, but also, for example, the average delay, expressed in months, in the transposition of the directives, the average delay in responding to the notices issued by the Commission, and so on."
"So it is really a very specific report which, I am sure, will make its entire pressure felt."
"Alongside this, there are the statistics, country by country, of the infringement proceedings brought."
"Somebody nicknamed this device a ""scareboard' , overdoing it in my opinion, but I think it has a certain effectiveness."
"As we want to be ambitious in specific measures, not ambitious in the large number of objectives, we took another step towards the single market yesterday, when the Commission adopted a draft regulation, based on article 235 of the treaty which, if approved by the Council, and I hope that Parliament will not fail to support it, will provide the Commission with a clear means of facing the serious obstacles to the freedom of movement of goods."
"A similar mechanism will be applied to that used with regard to state aid, that is, a decision that will enable the Commission to direct an executive decision at the Member States in the space of a few days, in the event of actions or inactions resulting in obstacles to freedom of movement, a decision that will constitute a document of execution, on whose basis injured parties will be able to see the national courts recognize the right to compensation for losses sustained by the Member State responsible."
"I will be very brief, Mr President, on the second and other strategic objectives."
"The second is that of eliminating the main distortions, and in this connection several MEPs (Mr Langen, Mr Metten and others) emphasized the subject of taxation."
"Someone mentioned the Delors White Paper, which remains a great inspiration for us as well."
"What is the difference?"
"Here too, we are trying to construct the specific means of establishing that policy, just as we did in March this year, with the draft directive for the Community framework on the taxation of energy; just as we have been doing in recent weeks with the package against harmful tax competition, and with this logical package we hope, for the first time in the history of European integration, but I do not know whether we will succeed, to interest different States in making developments, thus overcoming the main difficulty deriving from the rule of unanimity."
"Believe me, it is very easy to list objectives, but it is very difficult, in a political context you are familiar with, to achieve them: we are working precisely on the means of achieving these objectives."
"One important objective is that of the common VAT system, which some of you pointed out."
"In this connection, with regard to Amendment No 4 on the VAT system, I would like to point out the importance of the report drawn up by Mr Randzio-Plath on this matter, a report adopted in May 1997 which I hope the Commission will consider to be Parliament's official position on the matter."
"Among other things, I want to point out the position expressed with force by the Audit Office yesterday, on the fact that while the VAT system based on the principle of the country of destination and not of origin remains in force, there will be a considerable risk of fraud."
"In a survey conducted on companies, also published today (a lot is happening today with regard to the single market!), we see that, in classifying obstacles to a good life in the single market, small and medium-sized companies in particular put the complexity of the current VAT system first."
"I will conclude on taxation by saying, Mr Theonas and Mr Castagnède, that I too am convinced that, if we manage to make a clear possibility for taxation in Europe, we will establish an absolutely essential condition for having a European social model and a European economic and not just a monetary policy."
"With regard to the sectoral obstacles preventing integration into the market, I will state briefly that, with the efforts made by the Luxembourgian Presidency, three of the four legislative priorities (transparency for the services of the information society, legal protection of biotechnological inventions and liberalization of the gas market) have progressed rather well; with regard to the state of the European society, recalled by some, the Davignon Group has possibly offered a useful path for reintroducing the subject."
"Finally, establishing a single market at the service of all citizens: this, as you know, is something I feel very strongly about, despite not being an MEP, and questions such as the transferability of supplementary pensions, pointed out by Mr Boogerd-Quaak, are important."
"Several weeks ago, the Commission drew up a draft directive to permit the transferability of supplementary pensions."
"It should be said, however, that there would not be a great deal of sense in not having high employment mobility precisely when the single currency is appearing on the scene."
"Discussion with the citizens, Mr Florio, is certainly, by definition, always insufficient; however, the ""Citizens of Europe' Citizens First operation, conducted with the support of this Parliament, is perhaps the first major specific experiment: as you know, over a million citizens have made contact with this operation, by telephone and via the Internet."
"I will conclude by referring to the fact that the single market is expanding, and we need to prepare for expansion."
"Mr Peijs, we are working because the single market provides the initial basis for bringing the CEEC countries closer to the European Union and it has to be said that these countries are making considerable progress."
"Mr Alavanos, it is not true that we are overlooking the subject of present and future external frontiers of the Union: most of the assistance we are giving the CEECs is precisely for the development of their customs."
"Mr President, this subject is very important and felt by all a great deal."
"It is very encouraging, for the Commission and for me personally, to hear how the European Parliament is maintaining and encouraging our action in a field in which we can never be entirely satisfied."
"Mr President, I asked the Commissioner a question on the enormous mergers in the accountancy sector."
"One merger took place which provoked a counter merger with, I believe, extremely serious consequences for the internal market and monopolization."
"I wonder what the Commissioner's opinion on this is."
"Mr Peijs, this is proof that the single market works: we will not see these great concentrations, these great public purchase offers in the accountancy field, in the insurance field, if companies do not reap the benefits of the single market."
"It is right for these phenomena to occur, but it is right for them to be subjected to the stringent regulations on the control of competition, regulations established by the treaty for some time, indeed by the Treaty of Rome, which, as I think we all know, the European Commission seeks to monitor very carefully, as its main task."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow 12 noon."
"Construction products"
"The next item is the report (A4-0350/97) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission report on the construction-products directive (COM(96)0202 - C4-0636/96)."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have just been discussing, since 1987 the single market has been one of the basic elements of European integration."
"In other words, competition and liberalization come before harmonization."
"However, there are many areas in which technical harmonization remains an important factor."
"In the construction sector this matter was dealt with in the constructionproducts directive of 21 December 1988."
"Having a particularly wide scope, this directive covers every product that can be distributed and marketed for permanent incorporation in building works for structural and civil engineering projects."
"Unlike other sectors of industry and other product groups, trade in many construction products and construction projects is only sensible and economically viable over short and medium distances owing to the high transport costs involved."
"This is the main reason why much less progress has been made with the harmonization of standards and with the procedures and statutory provisions for construction products and construction techniques than is the case with products where technical trade barriers prevent the free circulation of goods."
"The construction-products directive is supposed to remove barriers to the free circulation of construction products which are mainly due to differences in standards, test methods and certification procedures."
"The directive lays down comprehensive requirements for construction work but not individual construction products, in respect of stability, fire protection, hygiene, safe occupancy, electrical safety, saving energy, all those things that are again documented in the Greens' motions."
"This means that according to this directive Member States may only permit those products the use of which enables the main requirements of the directive concerning the construction work to be adhered to."
"Harmonization in the construction industry is therefore necessary because it will ease the mobility of professionals, tradesmen and building contractors, making it possible for them to undertake projects in other Member States."
"As experience in Europe since 1988 has shown, the drafting of standards is a long and complex process."
"That is why the final result is now unsatisfactory."
"Without the harmonization of standards and other technical specifications there will be no free circulation of construction products."
"We have just been discussing the single market."
"The competitiveness of the European construction industry is being severely prejudiced, especially as the building trade is by far the largest industrial sector in the European economy."
"With an annual turnover of almost ECU 700 billion and a 10 % share of the European Union's gross national product, the construction industry employs a total of 27 million people either directly or indirectly - 13 million directly and 14 million indirectly - in Europe."
"All of this takes place in small and medium-sized enterprises, 1.8 million enterprises in all, of which 97 % employ fewer than 20 workers."
"The main responsibility for the laggardly implementation of the construction-products directive does not lie with the Commission, and I should like to make this clear, but first and foremost with the Member States who thus far have not shown sufficient willingness to compromise and have wanted to implement their own regulations to an excessive degree."
"By mid-1997, 8 years after the directive was adopted, specifications had been laid down and standardization mandates worked out for only 17 product families."
"The blocking tactics of the Member States in the Standing Committee on the Construction Industry and their lack of willingness to put national regulations to the test are the main reasons for this delay and I should like to criticize this explicitly."
"Now three levels are required, as mentioned in the report. First the Commission itself, which should undertake to lay down and complete all standardization mandates as speedily as possible, in other words by mid-1988 at the latest."
"The progress which has been set in motion by these proceedings of Parliament is already perceptible, Mr Commissioner!"
"Second, the Member States who in future must stop insisting on a large number of detailed regulations in the implementing orders and recognize the procedure finally agreed upon."
"And third, the European Committee on Standardization has been called upon to speed up its work."
"The Commission has pledged itself to improve the practical implementation of the construction-products directive and has therefore refrained from proposing any amendment to the directive at the present time."
"I wholeheartedly endorse the Commission's stance in this regard."
"However, it will be necessary not only to observe the development but actively to shape it."
"And, to this end, Mr Commissioner, I am sure we can count on your active support."
"Mr President, it is my pleasure this evening to welcome this report on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Mr Langen has produced an excellent document, and I was very pleased to work with him on it."
"Essentially what we are saying here to everybody concerned with the construction-products Directive is that we need progress."
"Here we have one of the key building blocks, if you like, of our single market which simply is not functioning properly."
"It is not necessarily the Commission's fault but what we are clearly saying to the Commission here tonight - and again in the vote tomorrow - is that it has our support to push the Member States to make progress, because it is simply not acceptable that this directive has been in force for the best part of ten years and nothing has really been achieved."
"I accept that it is a very difficult problem and - having followed the SLIM procedure, with the construction-products Directive having been one of the pilot projects for SLIM - it is clear that there will be difficulties, because in the SLIM project this was one of the areas in which progress was difficult to achieve."
"We must try to make the effort."
"An example is a brick manufacturer in my area which makes, surprise, surprise, an awful lot of bricks and wants to sell them freely around the European marketplace, but finds that instead of having one set of red tape to understand and one set of standards to come to terms with it has 13, 14, 15 different sets of standards to apply before it can sell its products."
"Often it finds it has a product ready to go into a new market and then the market changes and a new national standard is introduced."
"I accept that is not necessarily one hundred percent relevant to what we are doing here today but I can tell you that if that company had the opportunities to export freely around the single market, then it might get an awful lot bigger and employ a lot more people in my part of the industrial West Midlands, which would be very good for our local economy and for the people working for that company."
"So there is a real impetus for us to do something."
"I very much agree with Mr Langen that the Commission must get on and complete the standardization mandates. That would be an important boost for progress in the area."
"Really, as I say, this is a report we here in Parliament can all get behind; we are here to give the Commission support and encouragement to tackle the Member State governments, because, ultimately, if we have that progress then we will move a lot closer to having a completed single market and the sort of action plan we talked about earlier on will get that much closer to being fulfilled."
"Mr President, a period of almost ten years has passed before we have genuinely started trying to implement a construction- products directive."
"Exactly a year ago the SLIM report was published."
"It should be obvious that the Construction Products Directive was dealt with in this report for good reason."
"Up until then national Member States had not been prepared to submit their existing regulations."
"According to the famous maxim: he who has the standard has the market."
"The SLIM report concluded that there is some life left in the directive, but that harmonized European standards should be looked at seriously, as these do not exist."
"As is so often the case, the delay is not to be found at an European level, but at national level."
"As a result of increased pressure, there has been a certain degree acceleration since then."
"It is expected that during the middle of 1998 all commissions given to CEN for harmonization of the 40 product families will have been completed."
"Unfortunately this does not mean that the business community knows exactly what its position is."
"Some crucial questions remain unanswered."
"For example: will EC marking become compulsory in all European Union Member States?"
"Countries like the United Kingdom and Portugal think they can allowed themselves an optout."
"How does the Commissioner think he will be able to enforce the unity of the market?"
"A second crucial and relevant question from the business community: what are actually going to harmonize?"
"It is clear that testing methods need to be harmonized."
"What exactly is the value of this?"
"Will it also be obligatory to accept the test results of a renowned Dutch testing agency for example in Germany as well?"
"We all know that at present this presents a big difficulty and a large obstacle to the internal market."
"Harmonization of the limit value will only be partly possible because of regional differences."
"Please think of the difference in the climate between Lapland and Sicily."
"I think the aim for harmonization is that there should also be an internal market for construction products."
"That means that in establishing whether a product is satisfactory national test institutes, national requirements and national test methods will no longer be allowed to monopolize."
"This will be painful in the Member States, but, Mr Commissioner, please emphasize this clearly to the Member States."
"The construction industry has a right to clarity and simplicity after all those years."
"Mr President, the Green Group would like to emphasize that construction materials have a major effect on the environment and, for this reason, we have submitted a whole list of amendments."
"We think we need a high-level risk assessment process for all new materials."
"We have all recently heard of scandals caused by relatively new materials, and their combined effects can be shown to have disastrous consequences."
"Let me take just one example from this building here."
"A certain construction engineer told me once that above that splendid wooden ceiling there is fibreglass and rock wool."
"It is in fact demonstrably very unhealthy material; we therefore really need European standards and a decent form of risk assessment."
"At the same time we must also be able to reject any materials which harm the environment and people's health."
"One of our amendments concerns our opinion that the re-use and recycling of builder's waste should be promoted."
"Builder's waste accounts for a very large proportion of total waste in society."
"I should also like to put my question right away as I believe it is too important to be left to one side."
"When we talk about standardization we should generally be thinking about the type of reorganization of the standards system we in Europe are striving for."
"Time is getting short and if we consider that EUROCODES gave way to CEN in 1989, progress in this area has not exactly been setting the heather on fire."
"What we should all be asking ourselves is whether it would be possible to set new standards on a voluntary basis and considering what new standardization options are available to us in any case."
"It is also urgently necessary for us to get the EC mark because - as Mr Langen has quite rightly said already - many small and medium-sized enterprises are active in this sector."
"If we want to do away with borders, if we want to promote public procurement, then we simply need to operate these principles of product approval, labelling, purchasing, liability and insurance."
"Mr President, I can be fairly brief on this matter, not because it is not worth dwelling on it, as the subject is very important for the completion of the single market, but because Mr Langen's report is extremely clear and exhaustive."
"In fact, I must congratulate him, on behalf of the Commission, because the content of the report confirms the analysis made by the Commission in this sector."
"Previously, the Commission had reached the conclusion that the implementation of this Directive comes up against considerable difficulties at a practical level."
"The report reinforces the Commission's opinion, as it contains an analysis, which we share, of the work still be to undertaken in the field of standardization of construction products."
"Within the scope of the SLIM initiative, the Commission examined the possibilities of improvement and simplification thoroughly."
"Following the work carried out by all the parties concerned, by the Commission in the SLIM context, by the Member States and by the standardization authorities, the preparation of the harmonized standards is coming along well and tangible results are expected in 1998."
"The Commission is up-to-date on several points raised by Mr Peijs in particular: some points have already been dealt with, while others are present in the Commission's programme."
"The thirteen amendments proposed by the Greens can be summarized as an effort to increase environmental awareness at European level."
"The spirit is certainly positive, but some of them have to be considered in a critical light: for example, Amendment No 4 rightly emphasizes the complexity of the standardization procedure and confirms that consequences will necessarily arise."
"In emphasizing this fact, only the environment is mentioned in the amendment, however."
"Although it is certainly true, it does not take into account the fact that the standardization process will have considerable repercussions on many other sectors as well as on the environment: social policy, economic policy, safety and competition."
"Consequently, the Commission will only have to accept the suggestion contained in this amendment if it takes into account the possible repercussions in all fields."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 7 and 9, I wish to draw attention to the fact that the Commission is already following an active policy of financing the consumer and environmental associations, so as to enable them to take part in the standardization work."
"These amendments do not seem appropriate to us in this context, however, as they do not relate directly to the directive on construction products, which is the object of Mr Langen's report."
"To conclude, Mr President, I can say that the Commission will be able to accept the suggestions contained in Amendments Nos 1, 2, 12 and 13."
"Mr Commissioner, I only wanted to repeat the question: is a reorganization of the standards system in Europe being considered?"
"Mr Rübig, could you clarify your question a little further?"
"With regard to the single market we have seen the problem - and this is what Mr von Wogau was saying - that standardization in Europe is lagging behind."
"Deadlines are too long and we quite simply have to ensure that our standardization systems are more market-oriented and operate with shorter deadlines."
"The national systems are producing too much resistance."
"What we need is a new style of coordination and a new type of organization at European level."
"My question is whether the Commission intends to introduce reforms in this area."
"This subject has not been discussed in the perspective outlined by you, Mr Rübig."
"It seems to be an important subject and a good idea: I will certainly bring this consideration to the attention of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Indirect taxation systems (Fiscalis)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0344/97) by Mr Secchi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a programme of Community action to reinforce the functioning of the indirect taxation systems of the internal market (Fiscalis programme(COM(97)0175 - C4-0222/97-97/0128(COD))."
"Mr President, in stating the title of this report, you have already partly explained the content, or rather the object, of the Fiscalis programme."
"The content relates in particular to training, exchange of experience and development of information materials to provide a better knowledge, a better compatibility and a gradual common path towards harmonization in the field of indirect taxation and therefore, in particular, VAT and excise duties, by means of coordination by the national tax authorities."
"The object is naturally to enable the different systems to operate better and to co-exist better by means of this knowledge and, therefore, to allow the market to operate in a more satisfactory manner and the taxation systems to produce a more balanced and more satisfactory revenue for the States, contributing towards the battle against fraud and evasion."
"In the previous debate, we heard how, for example, the current VAT system is one of the aspects of greatest concern from this point of view."
"The fact that these objects are fixed beforehand also has very significant implications from the point of view of employment."
"Tomorrow, as already mentioned, the Extraordinary Summit opens in Luxembourg on the subject of employment: to be able to handle the revenue from other sources better will, ceteris paribus, allow us to reduce taxation on employment and therefore to support employment, from this point of view."
"The object of the Fiscalis programme (the Committee on Economic Affairs has pointed out some similarities, for example with the previous ""Customs 2000' programme) is to make better use of existing actions and introduce new ones to achieve the objects dealt with briefly in my introduction."
"The Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, which expressed an opinion, appreciated the Commission's proposal a great deal and, interacting with it, considered (the Committee on Economic Affairs in particular) that several improvements or amendments to the wording submitted for our examination should be proposed. I would briefly like to draw your attention to these amendments."
"The possibility of bringing academic experts and also consultants and representatives of taxpayers, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, into the seminar activities to be implemented by Fiscalis has been provided for, for example."
"The seminars have been better defined, from a technical point of view as well. The problem of language training the participants will necessarily have to have has been dealt with; the concept of exchange and training has been better explained; in particular, several suggestions have been put forward which in some way extend the scope of the programme, favourably in our opinion."
"It has been suggested, for example, that the experience drawn by the participants from this training and exchange can also be used by the European Commission to provide teaching aimed at further improving its action in favour of ever closer forms of coordination with a view to the harmonization of the taxation systems."
"It has also been suggested that a permanent network be set up between the national training institutions so that the practice of exchanging experience, of taking common measures, leads these institutions to know each other better and therefore to operate better on a market which, as previously stated when commenting on Mr von Wogau's report, is becoming more and more of a real internal market for the Union."
"The programme should enter into force on 1 January 1998."
"In view of the very tight deadlines, the Committee on Economic Affairs and its rapporteur have already made informal contact with the European Commission and with representatives of Council so as to ensure reciprocal approval of the amendments."
"We for our part have tried to put everything into it. We hope that not only the Commission present here but also the Council will do as much."
"The Committee on Economic Affairs has approved fifteen amendments which are more or less of the same type as I mentioned in my speech."
"In addition, tomorrow I will put three verbal amendments which have been agreed with the Committee on Budgets to the vote: the first seeks formal clarification, for example, of the rules that have to be followed in the case of recourse to subcontractors; the second relates to the fact that, if the CEEC or Cyprus are involved, the allocation will have to be increased accordingly; finally, the last one points out that, since it is a five-year programme, we are half-way between the current financial budget that expires in 1999 and the subsequent one, which we should remember."
"Mr President, I think the extension of the Fiscalis programme, and particularly most of the amendments suggested by Mr Secchi, deserve our support."
"Among those amendments, I would like to emphasize those which are intended to increase the number of active and passive participants in the actions to be taken."
"Thus Amendment No 5 (to article 2(d)), in which the 'exchange' is not confined to another administration but can also be effected with 'a training institution of another Member State' , is commendable; and so is Amendment No 10 (to article 5 (2)), accepting that the seminars to be held should be attended not only by officials but also by 'other experts in the field, such as academics, taxable persons or their representatives and advisers' , as has now been emphasized."
"Furthermore, the effectiveness of the actions is also improved, with better use of existing resources, such as that proposed for article 6 (Amendment No 12), not confined to 'a common core of training for officials' with the establishment of 'a cooperation network of the national organizations, academies or schools, and the officials responsible for training' ."
"If there were no specific proposal to amend the existing wording, I would have some reservations about the suggestion in Recital 10 (Amendment No 3), concerning the need for 'a Community academy for indirect taxation officials' , because I fear that a single structure of that kind might lower the profile of that cooperation which is possible and desirable at national level."
"In the fourth proposal, the exchange of ideas referred to in new Recital 9 (and also in Amendment No 2) should in fact be provided for and commended, since it may lead to the improvement of existing legal instruments and the extension of exchanges of information in general, which is restricted to VAT in Recital 7 (Amendment No 1)."
"It is especially necessary to involve ourselves in the training of a wide range of economic agents when moving from VAT to taxation in the country of origin, with a reduction in interventions by government officials at the cost of a higher degree of participation by citizens and greater responsibility being placed on them."
"This, furthermore, is a commendable trend in modern tax law, which also has implications for other forms of tax."
"Mr President, I trespassed on your goodwill for speaking time in an earlier debate. I will be brief."
"This is an excellent report."
"The Liberal Group supports it and we support the broad sweep of the Budget Committee's amendments."
"I would like to speak in particular to Mr Secchi's Amendment Nos 2, 3 and 10."
"We know that although the Sixth Directive has a single set of rules, there are in fact numerous differences in practice across the European Union."
"We know that to be workable the proposed origin system requires much closer cooperation and coordination between authorities of Member States."
"We welcome the Commission's proposals."
"We suspect that its timetable is very optimistic and that the full implementation of the work programme may need longer."
"But we are convinced that the imminence of substantial change to the definitive system must not obscure the need for reforms to the existing transitional system, which can then be carried forward into the new definitive system."
"The interpretation of the Sixth Directive by Member States, often to the benefit of their national treasuries, is no less than scandalous. This is certainly the case in the UK."
"I have published a pamphlet called 'Billion pound bungling: how the taxman stings British business and consumers' ."
"This shows how in cases of hire purchase agreements, consumer credit arrangements, the VAT treatment of housing and health provision and the problems of differential VAT registration thresholds for some small businesses, Britannia is waiving the rules."
"This pamphlet calls for an indirect taxation forum."
"That call is repeated tonight in Mr Secchi's report and was repeated in Mrs Randzio-Plath's report to which the Commissioner referred earlier."
"The Commission must involve practitioners and academic specialists in helping to sort out the current problems, irrespective of the move to a new system."
"Under my rapporteurship on the Economic Committee we have provided funds for this in the European Union's budget for next year and I hope the Commission will heed our calls."
"Mr President, the Fiscalis programme and colleague Secchi's report have my approval."
"The Member States and the Union have an interest in a well-organized exchange of information to improve fraud control."
"The opportunity for participation by the associate countries in central and eastern Europe is positive with the emphasis has to be on the countries which are serious candidates for entry such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic."
"One criticism is the obscure relationship between pain and gain."
"The Commission is financing the lion's share of the cost of this programme."
"It is clear that it has an interest in this."
"It is the Member States, however, who will collect the main share of indirect taxation and duty."
"My question is whether the advantages and disadvantages are equally shared."
"Can Commissioner Monti tell us a little bit more about this?"
"More than half of the large sum for this programme has been earmarked for communication and information exchange systems."
"Through workshops, civil servants v, guides and handbooks, civil servants are urged to use these systems."
"It is difficult to measure the effectiveness of these efforts, however."
"Can the Commissioner promise that specific attention will be paid to this aspect in the evaluation report, and that it will be made clear which results have been achieved?"
"The programme is strongly directed towards the new VAT system."
"Although I do not deny that it is sensible to be as well prepared for this as possible, I note that the final system is a long time off."
"The Member States are very divided about the clearing methods."
"In addition the switch to the original principle requires considerable effort from companies who have only just got used to the interim system."
"This seems in conflict with the aim that this programme should lead to tax reductions."
"For the time being I think it would be better to direct the programme towards improving the current interim system."
"I would like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on this."
"Efficiency through education, that is the motto for the tax system in the single market."
"If the single market is to function properly we need qualified civil servants who can also give out the right information."
"It is a question of establishing an obligation to provide information and, at the end of the day, a certain degree of liability for the information provided as well."
"We know, for example, that various double taxation procedures are causing enormous problems in the European Union."
"In this case a good training course for civil servants may be a major prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the single market."
"If civil servants had sufficient technical knowledge of the tax system this would be another firm foundation on which to build the harmonization of taxation."
"In particular, the improvement of language knowledge and also the training schemes available in this area, for instance Mattheus, is extremely important in order to have an efficient tax administration system in future."
"I believe that in future we should concentrate on creating a situation where the people working in this field also act in an advisory capacity and do not just regard businesses as victims but as the basis for the existence of our system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to express my appreciation of the work Parliament has carried out on the Fiscalis programme, and in particular on the undertaking carried out by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and its rapporteur, Mr Secchi."
"I believe Parliament's amendments, including those presented verbally on budgetary issues, increase the level of quality of the programme significantly. I am therefore pleased to say that the Commission can accept all of them, apart from a minor exception relating to Amendment No 12, specifically with regard to the words ""within the committee foreseen by article 11' ."
"I should like to take the opportunity to remind you and the Council representatives of the importance of the Fiscalis programme for the internal market."
"The regular operation of the VAT and excise systems depends to an ever greater extent on intense cooperation between the national tax authorities."
"These authorities encounter ever greater difficulties in facing the challenges raised by the complex business of the multinationals and by the intricate international frauds committed by the extensive organized crime racket individually."
"The need for profound and firmly-established cooperation between tax officials to be able to face these challenges receives general consent."
"But this cooperation cannot be imposed by diktat: Cooperation should stem from the creation of a relationship of trust between the national authorities by giving officials the right attitude and giving them the most appropriate means."
"Fiscalis constitutes the Community contribution to this committing but necessary task."
"It provides for it in three ways: firstly, exchanges, seminars and multilateral controls that will give national officials the opportunity to work side by side and study their respective working methods reciprocally."
"This exchange of ideas is fundamental to building the trust I mentioned."
"Secondly, the information systems will provide the technical means for cooperation."
"Finally, the coordinated training actions of the Member States, which are essential for creating the necessary attitude for cooperation in the national officials."
"The Commission will have to take all possible measures to ensure that the Council takes the Parliamentary amendments into consideration in full in reaching its common position."
"As it is broadly recognized that the Fiscalis programme should be adopted quickly, I hope the Council will reach a common position that is acceptable to Parliament."
"Thanking all those who have supported the programme, firstly Mr Secchi and all the others, I only wish to add, Mr Blokland, that, with regard to the points you raised, greater attention will be paid to the assessment of the efficacy of the programme and the cofinancing between the Community and Member States is deeply rooted in the preparation of the Fiscalis programme."
"Apart from the communication and the information exchange system, whose outline is very precise, cofinancing is rooted more deeply in the Fiscalis programme; I think we can guarantee it from this point of view."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Personal data and privacy in telecommunications"
"The next item is the report (A4-0361/97) by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of Parliament 's delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector (C4-0571/97-00/0288(COD))."
"Mr President, given that, as an eminent lawyer and a Member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, this is a subject with which you are familiar, I hope that you at least will be able to follow me."
"This draft directive reminds me of the ""Metamorphoses' - not Kafka's ""Metamorphosis' , but the more pleasant ""Metamorphoses' by the Roman poet Ovid - because it began with one title and is ending with another."
"And it began with one content and is ending with another."
"The directive was proposed seven years ago."
"Perhaps this is not a long time in the history of a nation, but it is a long time in the history of a legislative process."
"However, it seems as if twenty years has gone by since the Commission first submitted the draft directive."
"It was called something else then."
"It was called the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector, in particular in the integrated services digital network (ISDN) and in the public digital mobile networks."
"As rapporteur, it was difficult for me to explain what I was doing, because nobody knew what that was."
"And I believe that even the Commission did not know what it was, because we were entering unknown territory."
"As time went by, the mists gradually cleared, and the Council finally accepted - wisely, I believe - an amendment changing the title to the slightly simpler ""Directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector' ."
"I believe that the references to the integrated services digital network (ISDN) and the public digital mobile networks were a sort of magical incantation, which added nothing to the content of the directive."
"So now we have a title which is slightly simpler, but still a mystery to the general public."
"The directive was presented as a sort of annex to the general directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, which was adopted without problems: the procedure ended in agreement between the Council and Parliament, without the need for conciliation."
"With regard to the directive on data protection in the telecommunications sector, however, there was such an enormous difference between the proposal submitted by the Commission in 1990 and that submitted six years later by the Council and the Commission, that I raised the possibility in the Committee on Legal Affairs of asking to be consulted again."
"The Council and the Commission then explained to us that the changes were not that great, that what had been done was to adapt the proposal to the general directive on data protection, that certain new developments had been taken into account - and, so as not to delay the procedure any further, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Parliament finally approved the proposal."
"Thus, in the framework of a new and different procedure, progress was made, the dossier was taken forward."
"Parliament placed particular emphasis on a few issues."
"For me, the most important - from the point of view of principles - was that of subsidiarity."
"Subsidiarity is one of those words that people like to come out with without knowing what it means."
"More specifically, I believe that talking about subsidiarity in relation to the telecommunications sector is utter nonsense, for if there is a field in which there is no place for subsidiarity, it is the field of telecommunications - almost by definition."
"The Council accepted Parliament's amendments in this regard, so that the word subsidiarity no longer appears in the directive."
"Parliament and the Council agreed, moreover, that it is not the purpose of a directive to lay down detailed regulations. That is the function of a regulation."
"Consequently, I believe that we have struck a good balance."
"The reference to subsidiarity has been deleted."
"It is not a question of subsidiarity here."
"This a Community directive, which is binding, as to the result to be achieved, but which leaves to the Member States the choice of form and methods; and Parliament and the Council will therefore leave it up to the competent national authorities to apply it. That is something quite different from subsidiarity."
"There were a number of other issues of technical and economic importance, such the question of being able to record business communications for the purpose of providing evidence of commercial transactions."
"Another matter which proved to be extremely complicated concerned the possibility of charging subscribers for not appearing in a telephone directory."
"This appears to be the reverse of what should be the case."
"You would think that a person should have to pay to appear in a telephone directory, and should be entitled to be omitted free-of-charge. However, it seems that things are so complicated in the telecommunications field that the reverse is actually the case."
"All in all, I believe that we have collaborated successfully."
"The Council and Parliament have demonstrated the best possible will, the Commission has worked with us, and together we have reached an agreement - after a reasonable period of discussion. This new European Parliament and Council directive therefore provides a good example of collaboration and the successful implementation of the codecision procedure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with the rapporteur. In the application of new technologies it is not the technology that should be centre stage but always the people."
"Their individual rights and needs have priority and must be protected at all times."
"As obvious as this observation sounds, it is often difficult to put it into practice."
"The history of the Directive concerning the protection of personal data and privacy in the context of telecommunications has shown this once more."
"It was a long and rocky road which only had a happy ending in the conciliation procedure."
"The Directive supplements the general data protection directive as regards the protection of privacy in view of the technical facilities available to the latest telecommunications networks."
"It gives data protection in the context of telecommunications a similar importance to the protection of health for which the European Parliament has set particularly tough standards in many areas of our lives."
"This high standard is an absolute necessity to protect personal data and safeguard people's private lives against third parties."
"On the other hand, there is a danger that we are sacrificing people's individuality on the altar of the opportunities offered by a technology which is absolutely necessary and welcome and delivering them up without protection to the financial greed of those who run the telecommunications industry."
"In other words, we have to arrive at an individual protection scheme which leaves the decision to each person as to how much access to him or her modern telecommunications should have."
"Let me quote you the example of direct selling by fax or telephone."
"Who has not been annoyed by an unsolicited call from an insurance sales person at an inconvenient moment?"
"This will be a thing of the past when the directive comes into force as this and similar applications of telecommunications technology will require the consent of the person affected."
"I support the result of the conciliation procedure because while maintaining a high level of protection it has managed not to lose sight of the second main goal: the free transfer of data must be guaranteed."
"Let me conclude by pointing out a particularly strange example of the way the unrestricted exchange of data had been put at risk."
"Faced with data networks that span the globe, someone actually had the idea that, under the heading of subsidiarity in the European Union, telecommunications should be regulated differently in each country."
"They must have got communications and commerce mixed up."
"We have succeeded in preventing this, and a good thing too!"
"Mr President, it is worth being here tonight, at this late hour, to bear witness to the fact that the directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector has - as the rapporteur rightly said - reached a safe port."
"And it has reached a safe port after a voyage that - to put it bluntly - was long and complicated."
"Of the thirteen amendments debated at second reading, eleven were the subject of the final stage of the codecision procedure, and the Conciliation Committee agreed a satisfactory joint text on them all."
"The EPP Group will therefore be voting in favour of this joint text, and I have not the slightest doubt that tomorrow, in approving what has been agreed, Parliament will demonstrate its ability to achieve realistic compromises, whilst firmly maintaining its positions of principle regarding the protection of individual privacy and the legitimate interests of legal persons in the stormy sea of new technologies and telecommunications."
"I said that a long process was ending today, and it is appropriate to underline, on behalf of my group and speaking personally, Mr Medina Ortega's excellent management, which we have witnessed on other occasions, but which assumed particular importance during this extremely complex and delicate conciliation procedure."
"Indeed, as the rapporteur said, the initial proposal dates from 1990, but the process of adopting it has been taking place over the last two years."
"And, in this frontier territory, in which the speed of technological change - in particular, the introduction of the integrated services digital network, interactive television and video-on-demand - is creating enormous tensions in society, the extent to which building a genuine European society depends on our ability to resolve such problems is made clear."
"For it is possible to create an economic and monetary union with bankers and traders, but it is not possible to create a European Union without the citizens. And whilst the citizens are undoubtedly interested in the single currency and the free movement of goods, they are giving increasing signals that they are concerned - and exceedingly concerned - about the protection of their personal rights, and especially their right to privacy."
"As I said, eleven amendments were debated, and, amongst the disputed issues, a satisfactory result was achieved - as the rapporteur said - for Parliament's request that the legal authorization of phone-tapping should conform to the requirements of article 14(1) of the general directive on data protection."
"That was secured."
"And it was secured by means of a flexible and intelligent solution which meets the legitimate concerns of the financial services sector regarding the recording of conversations for reasons of business security, to which the rapporteur also referred."
"I should like to draw attention to a number of other matters which I believe are important, notably Parliament's amendment to recital 25 concerning the stormy sea of the commitology procedure."
"Parliament voted that this procedure should not be used out of context, and should not be used to make substantial changes; and I believe that the result achieved in the conciliation procedure delimiting the Commission's commitology powers sets a useful precedent for future legislative acts."
"The result secured for Parliament's demand that the legitimate right to privacy of legal persons should be guaranteed also deserves mention."
"Parliament considered at second reading that, for example, small businesses should be protected from the avalanche of unsolicited advertising material which can place an intolerable burden on their effective management."
"This concern has also been met."
"I am coming to end, Mr President."
"As the rapporteur said, a result was also obtained for Parliament's Amendment No 9 concerning the possibility of not appearing in a telephone directory; and, at this late hour, I shall simply conclude by welcoming the collaboration between the institutions which enabled us to achieve a solution to this undoubtedly thorny problem."
"Mr President, as has previously been said here, it is almost seven years since the Commission presented this proposal on the protection of personal details and private lives in public digital telephone networks, i.e. the GSM and ISDN networks."
"The aim was that the proposal should guarantee protection for all EU citizens with regard to information found in these various public and private lists."
"On the second reading Parliament approved the proposal with 13 amendments, including an amendment saying it should cost nothing to have an ex-directory telephone number."
"The Council was unable to accept all these amendments, especially not the proposal about ex-directory telephone numbers, which is why the question was referred to the Conciliation Committee."
"I do not think the question about the extent to which a charge should be made for ex-directory telephone numbers has really been answered; i.e. where this kind of listing of citizens is concerned, whether people should have the right to remain outside such a list at no charge."
"That also applies to people who are at special risk."
"I certainly think that Parliament has drifted a little away from its original standpoint."
"When the European Parliament's delegation reached agreement on this compromise proposal only four people were actually present, where there should in fact be fifteen people."
"I also think it is debatable whether this is a question which requires an EU directive to set binding standards for the Member States at all, since the consumers' interests are not quite satisfied and not fully protected."
"My group is therefore actually considering voting no to the proposal."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many conflicting interests had to be reconciled here."
"On the one hand, a compromise had to be reached between the need to afford Europe's citizens the greatest possible degree of protection of their privacy and the concern of the operators of public telecommunications networks to provide a comprehensive and efficient service."
"There had to be harmonization at European level while on the other hand the differing interests of the Member States also had to be taken into account."
"An arrangement had to be found which was mainly geared to the standards in the proposal for a directive on the protection of personal data but at the same time was open to future developments."
"The solutions arrived at in the conciliation process took satisfactory account of these concerns."
"Let me pick out three points."
"First, the conditions under which telephone conversations can be recorded have now been stipulated unambiguously."
"The wording of the common position in this respect, which was very vague and would have resulted in inconsistent practice throughout the European Union, has been improved."
"At the same time, however, the justified interest of the Member States in protecting public security and order has been taken into account in the new derogation."
"Second, although the European Parliament was unable to implement its demand that non-inclusion in a telephone directory should be completely free of charge, it was able to reach an acceptable compromise on this point as the actual costs incurred which are to be included have been clearly set out and they will be low."
"Third, going beyond protecting the basic rights of natural persons, the compromise now also takes better care of the justified interests of legal entities."
"On the one hand this prevents inconsistent application of the Directive and on the other, SMEs in particular, will be protected in respect of their inclusion in public directories and in respect of unsolicited telephone calls."
"It is to be welcomed that a simplified wording of the Directive which is easier to understand has been achieved at the end of the legislative procedure, that the terminology and the facts have been adapted to the proposal for a data protection directive, thereby avoiding differing interpretations, and that these two directives - at least in essence - will have to be jointly implemented by Member States by 24 October 1998 at the latest."
"The compromise reached places on record the Union's political will to create a uniform European standard for the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the context of telecommunications, in particular ISDN and digital mobile networks."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, on his, as usual, extremely diligent work."
"He seems to specialize in technical, difficult reports but always does it very well."
"This report covers two main issues: (1) data protection and, (2) new technology."
"Data protection is an important principle for civil liberties."
"We have the right to know what information is held about us and to correct information that should not be held about us."
"The second issue is new technology."
"Someone described the new technological devices to me as comparable to the change from sailing ships to steam ships in the last century."
"This means that all kinds of information is now much more quickly accessible and far more information can be held on computers than could have been kept in manual records and can be accessed much more quickly."
"This poses new problems."
"New solutions need to be found."
"In the report prepared by Mr Medina Ortega we have got some sensible conclusions."
"I would like to support his report."
"Mr President, MEPs, I wish to thank Mr Medina Ortega and the other members of the European Parliament Reconciliation Group, Mr Palacio, Mr Clercq and Mr Imbeni, for their efforts made to reach a favourable conclusion."
"The European Parliament has played an important role in all stages of the procedure, protecting the directive effectively."
"During the course of the reconciliation, the European Parliament made a considerable contribution towards ensuring citizens' rights, particularly with regard to the provisions on confidentiality of communications and public yearbooks."
"As has been recalled, the history of the directive goes back more than seven years and the European Parliament has always played a crucial role in keeping it in the topics to be dealt with, even at times when others thought the subject could be left to subsidiarity."
"Parliament's point of view has proved correct."
"The technological progress and market developments have highlighted the need for a Community means of protecting personal data and protecting private life in the telecommunications sector, a need that is now broadly recognized."
"The directive represents a key issue in the legal framework for the liberalized internal telecommunications market; the minimum package of regulations for consumer protection will help create a climate of trust in the information society."
"One further point I would like to make is the interest of the third countries in the Community approach to the treatment of personal data and the protection of private life."
"This interest of third countries is considerable; it will be important to ensure not only the correct national application of the directive as from October 1998 but also an adequate level of protection in the global telecommunications market."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Number portability and carrier pre-selection"
"The next item is the report (A4-346/97) by Mr van Velzen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 97/33/CE with regard to operator number portability and carrier preselection (COM(97)0480 - C4-0515/97-97/0250(COD))"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a few more weeks liberalization of the telecommunications market will be a fact in most of the Member States of the European Union."
"After business has been the first able to benefit from the liberalization of the telecommunications sector I am pleased to hear that thanks to the proposal on number portability and carrier preselection, as it is laid out before us, the ordinary consumer will be able to reap the benefits of the liberalization process."
"The Commission's proposal to amend the interconnection directive meets the European Parliament's position in the most important points, as expressed in its resolution of 17 July 1997, and of which I had the honour to be rapporteur."
"It is of extreme importance to the consumer that he will be actively able to experience the benefits of the liberalized telecommunications market."
"The proposal will not only lead to an improvement in the quality of service, it will also encourage competition in the market, which means prices will decrease."
"Mr President, the first amendment of the interconnection directive deals with number portability."
"This means retaining your telephone number even when you change operator."
"This is a highly effective instrument for promoting competition, as the consumer who wants to choose a different telephone company will no longer be discouraged by all manner of awkward number changes."
"In time, number portability must also be introduced in the mobile sector, and I would like to ask the European Commission to develop proposals for this as soon as possible."
"The second amendment, Mr President, concerns carrier preselection, which means that the consumer can choose which operator he or she uses, especially for long-distance calls."
"Carrier preselection is an excellent way for the consumer to benefit in the short term from the European liberalization policy."
"Considering the high expense resulting from long distance calls, the introduction of this regulation will be greatly to the advantage of the consumer, yielding hundreds of guilders a year."
"The Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted one amendment which offers Member States in which outdated analogues systems are still in being used the opportunity to request postponement of the introduction of carrier preselection, as long as they can demonstrate that the introduction of this would lead to an excessive burden on certain organizations or groups of organizations."
"I thank Mrs Read for her support on this amendment, and I am also pleased that she has decided against further amendments."
"Mr President, whilst working on the Green Paper on Numbering it emerged that there is a need for pan-European numbers."
"This could for example include one European number for the road rescue services, or one universal service number for the loss of credit or bank or cheque guarantee cards."
"Once these numbers were introduced the user would no longer have to remember complicated country codes when abroad, but merely one European number."
"The ITU has recently assigned 3-8-8 for the European Union, and on 1 January 1999 the European Commission will start testing a series of numbers, and I would like to ask the Commission to inform the European Parliament about the results of these tests as soon as possible."
"Following on, Mr President, I would like to say something about the emergency number 112."
"According to the Council's Decree the use of 1-1-2 or 112 in the European Union was, supposed to have been operational no later than 31 December 1996."
"During the past few months I have tried to check what has happened about this, and I notice that accessibility via the mobile network is still not optimal in certain Member States, and I notice that in Belgium the police are still driving around with the old emergency number."
"Mr President, the parallel existence of two emergency numbers, namely one national and one European number is not in keeping with the intention to have one European emergency number."
"It would be good if the Commission started an investigation into the introduction of the essential 1-1-2 number."
"Mr President, my group is delighted to agree with the Commission's proposal on number portability and carrier preselection, and the amendment agreed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Mr President, my compliments as ever to the rapporteur, Mr van Velzen for the thoroughness of his work."
"I am grateful to him too for indicating his own support for the amendment carried by the Economic Committee which I drafted."
"This proposal from the Commission and the principle of operator number portability and carrier preselection is one that my own political group very much supports as indeed do I. The reason that I was very keen for the particular amendment to go through was that there is at least a question mark over whether carrier preselection is going to deliver the benefits of liberalization to the ordinary domestic consumer, the one who very rarely makes even a longdistance call and almost never in his life makes an international call."
"The fact that there is that question mark, at least in my view, is the reason for the amendment which allows derogations for individual Member States where an excessive burden would be imposed on certain organizations or classes of organizations or - and this is important - where there would be a detrimental impact on the development of competition and choice for consumers."
"It is very important to recognize that derogation is not unconditional."
"Member States would have to demonstrate this excessive burden or detrimental impact on consumers before that derogation could apply."
"It in no way undermines the principle, particularly of carrier preselection, which Mr van Velzen so clearly articulated."
"Any of us who have had the experience of trying to dial a long international telephone number will remember that by the time you get near to the end, which is the time you almost always make a mistake, you have almost forgotten who you are ringing and why."
"Any simplification of that - and of course it is not only about simplification, it is giving real choice to consumers so that they can shop around so that the benefits of competition will come through - is extremely important."
"This is not part of the text, Commissioner, but I would like to indicate that I as an individual Member would like to ask a question of the Commission perhaps twelve months from this day so that you could report to us the number of Member States who have asked for derogations, the reasons for those derogations."
"It would give this Parliament an opportunity to look and see whether my fears are misplaced - and I do not think that they are - and if they are soundly based then we certainly would want to look for an opportunity to look at number portability and carrier preselection again."
"I commend the report to you and am particularly grateful to the rapporteur for his acceptance of the amendment drafted originally by me."
"Mr President, 1 January 1998 will be another historic date in the European Community."
"Liberalization in this sector will bring with it considerable progress and my thanks go particularly to Mr van Velzen who has really worked hard on this issue and has contributed greatly to making this possible."
"A few days ago I presented a book about telecommunications in Austria which represented the state of the art in Austria."
"The interest it generated was huge."
"Entirely new business opportunities are available in this sector and I believe this is of great significance for our future as well as for employment."
"As far as the numbers are concerned it is very important that the number should also be a trade mark."
"We can see this in the emergency number 112, and perhaps 388 will be the code for Europe."
"In future we should give much more consideration to what impetus for rationalization we could trigger using numbers like these, as well as considering the cost of change."
"I believe an analysis of the most frequently dialled numbers would be a giant step forward for us."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his brief and clear statement."
"We do not always agree, but when we do, I believe it should be mentioned."
"Already during the discussion of the Green Paper on number policy for telecommunication services, I expressed my support for the introduction of number portability and carrier preselection."
"This is absolutely essential if the globalizing telecommunications market is to function properly."
"The introduction of carrier selection alone will give the consumer a free choice of telephone company for international calls; yet having to time and time key in an extra code again is very customer unfriendly, as the technology in most Member States is not up to date."
"But, colleagues and commissioner, legislation will have to be introduced carefully, and the markets will need to be opened up on the basis of reciprocality."
"The telecommunication sector is a big employer and has much to lose."
"The Commission must therefore see to it the Member States do not curb the simultaneous introduction of number portability and carrier selection out of protectionist considerations."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner how thinks he is going to implement this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss liberalization or the completion of the internal market, crucial to our business community, and therefore to employment, this House is usually divided into a left wing and a right wing block."
"I therefore join the rapporteur in welcoming the broad support for this directive in this Parliament, and the Council - membership of which is still, unfortunately, two-thirds socialist - is also unanimous in its acceptance."
"This means that our citizens will soon be able to benefit of the liberalization from the telecommunications market, and my group welcomes this."
"I understand that you would like to go home, but I asked the Commissioner a question; namely how does the he think he will be able to check whether this number portability and carrier preselection on the basis of reciprocity is to be introduced simultaneously in all Member States."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can answer you at least in part."
"Your concern is shared by the Commission."
"The Member States, however, have shown a certain preference for flexibility; and so I think that there is still some way to go to achieve the objective you indicated; at the moment, I am not able to answer more specifically."
"I hope that reply satisfies you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel."
"I will now close the debate, and remind you that the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon ."
"(The sitting was closed at 11: 35 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"Mr President, my point concerns the Minutes."
"I refer to an intervention by Mr Macartney in which he said there had been some confusion and an error in translation from the original version in French into English."
"I have checked the original French version and it quite clearly states 'la viande britannique' ."
"My understanding is that 'britannique' means British, it does not mean English, and therefore it includes all British beef including Scottish beef."
"Mr President, I appreciate my colleague's concern for linguistic accuracy but as you know the President in the Chair at the time was David Martin who is also from Scotland."
"We have checked the original version signed by the group and it said 'anglaise' ."
"That is why I raised the point of order, just for the record."
"Thank you. I think we have looked at all the details of this question, and so the facts of this matter must now be clear."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Decision on urgency"
"Mr President, The Committee on External Economic Relations requests that you reject the urgency application."
"The Commission asked on 17 November for an urgent priority according to article 97."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations debated the application at a session on 18 November, and rejected it unanimously on grounds both of procedure and content."
"The following concerns the procedure followed."
"At the time of the application for urgent priority the Committee was in possession only of a copy of the covering sheet to the basic document containing the Commission's proposal."
"Under such circumstances we cannot be expected to give a Commission proposal serious consideration, however urgent it may appear to be."
"Despite this, it would be possible to make an exception for the Ukraine on financial grounds, but as a tranche of ECU 100 million was to be made available, we do not believe that it was not capable of rejection on financial grounds alone."
"We need time for consultation and request the rejection of the urgency application."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Organized crime"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following five reports on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs:"
"A4-0333/97 by Mrs Cederschiöld, on the Action Plan to combat organized crime (7421/97 - C4-0199/97)-A4-0348/97 by Mr Bontempi, on the draft Joint Action on making corruption in the private sector a criminal offence (10017/97 - C4-0478/97-97/0914(CNS))-A4-0351/97 by Mr Bontempi, on proposals for a Joint Action to create a European judicial network (9804/97 - C40428/97-97/0911(CNS))-A4-0355/97 by Mr Orlando, on the draft Joint Action establishing a mechanism for evaluating the application and implementation at national level of international undertakings in the fight against organized crime (10406/2/97 - C40479/97-97/0912(CNS))-A4-0349/97 by Mr Orlando, on the draft Joint Action adopted by the Council on the basis of article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on making it a criminal offence to participate in a criminal organization in the Member States of the European Union (10407/97 - C4-0480/97-97/0913(CNS))"
"Mr President, organized crime moves across frontiers in precisely the same way as environmental pollution."
"Joint action is required."
"Concerted efforts at global, European, national, regional and local level, but also within communities and on the part of the individual."
"The European level must be reinforced, but without weakening the other levels."
"The narcotics syndicates know no frontiers."
"People are smuggled via organizations between different parts of the world."
"They have the whole world as their playground."
"Hundreds of mafia organizations already have interests within our Union."
"We must increase the cooperation within the Unionʼs frontiers, but also outside these frontiers towards the east and west."
"The plans to start a more comprehensive initiative in this area began at international level a few years ago."
"One year ago in Dublin the foundations were laid for the programme of action, which was discussed in Amsterdam last summer, with 30 different proposals for fighting organized crime."
"Today we shall be discussing Parliamentʼs views on this matter."
"We also have a number of legal acts with detailed question that will be discussed at the same time."
"It is a question of building a fence - the fence of legal security - which is so clear-cut that we still manage to take targeted and very effective measures against crime, since this strikes a balance not only between the constitutional state and integrity, but also the effectiveness of the measures."
"In my proposals I have developed some of the points and gone further than the Council wishes."
"I am more specific on some points."
"I build a higher safety net on some points, while at the same time trying to increase effectiveness."
"I have even rejected some of the Councilʼs conclusions."
"In addition, I have included in the report some new points of view that were not included, that is, areas that had not been discussed."
"The report is, of course, very comprehensive."
"In particular, I would like to draw attention to the practical work, since I believe that it is extremely important."
"I have endeavoured to listen to my colleagues and also to understand their points of view."
"I feel that this has been an extremely good cooperation."
"Profit lies at the heart of organized crime."
"Many of the proposals are therefore directed at profit, but also at the points of evidence, since this is the narrow sector in this context."
"It is a question of finding various new ways of moving forward as far as evidence is concerned."
"This is, in fact, extremely difficult in this context."
"That is because organized crime often operates in such a way that it is not the people who actually take charge of the profits who are made to carry out the criminal activities, instead, it tends to be other people who do this - which means it is frequently difficult to sort out the evidence."
"I believe that practical cooperation through the network is one of the key factors."
"In the long term, this will help us to create an area for legal security within the Union."
"In this context I would also like to take the opportunity to look at cooperation in the Nordic region."
"We in the Nordic countries have had practical cooperation of this kind for a long time, which means that the parliaments take advantage of each othersʼ experiences before we introduce new proposals."
"We also have day-to-day cooperation, which in my opinion is among the most important areas for further development."
"We must establish compatible legal systems in Europe and we must harmonize in those areas where we cannot move forward in any other way."
"I would like to take the opportunity to extend a vote of thanks to the minister, Mr Fischbach, who has come to Parliament and is holding discussions and consultations with us for the first time on these questions, with the result that we shall have the opportunity to present Parliamentʼs views on an important issue under the third pillar - this is, in fact, in accordance with what was decided in Amsterdam, even though it has not yet been ratified."
"I would like to extend our special thanks for this."
"I think there is a wide range of opinion as to what the issue of organized crime actually involves."
"We must establish a definition."
"In order to be able to take effective measures, we must know what it is we are talking about."
"I therefore believe that the definition is extremely important."
"This, like the current law, will also be discussed on 3 and 4 December at the Council of Ministers."
"It will be interesting for us to see what actually transpires, and whether they will listen to Parliamentʼs views on these questions."
"I hope that they will also begin to look a little more closely at special methods of investigation, that is, more clandestine methods."
"These are extremely sensitive, but I hope that the Council will address them."
"I have addressed these issues in more detail in my report than the Council has previously chosen to do; they are, of course, sensitive questions."
"It is also important to address questions relating to information technology."
"We must prevent what happens within the field of information technology when the criminal world begins to make use of it."
"We must also ensure that the police have the right opportunities to make use of information technology in order to prevent crime."
"These issues should, I believe, also be explored more fully than they have been in the past."
"Ninety per cent of the report was passed by the committee."
"On those points where other views were expressed we have now put forward compromise proposals."
"I would particularly like to express my thanks to those colleagues who have attended and taken part in the discussions, since I feel there has been exceptionally committed, productive and interesting cooperation."
"I myself have been able to learn a great deal and therefore hope that the chamber will support this proposal in full."
"If it does not, it would, in a sense, be a shame if Parliament did not succeed in taking advantage of the opportunity Mr Fischbach is giving us to put forward our views. This also lends this issue a weight that it would not otherwise have had."
"I therefore feel it is right for Parliament to be able to put forward its views."
"I also hope and believe that the lengthy work we have behind us will give rise to good opportunities to give prominence to this issue, even though not everyone has had all of their views adopted in detail."
"That is why I also want to mention Italy."
"The Group Union for Europe is proposing some changes we have had little discussion about."
"Organized crime can take many different forms."
"I have worked with many Italians and it is clear that experience in Sweden and Italy is very different in this area."
"But we have a great deal to learn from Italy, since the Italians have taken some extremely drastic measures."
"I am especially addressing the Group Union for Europe when I say this. We must bear in mind - and this is also my personal experience of Italy - that the Italian situation shows how exceptionally important it is to uphold the principles of the constitutional state in this context, to keep up the fight for human rights and the integrity of the individual, and not to forget this whenever we wish to take really effective action."
"I eagerly await the Council of Ministers meeting in December, when we shall see whether the Heads of Government are able to live up to the hope they have given the citizens of the Union that they will make this Union an effective instrument against organized crime."
"Mr President, I think the direction we have taken of concentrating the entire package of measures to be taken against organized crime into one morning is a positive one."
"It is a significant innovation."
"We have been talking about the total lack of any international or European campaign against organized crime for a long time."
"Today I think we can finally say with some satisfaction that real changes are taking place."
"The action plan is a significant change."
"For the first time we have had to reflect and give our opinion on a global plan and a coordinated and consistent approach to the campaign against organized crime, although unfortunately the plan has already been drawn up, I think the most significant changes are those resulting from the operating plan, from that fact that since July 1997 the Council has set to work to define specific legislative measures as well."
"Today, in fact, our examination relates to the plan and to five joint measures."
"Finally, one particularly important change to be noted by the Luxembourg Presidency is that the European Parliament has finally been consulted on these actions in advance."
"I should like to remind the Presidency that this relationship will have to be regulated in future as we are forced to run a long way, further than a Parliament can normally do to be able to give a reasoned opinion."
"But we have done this to show that we really want to participate and make our contribution."
"With regard to the action plan, after this positive decision, I just want to say there are still a few gaps I would like to point out to Council so that subsequent actions can take them into account."
"It seems to me, for example, that the problem of urban crime has not been focused on a great deal; we know it is different from, but also connected with, organized crime."
"I can think of some areas of my country, particularly cities such as Naples or other cities in the south and north, where communal crime exists: small, widespread crime connected with drugs trafficking and organized crime."
"This problem deserves a specific speech indicating the measures that need to be taken with regard to social prevention and specific intervention."
"Perhaps we should talk about city business, but I want to mention this as a key point, as a critical point that has not been dealt with sufficiently - it has not been dealt with."
"Besides the social prevention measures, I also recall a very delicate issue regarding the organization of financial crime: tax havens."
"Action on tax havens is certainly difficult, but we are still having difficulties in establishing specific actions to reduce or oppose organized crime in respect of tax havens."
"We know that tax havens do not just exist in overseas countries, but in our own countries as well, in a variety of ways: in the form of anonymous accounts held in Austria or in excessively protected bank confidentiality."
"I believe these points should be recalled in a plan I believe should provide great political, operational and institutional change."
"I wish to make one important point in passing."
"In the amendments and discussion that at times are the inevitable but also exaggerated echo of national debates, we have a pattern that ought to be superseded: that of a confrontation between the effectiveness of the state's capacity to pursue crime and its complex, sophisticated current manifestations, particularly at international level, and the sacred principle of guaranteeing citizens' rights."
"I think that this confrontation, considered in a static and old-fashioned way, no longer works, and no longer satisfies us; we have to start from another angle, that of establishing or recognizing a fundamental right to legality as one of the central aspects of human rights which should be better guarded today in a complex society that is changing a great deal."
"The right to legality certainly means a right, a citizen's guarantee in respect of the law, the state and the courts, but also and above all a right not to have the territory occupied by crime, the economy distorted by crime, and the risk of citizens having to surrender democracy owing to the spread and pervasiveness of organized crime."
"A new balance should be sought from this angle and new means introduced."
"I am pleased to see that those who have had a very painful experience, as our country has, have been able to try out these new means."
"When I say try out, I mean that at the time we introduce these means, I am thinking of participation in organized crime, which, if it becomes common, will be exceptionally important for favouring legal cooperation, I am thinking of the organization of the judicial network which is no more than a collection of judges who, with those connections introduced one or two years ago, must constitute the basis for promoting rapid legal cooperation."
"All this stems from the fact that we clearly need to deal with the citizen's problem by defending his rights vis-à-vis the state - this is a point we always have to emphasize and analyze when that right is violated."
"But we also have to realize that other means are required, and so it seems dangerous and wrong to me to deny the potential of these means, when we should be assessing their operation, practice, management and efficacy."
"From this point of view, if Europe draws up a plan for combatting organized crime, as it is preparing to do, trying as far as possible to reproduce the conditions guaranteeing a state of law and transferring them to the first pillar, or at all events initiating all the actions which give Parliament a means of control over the Court of Justice (which, unfortunately, has not yet happened), then I believe that, while we are establishing these means, we should point out, with great critical concern as the report does, the need for a system that protects this new principle of legality."
"This principle of legality should be based on the need for the democratic system to provide an answer to the destruction of life and democracy by crime but also for the citizens to enjoy their full rights and protection."
"We therefore need to approach the citizen's point of view."
"I think that certain figures prove that concern about largescale, organized crime and widespread crime taking various forms is a prevailing concern among Union countries."
"The Union should therefore contribute towards finding an answer."
"I think that, with Parliament engaged in a lively debate on the possibility of giving an opinion, we will ensure that we move towards a declaration of the right to legality in general as a fundamental new category of human right."
"To achieve this objective, I think we have the very important duty of discussing but also supporting the changes that will enable us to fight organized crime and its fundamental attack on the democratic system, not just with words but in a visible, concrete and democratically guaranteed fashion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in completing the presentation begun by Mrs Cederschiöld and Mr Bontempi, I too wish to emphasize the importance of this debate on the affirmation of legality in Europe."
"I wish to express my appreciation for the sensitivity shown by the Council and the Luxembourg Parliament and my satisfaction with the discussion held by the Committee on Public Liberties."
"I am sorry we have so little time available, but, despite the strict deadlines, we have sought in every way to honour the commitment not to miss this important transition in the life of the Union."
"We are dealing with an organic measure and I wish to talk about three of its aspects."
"The first relates to the systems of assessing and implementing ways of combatting organized crime; the second to penalties for taking part in organized crime; and the third to the Falcone programme."
"This third aspect is not on Parliament's agenda."
"The relevant Council documents only arrived on 6 November."
"As far as I am concerned, I have done my duty and I too ask the Presidency for this point to be postponed, so as to allow Parliament to express its opinion."
"I have performed my own duty of indicating the positions held on the Council's motion."
"Of the two documents examined by Parliament this morning, the first relates to the system of assessing the implementation of measures to combat organized crime."
"I consider this document to be highly important politically as it introduces a criterion of consistency in the behaviour of the Member States with regard to the important issue of combatting organized crime and it constitutes in itself perhaps a clearer recognition of why this issue should be regarded as an issue of European interest."
"Within the committee, we have sought to praise the role played by the Commission and Parliament and we have provided for several amendments, which are largely shared within the committee, to try and clarify some of the changes."
"Again with regard to the first of the two documents, we should remember that, as a result of the position assumed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, the Council has made several changes and some of them, which I will refer to at voting time, have in some way absorbed the motions tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"With regard to the second document, a commendable and truly important attempt has been made, even if a little late, to establish a unified definition of the issue of combatting organized crime, including the establishment of penalties for belonging to a criminal organization."
"European cooperation in combatting organized crime can only prove effective if there is a common reference framework for organized crime, if there is a common awareness of the existence of criminal associations with different forms of participation."
"One premise stands out in this connection: the states and their criminal law have to adapt to the change in crime."
"If crime changes and the laws remain the same, they end up being ineffective and facilitating crime."
"The basic problem we have to face is whether today, not just in Italy although it began mainly in Italy, there is a particular criminal phenomenon that deserves particular attention."
"That is the basic question!"
"If we do not think there is any particular criminal phenomenon and there is no particular need to combat this particular phenomenon, we can continue to combat changing crime with antiquated systems, but we must realize that we will not be effective!"
"The committee thought and still thinks, by a large majority, that there is a special case of a criminal association composed of individuals who participate in differentiated ways."
"If this is true, and it is true as proven by the dramatic experience of my country, that the criminal organization involves and has involved not just the traditional criminal phenomenon, robbery rather than theft, but involves sectors of the church, the state and politics, it seems to me that the criminal law should take this into account; in fact, if it is not taken into account, the risk is to continue fighting a criminal organization that no longer exists or that is no longer really dangerous."
"For this reason, we believe that the Council's motion contains highly important and appreciable aspects and that the amendments presented by the committee comply with Council's approach."
"The respect for fundamental rights certainly needs to be stated forcefully, and this is confirmed several times, in the amendments submitted by the Commission to Parliament, but we should also not forget that legality, democracy, corruption-free institutions and a free economy are direct, subjective positions that should be protected."
"We certainly need to find a balance in the knowledge that we need to guarantee the connection that exists between the right to legality and the right to personal freedom."
"In the motions presented by the Commission, reference is made in particular to the requirement to take into account the fact that the criminal organization is trying to become less military and more financial; that is, it is having increasing recourse to aspects connected with finance and money laundering, while the armed military phenomenon, the phenomenon of massacres, is tending to become less significant. That does not mean that the criminal organization has ceased to exist, it means it is becoming more pervasive and dangerous."
"The motions put forward are fairly interesting and I think we will have to call upon Parliament to accept the invitation offered by a very large majority of the Committee on Civil Liberties which is seeking to take a step forward towards the European Union and the whole of Europe campaigning against organized crime, to prevent undesirable forms of it infecting the whole of Europe."
"With regard to the Mafia in particular, we are all dramatically aware that it is no longer an Italian or Sicilian phenomenon, but has become and is tending to become more and more of a European phenomenon."
"I confess that, with the pain of someone who is well aware of coming from a country that is the source of that infection, but with the loyalty of someone who knows that the others need to be forewarned of this phenomenon."
"The Mafia wants it said that it does not exist."
"The various theories as to the origin of the word ""mafia' include one applying Arabic etymology: in Arabic, ""ma fiiha' means ""does not exist' ."
"The Mafia needs people to think that it does not exist."
"When you are in a country other than Italy or in a city other than Palermo, and it is said that the Mafia does not exist, that is like an official invitation to the Mafia to go to that country and that city."
"I would like to thank the three rapporteurs for these outstanding reports."
"We shall now hear from the draftsmen of the opinions of the other committees."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs very sincerely, particularly Mrs Cederschiöld, on their reports, on which I have prepared this opinion by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I believe it is most appropriate that we should be debating these reports during a week which started with a visit by the President of the Court of Auditors and in which we have been concerned with his report on the financial situation and the weaknesses of our European budget."
"It is one of the principle duties of this people's Parliament to see that the interests of the citizens and taxpayers of this united Europe are not forgotten."
"The Court drew attention to the vulnerability of the European budget as a subsidy budget."
"I think that was very important."
"If we look at this vulnerability a little more closely, we discover that major frauds occur in the field of personal income by a ratio of about two to one."
"We have seen as recently as the Committee of Inquiry into transit fraud what that can mean."
"It means billions of ECUs lost to our taxpayers."
"What is going on there - the disappearance of whole truckloads of cigarettes or meat - is obviously nothing less than organized crime."
"It is really very much in our interests that this situation is combatted."
"It really is a scandal, as the President said, how little Member States cooperate in this."
"I believe it is the duty of the European Parliament constantly to point out these abuses."
"This has been done in your report and I should like to thank you most sincerely for it."
"Mr President, if one were to ask the citizens of the European Union what concerns them most, the overwhelming majority would reply that the Union should prioritize the fight against internationally organized crime."
"I therefore welcome Mrs Cederschiöldʼs report and the reports presented by Mr Bontempi and Mr Orlando."
"One of the most important items on the agenda at the Dublin Summit was organized crime."
"A High Level Group including representatives of the Member States and the Commission was therefore set up for this purpose."
"The groupʼs mandate was to draw up a plan of action."
"The Commission has constantly been the driving force behind work on the plans of action."
"The Amsterdam summit adopted the plans."
"It can be regarded as a first step in our efforts to tackle the serious crime threat and to confront the anxieties of our citizens."
"It is therefore gratifying that the Council of Ministers is encouraging both the Member States and the institutions of the Union to jointly put their weight behind the text of the plans of action and make the fight against organized crime truly effective."
"The Commission bears an important responsibility for ensuring that 20 of the 30 recommendations in the plan become a political reality."
"Todayʼs debate shows that all of the Unionʼs institutions must accept their responsibilities in the fight against organized crime."
"Let me also say something about the points at issue."
"Organized crime is nothing new - a fact which Mrs Cederschiöld also underlined - but with the new technology, increased trade and ever faster means of transport, it has grown and changed."
"Organized crime has adopted increasingly sophisticated methods and has increasingly become an international phenomenon."
"The development of the communications sector has brought with it many positive things."
"At the same time, however, the Internet and other electronic contact networks for business and monetary transactions provide organized crime with new opportunities."
"The facts speak very clearly for themselves."
"We have today in the European Union 15 different legal systems."
"We have different definitions of fraud and we have major differences in the regulations for banks and financial activities."
"Organized crime understands how to exploit this fragmented situation."
"At the same time, this intensifies the need for increased cooperation and greater effectiveness in the Unionʼs fight against crime."
"It is also becoming increasingly clear to us how organized crime is forcing its way into the Unionʼs own areas of cooperation."
"This applies to agricultural and export subsidies, State purchasing and trade in environmentally harmful goods, not to mention the extensive trade in drugs and human beings."
"At this moment UCLAF is busy investigating smuggling of hazardous substances that break down the ozone layer."
"This is an example of the new problems that we must address."
"The Cederschiöld report emphasizes that the plans of action are concerned partly with defining the problems and partly with proposing measures."
"I also feel that it is important that we should acquire more detailed knowledge about different criminal phenomena."
"In order to make headway in the fight against organized crime, we must first have a common approach to dealing with these matters."
"This applies both under the current Maastricht Treaty and under the new Amsterdam Treaty."
"Unfortunately, it seems that the Member States all too often want to assert their own sovereignty in these matters."
"I therefore agree that we should proceed step by step on the basis of a common understanding of how we should handle the new crime problems."
"This applies equally to the sharp increase in criminality with regard to electronic devices, hacking into databases, money laundering, and so on."
"The Cederschiöld report also advocates cooperation between Member State police forces and judicial authorities rather than a harmonization of legislation at EU level."
"I share the view that cooperation must be the first consideration."
"It was for this reason also that I recently proposed the long-term Falcone programme of action."
"This programme is targeted at education and exchanges between those working on the fight against organized crime within the different national authorities."
"This is also the reason why I support the proposal in Mr Bontempiʼs report to create networks for the Member Statesʼ legal experts."
"Another good suggestion along the same lines is the idea of a special liaison group for legal experts from the Member States within UCLAF."
"This proposal was made by Mr Tomlinson in the transit report which we discussed last spring."
"But increased cooperation alone is not enough."
"Clear and well defined rules are also needed in order for the different judicial systems to be able to function together."
"I am thinking among other things about the need for mutual assistance in judicial matters, including mutual rules for the submission of evidence."
"It is not a question of harmonizing penal systems."
"It is, however, necessary to close the loopholes in the Unionʼs legal systems that are exploited by organized crime."
"It is necessary to create effective and equivalent protection in the Member States."
"The goal must be that criminals should not be able to escape because of differences in our various legal systems."
"The Bontempi report on a joint action against corruption within the private sector is a good example in this connection."
"We must be able to get a result, even if the Member States do not have the same penalties for private corruption."
"We must, however, define these crimes in the same way and there must be reasonably similar minimum penalties for these."
"In the same report, Mr Bontempi complains that the joint action against corruption does not grant any role to the Court."
"I completely agree."
"We should come back to this once the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified."
"The problems surrounding the Courtʼs lack of jurisdiction have also been addressed in the Orlando report on a common system for the evaluation and application of international undertakings in the fight against organized crime."
"In the same report it was proposed that the Commission should be given an active role in this work."
"It goes without saying that I support this proposal."
"The Cederschiöld report also underlines the need for preventive measures, which is also addressed in the plans of action."
"I share the view that those crime-prevention measures require support both in the form of adequate legislation and the effective application of carefully considered methods."
"I regret the fact that the plans of action have not given sufficient emphasis to the social and economic factors that are often at the root of criminality, not least in the cities."
"The plans do, however, establish a connection with the structural funds as a means of improving the ability to fight crime in the city."
"This is something that I think it is important for us to develop. The social misery in cities is a breeding ground for organized crime."
"I, for my part, see no contradiction in the context of the fight against crime between preventive work on the one hand and repressive work on the other."
"We need both."
"The Orlando report addresses the question of participation in criminal organizations."
"The basis for sentencing a person for participation in a criminal organization is, in my opinion, that personʼs conduct."
"I believe that it is important to establish this fact."
"The Cederschiöld report also addresses the problem associated with the exchange of information in the same case between courts in different Member States."
"I have myself been able to witness how delays in the exchange of information between the different legal systems can directly benefit the criminals."
"It can take such a long time that the criminals are simply acquitted."
"The Council of Ministers is currently discussing a convention that is designed to improve the opportunities for mutual judicial support."
"Work on this is at a very advanced stage and I hope that a political decision can be taken in the course of the next year."
"Parliamentʼs proposal of a European public prosecutor is of interest in this connection."
"I would also like to say a few words about the expansion of the Union towards Eastern and Central Europe."
"It is evident that the fight against organized crime and corruption will be an important component in the coming membership negotiations."
"The plans of action therefore propose a special cooperation pact against organized crime, and that this pact should be concluded between the candidate states and EU Member States."
"Together with the Presidency, the Commission is now busy studying how such a pact should be formulated."
"In my view, this cooperation pact should give clear guidelines on how we are to tackle organized crime within the framework of a pre-accession strategy."
"The proposals for action should be presented well in advance of the summit in Cardiff next spring."
"The aim should then be to include them in the partnership agreements that are to be established with each Member State."
"Allow me finally to underline how important it is that we should use all of the instruments available to us in the fight against organized crime."
"The Member States already have a number of conventions lying on the table."
"I am thinking about Europol, the convention on extradition and the convention on fraud and cheating."
"I would like to appeal to Parliamentʼs Members to make use of their contacts in their respective countries in order to ensure that these conventions can be ratified as quickly as possible."
"Many thanks, Madam Commissioner, for your clear presentation and for telling off our governments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for their intensive work over the last weeks and months."
"I shall start with Mrs Cederschiöld, who had a difficult task to perform, namely to combine very different views, different understandings of terminology, various initiatives in the definition of organized crime, and the definition of the necessity for combatting it."
"I think she has achieved this magnificently."
"That does not alter the fact that there will certainly continue to be other basic views about one problem or another."
"Despite this, we can concur with the basic concept of Mrs Cederschiöld's report."
"That obviously applies also to the work of Rinaldo Bontempi and the preparatory work of Leoluca Orlando."
"One problem runs through all the reports: through the opinion by Mrs Cederschiöld on the report of the High Level Group, and through the proposals that have been prepared by Orlando and Bontempi on individual measures."
"There is no point in appealing to our colleagues in the national parliaments and asking them to hurry up with ratification of the current conventions please, because it is the right thing to do."
"That makes no difference to the fact that for some fields of criminal activity we shall have to arrive at a Community solution, a European Union responsibility for combatting crime."
"I shall try to make this clear to you by using practical examples."
"In recommendation 19, which Mrs Cederschiöld commented on in her report, the High Level Group wants to integrate the cooperation of penal authorities."
"Mrs Cederschiöld has said that cooperation should not be centralized, but take place directly between the penal authorities. Then she proposes a multilingual glossary of various legal terms."
"I accept that that is a fascinating idea."
"One day I should like to consult that work, just for fun."
"After Mr Orlando's speech, however, I have to ask myself if the Mafia issues a multilingual glossary of legal terms."
"Or perhaps it is working on one, while we wait."
"That is the real problem, and it is also the problem, Mr Fischbach, which has confronted us since Amsterdam."
"In Amsterdam we experienced what seemed to me to be a turning-point, as I said yesterday to my colleagues discussing the Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos report."
"Amsterdam was the start of a new phase, not a continuation of the Maastricht phase."
"The reason for this is that with increasing economic intensification, and the addition now of the single currency, the accompanying - I might call it brave - de facto state control of internal security simply is not receiving equally necessary attention because national exemption continues to be claimed as a priority."
"Here, as in the past, national exemption is presented as a primary objective."
"For some elements we may possibly have advanced, for instance, political asylum policy - although my personal impression here is that this has arisen more out of opportunism than because of internal policy, in order to sweep it away somewhere else and remove this unpleasant subject from our agendas."
"For all other subjects to do with intensification, however, we saw at Amsterdam that we have a five-year deadline, at the end of which there has to be a unanimous resolution for transfer to the Community framework."
"And I wonder if in the final count all 15 Member States will not in fact claim priority for their national interests."
"An end has now been put to this with the report Mr Orlando had to write - I commiserate with him on the task - and the title needs another look."
"We are being consulted about writing a checklist to examine national implementation of what were previously seen as Community measures."
"I prophesy now that we will soon be presented with a joint consultative measure to see what measures the European Union should adopt in order to flag up insufficient implementation at national level of what were previously seen as Community measures."
"I do not think this will take us any further in the suppression of organized crime."
"In my view we need a courageous decision which says that, if we detect that there are criminal areas that cannot be controlled at national level, either by police or penal measures, then these tasks must be delegated to the European Union within the competency of a Commissioner with the legislative authority of the European Parliament."
"That is the first obvious point."
"The second point is that this may be just in the future, but I think we should define it precisely here today."
"The second point is also that we must in the meantime live with the fact that things are not as we should like to have them, and that we must make compromises."
"In making compromises, however, that is, when defining what is achievable now, we must show more courage."
"More courage means to me that we must arrive at the closest possible integration within a basis of inter-state cooperation - what Mrs Cederschiöld tried to demonstrate in her report."
"But that must not follow the pattern of Europol - and that has to be passed to you, Mr President of the Council."
"Based on what I know from the debate in the German Bundestag and Bundesrat, delegates in the national parliaments fear that fundamental laws of a democratic constitution may be violated by the creation of this police force. If, when considering the proposals for the immunity of police forming a European police force, we at national level have to spend more time debating why Europol officers actually need integrated immunity than we do debating what they need in the way of technical equipment and training to hunt down criminals, then I have to say that the Council has the basic concept wrong."
"At the same time I should draw attention to the following. The considerations introduced with the Europol Report, and which are repeated in every other Community measure such as the report by the High Level Group, are quite relevant to realizing that the end of border controls within the European Union, abandoned customs barriers, and the European Union itself with its huge economic activity, offer increasing opportunities for gangs of crooks and organized crime."
"The Commissioner has herself drawn attention to the fact that in our own areas of responsibility the acceptance of fraud and corruption is on the increase, but in my view we have still failed to realize that we must then pay more attention to the qualifications of officials and organizations which are supposed to combat that situation."
"You referred to the Falcone programme, Madam Commissioner."
"I think that is essential."
"We need officials who are capable of handling modern technology."
"We need crime officers who are capable of understanding modern economic systems."
"I am fairly certain that in future it will be more important to have better police who are able to operate the most modern computer equipment, rather than to have faster cars with flashing blue lights."
"For that reason the main emphasis now being placed on integration of training and qualifications is one of the most important steps taken in recent years."
"We have behind us a long period of very intensive cooperative work."
"On behalf of my group I should like to end by thanking not just the rapporteurs, but also the Council President, Mr Fischbach: you promised us in Luxembourg that you wanted to abide by all the Amsterdam results that were in Parliament's interests, including the obligatory consultation of the European Parliament, for all third pillar measures."
"In the cases we are considering you have done that."
"We should like to ask you to hand that on to the next presidency, as far as you are able to do so, because the European Parliament has some important input to make, as you have seen from this morning's debate and as you have yourself mentioned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schultz has correctly drawn attention to the fact that organized crime has a relatively easy time of it."
"It has money available in almost unlimited quantities, uses it for the purchase of the most up-to-date means of communication which the police can only dream of, purchases and trains people with it, has the most modern and most effective logistics and one huge, decisive advantage: it does not have to abide by our laws."
"All these advantages have led to the fact that organized crime in our society and our state is spreading and will finally undermine our society."
"I have enquired of experts concerned with combatting crime, and they have made it clear that organized crime already has a hand in almost one third of all criminal statistics."
"It is high time, therefore, that effective measures were taken."
"Thus our thanks go out to everyone who wants to proceed with more intensive measures for cooperation, beyond the demands of national interests, to improve the lot of Europe's citizens."
"In particular our thanks are due to the rapporteurs, led by Mrs Cederschiöld with her very comprehensive report and the highly important reports on legal cooperation by Mr Bontempi and Mr Orlando."
"Whilst we have been successful in achieving some success in police cooperation - I am thinking of Europol and Schengen - with judicial cooperation we are at the very beginning."
"It will be necessary here for us to set up additional main aims for measures, as the police will only be as effective as we are successful in establishing a common legal framework, not just for detection, but obviously also within the context of common elements of the criminal code."
"On behalf of my group, therefore, I assess as most valuable the network proposed by Mr Bontempi, in which the judiciary and experts can be brought together to acquire the same level of knowledge, to learn a joint legal tradition, as the first steps towards that unification of the legal systems which will now be possible following the establishment of new elements of the criminal code."
"It is essential, however, that this criminal code be established to cover the field of organized crime and complicity in organized crime, otherwise we shall remain unsuccessful in the battle against it."
"As elected representatives of the people we are responsible for seeing that all possible measures are taken, because our citizens do not like criminals to be enjoying freedom of action, when Europe's freedoms do not lead to more security for the citizen himself."
"I appeal to the Council, therefore, to act on all these measures, and I know that in the capable hands of Mr Fischbach and his colleagues this cooperation will be intensively developed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I do not think there is a single lunatic in Europe who can say that the Mafia does not exist."
"The Mafia does exist!"
"It is very powerful and very well organized; it is now an international and transnational phenomenon that uses far more effective means than the obsolete means of our small Member States of the European Union, and I would also say outside the European Union."
"Today, organized crime, a great threat to the lawful state, is a great threat to democracy in many countries; it is attacking the economic and production nerve centres of many countries and attacking many young democracies, by money laundering, by international trafficking in drugs, arms and anything else."
"All this is now obvious, no-one can deny it."
"So it is absolutely essential to have a European judicial network, a stronger connection, more coordination between those involved in preventing and suppressing this phenomenon."
"Having said that, however, we cannot forget that, behind the legitimate requirement for more effective means, a temptation could be hiding for, after infecting Europe with unfavourable forms, such as organized crime, as Mr Orlando said, Europe could be infected with other viruses, legal substantialism, that of legal short cuts comprising exceptional laws, suspensions and compression of the right to the protection of individual rights."
"We are asked for a balance. We too want a balance, with the full individual guarantee of rights of defence, such as the direct relationship between criminal fact and accused, something that some are beginning to deny."
"We believe it necessary for criminals to be convicted with objective controls and not just through information on changes in living conditions that are particularly advantageous."
"We do not regard this as a balance; otherwise, the fight against crime would be counterproductive: the remedy would be worse than the evil, because it would affect citizens who are defenceless against the excessive power of the state and we would leave the real criminals unpunished."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the group of experts commissioned by the European Council of Dublin for this purpose has put together the outcome of its thoughts in record time in the form of an action plan against organized crime."
"Fifteen political groupings and thirty recommendations represent an enormous workload, but the pace of progress has been sustained despite the fact that the wider public is as yet unaware of the basics of what is involved."
"In connection with this I would like to make the following comments."
"Firstly, we should endeavour to transpose into national law the joint actions in the fight against organized crime - the first of which will be adopted at the beginning of next month in the form of joint actions - as soon as reasonably possible."
"The state of ratification - or should I say nonratification - of the Europol Convention, or the agreements on extradition, for example, are sufficient justification for this pressing call to Member States."
"Secondly as regards the fight against organized crime and the measures to be implemented in this area, it is clear that this is a highly sensitive area especially as regards respect for the right to a defence."
"It goes without saying that the Group of the Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, in whose name I am privileged to speak attaches particular importance to this."
"Thirdly, as regards the authority set down in the third pillar, the improvement of parliamentary control, which Parliament is right to insist on, has acquired a new dimension in the course of the current Presidency-in-Office of the Council."
"At this point I would like to pay a particular tribute to Mr Marc Fischbach, the current President of the Justice and Home Affairs Council for having given parliamentary participation a new momentum which his successors will not be able - and, I hope - will not want to ignore."
"Fourthly, I would also like to express my particular gratitude to Mrs Cederschiöld, Mr Orlando and Mr Bontempi, for successfully compiling our work within a timescale which allows the Council to make use of it in due course."
"Mr President, today we are examining the action plan to combat organized crime adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Amsterdam, along with four draft joint actions implementing a number of the recommendations included in that plan."
"Whilst a great many very interesting things have been said in this debate, I should like to draw attention to a number of other important points that must also be taken into account if we wish to ensure that the European Union takes coherent and coordinated action to combat organized crime."
"The European Union must take wide-ranging, coordinated measures to improve, simplify and speed up international cooperation to prevent organized international criminals from increasingly exploiting the weaknesses and loopholes in the Union's existing judicial system."
"In all these activities, however, the Union must pay constant attention to respect for legal and democratic principles and human rights - above all, fundamental freedoms, as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"In order to ensure this, it is essential to guarantee the democratic and judicial control of the various actions carried out."
"At this point it is appropriate to mention the democratic deficit with regard to these matters which exists in the European Union."
"I need only cite the fact that the European Parliament was not consulted on this action plan, and that constitutes a breach of the treaty."
"Furthermore, I should like to draw attention to the importance of having global and coherent policies in the social, youth and education fields, aimed at preventing organized crime."
"The social dimension of the action plan is too restricted."
"Crime is encouraged above all in areas in which the damage caused in the public domain is not repaired."
"The action plan must address social concerns such as the need for social security, the growth of poverty, the reduced ability of traditional social systems to integrate communities, the mistakes made in urban planning - resulting in shanty towns, slums, etcetera - and the negligence of town and city councils."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to avoid any misunderstandings, let me say that there is clearly a serious threat from international crime, and this will have to be answered by international police cooperation."
"Constitutional procedures, however, require a precise knowledge of what the phenomenon of international crime consists of, and against whom one has to take steps."
"A senior policeman once said that he knew what it was, but he could not really describe it. That is not enough for action to be taken."
"Thus my main criticism is aimed at the entirely imprecise definition of organized crime."
"Mrs Cederschiöld's report describes gang crime and criminal complicity, but it does not mention one main attribute and characteristic: the infiltration of crime into the machinery of state."
"Unclear and imprecise definition makes it possible for any means to be used as soon as things become dangerous."
"Then the term ""organized crime' can be used as a sort of skeleton key to unlock anything, any taboo, any basic right, and thus weaken the system of legal safeguards."
"One popular example of this is Europol, whose power would be extended in the action plan, but without any extension of legal guarantees."
"I do not need to go into democratic and legal safeguards here, or into the fact that there is no sign anywhere of a European Public Prosecutor's Office."
"We emphatically reject the logic of the doctrine concerning equality of weapon power."
"The state cannot and must not use criminal methods and means."
"The end does not justify the means."
"That is a strangulation of basic rights, as critics say when they talk of too many basic laws being unhealthy and of having to try less democracy."
"Democracy and basic rights are fundamental and are not available for disposal, not even in the fight against crime."
"I emphatically support what Mrs Gradin has said."
"I think what is mainly lacking from the action programme is a section on prevention and research into causation."
"Research into causes is the way to dig up crime by the roots, instead of playing about with its symptoms."
"Many thanks to Mrs Gradin, and many thanks to the Council. Many thanks despite all the controversy, or because of all the controversy, to the three rapporteurs - all of them equally, but more equally to Mr Orlando."
"Mr President, may I start by heartily congratulating our three rapporteurs Mrs Cederschiöld, Mr Bontempi and Mr Orlando on the quality of the work they have done."
"This joint action plan points up the inconvenience of not having a restrictive force and of favouring a weak consensus which we all dread to some extent."
"It presents the advantage of establishing long term objectives and this is something we should welcome."
"These texts may also suffer somewhat from the fact that they come to us mainly from Italy, the first country really to have a firm grasp of this whole issue."
"However perhaps we should guard against seeing European reality from a purely Italian perspective."
"These reports largely deal with particular aspects, sometimes excessively, but do not cover certain other aspects adequately."
"The authors have reported extensively on heroin trafficking, tobacco tax fraud, trading in human beings and money laundering, but yet remained silent on murderous political terrorism which is also highly organized crime."
"And that is the crux of the issue: the definition provided is imprecise to the extent that rights to defence and the protection of persons may well be open to threat."
"Certain professions may be very directly involved and I refer here in particular to lawyers and solicitors."
"Special investigation methods will have to be handled with a great deal of care."
"In short we should probably redefine the role of Europol, its area of responsibility and its control system more precisely."
"We fully support Mr Bontempi's report dealing with the judicial network in Europe."
"However on the other reports we remain less convinced for the reasons I have just indicated."
"These technical measures lack political inspiration in our view, and this inspiration is something which may yet be a long time coming."
"Mr President, this morning we are debating a series of reports on the fight against organized crime and legal cooperation in Europe."
"Our group considers that these serious questions relating to the exercise of justice, public freedom and public order are, by definition, a matter for national attention, as justice is a sovereign right."
"And what is more, if justice is to be implemented efficiently and with respect for the rights of individuals it must also remain close to the people."
"The state control level seems to us to be the most suitable."
"It cannot be denied that, faced with increasingly internationalized crime which operates through organized networks and international crime associations, inter-state cooperation is essential and must be strengthened: we need to ensure its efficiency and guarantee to our citizens respect for the established legal order and security."
"The Geneva appeal judges have already stressed this point."
"The reports submitted this morning are frequently of great interest and very high quality, and they present proposals which deserve examination."
"However we deplore the roundabout way in which all too often it is proposed to bring justice and national public order into the domain of the Community."
"This, we feel, endangers the rights of individuals and democracy."
"There is room for discussion on this issue, and the debate should be transparent to the people."
"European criminal law should not be created too hastily. It cannot be set up without formal consultation of the people involved."
"In this respect the draft Amsterdam Treaty and the protocol on subsidiarity indirectly reaffirm the principle which, up to now, was purely based on precedent, that is, the superiority of Community law over all national law, including constitutional law."
"We believe that this problem must be debated before the European people and for these reasons of democracy within the European framework, we cannot vote in favour of all the drafts which have been proposed this morning."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in technical terms the action plan and the reports of the European Parliament represent a positive element in combatting organized crime."
"That being said, I am not convinced that an efficient action plan will be carried out effectively, because the question is not purely technical but also political, moral and even religious."
"There are some obvious contradictions, for example between the political desire to remove frontiers and the desire to combat international crime."
"But in fact it is the dominant ideology in the West above all which is latitudinarian, egalitarian and cosmopolitan and which favours crime."
"We are well aware that nations are quite often complacent even if, out loud, they denounce the Mafia."
"None of this of new."
"Historically we now know that after 1945 in Italy, for example, the Americans facilitated the return of the Mafia."
"The philosopher Hegel wrote that when man eliminates God and regards himself as sovereign, he creates the moral conditions whereby he need no longer respect his fellow man."
"There can be no doubt that this philosophical evolution in the West has led to the current rise in organized crime."
"Without a criticism of the current nature of power, mafia organizations which are in collusion with certain political systems or nations will never truly be combatted, even if we claim otherwise."
"Mr President, can I say that this whole issue we are debating this morning illustrates how little progress we have made as a European Union in the whole field of judicial and home affairs, compared with the great strides that we have made in certain other areas like the economic and financial sectors and many other aspects of life."
"It is now becoming increasingly obvious how important it is that we tackle many of these issues."
"There is for example the question of the custody of children of parents who are citizens of different Member States."
"There is a question of extradition."
"There is the harmonization of judicial penalties which is creating considerable problems."
"There is the question of bail arrangements and many others."
"These things will have to be tackled with urgency and I very much hope that the British presidency starting the beginning of next year will help to make some progress in this area."
"I am concerned too about the plight of people who are arrested and held in custody in Member States of which they are not citizens, pending trial, and who are often held for extraordinarily long periods because of purely technical problems relating to translation of documents or differences between the judicial procedures of individual Member States."
"Of course if they are guilty they should be punished, but they should not be in a worse situation than they would be in their own country."
"Moving on, if I may, to the role of Europol - which is fulfilling a vital role and to which we have to give our support - it is very important that all the Member States should as soon as possible ratify the convention so that we can make progress."
"Organized international criminal organizations have an inbuilt advantage: they do not really bother themselves very much about frontiers, subsidiarity, national judicial differences and so on."
"At the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs some months ago we heard from some of the Italian prosecutors involved in the corruption trials in Italy."
"They mentioned that in getting information about the things they were investigating from other Member States they sometimes found that they had to write dozens of letters and wait months and even years before they got replies."
"Can you imagine the boss of some international criminal organization waiting a year, or writing 26 letters, before he gets a reply from one of his henchmen?"
"I do not think his henchman would last very long if he did not reply to the first letter!"
"We have got to ensure that our law enforcement procedures and systems are able to compete effectively with these international criminal structures that we have today."
"However, I must say that I could not support a greater role including operational actions by Europol until we have in place proper structures for democratic political accountability of its activities - they clearly do not exist at the moment."
"We must also have in place a system for the investigation by an independent police complaints body of any complaints that there may be from citizens of Member States about the activities of Europol."
"Such an independent police complaints body should not be less effective than those existing in the Member States; hopefully it will be more so."
"Finally, can I say that the British Labour Members in this Parliament will be able to support all these reports with the solitary exception of the second report from Mr Orlando, where we will have to abstain."
"We have some problems over the envisaged greater role for the Commission and there are also complications about the legal situation that it proposes as far as the UK is concerned."
"There are problems there that will have to be investigated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1957, when, at the very beginning of the process of European integration, the goal of establishing ever closer union among the peoples of Europe was proclaimed, we have come a long way."
"We have a come a long way, and today we are privileged to have among us an exceptional witness, Mr Fischbach, who, on behalf of the Council presidency - something to which we are unfortunately not accustomed when matters of interest are being debated - can give us the benefit of his long experience - despite his youth - in the Trevi Group."
"We have come a long way since that initial proclamation of the goal of ever closer union, and today the goal set by the Amsterdam Treaty is the progressive establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"However, as previous speakers have already said, the freedom envisaged is far more the free movement of goods and services than the free movement of persons."
"And when it is the free movement of persons it also partly the free movement of criminals; but adequate means to combat the free movement of criminals effectively have not yet been orchestrated."
"Consequently, besides welcoming the new articles 29, 30 and 31 of the Treaty on European Union - in other words, the substantial modification of former articles K.1, K.2 and K.3 - which set the goal of the progressive establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, we must address the following issue: after having achieved a great deal in the economic sphere, we are now getting down to the essence of European integration - a subject which is difficult to tackle: the sphere of values."
"As Mr Bontempi has already said, and Mr Orlando has underlined, we cannot continue to make progress without agreeing on certain issues which, because they affect the fundamental rights of citizens, concern values."
"We have to define organized crime, and, as Mr Pradier rightly pointed out, we have to adapt the fight against organized crime to current circumstances, since it is no longer simply a question of crime organized for economic reasons, but of crime organized for political reasons within the European Union: in other words, terrorism."
"In this sense, with regard to the four joint actions envisaged - leaving aside Mrs Cederschiöld's excellent report, which unfortunately maintains the action plan's ambiguity on this point - the Luxembourg Presidency has had the courage to go beyond the narrow framework of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty still in force and utilize the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"It is not at all a question of bringing these matters into the Community domain, but of addressing the issue of what those values are, and, on that basis, determining how to combat this scourge of European society."
"Mr President, I would first like to say that I am delighted that for once Parliament has been consulted by the Council within the framework of the third pillar."
"As regards the action plan on organized crime, we can only be glad that a coordinated and coherent Community approach is being sought and that cooperation on policing, justice and customs is being strengthened."
"Of course we should encourage the establishment of direct links between the repressive authorities in Member States as a first step on the road to a common justice system."
"However it is important to retain the channel of national entities which work with Europol in order to avoid dispersal of information."
"We must also define precisely the central system of judicial control which has been called for."
"And we must not forget that Europol is first and foremost a police structure."
"However we agree that ultimately the methods of special investigation should be harmonized."
"On the other hand, the majority of my group certainly does not share the idea contained in Amendment No 14 tabled by the Green Group."
"The act of legalizing drug sales would surely not be enough to deprive criminal organizations of the profit of this traffic."
"Tobacco and alcohol are freely available for sale, and yet look at the situation there!"
"If this amendment were to be adopted we would have to abstain from the report as a whole."
"Yet we share Mr Bontempi's fear that the links between organized crime and corruption represent risks for the state of law and for the stability of democratic institutions."
"We are pleased to note that there is recognition of the political importance of the debate on legal cooperation and on putting in place in Europe instruments which permit investigators to establish a direct contact with colleagues from other countries which are faced with the problems associated with organized crime."
"We are supportive of these first steps on the road towards installing practical instruments which aim to improve the efficiency of international legal cooperation."
"On the other hand, the main proposal in the Orlando report on international involvement in combatting organized crime concerns the central role - granted to Member States by the Council - which would have to be attributed to the Commission during the temporary process of evaluation."
"Our group does not accept this and we will abstain on the whole report if this clause is accepted."
"Mr President, the fight against organized crime ranks high on the political agenda in Europe today."
"It is good that we are concentrating our energies on fighting against this kind of cross-border crime which the individual countries do not solve."
"But so long as Europe takes vigorous measures against criminality there is a risk of excesses."
"That applies also to this proposal regarding the criminalization of participation in certain organizations."
"Although such activity is increasing, we must always ensure that the right exists to an effective defence, in other words, a person is innocent until proved guilty and should be held responsible only for what turns out to have been committed deliberately."
"Our group will therefore be supporting Amendment No 18 the Group of the European Radical Alliance."
"We wish to emphasize the principle of the rule of law."
"Clearly, the European Union wishes the countries applying for membership of the Union to respect this principle."
"All the more reason, then, why we must not forget it ourselves; if we did so, we would be extremely poor teachers."
"One part of the principle of the rule of law is also the principle of legality in criminal law, which states that the stipulated penalty should be exact, and that it should be absolutely clear in which situations one is considered to have committed an act so reprehensible that a penalty can be imposed."
"For example, the list in the proposal for joint action of what activities are criminal is not exhaustive and does not, therefore, correctly satisfy the principle of the rule of law."
"I also wonder whether we are not perhaps extending liability under criminal law too far in the committeeʼs Amendment No 12, which means that people are deemed to have committed a criminal offence if they have taken part in a certain type of organization, even if they have not become a permanent or significant part of the structure of that organization."
"If we draw a comparison with existing proposals - for instance, that this interpretation of a criminal offence should apply to people who, for example, have participated in computerized crime - then this may well appear to be an example of excessive criminalization."
"Mr President, the joint programme, four or five reports and all the speakers do offer certain interesting ideas and proposals, but they have a common basis, a common logic."
"They address the problem of organized crime on a national and a European scale but from a one-sided viewpoint, that of the methodology, the philosophy and the practice of repression."
"Mr President, I think this is a waste of effort."
"Organized crime has been discussed here with this methodology for decades and it has not been eradicated, nor has it been seriously reduced. Instead it has grown and taken on gigantic proportions over the period we are now debating."
"The problem, therefore, is to examine the issue jointly and to place greater weight, if you like, on prevention."
"We must recognize that the forcing house in which organized crime germinates is the economic, social and political status quo that prevails in our countries."
"Under these conditions it develops, matures and expands on a European and a national scale."
"Let us not forget that. On this basis the problem must be investigated."
"Nor must we forget that this form of crime is closely linked to police, judicial and administrative authorities and also to political leaderships and governments."
"Let us not forget the power of the drugs cartels, of arms smuggling and immigration, that is, modern-day slavery."
"Mr President, we believe in a combination of the two methods."
"Prevention, first and foremost, and, of course, enforced measures of repression."
"But this must be done with circumspection, since I very much fear that the expansion that has been introduced here will be a pretext for you to create a gaoler of liberties and a guard over the interests of the few, of a tiny speculative minority of vested interests."
"Mr President, Interpol exists in order to combat international crime."
"It is therefore quite remarkable that the Cederschiöld report does not say a single word about Interpol."
"Unfortunately I get the impression that the former head of Interpol, Carl Persson, who is also the former Swedish national police commissioner, was right when he publicly expressed the view a week or so ago that the EUʼs efforts against international crime are, in part, an unnecessary duplication of work."
"Among the demands made in the Cederschiöld report is a call for a centrally determined, harmonized criminal code, that is, a centrally controlled, united state of a sort that that we thought had been consigned to the scrapheap of history."
"This is not even the way to build a federal state - After all, the US criminal code is not totally harmonized."
"There are, of course, some good suggestions in the report, which we shall support."
"We shall, however, be voting against the Cederschiöld report in the final vote, since we are advocates of a serious fight against international crime involving strong cooperation from Interpol."
"However, we do not wish to contribute to making the EU into a centrally controlled police state."
"Mr President, I would like to recall Mr Orlando's attention to the denial of the legal bases of our rights with his arguments for modernization and adaptation to new conditions."
"All our national regulations contemplate the offence of a criminal association while the proposal made by Mr Orlando is to ensure that this offence is recognized without an offence existing."
"This is an open door for the witch hunt, that is, the Europeanization of the Italian legal system, which is a real disaster, as it has put tens of thousands of innocent people in prison for many months and years."
"This is Peronista justice, and would be a disaster for Europe."
"Our group obviously cannot vote for this report proposing a highly convenient way of shuffling off the real problem, which is one of drugs and drugs trafficking that today represents 80 % of the organized crime business."
"We want to draw your attention to the need to legalize this business as a matter of urgency, to wipe out the 80 % of Mafia income."
"I would also like to ask Mr Orlando to report me for belonging to a criminal association."
"Together with Marco Pannella and other colleagues in my party, in recent weeks I have been distributing hashish on the streets of Rome."
"I have done so publicly. I will do it again and a lot of us will do it again because this is the real problem today: legalizing the trade, production and distribution of all drugs."
"Mr President, it is a good thing we are talking today in such detail about organized crime, and we shall have to do so more frequently in future."
"That is because the level of analysis of their own activities is still higher amongst those who organize crime, than amongst those who make pretty speeches on the subject in this House."
"Part of this debate must be that we clarify amongst ourselves what is meant by organized crime."
"I should like to make that clear by using an example."
"Two things may lie behind a pickpocket theft in a city."
"Firstly, it may be a single act by a drug addict needing money to buy drugs."
"That is not organized crime."
"It may also be, however, that a group of specialists has been flown in to work the city systematically, stealing credit cards, and by evening they are sitting in their aircraft again over the Atlantic whilst couriers take the cards to other parts of the world, where they are used."
"For that one can earn about ECU 25, 000."
"The booty is changed into cash through a professional organization of fences, the cash is collected and re-introduced into normal commercial circulation by means of money laundering."
"Here we are talking about organized crime, and the difference must be noted."
"It must also be part of the discussion that we make clear to ourselves that there are interfaces between so-called normal society and organized crime."
"What do I mean by that?"
"What makes the fight against money laundering so difficult is the fact that the techniques used in it differ in no way from those used by tax defaulters when they want to launder their illegal money."
"For this reason there is a bodyguard of people, even in politics, who in the interests of their clients want to prevent stricter laws."
"Those are the people for whom banking secrecy is more important than the secrecy of the confessional, even though they go to church on Sundays."
"We must also include debate on weaknesses."
"One obvious weakness, Mr Council President, is that only now do we have the study group on high-tech criminality and the use of technology in organized crime."
"What world have the ministers been living in?"
"If one knows that organized crime can call on a great deal of money and possesses business structures, then it must be obvious that these organizations can buy in specialists and technical experts and even modern technology."
"And they do just that."
"They have been doing it for years."
"It is high time for us to begin to consider how we can make certain technologies safer from abuse."
"There must be debate like the one we had on dual use products in the armaments sector."
"These were products which could be used for various tasks, and in whose whereabouts, therefore, we had to take an interest."
"I should like to name two examples. The equipments one needs to counterfeit credit cards can be obtained freely on the open market without a licence."
"No one is concerned about where these machines go."
"Whilst we take great care that no one gets hold of the paper needed for printing money, no one pays any attention to plastic money."
"That is a contradiction."
"A second example is that we have a proposal from the Commission on how one should deal with encryption."
"Commerce does not want any limitations."
"When I read this paper I see that commercial interests have completely taken over within the Commission, and security interests take second place."
"We must not allow this."
"Mr President, trade in human beings, paedophilia and child abuse, arms and drugs trafficking, corruption, money laundering and fraud are the characteristics of a civilization of today which has lost its greatest values and is dying, as Paul Valéry said, from the death of its instincts, the very principles that formed the basis of civil life, of relations between human beings."
"A common measure needs to be taken as a matter of urgency indicating the path of our commitment to answering the challenges of the third millennium."
"We need to create a strong, firm basis for fighting the sad present-day phenomena such as slavery, which is organized crime on a world scale, without scruples, that is, attempting to import into Europe today, by means of mass immigration, unfortunate people who add to the fraud with a mockery of repatriation; and paedophilia and child abuse, which reflect a sad reality, burdening weaker categories largely in need of protection with the outlet for instincts that are no longer human."
"Finally, we are trying to make the facts follow the words and the Union is trying to put the system of police cooperation into writing, by attempting to use common criminal policies."
"Unfortunately it is doing so, or trying to do so, without first associating Parliament and without managing to make a suitable choice between intergovernmental cooperation, which in our opinion is now out-of-date, and harmonization of the current criminal laws of the member countries, a road we have yet to follow."
"Organized crime is a real counter-power."
"To be fought effectively, we need to have a valid system of rules recognized by everyone, with legal cooperation running from the intergovernmental sphere to the Community section, establishing effective penalties that include criminal liability and therefore imprisonment and extradition."
"In that way, we would establish a system of fighting it, which can be all the more effective as it is capable of having a system based on absolute values suited to the requirements of the present day."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteurs on these reports."
"As has already been emphasized in this debate, everyone is aware of the difficulty of combatting organized crime, which takes advantage of the free movement of goods, capital, persons and services, as well as technological innovations."
"I believe that the time has come to abandon traditional models of combatting crime, based on antiquated ideas of impermeable borders, and begin to employ methods based on close cooperation between the judicial, police and the customs authorities beyond our national borders."
"We must not forget that it is especially important to the citizens of Europe that their public and private safety be guaranteed, and I therefore believe that it is the European Union's responsibility to combat organized crime by strengthening police and judicial cooperation."
"This is the sense of the action plan's political guidelines, which also stress the need to improve the implementation of the measures already adopted - essentially relating to extradition - by promoting the development of preventive instruments."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on the need to promote and step up the information campaigns on the effects of the activities of criminal organizations, and especially to foster effective measures to tackle conditions which encourage a willingness to support organized crime."
"However, like my colleague, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, who spoke earlier, I profoundly regret the lack of a clear definition of organized crime in the action plan."
"In this regard, we must not forget that the concept of organized crime covers many different types of crime."
"I believe that a full definition of organized crime should comprise - in accordance with the provisions of article K.3(e) of the Amsterdam Treaty - the constituent elements of criminal acts and the penalties in the fields of organized crime, terrorism and drug trafficking."
"Organized criminals commit serious offences. They are dangerous felons who undermine democratic institutions and cause a feeling of insecurity to grow amongst the citizens."
"Organized crime is not only the business of what we might call ""criminal traders' ."
"It involves not only the pursuit of profit and other economic benefits, but also violence - unfortunately including terrorism."
"Nevertheless, I wish to conclude by saying that, overall, this debate represents a significant step forward and gives an important political signal. I would stress that the people of Europe require a response to their desire for an efficient justice system, and we must therefore present them with a body of law which provides an effective solution to the problems of cooperation in the field of combatting organized crime."
"And I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we have taken an important step forward with this action plan, although we still have a long way to go in the fight against organized crime."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur and say that it is not before time that we had this debate in Parliament; but the more we talk, the less we appear to do on issues like this."
"The criminal fraternity throughout the European Union has enormous resources - resources unimaginable even to the European Union budget. They use it for bribery, corruption and the free flow of drugs and laundered money throughout the Community."
"In my own constituency, some years ago, there was no will to tackle the problem of drugs in parts of that inner city constituency."
"It is only in the recent past that the Irish Government has acted to confront the drug barons."
"Before that, people took to the streets."
"People knew who the drug-pushers were."
"They knew which people were laundering money."
"They knew exactly what was going on but there seemed to be no action."
"The government has now introduced the Criminal Assets Bureau."
"By this means they have confiscated property and frozen bank accounts throughout the European Union belonging to the criminal fraternity in Ireland."
"Unfortunately there is another element, the witness protection scheme."
"Some of the hardest criminals are turning witness and are now offered very lenient sentences."
"It has an upside and a downside, the witness protection scheme."
"Quite frankly, I do not think it is a particularly just system because some of the hardest criminals are being released."
"Four or five very hard criminals may be given soft sentences to convict one."
"We must look at that particular aspect of legislation."
"Mr President, organized crime has a great capacity to adapt to the situations to increase its trade."
"At the moment, one of the most lucrative trades is trading in human beings: a trade that, on the one hand, serves to strengthen the networks of these criminal activities and, on the other, is obviously a source of considerable profit."
"Italy is an extremely weak point today, as its coasts are experiencing an unprecedented invasion."
"I am sending a warning to this Parliament, as the Italian government is trying to minimize the situation and is sending its governors around saying that everything is in order so as to obtain the application of the Treaty of Schengen."
"This is not true: the situation is out of control and unmanageable, and the Italian State is also responding with the verbal assurances but is proceeding with substantial measures, such as the laws that actually favour the indiscriminate entry of people into Italian territory."
"These masses of desperate people who are pawns in crime are passing through Italy and invading the whole of Europe, first the Po Valley and then the rest of Europe."
"We therefore need great control and so I ask Parliament to take every possible measure for this phenomenon to be arrested."
"Mr President, the fight against organized crime is the issue on which the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, of which I am chairman, has produced a series of resolutions."
"We always remain extremely critical, but this morning I would like to congratulate our colleagues who have worked together so amicably in such a short time."
"I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Anita Gradin, the President of the Council, and Mr Fischbach, because I think what is happening today represents the completion of their cooperation."
"I hope it is of help to you."
"I understand from the Commissioner, as well as from the minister, that something will actually happen as a result of their contribution."
"So I do not really want to speak at length about everything that is suggested in these resolutions, as they are the people best qualified to do so."
"There are only a few points."
"First, organized crime needs to be fought not only paper, but in the tough real world."
"That is why we have to wait and see what will happen to all those excellent proposals from both the Commission and ourselves."
"Two more remarks."
"Firstly, Mr Bontempi has already talked about it at length, but I would like to draw you attention to it once more, something easily said, but more difficult to do, namely that in everything that we are doing at present to combat crime we have to keep in mind that this must be done in the most responsible way possible in order to ensure that personal protection is guaranteed."
"We must not become a police state, nor a ""police Europe' in which individual liberties and individual protection are sacrificed on the block of collective fear."
"This will require some more thinking on our part."
"The second point concerns the small and diffuse margins between organized crime and business crime."
"Links between these two exist."
"The Mafia infiltrates the circuit of decent politicians, business people, and other honest citizens."
"Business people, politicians who, and we all know this, have links with the Mafia circuit."
"This muddled, grey area is what we have to be aware of."
"It has to be mapped out better than it is at the moment."
"Mr President, I hope Mr Fischbach's exemplary working method will be passed on as a baton to the next Presidency."
"Mr President, in spite of the deficiencies noted by the rapporteur, we must welcome the action plan against organized crime which targets a form of criminality which is on the increase as a result of the development of the internal market."
"The fact is we must not unwittingly allow the free circulation of persons, goods and capital to further a single market of drugs, fraud, prostitution, illegal arms trafficking, trade in human beings, money laundering and much more."
"It seems to me that the harmonization, or even the introduction, in every national criminal code of a legal definition of the concept of organized crime would be a condition sine qua non of the proper implementation of this kind of action plan; how can we effectively fight an ill-defined and poorly identified enemy?"
"Moreover, before we dream up new ways to fight organized crime, would it not be better to exploit the existing means more effectively first?"
"The report quite rightly advocates that priority be given to improving cooperation between Member States which have not yet signed existing agreements on repression and convergence of penal procedures, or which do not exploit all the options offered by these agreements because of national sovereignty considerations."
"In this area where results have been shown to be insufficient, despite increased cooperation, harmonization is essential; in this case we must consider a progressive convergence of criminal law in the Member States and the establishment of minimum standards."
"What is clear is that criminals involved in organized crime are benefiting to the full from the inconsistencies between the different systems and from any reticence to cooperate on the part of Member States."
"So it is high time that the fight against this form of crime which is constantly on the increase was coordinated at a European level; the action plan presented to us is a step in the right direction."
"However two previous reports already stressed the need for increased action: these were the Schulz report on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and the Reding report on the fight against terrorism."
"Despite the interesting progress contained in the Amsterdam Treaty, cooperation between the forces of order and criminal systems is still far from satisfactory, because all too often developments come up against the obstacle of national sovereignty, and we forget that the absence of effective cooperation at EU level does not serve the people, only the criminals. Only when we realize that the number of national problems which can only be resolved at European level is on the increase will we really be in a position to fight organized crime effectively."
"Mr President, one minute's speaking time is not exactly a long time for discussing three or four reports, so I have to limit myself to one single thought."
"My experience in my own country is that government capitulates systematically to criminals."
"In large cities like Brussels there are streets and areas where the police is no longer allowed to take action, where even public transport no longer goes, and where the remaining decent citizens, those who do not have the means to flee, are at the mercy of the law of the jungle."
"My thought is therefore the following: when government does not have the courage or the wish to tackle such small local problems, how will it have the courage to tackle international crime?"
"Briefly, the principal problem in the fight against crime is by no means that the European Community authority is still in its infancy - and I do not advocate such a communal approach, but merely more effective cooperation between Member States - the problem is a question of mentality and the political will to combat crime."
"I believe that at present this political will and mentality is sadly nowhere near strong enough in Europe, while it does exist in a small city state like Singapore, where they have been successful in stamping out crime."
"Mr President, I would like to make a few brief remarks on the valuable work carried out by the rapporteurs who have diligently illustrated their work."
"The first thing I would like to point out is how subjects of this kind, particularly the approach we give them, are directly connected with more general questions we dealt with yesterday, during the debate on the decision to be made on the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"In pursuing general arguments, we are always sensitive to issues of political integration of the European Union, but it is when we have problems such as this that we show our capacity and real will to proceed in the direction of the political unity of the Union."
"From this point of view, I think that the work carried out is so important but also requires more courage, and I believe this opinion is shared by the government of my country."
"Cooperation between the Member States is no longer sufficient; we need to find courage in internal security policies, the fight against crime and other important issues such as taxation, proceeding towards harmonization, towards a more uniform set of rules that enables us to deal with and specifically solve the actual problems."
"I think this is the difficulty that needs to be worked on, by finalizing the texts and working to ensure that our social analysis of and decisions on these phenomena are accompanied in the near future by specific harmonization measures as well."
"Having said that, I would like to add what I believe to be the real priorities."
"We should try to make an effort to identify the subjects we can deal with at European level and separate them from other issues that can be resolved by cooperation between the Member States."
"I wish to mention three: the first affects us directly and is the fight against Community fraud."
"The legislation needs to be harmonized in this sector."
"Only three Union countries have included Community fraud in the criminal code."
"As we always make so many graded lists about fraud, we will start by recalling those who have not yet fulfilled their duties from this point of view."
"The second issue relates to the fight against crime in the sector of trading in people, or clandestine immigration."
"We cannot make a caricature of this problem as Mr Formentini did, because the problem is now a general one."
"Crime initially related to cigarettes, then drugs and now drugs and human beings."
"The other issue is that of money laundering."
"These are the three major issues on which we can work with a little more courage, even than in the important work carried out by the rapporteurs."
"Mr President, corruption threatens society, organized crime threatens society. Added dangers accrue, therefore, from the interplay between corruption and organized crime."
"We in the Freedom Party have always made a stand against corruption of any kind in Austria."
"We have made a name for ourselves for that."
"So we basically welcome the action plan - I do especially in my capacity as a judge in the criminal court - but most particularly the initiative to create throughout the Union a criminal code to combat active and passive bribery, even within private commercial activities."
"International development and the annual report on fraud make quite clear the need for relevant regulations within the criminal codes of Member States, and for international prosecution procedures."
"We do have ideological reservations, however, on the indictment of artificial persons and in contrast to Mr Bontempi we believe that for democratic reasons a treaty between nations would be preferable."
"Mr President, I hope this discussion can be received by public opinion for what it is, beyond the technical, legal or relevant issues."
"It is a coordinated response we wish to make to the need for safety and legality demonstrated by our citizens, and it is a common undertaking we are making today, with this discussion, to combat crime so that it cannot benefit from our system of rules and democracy and then place it in crisis."
"It is an honest reply because this discussion leads us away from temporary uncoordinated measures and we are responding with an action plan: 30 recommendations, some of which have already been converted into specific common actions, like pieces of a common design."
"This is the meaning of a choice that is strategic and also an undertaking that can be measured and assessed."
"The gaps and limitations of this design also need to be mentioned, however."
"It seems to me that there is a lack of a more definite harmonization, of a clear definition of organized crime, which makes everything weaker, not so much because we are not managing to define crime but because it is difficult to define the organization."
"It should be recalled, however, as pointed out by our rapporteur and then taken up by Commissioner Gradin, that there is a weakness in identifying the causes and all the strategies of prevention."
"We should also do this to answer those who came to talk to us in the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"I mentioned an honest and, I would add, a balanced answer."
"The balance should be sought and assessed particularly in this Parliament, a balance between the need for an effective fight against crime and the need for this fight not to injure the fundamental rights of citizens."
"It is not a comparison, as recalled by Mr Bontempi, but a construction of a system of legality."
"It is a balance that should always be maintained, and the means we are approving today, from a reciprocal assessment to points of contact, to letters rogatory, are means of achieving legality."
"Being Italian, and as Italy has been brought up several times, I can only say one thing: we do not want to export the emergency to Europe, or laws, or refugees, but we believe that with effective cooperation we will all be the winners, including Italy, in this sector."
"Mr President, Mrs Colombo Svevo is right and I want to say the same: an honest and balanced answer, a virtuous course that begins this morning, a course of cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"And here I wish to express my appreciation to Minister Fischbach and Commissioner Gradin."
"An honest and balanced answer that seeks to bring together the requirements of European cooperation and respect for individual national regulations: first, respect for rights, correct proceedings, fair proceedings, rapid proceedings, and the presumption of innocence; secondly, the identification of an organized crime: participation in the crime should be direct and certainly personal."
"An organized crime consists in getting organized to commit a crime."
"We are here for that reason, because otherwise we would have no reason to talk about a criminal organization."
"One further reference to the quotation, already maintained and contained in an amendment as well, relating to the phenomenon of the collaborator, the terrorist."
"The text drawn up by the Council and the Committee on Civil Liberties does not refer to collaborators and terrorists, because we consider that to be a very complex, controversial issue burdened with so many ambiguities that it cannot be dealt with just in an amendment."
"For this reason, I think it is inappropriate and wrong to include this issue in a framework which needs to remain organized, honest and balanced, as Mrs Colombo Svevo says."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this debate there will be an opportunity to demonstrate that organized crime can only be fought successfully within a common European legal environment."
"The proposed joint action for construction of a European judicial network points to this and we support it."
"What we need is a sort of legal internal market."
"What we are seeing is a legal Europe puffing along behind a commercial Europe."
"All limits have been lowered or already largely removed for internal European trade."
"Legal limits, however, are being defended with great vigour."
"This is leading to products, services and capital being freely exchanged, but the legal instruments for safeguarding commercial trading are being blocked at the frontiers."
"Why is this so?"
"Why is not actually possible to deliver direct a payment order by a German court in France?"
"Why cannot an Italian witness be directly summonsed to appear before a Belgian court?"
"Apparently national sovereignty prohibits this."
"I do not want to be misunderstood."
"I support the existence of a national state and we will need it for a considerable time as an organizational model for the completion of public tasks."
"But national sovereignty must serve the interests of the citizen, in this case the protection of his rights and freedoms."
"Where it does not do this, it must be examined."
"If from time to time national sovereignty is quoted to counter legal communication, then that is simply a distorted picture of national sovereignty and has actually nothing to do with it. It is more a sign of backwoods crankiness."
"Sometimes one can even detect evidence of legal racism."
"Foreign legislation is opposed because it is foreign and not one's own."
"Yet the constitutional status of all Member States in the European Union is fixed and securely anchored."
"There is, therefore, absolutely no reason why Germans should not be summonsed before a British court, or why verdicts should not be delivered directly."
"We need workable solutions to this."
"Workable solutions must be found."
"This would happen under the European judicial network, which we therefore emphatically support."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Madam Commissioner and ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation, the kind words and a very comprehensive piece of work."
"Time does not allow me to summarize the entire debate."
"I shall therefore focus on only a few points which I think need to be emphasized."
"One point relates to the Community: the preventive measures which Commissioner Gradin addressed and which have also been touched upon by several others, and the social angle."
"These points were not included in the High Level Groupʼs document, but I have incorporated them into my report and would like to emphasize them."
"To Mr Gahrton, who has not even shown enough interest to stay on, I would like to say briefly that I think he is using this chamber for domestic policy debates."
"I do not even consider his oversimplified contribution worthy of an answer in this connection."
"I would, however, like to have that included in the Minutes."
"To Mrs Thors, who is unfortunately not here, I would like to say that the report takes her concerns fully into account."
"In fact, it addresses precisely the points that she was calling for, that is, motive, intention and active participation with regard to criminal organizations."
"They are therefore included."
"Finally, I would like to say briefly that it is the excise duties and contributions that we shall take with us from this debate."
"These questions must be brought into focus."
"We cannot allow taxpayersʼ money to end up in the pockets of criminals."
"I hope that the debate results in our continuing henceforth to pursue with greater vigour and intensity - and working more closely with the Commission and the Council - what Nassauer termed a ""legal internal market'"
"Mr President, to conclude this discussion, I wish to raise three points."
"First, it is important that this formal sitting was chosen for the beginning of a new phase in the work of the European Union and also Parliament in the fight against crime."
"I believe the discussion has been very useful and has offered us conditions for correcting the delays and taking more useful action in the future."
"Secondly, there seems little evidence to me that the introduction of new instruments includes regulations other than Italian ones."
"I would like to point out that the criminalization of private corruption, which is an important aspect of innovation, is a very important aspect; it does not exist in many regulations, it does not exist in our regulations and so its introduction shows that Europe is working through the best experiences acquired over the years."
"Finally, I would like to recall that keeping the balance mentioned by Mrs Colombo Svevo between the requirements of safety and the requirements of freedom is something sacrosanct, and it is something else to discredit instrumentally and with entirely false information, an experience that has made it possible to combat corruption and the Mafia in our country effectively."
"I ask everyone, if we want to take this seriously, to accept the balance and not the instrumentalization."
"Mr President, like Mr Fischbach I wish to express my thanks for the good and wide-ranging debate."
"To save time, I shall largely agree with the comments made by Mr Fischbach, so that we also manage to finish the next debate this morning."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow."
"Cooperation priorities in justice and home affairs"
"The next item is the report (A4-0367/97) by Mr Nassauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft Council Resolution laying down the priorities for cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs for the period from 1 January 1998 to the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam (10021/1/97-C40426/97-97/0910(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on justice and internal political priorities has now reached a rather different plane, because we are conducting it not just on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty, which is still valid, but with the draft Amsterdam Treaty in mind."
"For this reason the proposed resolution of the Council, quite understandably, uses the effective date of the Amsterdam Treaty as the deadline for this list of priorities."
"At the same time, Mr President of the Council, I want to call for an examination of whether we could not keep to the usual one year deadline for checking these priorities, should it turn out that the effective date of the Amsterdam Treaty were to be delayed."
"For, as the previous debate has shown, this field is of increasing importance for the whole European Union."
"The first conclusion must be that work in this field must be intensively continued, regardless of the threat from the Amsterdam Treaty It will, however, have difficulty keeping the new legal instruments of the Amsterdam Treaty directly in its sights, because it is possible that modifications will have to be made after the effective date."
"You, Mr President of the Council, have involved the European Parliament in good time and very fairly in your procedures, and this needs to be emphasized."
"You made the welcome suggestion of hearing the European Parliament as a matter of principle during the earliest dealings on the Amsterdam regulations, and not just during the most important elements of the work."
"We have certainly appreciated that."
"I must add a comment addressed to you, however, when I say that we shall have to make some effort so to organize our deadlines that we do not delay the progress of procedures."
"I want to make a second comment. Taken together with Amsterdam, we will have a substantial increase in legislation."
"I think we will have to pay more attention to the quality of our legislative texts than has been the case in the past."
"For instance, when I look at Parliament's amendments to legislative texts, I see that they lead in most cases to an almost dramatic expansion of texts which were originally shorter and more precise. This arises from many good political intentions, but leads to the texts becoming lengthy and confusing, and this is on the increase at European level."
"In short, with this procedure we shall add to the flood of standards and the incomprehensibility of the law, something we otherwise complain about."
"We must take great care to see that our legislative texts are shorter and more precise."
"I should like to turn my attention to a few details in the list of priorities."
"Mr President of the Council, it would be a good thing if a new list of priorities were to make some mention of what happened to the old ones."
"A little success rate control would be helpful for all concerned."
"One would be able to write in what had been achieved, and what had not, and the reasons why something had not been achieved."
"In this case, unfortunately, we have had cause to complain repeatedly that freedom of individuals in the European Union has not been achieved to the extent laid down in the treaties."
"The Commission has meanwhile done its homework in the form of the Monti Proposals."
"It is now up to the Council to find an answer to the Commission's proposals."
"My third point is on the judicial network we have been dealing with."
"Up to now it has been the only legislative expression of the area of freedom, security and law that we all aspire to."
"It must be possible to extend this network with appreciable benefits for our citizens."
"Europol comes into being next year in all probability, and will be able to start its work."
"Development work on the next stage of Europol must not then be delayed."
"We ask that of you, Mr President of the Council."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency for its excellent cooperation."
"I am not sure if one can really talk of priorities in this list."
"It is rather more a collection of bits and pieces, and something of a contrast with the actual results in the Council."
"It is true that in the field of justice the Council's aims will have to be more ambitious."
"They must keep step with the development of the internal market if we are really to create an area of freedom, security and law, as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Why indeed should parties, witnesses, defendants and experts not be summonsed as though we were one state?"
"Why should parties not be required to appear personally as though we were one state?"
"Why not, indeed?"
"Let me deal with another point, concerning the duration and cost of cross-border court cases."
"There was a study done on this by the Commission in 1995."
"The cost and duration of cross-border legal disputes lead to the fact that we are faced with a straightforward denial of legal rights."
"It is in practice pointless to initiate a case on the other side of a frontier because of the costs and the time taken."
"I see a real priority here, because it has become an obstacle to the internal market. Let me point out another thing."
"It is exceptionally unfortunate that according to the Amsterdam Treaty on this subject of cooperation within the civil law the Intergovernmental Conference only allows Parliament a joint right of decision where visa policy is concerned, and then only in five years time."
"Considering the poor results achieved by the Council in this field so far, that is difficult to understand."
"I am sure the European Parliament could participate in our achieving very much better results."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I share the Mr Nassauer's view of this because of the initial position following the Amsterdam Council, and because of the agreement by Mr Fischbach, which I already mentioned this morning, it can be hoped that successive presidencies will keep Mr Fischbach's word. I hope they will say that they will apply Amsterdam and carry out obligatory consultation with the European Parliament."
"This would require of the European Parliament a consequent and comprehensive reform of its rules of procedure, or we shall be unable to keep pace with our workload."
"You expressed that very politely, Mr Nassauer."
"I will put it in my own way a little more bluntly."
"Part of what we produce here could well be left alone."
"That does not alter the fact, however, that the priority list - Mr Rothley called it a collection for bits and pieces - has no apparent theme."
"I have to say that I get the impression that the Council did not really quite know where to set its main emphasis in the priority list."
"For that reason I shall first deal with the fact that the most important thing is what can be activated from amongst the policy areas covered by the ratification procedures which are about to end."
"Now let me return to Europol, Mr Fischbach."
"Here I must emphatically contradict you."
"I have a very high regard for you and I know that you are a constant defender of the constitutional state, but you cannot stand here and say on the subject of the immunity agreement that, just because it still has no operational authority, we can simply leave the question of immunity to you."
"Put another way, that is saying that when it has obtained the operational authority, then we shall take it away from it again."
"Or that is how I interpret it."
"Unfortunately you do not have a microphone, so I shall repeat what you have just said: ""I did not say that' ."
"Thank you, Mr Minister, that is what I wanted to hear."
"Now let me say that we no longer need to give the police this immunity, and I shall say why not."
"The collection of data is also a violation of citizens' basic freedoms."
"They can already do that."
"I must tell you that wherever police forces exist, Mr Nassauer, and you are a former Minister of the Interior, wherever police forces exist there have to be two things in parallel."
"When a police force is created with the right of interference in a citizen's freedoms, then there must be a legal guarantee and parliamentary control."
"These do not exist here."
"Now let me add that where the collection of data has to do with personal habits, race, origins, or sexual preferences, Europol officers can go ahead and collect all of it. The individual citizen affected by Europol's activities must have the right to knowledge of that data and the right to control its availability."
"So, if you are looking for a priority, Mr Fischbach, I would recommend to the Council that it withdraws the immunity regulation in its current form as quickly as possible."
"Furthermore, may I quote Mr Nassauer's report, which was passed by this Parliament with a large majority: we, as the European Parliament, require that all accompanying regulations on Europol be submitted to the European Parliament for consultation before they enter the ratification procedure."
"A start can be made straight away with the immunity regulation."
"You quite rightly said in the priorities that the policy on asylum would become to a dramatic extent the subject of debate in European politics over the next few years."
"I ask the Council, therefore - and I say this emphatically on behalf of our group, because we are giving asylum policy a leading position in our work - to prepare, as early as next year, specific ideas about how it will deal with the harmonization of asylum policy, both technically and in content."
"I should like to say about content, that I assume - at least for as long as you, Mr Fischbach, are Council President - that the Council will not succumb to the temptation of believing that asylum policy can be devolved to Europe, simply because it is a delicate and touchy subject at national level which people would like to be rid of at that level, in order for minimum standards to be yet further reduced, something not achieved at national level."
"That is an asylum policy which we will not support."
"Mr President, when we are talking about the priority schedule for justice and home affairs, we have to say that in this area many decisions have been made over the past few years."
"Absolutely."
"However, there is a serious problem about the decisions which have been taken."
"For a large part it is fake legislation, imitation legislation."
"They are not directives as we know them in the first pillar of the European Union, but rather recommendations and such like."
"The problem here is that it is completely unclear to what extent the measures taken have been implemented nationally."
"Mr President, the Council and the Commission need to draw up a report on the progress of the implementation of Union level decisions into national legislation."
"I believe a report of this kind should be discussed in this Parliament as well."
"Mr President, many decisions have been taken."
"Many decisions have also not been taken, including extremely important ones."
"Looking at asylum and immigration policy, I ask the Council and the Commission: where is the decision on sharing the burden of displaced persons fairly?"
"Before we know it Algeria might explode, and no decisions will have been taken on such an issue."
"Where is a proper strategy of the external border of the European Union?"
"It has been the subject of discussion for six or seven years."
"And priority schedules or not, it is time decisions were taken."
"Mr President, more and more discussions are taking place about the establishment of a European Magistrate's office, and of public prosecutors at European level; they would for example supervise Europol and so on."
"This does not strike me as very desirable, as the supervision of Europol should be political."
"My final question is - and with it I conclude my remarks - the Council and the European Commission prepared to draft a report on the establishment of a European Magistrate's office, including the advantages and disadvantages?"
"Mr President, this report, like the earlier reports, expresses some technicalities that one can endorse."
"I am broadly in agreement with what Mr Rothley said on these points."
"But the most important thing for me is that this is a snapshot of a process of development."
"It is, so to speak, the ECʼs route from a Common Market to Union law - or, as Mr Nassauer put it during the earlier debate, a legal internal market."
"It is an integration process which - and this is a fact that has largely been overlooked in this debate - involves dismantling the national institutions and legal traditions on which Denmarkʼs law-governed society, for example, is built."
"It is evident both in Mr Nassauerʼs report and in the earlier reports, and the keystone can, of course, be found in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Of course, the proposal in question only applies to the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"And page 6 of the report states that ""the Treaty of Amsterdam Treaty makes substantial changes to the existing third pillar of the Treaty on European Union and places the cooperation of Member States in the fields of justice and home affairs on a new legal footing' ."
"The set of priorities we are referring to now is, so to speak, an anticipation of this, and what we regard as the end-point in this development process - in viewing it as a snapshot - is, of course, also described quite clearly in Mrs Cederschiöldʼs report. I regard this report as a bogeyman, but it is heartening for others (Commissioner Gradin, for example), in that it advocates a harmonization of the Member Statesʼ criminal codes."
"This is actually the end-point of this development process - and, what is more, it is taking place without the national democracies having the opportunity to react."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasize one fundamental point, and that is that a very important part of the quality of any democracy is measured by the degree of open control that can be exercised over the police and the penal institutions."
"I can state that on a whole series of key points, these proposals, these priorities - not to mention the earlier reports - break with this fundamental principle, for instance the Europol Convention, which entrusts control only to this Parliament (and not to the national parliaments) and to the European Court of Justice - not to the national courts, as require, for example, in the Danish Constitution."
"Mr President, I think I already overran my time earlier."
"You should have interrupted me."
"I am sorry, I was not paying attention."
"I just wanted to say that of course I am delighted with this excellent report from Mr Nassauer."
"It is a simple indicative programme, ladies and gentlemen, not a definitive one."
"From it you can tell that the Council wishes to exert all the pressure it can to achieve results which are as firm and conclusive as possible using a maximum of actions, plans and initiatives."
"So we must work with both accuracy and determination to achieve these results."
"And this is what this programme actually means."
"We have achieved quite a few of the points from the 1996 programme, which was the first one, albeit biennual."
"I hope that this one will not go further than January 1999 when we all hope that the Amsterdam Treaty will finally be ratified."
"But please do not hold it against the Council that it wishes to do too much, we have good intentions and I think that tribute should be paid to our efforts in taking this step."
"Mr President, the basic principle is free movement of persons within the European Union, but many people fear that this will become free movement for criminals and swindlers."
"That is why the third pillar was added within the context of the Maastricht Treaty."
"My task within the Commission is therefore to work towards realizing the free movement of our citizens."
"So I welcome the fact that we are having a special debate about Mr Nassauerʼs report on the priorities for judicial and domestic questions."
"The aim is that we should in future be better able to handle the problems that we encounter."
"Among the areas I am thinking about are refugees, organized crime, the drugs trade, the slave trade involving women and children, and fraud, corruption and effective police cooperation."
"When the new Amsterdam Treaty comes into force we shall receive new, increased opportunities for cooperation."
"This is an important step forward."
"The Commission, the European Parliament and the Court will all be given a stronger role in connection with the third pillar."
"This is important in order to counter the anxiety felt by the citizens with regard to the threats to their safety and security."
"Increased openness, greater effectiveness and better democratic and judicial control are necessary in order that people should know that this affects them."
"In the short term the Commission will complete the work under the Maastricht Treaty."
"This includes the proposals that are now being discussed within the Council of Ministers."
"Here I would like draw attention in particular to the Commissionʼs proposal regarding admission, that is, accession, temporary protection, measures against corruption, the fight against synthetic drugs, the fight against the slave trade involving women and the fight against sexual exploitation of children."
"The Commission is, of course, from now on also actively working to ensure that the plans of action against organized crime that we have just debated are carried out effectively."
"In this connection I would also like to draw attention to the important cooperative projects that we have initiated through the long-term working programmes, for example, Grotius, which is leading to increased cooperation between judge and prosecution, and thus cooperation within the judicial system;"
"Sherlock, which of course is aimed at cooperation with a view to preventing forged documents; and Oisin, which is aimed at bringing about cooperation between police forces."
"Each of these programmes plays its own part in increasing legal security within Europe."
"We also have the Stop programme, which involves cooperation between authorities in the Member States with a view to combatting the slave trade in women and children, and the Daphne programme, which gives support to voluntary organizations engaged in the fight against sexual exploitation of, and violence against, women and children."
"Both of these programmes have met with a very big response."
"Later today, Parliament will discuss Mrs Zimmermannʼs report on the Odysseus programme, which is aimed at those who work with migration and asylum issues."
"As proposed in the Nassauer report, the Commission will continue to take new initiatives with the aid of the new instruments that we now have at our disposal under the Maastricht Treaty."
"I am preparing five different initiatives: one regarding enforcement of court rulings, one on legal aid, one on missing children and sexual exploitation of children, one on asylum procedures, which is missing from this debate, and one on credit and payment card fraud."
"Both I myself and the Council will, of course, be sure to consult Parliament about these reports."
"In parallel with our ongoing work under the current treaty, we are also preparing ourselves for the day when the new Amsterdam Treaty comes into force."
"This work has already begun."
"One of the questions that must be answered concerns the integration of the Schengen Agreement into Union cooperation."
"As a result, the Unionʼs regulatory framework will be extended, even if the fields of responsibility within the third pillar are not expanded as such."
"There are concrete agreements within Schengen that as yet have no equivalent within the EU."
"This has two important consequences."
"First, the Union will operate within a broader field of activity than at present."
"Secondly, the expanded regulatory framework will impose greater demands regarding safety and freedom for the eastern and central European countries which are now preparing themselves for membership."
"Schengen will be one more dimension that needs to be incorporated in the coming negotiations."
"Two working groups are now fully occupied with the practical preparations."
"One group is devoting itself to integration within the Union work and the other to the matter of what form the cooperation with Norway and Iceland is to take."
"In the long term, the most important question will be how we are to take up the growing challenges in the area of justice and home affairs."
"One of these concerns the development of internationally organized crime within Europe."
"The most important consideration here is to meet the citizensʼ demands that we should combat the crime threat effectively."
"The Europol Convention will be an important tool in this connection."
"The aim is that the convention should be ratified before the end of the year."
"I also hope that the Member States push on with the ratification of the extradition convention and the convention on measures against deception and fraud."
"At the same time, like the committee, I regret the fact that the Hague Convention on judicial scrutiny in connection with cross-border disputes has not been ratified by all Member States."
"As I said in my introduction, the Amsterdam Treaty will mean that cooperation in justice and home affairs will be raised to a new level."
"The treaty includes an ambitious five-year work programme that looks into how questions of border control, migration and asylum are to be integrated with the first pillar."
"Questions relating to the police and tariffs, as well as to criminal and civil law, remain within the third pillar."
"But even in these areas, cooperation will be developed through framework decisions, and so on."
"In my opinion, a careful review is needed of the new treatyʼs consequences for justice and home affairs issues."
"I have therefore set in motion a study which I propose to present to the Council of Ministers and Parliament in the form of a wide-ranging report."
"I hope that this report, like a White Paper, will serve as an important basis for a full debate on how we are to bring about a Europe that is characterized by freedom, safety and justice."
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"In principle, the vote ought to take place now, but if not it will take place this evening."
"Votes"
"Mr President, there are actually three oral amendments, which I now propose to read, agreed with the rapporteur and the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, in order to clarify several aspects of the budget and financial control."
"The first amendment is an addition to article 4 paragraph 2 which reads, ""in the event of recourse to subcontractors, the latter shall be selected by tender, organized pursuant to the current financial provisions' . It is therefore a general precaution."
"The second amendment is an addition to article 7 relating to cooperation with the CEECs and Cyprus and reads, ""the costs of such participation shall be added to the appropriation for that programme' ."
"The third amendment, which supplements article 9, relates to the fact that, since it is a five-year programme, it covers two different financial budgets."
"It is therefore worded as follows: ""this financial appropriation will be partly covered by the 1993-99 financial perspectives' ."
"I apologize, but the approval of this measure has required very tight deadlines."
"However, it has been possible to incorporate these three oral amendments and thus subsequently amend the measure with the consent of the Committee on Budgets, if Parliament will accept this."
"Madam President, as I cannot see the Socialist Group coordinator at present, I wish to say, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that I am unable to accept these oral amendments tabled at the last minute."
"The vice-chairman of the Committee on Budgets submitted these amendments and during discussion of them in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy there was consensus."
"It concerns budgetary specifications."
"I urge that this be approved."
"It was due to an oversight during the vote in committee."
"Madam President, after the committee submitted Amendment Nos 3 and 14, the Council amended the wording to which they related. I therefore consider the aforesaid amendments to be superseded, accepting the final wording proposed by Council."
"Are there any objections to Amendment Nos 3 and 14 being considered as null and void from now on?"
"As there are no objections, this will be the case."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"A corrigendum is to be made to all the language versions."
"Also, Amendment Nos 6, 7, 10 and 11 have been cancelled."
"Madam President, there have been a certain number of corrigenda, but they do not go far enough."
"For example, Amendment No 21 by my group was altered in a completely wrong way to the extent that it now says the opposite of what we intended."
"At best, it would certainly be completely incomprehensible."
"There are also a number of translation problems in the French version."
"Our Amendment 20 has not kept its original meaning at all; in its current form it would add to Mr Orlando's argument and this is completely at odds with our own argument."
"There are other instances - I could go on."
"I therefore propose deferring this report to the next part-session as we cannot vote on it as it stands today."
"Mr Dupuis, are you making this proposal on behalf of your group?"
"Yes, Madam President."
"I would like to hear the opinion of the rapporteur."
"Madam President, I believe we expressed our appreciation this morning to the Luxembourg Presidency and the Commission for enabling Parliament to assess such an important wording before the 4 and 5 December part-session."
"It would be really odd for us to return this report now."
"I therefore insist that we proceed as requested by the committee."
"I think that clarifies things."
"I will put Mr Dupuis' request to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request) I can assure Mr Dupuis that we will check all the language versions very closely in order to avoid any inconsistencies."
"Madam President, thank you for rejecting the amendment by Mr Dupuis."
"The amendments by the Group of the European Radical Alliance in any case follow a completely different path from Mr Orlando's."
"But before we vote I would again like to raise the question of the many linguistic corrections."
"There is a reason for this."
"The Council was kind enough to send us these texts for consultation in advance of the Amsterdam Treaty, but with a very short deadline, which posed a considerable time problem for the numerous translations."
"But when the Council then did what followed, there was no way of coping."
"First, it sent us a text. We are very thorough in our consultation procedure, but in the meantime the Council amended its own text without consulting us or waiting for our views."
"That is an impossible procedure."
"Parliament really cannot be treated like that."
"I must ask therefore ask the President to report to the thunderous applause of this House to the Council."
"Thank you very much."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Schulz."
"I would have liked the Council to have heard your comments."
"Unfortunately that was not the case, but we will be happy to forward them for their attention."
"Madam President, with regard to Amendment No 12, I wish to point out that after the vote on the amendment the committee experienced a certain amount of confusion, so the Council drew up a wording that seems more correct to me."
"I therefore report the committee's rejection of the amendment as it had been draftedincorrectly and might lead to possible legal criticism, to quote an expression used this morning."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"It is very satisfying to note that the Conciliation Committee has succeeded in arriving at a sensible and particularly satisfactory compromise between the Council and Parliament in connection with the adoption of this Directive."
"It is most gratifying that both Council and Parliament have from the outset been in agreement that a high level of protection should be given to personal data within an area such as the telecommunications sector, where technological development is advancing extremely rapidly."
"Nevertheless, Parliament has in the conciliation procedure been able to introduce an even greater level of protection than the Council had originally desired."
"One example that can be cited is the extension of the Directive to embrace legal entities."
"The provisions relating to monitoring and recording of telephone conversations have also been significantly improved in the conciliation text."
"It should be emphasized that the proposed Directive is an extremely important legislative act that deserves full support."
"Secchi report (A4-0344/97)"
"It is not possible to determine when it would be best for the EU to introduce fully harmonized regulations on VAT, but there is no doubt that if such a harmonization is to take place, the Member States must be extremely well prepared."
"The Fiscalis programme is therefore a necessary initiative, which means, among other things, that national public officials acquire a thorough knowledge of Community law."
"This knowledge is absolutely essential if these public officials are to continue to provide the best possible service to the citizens."
"Another aspect of this question concerns the many advantages that it is hoped to achieve through formal cooperation between the Member States in the tax sector as a whole."
"The Fiscalis programme is aimed at creating a solid and sensible basis for future harmonization of VAT and other taxes."
"This does not, however, mean that the Member States are at this point in time committing themselves to any set time-frame for such harmonization."
"The Fiscalis programme, which aims to establish coordinated European actions in support of the individual national systems of indirect taxation, is an innovation in the European tax policy."
"In fact, not only does Fiscalis aim to harmonize and coordinate the existing tax system and even ensure uniform operation of the tax authorities with a view to adopting the final VAT regulations but, as rightly pointed out by Mr Secchi, it should provide a means of indicating the requirements and difficulties encountered by some national authorities in performing their duties and should be able to transfer the winning experiences implemented in other Member States for the same problems."
"As mayor of an Italian municipality and aware of all the actions aimed at improving the efficiency of the public authorities, I appreciate the European Commission's decision to consider the training of human resources to be a priority objective of the programme and, agreeing with Mr Secchi, I believe it advisable for training to be provided by exchanges arranged between officials of different tax authorities."
"I also agree fully with the rapporteur on the need to set up a network of cooperation between the national institutes and academies operating in the taxation training sector."
"I offer my congratulations to Mr Secchi and fully agree with his report."
"W.G. van Velzen report (A4-0346/97)"
"Numbering is one of the most conspicuous aspects of telephony and is therefore an area that concerns the consumer very directly."
"At Parliamentʼs request, the Commission has proposed a very workable and sensible modification of the Interconnect Traffic Directive."
"Number portability is an extremely significant area and it is important that a system should be introduced quickly that ensures the transparent, fair and objective allocation of numbers to the fixed lines."
"The rapporteur is absolutely right to emphasize that the same policy must be introduced, with relevant regulations, in the mobile communications networks."
"The necessary arrangements must be introduced as early as possible so as to have the desired effect and to give the operators the time to carry out changes and adjustments."
"It is therefore not possible to go along with the Commissionʼs view that the time is not yet right for regulations on number portability for the mobile networks."
"I therefore give the report my full support."
"Cederschiöld report(A4-0333/97)"
"We are of the opinion that the report deals with an extremely important area for the future work of the European Union."
"In making this statement on our voting, we wish to emphasize our view that in a number of areas, the report contains more far-reaching harmonization requirements than can objectively be regarded as justified in the light of the plans of action for combatting organized crime."
"Among other things, we wish to draw attention to our doubts with regard to the following requirements made in the report:"
"there should be a harmonization of provisions in criminal law (point 12), -a public prosecutor should be introduced at European level (point 35), -in the absence of a more precise definition of the already evident need for greater public control and inspection, Europolʼs position should be expanded in relation to the national police forces (various points)."
"Mrs Cederschiöld's report deals with the action plan to combat organized crime."
"This plan was drafted by the High Level Group at the urgent request of the European Commission."
"What the group has done is in itself praiseworthy, and considering the way it is implemented by the Council, it appears to be effective."
"Yet the plan is not always sufficiently clear."
"A strong point of criticism from the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, is that no clarity has been established on the question whether crime will be combatted by harmonization of the definitions of the most important punishable crimes, or by the system of improved cooperation between the Member States, whilst keeping intact the differences between national judicial systems."
"In the plan, this choice is not made."
"This is also where the problem lies."
"Although the report aims for a pragmatic approach, the European Parliament's wish for the harmonization of criminal justice and the establishment of one large European judicial area resounds from it."
"It is obvious that with this choice we would be deeply encroaching on sovereignty, the heart of the Member States."
"This will be an extremely painful process, and one can ask oneself whether it would all that useful right now."
"I would therefore be more inclined to opt for pragmatic cooperation without losing the differences between the national judicial systems."
"As the report and our choice differ, we decided, despite all our sympathy for the action plan and the report, not to support this plan."
"You will recognize this thinking in the way we will be voting on the other reports on 'the combat of organized crime' which was discussed this morning."
"I would like to support the recommendations put forward by Mrs Cederschiöld."
"In her draft resolution she identifies the inherent flaws and weaknesses in the current EU approach to tackling organized crime."
"Organized crime is a sophisticated international business operation."
"They recognize no national boundaries and because of their huge resources they are able to employ the best brains in the legal, financial and other technical fields."
"In response the EU approach is uncoordinated, fragmented, under-resourced and operates on a national basis due to the chauvinistic attitude of interior ministries who wish to protect their own little 'empires' based on outdated notions of national sovereignty."
"We must change these attitudes, achieve greater harmonization of our legal, judicial and policing systems if we are to win the war against organized crime."
"Any sensible person could not help but be shocked by the slow pace at which the Member States of the European Union have undertaken to join forces and coordinate their actions and procedures in the fight against organized crime."
"The globalization of the economy and of financial channels allows operators - including the criminal fraternity - to recycle, or rather launder without any difficulty or control the enormous profits gained from prostitution and drugs and arms trafficking."
"As everyone knows, the collapse of communism in central and eastern Europe laid a fertile ground in the debris of state controlled structures for various forms of gangsterism, racketeering and corruption."
"The free circulation of capital and individuals within the Union, combined with technological development burst open the borders for everyone, including criminals, and thereby promoted trafficking in cars, drugs and human beings."
"Under these conditions, how can we imagine that purely national legal and judicial systems and policing are in a position to confront the plurality of ever more organized serious crime?"
"How can we accept the unbelievable amount of time taken to process requests for information or cooperation between magistrates in different countries?"
"How can we accept that the Europol Convention has not yet been ratified by all the signatory countries?"
"So of course I am delighted that on 17 June the European Council of Amsterdam adopted the action plan on combatting organized crime."
"This is a step in the right direction."
"Furthermore I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of the Council of Europe towards drafting an agreement against organized corruption which is rampant in international markets."
"If there is one area in which the Union must prove its capacity to meet the legitimate aspirations of its people, it is that of the security of individuals and goods."
"A corrupt Europe has no future."
"We must act now."
"It is regrettable that this report, which deals with organized international crime, does not say a word about Interpol, whose aim is precisely to combat crime at international level."
"Instead, the report is aimed merely at advocating, in a more or less explicit manner, an ""EU FBI' , which is to harmonize the policing and judicial systems in the EU states in accordance with the body of law governing the creation of a future common European criminal and judicial sector."
"In my opinion, this development is neither reasonable nor appropriate."
"It can scarcely be reasonable at this juncture to set up a policing organization that is to compete with Interpol."
"Instead, work with Interpol should be intensified in order to enable this organization to challenge international crime more effectively."
"It is also proposed that Europol should be given more powers, one of them being that it should also include operational activity - this in spite of the fact that Europol is subject to inadequate parliamentary and judicial control and characterized by a serious lack of openness and protection of privacy and personal data."
"I can agree to several of the proposals in the report."
"The best way of fighting crime and criminality in the long term is to reinforce the democratic foundations within society in the fields of child welfare, education, working life, etc."
"I would particularly like to underline the importance of improved cooperation between the Member States in combatting cross-border crime."
"I advocate intensified intergovernmental cooperation in this area along the lines of the Nordic model."
"It is important that there should be no criminalization in the absence of malice."
"The proposals regarding the interpretation of a criminal offence within a so-called criminal organization must therefore be based on this principle."
"I am, however, opposed to centrally determined forms of judicial cooperation, where the main aim is a harmonization of the legislation."
"The EU must not be developed into a centrally-controlled police state - using Europol as a tool - with large information systems that are subject to inadequate democratic control."
"In view of the fact that the report contains several proposals along these lines, I shall be voting against it in the final vote."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the Cederschiöld report, since we believe that effective and improved efforts are needed in order to be able to cope with the growth in the organized crime that is operating across the Member States."
"We are, however, uneasy about some of the statements made by the rapporteur - statements that aim to involve supranational institutions such as the Commission and the European Court of Justice more closely in judicial cooperation."
"Judicial cooperation should remain within the confines of the third pillar and the Commission and the European Court of Justice must not have any further powers."
"Harmonization within the field of criminal law must not be a goal in itself and the existing intergovernmental instruments should be made effective before new initiatives are undertaken."
"We advocate effective and practical cooperation between the Member States in the judicial sector."
"Such cooperation will be an effective counter-measure to organized criminality."
"Orlando report(A4-0355/97)"
"Madam President, we were unable to approve the report by Mr Orlando on the implementation of international agreements to combat organized crime, because, according to an excellent text by the Council, the Parliament desired systematically to transfer the prerogatives of the Council to the Commission."
"In the domain which affects one of the major sovereign areas of responsibility of nations, it seems clear to us that it is up to the Council to act and not the Commission, which is an administrative body with questionable democratic legitimacy."
"Furthermore, in terms of efficiency in an area in which the specific factors, traditions, the philosophy of law and national origins have such a strong role to play, we consider it much more expedient to leave it up to each nation to act."
"The report gives the Commission a much stronger role in the evaluation system."
"We are of the opinion that it is the Councilʼs presidency that should continue in future to bear the responsibility for this work."
"The Council is - and should be - the highest decision-making body in the European Union."
"We see no reason to reinforce the Commissionʼs role in this context."
"For this reason we shall be abstaining at the vote on this report."
"Mr Orlando has proven his pugnacity in drawing up these different reports, and we can only welcome it."
"These three reports deal with one issue: organized crime."
"The European Parliament has got to prove its unstinting determination in the fight against all Mafia practices."
"Mafia organizations are growing stronger in countries which already have competent services to combat organized crime."
"We could question the means put in place at Community level to eradicate this scourge."
"We have no choice but to affirm that Mafias are emerging, not only in eastern Europe, but also in the heart of the European Union."
"I agree with the recommendations of the rapporteur which refer not only to the way these groups are evolving, but also to the spread of crimes and offences."
"Reference is also made to money laundering, and as far as this goes, I too demand an end to all the hypocrisy."
"Within Europe or the European Union we must provide judges with a wider range of methods of investigation, especially to check suspicious bank accounts; without these there is no point in legislating or discussing the issue further."
"The European Union is becoming fussier and fussier about the help given to certain areas of activity."
"I hope that it will demonstrate the same concern to implement quickly the means to combat organized crime effectively."
"If the European Union does not score a few points in this war, it will lose yet more credibility with its citizens."
"Orlando report(A4-0349/97)"
"If we are serious about tackling organized crime we have to ensure more effective coordination throughout the European Union before we can properly start cooperating with third countries."
"Intergovernmentalism and lack of transparency is not the way to convince European citizens of our determination to win the war against organized crime."
"I believe there are many excellent proposals in this report that are well worth considering if we want to send a message to international criminals that we mean business!"
"Nassauer report(A4-0367/97)"
"Madam President, the Nassauer report on laying down the priorities for cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs represents a return to the European Parliament's usual cliché on the free movement of persons which supposedly could not exist in the Union as long as any degree of control remains in place at internal borders."
"This idea has caused a great deal of harm already and will cause even more in future if the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified, because article B of the New title 3 A in the Community section states that within five years the Council will have to put a stop to measures which ""pursuant to article 7 A aim to guarantee that citizens of the European Union or of a third country will not be subject to any controls when they cross internal borders' ."
"As usual those in favour of a federal Europe are trying to make people believe that they are only being asked to apply a decision which had already been made, and that legally and morally, they would have no room for manoeuvre."
"But in reality this is not the case, for article 7 A never said that free movement of persons implied there would be no controls, and even less that this would also apply to persons from third countries."
"Furthermore, the Treaty of Amsterdam, in article B cited above, does not set any pre-conditions for the abolition of controls of persons at internal borders."
"The accompanying measures are only evoked in article A, but this article deals with a legally different problem, i.e. the integration of Schengen, and nowhere does it say that the conditions evoked - which, by the way, are in a very allusive form - represent pre-conditions."
"So the peoples of Europe risk once more being trapped by a European Union which is fulfilling the objective function of demolishing their defence when it should be aiming to strengthen it."
"This corruption of European institutions which constantly work against its own side must be put right urgently, and initially by rejecting the Treaty of Amsterdam, for if not Europe will be lost."
"I welcome the production of this report by Mr Nassauer and I support its key recommendations."
"In particular, I endorse the proposal that Europol should be given precisely defined operational and executive powers determining which national police bodies are to be responsible for all the measures carried out in their countries."
"A fully operational Europol is critical to ensuring successful cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs."
"It is nothing short of scandalous that the Europol Convention is not ratified."
"After the Dutroux scandal in Belgium there was a flurry of activity and there seemed to be a determination to ensure that Europol would be given the necessary powers to discharge its responsibilities."
"Things have now ground to a halt and if Member States genuinely wish to create a citizens' Europe the progress must be made in the area of justice and home affairs."
"Progress on Europol will be the litmus test of proving how serious Member States are in relation to delivering on their promises."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Situation in Iraq"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Iraq."
"Mr President, I think we, and indeed the whole world, have followed the developments in Iraq very closely and with bated breath."
"It hardly needs stating that the Commission and the Council, and most certainly this Parliament, will agree that the United Nations, the Secretary General, and the Security Council all must have our full support in their aim to have Iraq meet the relevant Security Council resolutions."
"Naturally the United Nations and the Security Council is the obvious place to debate and decide on these issues."
"I am sure you have will noted with a certain amount of relief the encouraging news which reached us today from Geneva, where the five permanent members of the Security Council met yesterday."
"Without having exact knowledge of what was discussed in detail, it appears that some form of compromise has been reached, to which Iraq still has to respond."
"But this compromise would in any case allow the UN Committee of Inquiry, UNSCOM, resuming its work with its original membership, so that this work can now be continued; which is extremely important for the safety which is needed to dismantle all the capacity which Iraq has at its disposal to produce weapons of mass destruction."
"It is clear that if this conflict with Iraq drags on, it will have serious consequences, not only in the sense of security, but also as regards the enforcement of oil and food resolutions, if I may call them this for the sake of convenience; which in turn would lead to harmful consequences on the humanitarian aid which may be given to the people of Iraq, and would also hamper aid efforts to northern Iraq."
"There is not much more the Commission can say about this at the moment, apart from expressing the wish that the indications (which are there) that the crisis has been averted, are being confirmed."
"In the current state of affairs I am not able to more positive about in drawing this conclusion, but if we also take note of the statements and announcements made yesterday by the British Foreign Secretary after the consultation between the five permanent members, and of the text which appeared today in Telexpress, then we can hope with some justification that the crisis can be averted."
"Mr commissioner, thank you for your report."
"We are of course very happy that it at least appears as though the current crisis has been avoided, even though it would be an overestimate of Europe and the European Parliament to assume that the effect of today's session was so great that Saddam reacted to it."
"I do think, though, that a number of questions remain to be answered, not just the fundamental questions you posed, Mr Commissioner."
"Firstly, is it your opinion, Mr Commissioner, that the necessary unified European position in this crisis could have been established quickly enough?"
"I am aware that that is not the job of the Commission or of the Commissioner, but I should still like to ask if you, as a Commissioner, could assume a common European line during all your discussions and efforts."
"Secondly, how much, in your view, has the current crisis in Iraq to do with the situation in Israel?"
"Is the impression correct, which you also may have gained, that the necessary solidarity within the Arabian area itself was not forthcoming because of the Israeli crisis and the opinion of many Arab countries that America had applied too little pressure in the days leading up to the crisis?"
"The third point that causes me and all of us particular anxiety is obviously the humanitarian aspect."
"However unacceptable this Group - and, I believe, all in this House - perceive Saddam's actions to be, just as it is not acceptable that monitoring controls were not good or effective enough, so too do we fear that humanitarian aspects, particularly those concerning children and health problems, are suffering very much under these sanctions."
"I should like to ask you if it is your impression that essential humanitarian aspects have been included in the programme of oil in exchange for food, which you mentioned. Or should not indeed greater essential humanitarian aid have been forthcoming?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement."
"It is in fact an extremely strange, of course, that our Commissioner has to make this statement, as we would really expect the Council to talk about foreign politics in this House."
"But the fact that a prelude is being used is welcome, a prelude of which our Commissioner is quite capable."
"I am in actual fact sorry that this Parliament did itself not take the opportunity to take the initiative to move towards a policy."
"There was a cautious resolution which supported the UN policy - I think this would anyhow have been a good back-up - and also an inducement to the Council to start working on a communal position on Iraq."
"Unfortunately Parliament has let this opportunity slip."
"I think it is very important nonetheless that we as a Parliament have the courage in these kinds of extremely dangerous situations, to say what we think ourselves, not only on this one, but also on Cuba and other issues, to give a signal from Europe, if nothing else."
"I assume that on this kind of issue we should be able to come to agreement."
"My question on Iraq, which is a state with an exceedingly criminal government, is whether it is not our responsibility to say something about it, particularly because peace in the Middle East is threatened by it."
"When I hear the Israelis say, we live on only a small strip of land; a few bombs, a few long range missiles with biological and chemical weapons of the kind being developed in Iraq, and we would have had it; then we should take these noises seriously."
"Furthermore, it would not have been the first time Europe, too, might be threatened by long range missiles."
"It was mentioned earlier that from the Serb Republic Scud missiles can easily reach Rome."
"In time this will also be possible from Iraq, so it concerns us directly."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you: has enough been done in the field of foreign trade measures to prevent Europe also giving succour to the production of biological and chemical weapons in Iraq?"
"Have you looked at this in the recent past; and would you please reply to this?"
"Secondly, the humanitarian aspect."
"This has surely always been possible."
"It is only really Saddam who is stopping humanitarian aid reaching his people."
"Is there not the danger that if we direct all our energies to the humanitarian aspect, this aid will end up in the hands of Saddam and his army, and not in the hands of the people, who are at the heart of this?"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement."
"I would like to start by completely agreeing with Mr Oostlander and I would like to add that I find it is extremely regrettable that the two large groups in this Parliament have clearly rejected their actions from within this Parliament."
"As the Commissioner said: Saddam Hussein appears to have accepted that UNSCOM will continue the investigation with the Americans."
"This must have been the result of negotiations between the 5 permanent members of the Security Council and that is a welcome and necessary outcome of the conflict."
"Does the Commissioner perhaps have any more background information on this agreement, and can he confirm that in exchange no concessions have been made to Saddam?"
"Obviously the credibility of the entire UN system is at stake."
"For years UNSCOM has been destroying weapons of mass destruction and the investigation is being constantly obstructed."
"Straightforwardness, Mr President, should and must be the only answer."
"The thought alone of concessions to Saddam is unacceptable."
"Saddam must implement Resolution 687 without delay."
"After that he may be able to a look forward to the sanctions being lifted, but not before."
"Saddam can arrange for the often quoted light at the end of the tunnel by not obstructing the investigation any further."
"Once that has happened, the destitute Iraqi citizens who are being held hostage by Saddam will experience an improvement in their lot."
"The international community, Mr President, must act as one."
"An empty slogan, perhaps."
"For that matter, unilateral action by the United States would not provide the answer, even though Saddam may have hoped for it."
"But nor should economic interest in the short term break this unanimity."
"Can the Commissioner finally indicate whether there was European harmony, for instance, when they took their position in the United Nations, as is required by the Treaty of Maastricht?"
"And if so, what was the result of all these efforts?"
"And if not, why not?"
"Mr President, at the eleventh hour the apparent temporary solution to the Iraqi/United States crisis has avoided a tragedy of major dimensions for the Iraqi people, that is, a prolonged air bombing and missile offensive by the United States armed forces."
"We cannot but express our deeply-felt relief for such an apparent solution and our thanks to those members of the Security Council of the United Nations who worked against time to restore the UNSCOM role in Iraq and to avoid further bloodshed."
"On this side of the House we nurture no sympathy for the Baghdad dictator and his desperate gambles with the lives of his people."
"At the same time we cannot accept a return to the status quo ante and endless prolongation of the most cruel and senseless sanctions which, in less than six years, have led to one million dead civilians and to a veritable slaughter of the innocents at the rate of 4, 500 children a month."
"The lifting of the embargo on non-strategic goods is overdue, as is in our view a gradual lifting of the oil embargo far beyond the arbitrary limits of the food for oil problem."
"Enough is enough."
"The European Union, shockingly absent and passive up to now, has to step forward and convince our American friends that this carnage must be stopped, that a temporary solution of this crisis could lead to a worse crisis in the future if diplomatic, political and economic alternatives are not pursued to replace the threatened use of B52 stealth bombers and tomahawk cruise missiles."
"Mr President, like everyone here I am delighted both personally and on behalf of the Radical Alliance that right seems to be winning the day."
"We owe this to the reticence of a certain number of permanent members of the Security Council regarding the military option, and possibly to an equal extent, to Russian diplomatic initiatives."
"Be that as it may, and let's be clear about this, we have no special sympathy for the Iraq regime, not more so than we ought to have for the Syrian regime, for example. However it is clear that a peaceful, fair and lasting solution has five conditions: the withdrawal of the embargo which serves only to harm the Iraqi people; the relaxation of the oil blockade; which all too clearly serves only the interests of the Americans; the abandonment of the financial compensation due to Kuwait which Iraq does not have the means to pay as a result of the sanctions; also a clarification of the missions of UNSCOM which should not serve as a pretext for indefinite supervision; and a progressive reintegration of Iraq into the international community."
"It is certainly not up to the Americans to say who should govern Iraq, but it may fall to them and to a European diplomatic mission, finally unified on this question, to create the conditions for a democratic evolution by using a more generous approach in a country where the leaders exploit a collective paranoia which we do nothing but feed."
"Mr President, although this is a question which is a matter for the United Nations Security Council, and at European level, the Council and not the Commission, as you are responsible for the implementation of the embargo on Iraq on behalf of the European Union, I would like to ask you, Commissioner, if it is not time to look seriously at the basis for maintaining the embargo, which by all the evidence over the last seven years has not reached the objectives it was set."
"It was supposed to destabilize a dictator who seemed scarcely affected by its consequences, if we judge by the recent expulsion of the United Nations experts."
"On the other hand, this embargo, our embargo is overwhelming the population by its devastating effects on food supplies, care and education."
"Will this determination effectively to imprison Iraqis improve our image in the region or will it strengthen the forces which are most hostile to us?"
"Would it not therefore be more appropriate from now on to change our approach radically and to dissociate completely the question of chemical and nuclear weapons (on which the international community should exercise the greatest vigilance) from that of an embargo which has not contributed in any way to resolving the problem and which has only increased the suffering of a people?"
"Mr President, I welcome Commissioner van den Broek's opening remark that this is a UN matter and this is not necessarily the most appropriate forum."
"It is important that we keep in mind that this is indeed a matter for the UN and, therefore, it is important that there be no doubt that Iraq has to comply with UN resolutions in every respect."
"We feel relief that there has been - we assume - a solution to the problem."
"Our relief must not be allowed to hide the fact that the inspectors should never have been expelled in the first place."
"This is another example of Iraq's attempts to divide and rule: to separate out elements of the anti-Iraq alliance."
"Will the Commissioner agree with me that the most important thing the European Union can do is make it absolutely clear we are united behind UN resolutions and we will not have any weakening of the EU position confronting Iraq?"
"That is the most important statement he can make today."
"Nothing must come out of this forum which implies any weakening of the resolve of the Member States of the European Union or that the dictatorship in Iraq will get any succour from the European Union."
"We will reinforce the UN resolutions and we will stick by them."
"Mr President, just like Commissioner van den Broek, one must naturally be relieved at the return of the UN weapons inspectors and by the fact that Iraq has accepted, in order to avoid further conflict with the USA."
"What one does find troubling, though, is that this solution came about without EU involvement and that it indicates an increase in the role of Russia in the Near East, which has led to a weakening of the position of the USA as well as disclosing a splintering of Europe."
"The crisis about weapons inspections which was initiated by Saddam Hussein has once more been symptomatic of weakness in the European Union's foreign policy, and has disclosed its lack of a common policy for foreign affairs and security."
"I am aware that sanctions against Iraq and the Iraqi question fall primarily within the competence of the United Nations, but it would have been really useful for the EU to show solidarity in this as well."
"I very much regret that the European Parliament was not in a position to act as a sort of flanking measure by passing a joint resolution, and I am very thankful that the Commissioner has taken this up today in his explanation."
"One must be aware, however, that this was just an emergency repair."
"A resolution would have been a clearer instrument and would have emphasized the formation of opinion in the European Parliament in order to strengthen the UN resolution and show a certain amount of solidarity with the USA."
"If we want the USA to show a continuing interest in our security problems, we should make it clear once more that we feel ourselves to be in a rather critical position vis a vis solidarity with America."
"I do not want to repair errors in the inadequate American strategy, but my question to you, Mr Commissioner, is this: does the Commission have a strategic plan concerning Iraq which might prevent the constant repetition of such crises?"
"Mr President, while totally condemning the policies pursued by Saddam Hussein and the appalling violations of human rights, particularly against his own people, can consideration now be given, firstly, at least to easing the embargo in a way that will provide more desperately needed supplies for the Iraqi people, while maintaining total opposition to the dictatorship and efforts of Saddam Hussein to build his military strength, and, secondly, to seek to help end the fratricidal struggle between the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions - the KDP, which has been cooperating with Turkish forces - and the PUK, which has been in league with Iran, which is undoubtedly playing into Saddam Hussein's hands?"
"Both those factions have sent delegations to see him, and this is a very great problem indeed."
"Can we ask for actions on these issues, now that the crisis has at least lifted a little, in order to get a more permanent settlement, which will be in the interests not only of people outside but also of the Iraqi people?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank those who have spoken."
"Let me start by saying that hasty conclusions should be avoided at this point, in the sense that the Permanent Five have made it clear that they hope that Russia's initiative, which was welcomed by all, will lead to Baghdad allowing Unscom to return to work in its original composition."
"In other words, we will obviously have to see what the detailed response from Baghdad will be before we can feel genuine relief."
"Secondly, I agree with those who have said that this is first and foremost a responsibility for the members of the Security Council."
"That is undoubtedly true."
"But when we talk about issues which verge on questions of war and peace then it is also obvious to the Commission that this Parliament would wish to make some comments about it; although, having said that, the Commissions does not profess to have any specific authority on the subject, but would like to participate in this exchange of views."
"I endorse what has been said, namely that, firstly, such a statement could obviously also come from the European Parliament, from ministers and from the Commission, that there must be and remain one voice, and that Security Council resolutions are there to be implemented in their entirety, and that is something which cannot be negotiated."
"The five permanent members initially agreed about this message as such."
"If it seemed that there was some difference between them in the assessment of what means should be employed to reach that goal, then that is correct, but I repeat that it is most satisfactory that the five permanent members have now jointly made an intitiave, and are now apparently awaiting an answer from Baghdad."
"In itself this is very significant."
"What the possible relationship might be between this conflict and the situation in Israel, respectively America's interference in this, and the subsequent impact on the attitude of the Arab states - recently visited by Madeleine Albright - is extremely difficult for us to weigh up."
"It is absolutely true that the situation in Iraq was and is all the more worrying as the entire situation in the Middle East is rather explosive at the moment because the entire peace process in the Middle East is stagnating."
"And in any case it is worth observing that the United States, the American President, and the American Secretary of State also talk openly about it in the sense that they are very worried that Israel's inflexibility does not contribute to the much needed progress in this process."
"On the subject of humanitarian aid."
"Through Echo, my colleague, Mrs Bonino, has allocated another ECU 10 million to humanitarian aid for the period up until August next year."
"I agree with those who say that where there is humanitarian need, Saddam Hussein himself is primarily responsible for bringing this on, as providing for sufficient humanitarian resources is also dependent on meeting the Security Council's resolutions; that there is also a resolution of the Security Council which states that $ 2 billion worth of oil may exported so that food and medication can be imported in return for this."
"In other words, I do not think that any responsibility should be attached to the international community for causing possible humanitarian need."
"For that matter I would like to point out that in northern Iraq where there is a specific humanitarian situation for which the European Union is also attempting to bring relief, the situation with the Kurds, and in particular Turkish interference over the border in northern Iraq is causing real obstacles, making the transit of aid goods extremely difficult."
"Mr President, I would like to leave it at that."
"I thank Parliament for the opportunity to exchange views on this."
"The debate is closed."
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, pursuant to Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0946/97 by Mrs Lenz and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the permanent International Criminal Court; -B4-0951/97 by Mr Pettinari and Mr Manisco, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the permanent International Criminal Court; -B4-0960/97 by Mr Dell'Alba and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the permanent International Criminal Court; -B4-0961/97 by Mrs Aglietta and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the permanent International Criminal Court; -B4-0974/97 by Mrs Cars and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on the permanent International Criminal Court; -B4-0985/97 by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the permanent International Criminal Tribunal."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I would first like to say how pleased I am that our resolution today has been supported by six groups in this House."
"I think that is a sign of how important it is actually to establish a court of law to replace the interim courts for Ruanda and Yugoslavia."
"The United Nations have realized the necessity for establishing such a court, because war crimes and internal armed conflicts do not occur just in these two countries, but in many other countries where it is necessary for this kind of court to operate."
"We have seen that with our previous courts we have legally been skating on thin ice and that the room for action of these courts has been very limited."
"It is also important that this resolution demands that clear definitions should be established at the talks preparatory to the conference, which thankfully takes place next year in Italy and is organized by the United Nations for the express purpose of setting up this court."
"What is a war criminal?"
"What is an internal armed conflict?"
"And it is obviously very important also that this court - and this should if possible be clarified in the preparatory meetings - can operate independently of the United Nations and Security Council, so that matters are not constantly blocked by these institutions for professional reasons."
"A great number of important things have taken place here, and I think it is not only I who thinks that this is a first step towards controlling conflict in the future."
"Large problems still lie ahead of us, particularly in view of the fact that throughout the world there is so far no ethnic group law."
"We have only national and constitutional law, but no law that defines and establishes what the rights of an ethnic group are, and where they can be brought before a court."
"I think the creation of this sort of court of law is a first step towards this enormously important right."
"If we look at conflicts over the past few years we see that most of them were in fact conflicts between various ethnic groups."
"I think this will be a great step forward and that we as the European Parliament should do everything possible to see that it is successful."
"I realize that certain financial obligations arise from it, in order for the project for an International Criminal Court really to become established and to flourish."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, may I first lament the absence of representatives of our Council, since, as we know, it is the Member States primarily which should be in the front line of the last battle in the United Nations to conquer this first part in the reform of the United Nations. This in fact is the first reform to merit the name since the creation of the United Nations."
"Mr Habsburg-Lothringen has already outlined one of the fundamental points which the Member States of the European Union and the Commission should insist upon within the scope of their responsibilities: the independence of the Court."
"I would like to reassure Mr Ephremidis by clarifying that we do not wish to open up the question of past conflicts, be it Cuba, North Korea or the People's Republic of China; the problem we face concerns future conflicts."
"I would also like to invite my colleagues to start thinking about a later step we could take: the creation of a Universal Court of Civil and Political Rights on the model of the European Court of Human Rights."
"All experience with dictatorships and civil wars in the east, the west and the south, whether in the former Soviet Union or in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chile or today in Algeria, teaches us one thing: war criminals and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted by the criminal law."
"Immunity from prosecution is an invitation to further crimes and prosecution has a huge preventive function."
"For that reason my group has for years supported the establishment of an international criminal court."
"I should like to draw your attention, Commissioner van den Broek, to Figure 3 of our joint resolution, which deals with finance."
"Two years ago in this House I talked myself hoarse in order to obtain ECU 3 million for the financing of the Criminal Courts in Yugoslavia and Ruanda."
"This year we have been able with rather less effort to insert ECU 3 million into the budget."
"I should be grateful to the Commission if it were to develop with us in future a system of financing, so as to secure the long-term finances of such an International Criminal Court."
"Mr President, we all dream of an existence without war and other evils, but we must not allow ourselves to be satisfied with that."
"A permanent war crimes tribunal could be a step on way to realizing our dreams."
"In wartime, many people relax all of their moral scruples."
"They may then perceive that they are allowed to commit crimes that in their heart they know to be wholly unacceptable."
"An independent war crimes court is for those people who are struck by warʼs worst evil, the evil that can run riot when all constraints are set aside."
"The victim should know that even then there is, somewhere on earth, a court which can administer justice and which can restore to the suffering victim his dignity and punish the guilty party."
"For those who perceive that war gives them the right to carry out acts that they would otherwise never have done, the knowledge that such a court exists may have a deterrent effect."
"A permanent war crimes tribunal becomes a lodestar for respect for human rights, even in the lifeʼs darkest moments."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the history of the world and of Europe this century is a story of wars and of war crimes, but only partially a story of the prosecution for war crimes."
"That is why I think that with this motion we are supporting a basic idea that is absolutely essential. We cannot accept that simple murder is subject to prosecution, obviously quite rightly and necessarily, whereas mass murder frequently goes unpunished and many mass murderers can go about their daily lives as though they were respectable people."
"I think the few cases where international courts have been established to deal with war crimes, complemented by one or two private initiatives - think of the Stockholm Tribunal and others - are really not up to this dramatic situation, so that we are repeatedly confronted, even in Europe unfortunately, by wars and such numbers of war crimes that our claims to civilization are completely unfounded."
"For that reason I fully support this motion, as does my group, even though there are obviously several problems."
"I did not understand from Mr Ephremidis whether he was for or against it, since all his points were arguments against."
"I think he was called as a supporter, however."
"Whatever the reason, that is a contradiction that does happen."
"Naturally he is right in saying that one or the other problem will arise."
"Our international political system must and will change when there is the certainty that there are independent international courts who are obliged to prosecute matters, even if perhaps political considerations weigh against it."
"Clearly there is the danger that political decisions, political compromises and even some peace treaties may be blocked when the one who wants peace has to reckon on being questioned before an international court afterwards."
"I should like to raise just two points. Firstly, it is naturally critical who can be called to account."
"Here too the present situation is unsatisfactory."
"Although underlings may be called to account, those who give the orders for war crimes by and large escape the consequences, particularly those from the political side."
"I do not think that should happen, because it contradicts the spirit of justice to try the one who carries out the crime, but to ignore the one who initiates it."
"Secondly, the duty of giving evidence."
"I do not entirely agree either with the most recent decision that a Croat Minister is not even obliged to give evidence."
"I think that when we have these international regulations it will have to be clear that anyone, regardless of his person, must be prosecuted, and anyone, regardless of his position, is duty bound to give evidence under oath before this international court."
"Mr President, Commissioner van den Broek, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the fiftieth birthday of the universal declaration of human rights it might be appropriate to reflect on the further development of ideas on a permanent international criminal court."
"All the same I have some questions."
"The resolution mentions the progress which has been made with the ad-hoc tribunals on Yugoslavia and Rwanda."
"Well, Mr President, I have my doubts about that, because in the absence of the will to genuinely catch those murderers, they are being very selective, and that can never have been the intention."
"It is not entirely clear to me how an international independent court will relate to the decisions made by the Security Council."
"Will the veto disappear?"
"How does it work?"
"Nor is it clear to me which nationalities with which sense of justice will occupy the office of prosecutor."
"Will all the inhabitants of the planet fall under the jurisdiction of the court?"
"Well, Mr President, America has already lodged a waiver on this."
"Why the EU should be mentioned as the major financier, when it involves all Member States of this planet, is not clear to me either."
"And then there is the question of who will arrest these murderers, and when and how?"
"We are at the start of a process which needs to be developed, fine, but let it never become a court which is just a victor's court."
"Finally, Mr President, in the context of war crimes during armed conflict this permanent international criminal court would finally, finally be able to drag Surinam's ex-dictator Bouterse to court."
"Mr President, my group will vote partly in favour, partly against."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I am hopeful that the diplomatic conferences which are to take place next year, will open the way for a permanent criminal court."
"It is extremely important that such a court should exist."
"The experiences with the ad-hoc tribunals on Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia show on the one hand that their existence is of immense importance, but on the other hand that there is much room for improvement in the way they operate."
"The establishment of a permanent court will offer the continuity and expertise which everyone needs in international criminal law."
"A number of difficult decision will obviously need to be taken, and exclusions and claims to sovereignty should be out of the question."
"It would be at odds with the impartial international rule of law."
"If necessary, we will have to continue without the countries which are not and do not want to become part of it."
"Concessions to obstructionists must be avoided at all cost."
"Otherwise the court will turn out to be a blunt instrument, as happened in the case of Rwanda and Yugoslavia."
"I depend on the Union and Member States working towards a strong, financial and political independent permanent tribunal, and if necessary contributing towards it, but as Mrs van Bladel says, not only from within the Union, but also from the rest of the world."
"Mr President, regional wars and conflicts ravage the various continents without sparing even old Europe, which until only yesterday saw crimes and genocides in the former Yugoslavia as well as in Africa or the Middle East, where it has not been possible to intervene to avoid evil."
"Now we are at least trying to rectify the situation by setting up international courts keen to recapture the role which national interests and a lack of courage of the Member States are not managing to play and to ensure the real application of a justice that transcends national boundaries, on pain of the futility of the very principle of justice decided upon, with the peace of the victims now sacrificed on the altar of state reason."
"Besides obeying the principle of justice, the international courts we hope to set up should contribute towards ending the current situation of impunity and setting up the corpus iuris serving not only to finally expose the war criminals, at all events and wherever they are, but above all to draw up a legal code, an international legal system that is valid for everyone."
"Alongside the creation of the courts, we also hope to set up a system of penalties that can actually be applied and, more than police coordination between the States, the formation of an international police force to ensure the persecution of crime and punishment of the offenders."
"Mr President, as has already been said, next year will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also of the Genocide Convention; it will also have been fifty years since the United Nations' International Law Commission was asked in the United Nations General Assembly to come up with a draft, to prepare a draft statute for the creation of an international court for criminal cases."
"So we are talking about an initiative that is almost fifty years old, and which over the years has been supported by the Member States of the European Union with a great deal of effort."
"We are also expressing the hope that next year the diplomatic conference which has to prepare the convention and which has to lead to the establishment of this international court, will actually meet, and that, en route, the preparatory committees will be able to solve the remaining differences, including the kind of questions which have been raised by several of your Members."
"It goes without saying, of course, that the European Commission, which will not take part in this capacity in these UN negotiations, at present wishes to refrain from making any bold statements on the scope of the legal powers or the procedural rules which might have to apply when such an international court is established."
"But just as the Commission at the time wholeheartedly supported the establishment of the tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, now we too support wholeheartedly all action which might lead to the realization of this larger international court."
"This is a long-standing ambition of a great many countries, and for that matter, of a large number of nongovernmental organizations which have contributed to keeping interest alive on this issue."
"We are therefore still grateful to this Parliament that in 1995 to budget ECU 300, 000 for aid to non-governmental organizations who committed themselves to the establishment of a permanent criminal court."
"The supporting activities contribute to the development of a European position on the issue, and thus information and awareness-raising campaigns for the public at large are therefore being set up, and actions are supported which are aimed at creating coordination and cooperation mechanisms between NGO's, the governments, the ad-hoc tribunals, and the United Nations institutions, whilst work on the establishment of the court continues."
"To conclude, Mr President, I think that the basic motivation behind our support for the establishment of an international court is in fact the same as the motivation behind our support for the creation of ad-hoc tribunals."
"There is no better guarantee for preventing these kinds of crimes against humanity."
"There is no better method of prevention than to ensure that when these crimes are committed, they will not remain unpunished."
"Mr President, as far as the financing of the tribunal itself is concerned, I would like to remind you that the Commission contributed from European funds not only to the establishment, but also to the functioning of the ad-hoc tribunals, and I believe that finances should not be a barrier to shelter behind when one wants to make progress in the establishment of this extremely important international institute of law."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0937/97 by Mr Bertens and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on Togo; -B4-0949/97 by Mr Chanterie and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the situation in Togo; -B4-0952/97 by Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the situation in Togo; -B4-0988/97 by Mr Scarbonchi and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the situation in Togo."
"Mr President, some days ago the ACP-EU Joint Assembly sat in Lomé, Togo."
"Some incidents caused the meeting to be peppered with denials of human rights violations, although these had been proven by Amnesty International."
"I do not want to go back over these facts. But I would like clearly to point out that even if the government has made progress, for example in setting up a constitutional court, a magistrate council or a national electoral commission, this is still not enough."
"If Togo wishes, as we do, cooperation to recommence, the elections in 1998 must be completely transparent."
"All political tendencies must be represented in the democratic debates, including the opposition of course."
"They must have access to the media, especially to radio and television."
"The security of each individual must be guaranteed, and freedom of expression and to hold gatherings must be authorized."
"Finally, the government must accept the presence at the elections of international observers and human rights representatives."
"Under these conditions and these only will we be in a position to declare democracy in Togo to be on the right track."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have the impression that the process of democratization in Togo has become stuck half way."
"It is advancing like the Echternach Spring Procession: two steps forwards have so far generally been followed by one or one and a half steps back."
"In other words, the President of Togo and his government appear to be in a dilemma as to what course the country should take: full democratization, which would also open the door to rapid political, economic and social development of the whole region in this part of West Africa, or regression into an autocratic regime leading to political isolation and internal confrontation - which is already detectable - and also to economic and social stagnation."
"A democratic opening would make the way clear, however, for cooperation with the neighbouring states of Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ivory Coast, who are all already several stages further along the road to constitutional government, recognition of human rights and education of a pluralist society."
"What is to be done?"
"Our business rules for cooperation with Togo are in article 5 of the Lomé Convention."
"We demand the maintenance of human rights, democracy and constitutional law."
"We must constantly emphasize that the resumption of development cooperation, much less its expansion, is only possible if the Government of Togo meets these requirements."
"The report by the two European experts on preparations for elections has now been presented."
"We should ask the Togo Government to study this report very carefully and to implement its main elements."
"The Government of Togo should now at last lay out the framework for the next presidential and parliamentary elections in cooperation with the opposition, so that there is equality of opportunity for both government and opposition."
"We think there should also be an opportunity within the Joint Assembly or our Committee on Development and Cooperation to start some possible mediation action, on the lines of what we did so successfully in Mali."
"Mr President, I would like to express my surprise, both personally and on behalf of my group, that the situation in Togo appears among the urgent debates."
"Prior to the meeting of the Joint Assembly at Lomé, our Parliament sent a mission to Togo which found that the minimal democratic conditions for holding this assembly had been met."
"So we went to Lomé for a week."
"As far as organization is concerned, the Joint Assembly ran perfectly."
"And as regards the democratic life of the country, we all held numerous talks with the government and with the opposition."
"We received a general impression that things were developing well, what with the multiparty system and the freedom of the press, even if access to television still leaves room for improvement."
"All in all, in my personal opinion, if the situation in Togo is fragile, this seems to be at least as much the result of a wish for destabilization by foreign countries as it is due to the longevity of the presidential power."
"In fact, at the end of its work, the Joint Assembly rejected a resolution, although very moderate, inviting the Togolese Government to reinforce its guarantees of pluralism in the 1998 elections."
"In this light, it seems to me that the inclusion of this question represents a double insult both to our Togolese hosts and to the Joint Assembly which appears to be disowned here, at a time when we have many other much more pressing urgent matters to deal with."
"This is why I personally intend to abstain from the vote on the compromise resolution."
"Madam President, I am speaking for Lord Plumb, who feels very strongly about this resolution."
"He has had to return home because his wife is unwell."
"I feel sure the whole House would wish Lady Plumb a speedy recovery."
"He has been to Togo twice: once, leading a delegation as Co-President of the ACP, and again, for the full session of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, when he met the President, the Prime Minister, and representatives of all the main opposition parties."
"He stresses that in Togo there exists a vocal and active political opposition which chairs some of the most important parliamentary committees."
"He met leaders of NGOs, journalists and ordinary people in Togo."
"An account of the mission has been published. He recommends that we read it."
"Togo is emerging from a difficult political and economic situation."
"While it is clear that not everything is perfect in that country, it is also clear that elections have been held, that opposition parties are active and participate vigorously in the parliamentary process and that often virulent opposition newspapers are sold freely on the streets."
"One-hundred-and-seventy representatives from 85 countries have discussed this subject."
"European Members have played a full part in the Assembly."
"Lord Plumb feels that there is little point in this resolution before the House today."
"Madam President, on 20 March in Brussels, I indicated on behalf of the Group Union for Europe that the particular features of the Lomé Convention were to be found largely in the contractual framework which it offers to the partnership and that this must be revitalized within the domain of political dialogue to ensure that our action is more effective."
"In addition, I pointed out that everyone agreed that this dialogue between the European Union and the ACP had failed, when the instruments are largely in place."
"In fact, I wanted to specify that for Europe the ACP group is not currently a real partner in the political dialogue, and that this dialogue lacks content and visibility."
"The open debate since the Green Paper shows that our cooperation with the ACP has lost legitimacy both within and outside the European Union, this cooperation is also no longer unique when commercial preferences are subjected to continuous erosion, and the debate also shows that the ACP is no longer pre-eminent in our actions."
"Faced with the growing concern of the ACP countries regarding the place we accord them in our policy of cooperation with less advanced countries, you will agree that this political coup de force on Togo is not likely to re-instil our partners' confidence, but will create a deep unease about the consideration we have for populations to which we owe a historical debt."
"The Group Union for Europe has always held that development aid is dependent on respect for human rights and democracy, but regrets that certain political groups demand that our Parliament questions the result of a vote to which we contributed."
"This draft resolution which has been submitted to us was rejected effectively by the Joint Assembly at Lomé on 30 October, in line with the internal ruling of the Joint Assembly, following a vote by separate college and secret ballot."
"To question this result in the absence of the ACP countries constitutes a violation of the internal ruling of the joint Assembly which we initiated, and stems from a lack of consideration for our ACP friends. We in the Group Union for Europe cannot sanction this in any way."
"Madam President, under these conditions my group will not support this behaviour and will make it known to all of our ACP partners."
"Madam President, let us be honest, Togo is not Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Somalia, and that why it is important that we offer a helping hand to it."
"During the ACP-EU Joint Assembly I had the opportunity as head of the liberal delegation to have a personal talk with the president and four of his ministers."
"The response to the questions which were in the Amnesty International report gave me the impression that the promised free elections would not be entirely free."
"We did not offer any criticism, we only asked questions."
"The Togolese Government is aware of this, and knows that article 5 of the Lomé Agreement forms a part of the postponement policy from Europe, and yet they still made it clear they did not want to carry it out."
"Therefore the situation will have to be followed closely, and that is why I ask the Commissioner whether an expert investigation on behalf of the Commission has been made; and I would like to see the results of this investigation made public very soon, if only to help the Togolese Government, to help demonstrate that free elections in a democratic Togo can be genuine."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to explain why my group has not signed this resolution about Togo."
"It is not that we do not support the text of the resolution."
"We do: in fact, we support everything in it."
"It is, rather, the process itself - the way this question is being handled politically - that is causing us a great deal of concern."
"It was only a few weeks ago that a resolution with largely the same content was defeated and rejected by a unanimous ACP delegation in Lomé, Togo."
"To now vote through a resolution that has virtually the same content would signal discredit of the ACP states and the ACP delegation."
"This would not be conducive to the continuation of a cooperation which is at an extremely sensitive stage."
"I was present in Lomé and know that there were several resolutions that were voted down, including a resolution about Nigeria, where one could certainly say that the situation with regard to human rights and democratic principles is much more serious than it is in Togo."
"We believe that it would be extremely humiliating for the ACP delegation if we were to vote this resolution through at this particular juncture."
"Madam President, this resolution on Togo constitutes false urgency."
"In this case, what events justify urgent procedure?"
"There are none."
"This resolution is therefore of no use whatsoever and totally out of place."
"Why do we need to go back over the situation in Togo scarcely three weeks after our Parliament reached a decision on the issue, firstly in the framework of the investigative mission, and then in the framework of the Joint Assembly of European Union-ACP countries?"
"After an extremely long, frank and open debate, the Joint Assembly did not consider it appropriate to adopt the resolution on Togo, considering that it would not facilitate the current democratic process."
"Do we in Strasbourg wish to question the decisions taken by our Joint Assembly in Lomé?"
"Could this be an attempt to seek revenge by those who failed in their plan to prevent the Joint Assembly being held in Togo, on the basis, incidentally, of information which was not verified and was quickly shown to be erroneous when we were actually on the ground?"
"Togo is learning democracy and democratic culture with perseverance at its own pace, but it is a delicate process, and we should not seek to undermine it by making irresponsible declarations."
"Why are we persisting in pointing the finger at Togo and casting aspersions on the current democratic process instead of helping a country which has sought the help of the European Union in this process?"
"Is it not true to say that Africa offers cause for concern on subjects which are much more serious and yet strangely enough these do not feature in the urgent debate!"
"Should the massacres in the Democratic Republic of Congo not have been the subject of an urgent debate, following the repeated refusal of the authorities in Kinshasa to admit the United Nations to investigate?"
"Should the issue of Islamic terrorism not have been raised the day after the appalling massacre at Luxor? And what about the new problems in southern Sudan?"
"Should we not have given these our close attention?"
"No, it is clear that the situation in Togo is out of place in this debate."
"The only real threat to Togo is the attempts by foreign countries to destabilize it, and these have not been mentioned in the resolution."
"We will therefore vote against the text which has been proposed."
"Mr President, the theory of control, which spread in Asia in the 60s, is repeating itself in central Africa."
"It is no longer the Marxist logic that is penetrating the countries, destabilizing them and causing them to fall, one after the other, but a gradual and not as slow a destabilization of the entire continent."
"After Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire and Congo, Togo is still today in a state of crisis."
"And yet that region of central Africa gave the impression of making progress in the life of real democratization, even at economic level, by maintaining the prices of raw materials."
"These positive aspects were rendered even more promising by the geopolitical situation of black Africa, which only a few years ago managed to overcome the anachronisms of apartheid and contributed towards the consolidation in South Africa of an awareness of an indigenous majority with the vocation of supporting the smaller countries, encouraging them and helping them."
"Despite that, a constant and progressive destabilization is taking hold of that region, destabilization caused above all by the role of the former European colonial powers which are today too undecided between domestic political issues and continuing to play the old role of a tutelary deity."
"The protection of human rights, the development of the population and the protection of the regions threatened by the crisis are therefore forcing a redefinition of the entire European policy in the continent."
"Madam President, fair and free elections in Togo are an important gauge for the future of this country."
"The Commission has expressed its willingness to offer technical and financial aid for the preparation and follow-up of these elections in Togo."
"But the Commission only wants to make this contribution if the Togolese Government meets its promises of openness and transparency, and also of security during the election process."
"And if they make it clear that all political forces are given the opportunity to participate in this process and subject to the conditions which guarantees free access to the media, internal free movement and security."
"This means that in the opinion of the Commission, a national elections committee should be set up forthwith, in which the government majority and the opposition must be represented equally."
"The election committee must supervise and exercise control on all activities related to the election process, and must have powers over security, in particular vis a vis the safety of the candidates, as well as exercising control on access to the media."
"The Togolese Government has made a verbal promise verbally to appoint the members of the election committee and to start the election process before the end of November, in other words before the end of this month."
"This promise must be implemented within this period if the Commission's support is to be applied effectively."
"Mr Bertens inquired about the expert's report which has been drafted."
"It shows how, in the eyes of experts, the election process is to be given shape, if it is to be truly open and fair."
"And they also go into certain specific technical and material requirements."
"But the Commission believes that it is up to the Togolese Government to take the initiative to publish the report."
"The Commission recommended the government to present the report to the Togolese National Assembly."
"It hopes that its recommendation will be taken up."
"Sending the report out contributes to a bigger consensus between the political powers and a transparent preparation of the election process, and the Commission will inform the Togolese Government of the European Parliament's request to make the report public."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Voting will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following resolutions:"
"(B4-0954/97) by Mrs Pailler and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on children's rights; -(B4-0968/97) by Mr Pasty and others, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe on the protection of children's rights; -(B4-0977/97) by Mr Monfils, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on the protection of children and their rights; -(B4-0980/97) by Mrs Frutos Gama and Mrs García Arias, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on children's rights; -(B4-0990/97) by Mrs Leperre-Verrier, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the respect of children's rights; -(B4-0947/97) by Mr Habsburg-Lothringen and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the economic threats to the press in Slovakia; -(B4-0976/97) by Mr Bertens and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on the proposal to increase taxes on publications in Slovakia; -(B4-0992/97) by Mrs Schroedter and Mrs van Dijk, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the increase in VAT on publications in Slovakia; -(B4-0966/97) by Mr Telkämper, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the agrarian reform in the Philippines; -(B4-0982/97) by Mrs d'Ancona, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the importance of continuing the agrarian reform in the Philippines; -(B4-0936/97) by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on detentions without trial in Malaysia; -(B4-0967/97) by Mr Telkämper, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on detentions without trial in Malaysia; -(B4-0962/97) by Mr Telkämper, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the situation in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT); -(B4-0989/97) by Mr Dupuis, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the situation in the Chittagong Hill Tracts; -(B4-0950/97) by Mr Manisco and others, on the detention of Silvia Baraldini in the United States."
"Protection of Children's Rights"
"Madam President, the resolution which we are discussing is bizarre."
"It asks us to celebrate Children's Day on 20 November and to fight abuse, but the compromise resolution eliminated from this text the three passages of the resolution which I tabled on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party on the serious paedophile acts which may have occurred at the Clovis crèche which is a European Union facility."
"There has been a conspiracy of silence for months."
"Parents are left in the dark about what is going on and are even invited by the administration to say nothing."
"They are criticized when they turn to services outside the Union."
"Children who have suffered ill-treatment are not taken into care."
"So what about the transparency of the European institutions?"
"I am sorry to have to say it, but the Commission obviously wants to stifle the whole affair."
"This is completely unacceptable!"
"In the reports voted on recently we condemned everything without reserve: paedophiles, those who keep pornographic pictures, Melchior Wathelet and we are not capable of putting these resolutions into practice in our own crèches."
"I would clearly say that the commissioner responsible, obviously not Mr van den Broek, ought to explain himself whether he wishes to or not, in other words, either on his own initiative in front of the honourable Members, or before a parliamentary committee of inquiry with which we are filing the text."
"If this does not happen, the press will take care of it and in fact has already started to do so."
"It is not right to play on the anguish of parents and risks to the physical and mental health of children, and the Commission has been doing so for too long."
"Mr President, today, on this day devoted to the rights of children, we must again report on the terrible violence to which they are subjected."
"Two hundred and fifty million children are at work, thousands of children exploited, terrorized by war, if not dragooned, and we must also add the children in the Western world who suffer terrible abuse."
"The conferences in Stockholm and Oslo gave an alarming review of the situation and its evolution."
"But over and above complete and unanimous condemnation, this day should also give us pause for thought."
"Firstly at an institutional level, what should we think of those countries which have forgotten to ratify the UN convention on children's rights, which was adopted some seven years ago?"
"These are sometimes the same countries that do not guarantee refugee children the security and protection which is essential."
"And in this regard, we should once again deplore the fact that the European Union has not always included in its treaties the rights of children."
"Secondly, we should reflect on the place we reserve for children within our society."
"Democracy and development ought to have led to more education and a prolongation of the duration of schooling."
"But the opposite is the case: throughout the world, children are wandering the streets, are put to work and even sexually exploited."
"By the same token, now that progress in child psychology has explained to us their emotional and intellectual needs, how can we accept that there are more and more children who are abused, especially within their own families."
"And in addition, children have nowadays become the privileged target of shopkeepers. They are taken hostage to sell the products destined for them, of course, but also to sell anything and everything."
"We have entered the era of the child as an object."
"What is required for our society to regard the child as a person in his or her own right, to whom it is our duty to convey a sense of humanity, happiness and hope?"
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, on behalf of my group may I express my pleasure in the fact that there has been such a general and clear consensus in this House about the role and rights of children."
"I can say on behalf of my group that we fully support the contents of Conclusions 1-9 of the amendment motion."
"As a German delegate I must unfortunately add an appeal to the Bundestag and Federal Government for them at long last to repeal the abstention pertaining in the Federal Republic from the UN Children's Convention, and thereby to create the conditions necessary for the harsh treatment of families and children generally found in expulsion cases to lose its legal sanction."
"The way it treats children and children's rights demonstrates whether a society thinks might is right, or whether by its treatment of weaker members it shows the right of its might."
"That must also apply, of course, to children in the Clovis Nursery, to which a child of one of my assistants belongs."
"Mr President, a few days ago an eight-year-old child was brutally raped, then beaten and finally burnt; his remains were scattered around."
"Three people were responsible for the crime, with instincts more bestial than human; three people who hid their baseness and perversion behind a facade of social respectability."
"This is the latest in a series of episodes involving child victims, and torturers and their accomplices, whole families or isolated individuals or groups of senseless people."
"What is striking is the climate of social conspiracy that surrounds these episodes and the fact that they only come to light after something irreparable happens."
"Skilled psychologists, famous sociologists and eminent MPs try to convince us that this is not happening to any greater degree than in the past, but we just hear about it more through the media; however, this is a pitiful and awful lie as so many cases of violence to minors have never taken place in other periods of history."
"The ideological assumption made by the left that any message relating to sexual issues, even the most contorted, has a right to exist has proved tragically wrong because not all those who receive it have the same cultural and social defences and not everyone has the same capacity to control their own instinctive impulses."
"All the falsely progressive legislators who would have liked to free sexuality from the chains of hypocrisy have not only freed absolutely nothing, but as sexuality has taken on different but fundamentally similar expressions in all eras, they have only managed to ensure that the weakest individuals with limited inhibitions consider sex to be a consumer good to be obtained at all costs, even with money and violence."
"The Press in Slovakia"
"Mr von Habsburg, you received congratulations yesterday, but I believe it is your birthday today, and that gives me the opportunity to congratulate you once more most sincerely."
"Thank you very much Madam President."
"I am very pleased to be able to bring you good news on this day, for once."
"We have just received a communique about our resolution concerning the Slovak Government's measures against the Slovak press."
"The Slovak Parliament has resolved largely to reject these measures or so to rephrase them, that we have the impression that a real battle for press freedom in Slovakia has been won here."
"This is of great significance because it shows yet again that, if one really confronts a matter, one is successful."
"That is our good fortune, because the Slovaks are one of the most likeable races in Europe."
"They are good people who have suffered a great deal throughout their history, and yet still believe in their faith and their homeland."
"Today they have a Prime Minister who follows a most unfortunate policy and, particularly with regard to minorities, behaves in a manner which we cannot in any way countenance."
"That is why Slovakia has fallen behind in its negotiations with the European Union, although things would doubtless have gone better under a better Prime Minister."
"This development at least shows that we are progressing in the right direction, and we can say that we no longer need this resolution."
"As a result of our experience with Mr Meciar, however, we should restore the matter at once, were the Parliament's resolution not to be obeyed."
"Let that be sign of good faith on our part."
"At the same time, it should be a signal to the Slovak people that if policies which accord with our standards are followed there, the door to European Union stands wide open for Slovakia."
"As a result, at least speaking on behalf of the first signatory sitting next to me, my son, may I say that we withdraw this resolution, but with the thought that should Mr Meciar not abide by his parliament's resolution, our resolution will be reintroduced in December."
"Madam President, according to my information, the situation, unfortunately, is not as good as Mr von Habsburg has said."
"Only one committee in the Slovakian Parliament has proposed modifying the suggested increase in the threshold rate of VAT to 23 % The rest of the Parliament would appear to be intent on voting tomorrow on the 23 %."
"So, unfortunately, the optimism is premature."
"I intend to withhold my proposal because it is important that we bring pressure to bear as the elections approach."
"Journalists in the country are very anxious."
"The government party could and should do something but so far we have heard nothing."
"The formal decision in parliament has not changed things."
"Therefore, I will withhold my resolution."
"At the same time, I wish to ask the Commissioner if, in the light of the recent memorandum on the language situation, she thinks that the government's proposal to do nothing has taken Slovakia nearer to fulfilling European Union membership criteria."
"We know that there is now a very precise language law at state level but only constitutional references for the situation of the different minorities."
"Madam President, I would like to agree with Mrs Thors, because, according to the information which I was given very recently by the Chair of the Slovakian delegation, it does not amount to much more than what Mrs Thors explained just now."
"It is therefore by no means certain that the Slovakian Parliament will reject the proposal to increase VAT on publications."
"We must point out therefore that this is a form of tax which will lead to fewer newspapers and magazines being read - as all taxes are regulatory, after all -, and this is an extremely serious situation, not only with respect to freedom of the press, but also democracy."
"Now I have to say that I have some difficulty, as our own Bureau of Parliament has just decided to impose all manner of restrictions on journalists."
"You might almost being to think that it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black, but still, I would like to stress that what is happening in Slovakia is unacceptable, and that what is happening here is also unacceptable."
"Madam President, whilst I do not entirely share the views of Mr von Habsburg, on this his birthday, as far as all aspects of his speech are concerned, I do agree entirely with his statement that we have had good news today."
"I believe this is information which, as I understand it, comes from European sources and suggests to us that we should be sending a positive response as a result of this action by Slovakia."
"We should be well advised not to put this resolution to a vote today."
"On behalf of my group I should like to withdraw our signature from this joint motion."
"If it does come to a vote, we in the Socialist Group will act accordingly."
"I am very pleased that the matter has taken this turn."
"It is a sign that in a country such as Slovakia, too, there can be developments in mutual relations in the most positive sense."
"I do not think we should endanger that and have a detrimental influence on events by adopting positions which we are unable to alter at a later stage."
"I should ask, therefore, for us to proceed accordingly."
"Madam President, I can only agree with the previous speaker."
"I am almost embarrassed to face Mrs Thors, because I always thought I was the hardliner here, and now she is clearly a harder hardliner than I am."
"I think it is good news which we have just received and we should bear in mind the fact that the full delegation will be meeting next week with the Slovaks."
"Having had good news we now hope that it proves to be true and that the delegation will get the opportunity over the next few weeks to debate it."
"I also think we should reserve our position to return even more firmly to this point next month, should the news prove not to be true."
"On this occasion, however, I should like to say on behalf of my group that we shall withhold our signatures and also vote accordingly."
"Agrarian reform in the Philippines"
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is interesting to see what is taking place out in the Philippines."
"There is a Ministry of Land Reform - the European Union has participated since 1986 in this programme to the tune of tens of millions - yet the local Minister has nothing better to do than to redistribute back to large landowners land already given to the farmers."
"Simultaneously one of the farmers' leaders, one Romeo Cortez, and Gaudencio Devaras, chairman of a community, have been kidnapped by the military."
"The farmers were successful in using a hunger strike to get President Ramos to return the land to them on this occasion."
"We must press the Commission to demand coherent policies in the Philippines."
"I can tell you from my own experience working with landless farmers in Brazil, that a country can very quickly deteriorate in this way, or even be driven into civil war."
"We can see that in Columbia. Such conflicts are very vicious and we must insist that, if we are to participate with money, an end is put to this situation."
"Madam President, there is, unfortunately, a long history of struggle for the redistribution of land to the poor and landless in the Philippines but its bitterness has not diminished over recent years."
"The fact that the European Union has devoted very considerable funds to enable the comprehensive land reform bill to be carried out underlines the importance which we have put upon it."
"Unfortunately, however, there have been serious setbacks to its implementation and the recent strike by 20 farmers in Manilla over the return of land to a large landowner illustrates this."
"This, however, is only one of the cases of land being distributed and then returned to a former owner."
"Another matter of deep concern is the disappearance of leaders of the people, R. Cortez and G. de Varez, which shows that there are forces which are prepared to use violence and prevent land reform."
"There are also reports of torture."
"This resolution is an appeal to President Ramos and his government fully to maintain the policy of land reform against all opposition and to ensure also that these disappearances are fully investigated."
"All these acts should be stopped and every effort by the government should be made to counter them and those responsible should, if possible, be brought to book."
"This resolution further calls on the President and his government to take action on other issues."
"We are against capital punishment and we hope that the sentences of death imposed on certain people at the present time will be commuted."
"The European Parliament has been deeply concerned to support democratic development in the Philippines over the years and we very much hope that our resolution today will be taken very seriously."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Malaysia"
"Madam President, recently another ten political activists were arrested in Malaysia on account of their Islamic convictions, and specifically on the basis of the lnternal Security Act."
"This is the umpteenth example of lack of respect for basic human rights in Malaysia."
"Experiences in Algeria and Egypt show that suppression is not the answer to differing religious beliefs."
"The internal security law is a law which the Malaysian government clearly uses against every form of political opposition."
"This same government has made several promises to alter this rigorous law, but this never happened."
"At the end of last month big demonstrations had been organized by NGOs, including Amnesty International, to call for the abolition of the law."
"It goes without saying that we support this call, and I believe that a democratic state requires an independent legal system."
"The Union, this Parliament and the Commission must, by mutual agreement, try to raise the recent arrests with Malaysia, perhaps in an ASEAN context, and to plead for their release or for fair trial."
"Chittagong Hill Tracts"
"Madam President, the problem of the Chittagong Hill Tracts is not well known, however it concerns a large region which is relatively well populated; this is a region which, we could say, has been somewhat abandoned by the world, and in which for long years, perhaps thirty or forty, in fact since the partition of India after the war, a problem has existed which has never been confronted with the desired strength and will."
"The first use of this resolution is, in my opinion, to address a friendly invitation to the government of Bangladesh to resolutely confront the problem in this region, to ""get rid of it' to a certain extent by according real autonomy - autonomy and not independence - to the population in this part of its territory."
"These people have their own specific identity and traditions, and in resolving this issue, the government could perhaps devote itself more resolutely to other problems which affect its large country."
"The conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts arose from the attempts of past governments to settle part of their expanding populations in the area in total disregard of the rights of the indigenous people, without respect for the autonomy which they once enjoyed."
"The resistance of these peoples and the brutal attempts of past Bangladeshi governments to crush this led to gross violations of human rights of which the non-combatants were frequently victims."
"Large numbers of the original population lost their lives and many of the survivors were forced to flee."
"Thousands still languish in camps."
"The present government of Bangladesh, the Awami League Government, has, to its great credit, sought to achieve a peace agreement and the seventh round of the talks on this is set for 26 November."
"It is sad that the opposition parties in Bangladesh are opposing this because it offers the only real hope of bringing this terrible conflict to an end."
"The basic cause of the problem is overpopulation in Bangladesh and the settlers often come from very poor families who hope for a better life."
"We recognize this problem."
"It is, however, totally unacceptable that the land rights of the indigenous population should not be fully recognized."
"Refugees must be allowed to return on terms which enable them to resettle, preferably those of the 20-point economic package."
"It is in the interest, not only of the indigenous peoples of this region, but all the peoples of Bangladesh that this conflict, costly in both resources and lives, should be settled and peace should be restored."
"I appeal to this House to support the resolution and for the European Union and the Commission to do everything possible to monitor and to assist in the process."
"Madam President, I should naturally like to thank the author, Mr Dupuis, and also Mr Newens, for the fact that they particularly mentioned settlement policy in this region. I think there is a big problem here, which is manifest not just in this area but in many."
"This is that the original inhabitants have a real right to their land; that is their culture, their life, the whole core of their existence, and just because they have no piece of paper to certify this current Bangladeshi law says that only those possessing such a piece of paper has a right to own land. In most cases those will be settlers who arrive later."
"In 1947 there were about 10, 000 settlers there who had not originated directly from the Chittagong Hills Tracts."
"In 1977 there were about 100, 000, and today the number already runs into seven figures."
"It is clear from this that a huge policy is being pursued in this direction, such that we actually have to say that it conflicts with basic human rights and that we as the European Parliament, which invests a great deal in Bangladesh, have got to make a clear statement in support of the Jumma people 's rights."
"Silvia Baraldini"
"Madam President, it is with heavy hearts that we again raise our voices in defence of the human rights of a political prisoner in the United States: the Italian and European citizen Silvia Baraldini, ailing in the penitentiary of Danbury, Connecticut, after having served fourteen and a half years of a 43-year sentence for a youthful association with a revolutionary Afro-American movement."
"Her incrimination and sentencing did not indicate personal involvement in acts of violence leading to bloodshed. We read in the rejection of her appeal four months ago by the local Parole Board that she is supposed to have had foreseeable knowledge of the crimes being committed by her associations."
"Note, not 'knowledge' but 'foreseeable knowledge ' - a very peculiar notion indeed of guilt by our standards of justice."
"It is not our intention here to criticize or interfere with the judicial system of the United States."
"The purpose of this resolution - the third in three years - is to ask our American friends to abide by the terms of an international treaty - the Strasbourg Convention on transfer of foreign detainees to their country of origin - a treaty that has been signed and ratified by Italy and the United States."
"We do not ask for the freedom of Mrs Baraldini but for her transfer to an Italian jail where she could at least be visited by her 80-year-old mother."
"We ask for an act of compassion on humanitarian grounds."
"During her long detention she has been operated on twice for cancer of the uterus."
"Seven years ago she lost in tragic circumstances her sister, Marina - a highly-esteemed official in the European Communities in Brussels."
"Since last July her physical and psychological state has been deteriorating rapidly, while the rules and conditions regarding her incarceration are becoming stricter and more unbearable."
"We ask the American authorities not to ignore, as they have done until now, the appeals and resolutions of this House, the mood and the emotions of Italian and European public opinion."
"The transfer of Mrs Baraldini to Italy would not only be an act of justice and humanity but also a great contribution to that transatlantic dialogue that has dominated our debates in this session of the European Parliament."
"Madam President, Silvia Baraldini's case has now become a symbol in the fight for the assertion, at international level, of the most elementary principles of justice and freedom and respect for human rights."
"With every day that passes, Silvia Baraldini's life is in greater danger owing to an absurd verdict and an absurdly long sentence and owing to terrible conditions of imprisonment and psychological pressure."
"With every day that passes without the problem of Silvia Baraldini's transfer to an Italian prison being resolved, the internal and international credibility of the United States and its legal system become more compromised."
"The European Parliament is still drawing up the resolution that we are preparing to vote on the same request made in the past, a very simple request: that the Strasbourg Convention at least be applied so that Silvia Baraldini can return, even in prison, to her own country."
"We hope that the US political and judicial authorities respond to a request for justice that is receiving unanimous consent in Europe."
"Madam President, everything has been said."
"It is not the first time we are dealing with the case of Silvia Baraldini in the Chamber of this Parliament."
"It is to be hoped that this time our position will have greater success than in the past."
"The new aspect is the extension of the prison sentence and the worsening of Silvia Baraldini's health: these are the aspects which, from the point of view of gravity, add to the arguments already recalled by Mr Manisco and Mr Vecchi."
"For these reasons, on behalf of my group as well, I support the proposed resolution submitted by Mr Manisco."
"Madam President, may I start by responding to the speeches on the rights of children, and by expressing how much the Commission agrees with this Parliament that abusing defenceless children is one of the most loathsome and reprehensible crimes, and that it needs to be combatted with all possible means."
"The Commission is also involved in the fight against this evil, and in particular in the fight against child trafficking and child abuse in accordance with the aide-mémoire which Mrs Gradin sent in September 1996."
"At the level of the Member States, the Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs had as far back as 24 February 1994 given its approval to a joint action to fight human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children."
"In addition the Commission is presently investigating the possibilities of an European approach to the problem of missing children."
"Furthermore, the Commission is managing the so-called Stop programme, the joint action by the Ministers of Justice and Homel Affairs from 1996, for which over five years, ECU 6.5 million was made available to support people who are professionally responsible for, amongst other things, the fight against human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of children."
"This includes support programmes for judges, law enforcement offices, and social workers."
"Then there is the Daphne initiative, on the basis of which ECU 3 million a year has been made available to assist nongovernmental and voluntary organizations in amongst combatting violence against children."
"The Commission is also implementing the policy against child sex tourism."
"It is about to approve a statement concerning an action plan for the promotion of safe use of the Internet."
"This action plan will stimulate measures such as those proposing action against illegal material such as child pornography."
"In its external policy, the European Commission will make an active contribution towards the more general problem of child labour."
"This is on the agenda of the 86th Session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva in June next year."
"According to the International Labour Organization, included in extreme forms of child labour or the use, entrapment, or supplying of children for prostitution or pornographic display."
"Finally, the external policy of the European Union includes programmes for the protection of human rights; in this context resources will also be made available to fight the sexual exploitation of children."
"Before closing the issue of child abuse, Madam President, I would like to give a quick response to several remarks which have been made this afternoon about the events in the Clovis crèche, where, as everyone knows, children of European Commission officials attend."
"I would like to emphasize first of all, that this case is undoubtedly regrettable, but that it is being investigated by the Belgian judicial authorities, and that a judicial inquiry was set up by the Public Prosecutor in Brussels in the middle of June this year, and the inquiry is still taking place."
"Secondly I can report that on 14 November the Public Prosecutor made a statement to the press, in which he said that cooperation with the European Union on this inquiry is progressing well, and in which he pointed to the need for discretion whilst the inquiry is still being conducted, and that such discretion and reticence had been expressly sought by the parents of the children in question."
"To conclude, the Commissioner responsible for personnel and administration has had a talk with the parents in question."
"I would like to correct the incorrect impression that the Commission would in any way be concealing a responsibility, which is not in the first instance the Commission's, particularly as it concerns such a delicate issue in which the Commission naturally feels most definitely involved."
"Then the next topic discussed was press freedom in Slovakia."
"But let me first of all join this House in the warmest wishes to Mr von Habsburg on his 85th birthday, whom I also congratulate on behalf of the Commission, and I would like to add the wish that he be preserved for many more years for the European electorate; if I may put it like this."
"Madam President, on the issue of the press in Slovakia different reports are clearly spreading at present concerning the fate of the Slovakian government's proposal to increase VAT on newspapers, amongst other things, from the low rate of 6 % to 23 %."
"I do not know the definite outcome, other than that it is presently being discussed in the Slovakian Parliament."
"I would like to agree wholeheartedly with the remarks made in this Parliament, and at this stage I would like limit myself to saying that there is nothing we can do other than tell the Slovakian Parliament and government that we would like to do everything possible to prevent doubt from emerging about the Slovakian government's efforts to protect fundamental human rights, such as freedom of speech and press freedom, that doubt might be sown about the Slovakian government's efforts to in any way ignore these principles which are highly represented in the European Union."
"With this we express the hope that the Slovakian Parliament will want to be in touch with the Slovakian association of publishers and with the Slovakian press before a definite decision is taken on this proposal."
"I would also like to say toward Mr von Habsburg that in Agenda 2000 the Commission took a critical view of the political situation in Slovakia, but it did conclude that Slovakia should not form part of Europe, that Slovakia will not be assisted and supported as the Slovakian government is prepared to be serious about the principles of democracy."
"As far as this is concerned, Bratislava can count on our efforts and support."
"The Commission will continue to devote considerable attention to this issue, also in the context of the partner nariate agreements with Slovakia."
"I would finally like to express the hope that soon, Slovakia, too, will be included amongst those to whom, politically speaking, no criticism is due, when its the application for entry to the European Union is judged."
"With regards to the situation in Malaysia - I believe Mr Bertens spoke about this - we would like to see the issues concerning the internal security law remain negotiable with the Malaysian government."
"But I should say this."
"As part of the discussion about Malaysia and the ASEAN countries, a question has been asked in this House about the extent to which our relationship with these countries is governed by human rights clauses, such as those we include in all our external agreements with third countries."
"Mr Bertens will know that the cooperation with ASEAN has been institutionalized around an agreement signed in 1980; it has been argued on numerous occasions that it should be updated, and should be adapted to present circumstances and relations with the ASEAN countries."
"This implies at the same time that a new agreement of this kind should contain such a human rights clause."
"Up until now it has not only been a problem to come to such an agreement from the ASEAN side, but also from the side of the European Council, as the problems in East Timor are still playing a part in this."
"Madam President, I hope to be able to say that in the long term these obstacles can be removed, and that the problems will be solved."
"And I should add that until now we have not encountered any resistance from Malaysia when discussing these issues, nor when it concerned sensitive human rights issues."
"Then there is the issue of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh, Mr President. It seems that the present peace negotiations - there have been 6 rounds of talks since October last year - currently held under the presidency of the National Commission for the Chittagong Hill Tracts, have succeeded in bridging the gap between government's and the rebel leaders' positions."
"The European Commission is following the peace process in Dhaka very closely."
"Once the agreement has been signed, the Commission will consider supporting the implementation of the peace process, in consultation of course with all those closely involved."
"The government of Bangladesh appreciates the Union and other development partners' interest in supporting the peace process, and of course the offer of financial assistance for rehabilitation of repatriated refugees, and the reintegration of Bangladesh in Chittagong."
"Even so the government of Bangladesh has, in view of the sensitive nature of situation, asked the international donors to wait until the peace agreement is operational, and the situation has been stabilized."
"A minimum amount of political stability and sufficient security are of course necessary before we can see how reintegration and development can be stabilized and implemented."
"Finally, Madam President, Silvia Baraldini's fate."
"It has been discussed a number of times in this House."
"We know that in fact we only say it is primarily a bilateral affair between the United States and Italy."
"On behalf of the Commission I agree with those who pointed out the fact that this seems to be a clear case where the Convention of Strasbourg should apply; this was also ratified by the United States and Italy."
"We would therefore appreciate its letter being complied with."
"Madam President, I believe the Commissioner has forgotten to make a statement on the Philippines."
"At any rate, I heard nothing."
"I should like very much to have some information on the situation."
"My apologies, Madam President, but having read the resolution I had understood that it was directed primarily at President Ramos and not at the European Commission in its request for support."
"That is why I had not prepared a response to this."
"But I would be quite happy to read through the resolution while the next matter is discussed to see if there is anything which gives good reason for the Commission to respond."
"But I dare not do so without preparing myself and being able to seek justification."
"Thank you very much Mr Commissioner. I assume Mr Kreissl-Dörfler is in agreement with that."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following resolution motions:"
"(B4-0932/97) by Mrs Frutos Gama and Mrs García Arias, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the flood disaster in the Autonomous Community of Extremadura autonomous region; -(B4-0957/97) by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the serious effects of the storm in Spain; -(B4-0991/97) by Mr Novo Belenguer and Mr González Triviño, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the flooding in Badajoz; -(B4-0933/97) by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the serious effects of the storm in the Azores; -(B4-0981/97) by Mr Marinho and Mr Correia, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the storms in the Azores; -(B4-0939/97) by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left on the serious consequences of the storm in Portugal; -(B4-0969/97) by Mr Azzolini and others, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on the storms in Portugal; -(B4-0983/97) by Mr Marinho and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the storms and floods in southern Portugal; -(B4-0956/97) by Mr Capucho and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the recent floods in the regions of Extremadura (Spain), Alentejo (Portugal) and the Azores."
"Spain"
"Madam President, once again, devastation caused by floods is the subject of a motion for a resolution in Parliament's topical and urgent debate."
"Storms in Spain and Portugal have again left a trail of deaths, injuries and missing persons in their wake."
"Whilst it is true that this type of disaster is in general difficult to avoid, it is no less true that the effects of these floods could have been less serious if certain measures had been taken in time."
"It is no coincidence that disasters of this kind vent their fury on the most depressed areas of the European continent."
"Nevertheless, what happened in Melilla on Monday - when a 20, 000 cubic metre reservoir burst its banks - was the chronicle of a tragedy foretold."
"Nine deaths and 41 injured persons, as well as incalculable material losses, is the provisional toll of this disaster, which, far from being the product of fate is the result of pure negligence."
"At present, I do not wish to apportion blame, which in any case must be established by the Spanish authorities, but to use this opportunity, as both a Member of the European Parliament and a citizen of Melilla, to call on the European Commission to provide urgent aid for the families of the victims, for those who have totally or partially lost their homes or businesses, and - in short - for all those who in one form or another have suffered material losses."
"Furthermore, I wish to urge the Commission to establish, in collaboration with the Spanish authorities, a rehabilitation plan for the areas affected by these disasters, and to make available the necessary funds for the reconstruction of infrastructure, housing and, in the case of Estremadura, the farming, stockbreeding and tourist facilities affected."
"Finally, I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to call on the Commission to examine the possibility of revising Community environmental legislation with a view to ensuring that the obligatory environmental impact assessments are accompanied by an appraisal of the risks to the local population posed by operations affecting the environment."
"Disasters like the flooding in Estremadura and the flood in Melilla could undoubtedly be avoided if the Member States' authorities and the Commission put more effort into fulfilling one of their most important duties: guaranteeing the safety of all citizens."
"The Azores"
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since our request at the partsession in Brussels on 4 November that Parliament send a message of sympathy to the people of Ribeira Quente, and our subsequent submission to the President of this House of an urgent draft resolution to take measures to alleviate the effects of the storms which have devastated the Azores; since that date, huge mainland areas of my country - the Alentejo, the Algarve, metropolitan Lisbon, Setubal and the Tagus Valley - have also been laid waste by devastating storms."
"I regret that there are further deaths to be recorded."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the storms have left 41 people dead or unaccounted for in Portugal, apart from many injured."
"According to relatively modest estimates, the losses suffered by private individuals, public bodies and businesses amount to over 10 billion escudos."
"The tremendous human chain of solidarity between the people that immediately formed from one end of Portugal to the other, is something that deserves to be recorded and commended, and I would like to mention it in this House."
"I would also like to express similar sentiments to the local authorities and their services and to the fire brigade."
"We are today applying to the Commission for financial support in addition to the existing instruments, with the object of mitigating the effects of the disaster and providing support to the people caught up in these human dramas."
"We are also requesting the Commission, and in my view this is the most important thing, to set up a system with the authorities in my country to provide financial and technical support and cooperation in technology and research to enable us to predict and prevent the recurrence of the devastating effects of storms which it is unfortunately beyond our powers to avoid."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, once again, and within a relatively short space of time, the autonomous region of the Azores has been lashed by hurricane-force winds and torrential rain, which struck the region at dawn on 31 October, causing particular devastation in the parish of Ribeira Quente, in the district of Povoação."
"I regret to say that, apart from massive material damage, which according to our information represents a cost of over five billion escudos, we have to mourn 29 dead."
"It is against the background of this sad fact that we wish to state the importance of introducing an article into the Amsterdam Treaty providing for the individual and specific treatment of the ultra-peripheral regions. The Commission should recognize the disadvantages and risks to which these citizens of the European Union are subject."
"In that context, we appeal to the Commission to turn its attention to re-scheduling and reinforcing the financial resources already allocated to the recovery of the infrastructures which have been destroyed in the autonomous region of the Azores."
"The fact that these situations have repeated themselves leads us to state that, in future, the Regis initiative should contain an element designed to make it possible to deal with natural disasters."
"Portugal"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the facts of these disasters have been related either by the press or by my colleagues who have spoken before me."
"Naturally, I do not propose to go over them again. I would merely like to put together three thoughts on the matter."
"As we have already heard, these disasters happen in the most depressed areas of Europe, whether it be in the ultraperipheral region of the Azores, Estremadura in Spain or the Alentejo in Portugal."
"This shows that the European Union must go on supporting those areas."
"Certainly there may have been negligence, certainly there may have been errors in the planning and development of the areas, but the truth is that there are infrastructural deficiencies which we must make good."
"Secondly, it is important that the Commission should provide material support, because that is another way of showing solidarity with the people involved."
"Solidarity on the part of the Commission will naturally strengthen the sense of being European and will make people feel there are other Europeans who stand with them in times of difficulty."
"This therefore is a matter not only of material but also of political importance, and if we may say so, of solidarity."
"One final note. We consider - and my group has already pleaded this case here - that the Commission ought to have a response mechanism for these situations."
"This type of aid should be institutionalized, since it would make it possible to inspect the consequences of such disasters in situand also to take immediate measures to deal with them in conjunction with national governments."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, the serious and dramatic situation caused by the floods to a greater or lesser extent all over Portugal justifies the use of Community funds."
"We now need to know whether those funds will be coming out of monies already allocated to Portugal by rescheduling the present Community aid programme, or with new, additional sums provided by way of emergency relief, or again by increasing the budget and, for example amending the framework letter of the INTERREG II-C Community initiative, as has been requested in the Resolution of the European Parliament."
"The question here is whether, in the light of the efforts expended by the Fire Brigade, Autonomous Authorities, municipal councils, police and military authorities in their response to the disaster, and prompt action by the Governments of the Republic and the Region, the Commission can make no better response than a restricted and academic view of the Community rules."
"People - and people are the reason why the Community project exists - will not accept it."
"The Commission cannot afford to forget this!"
"In a disaster situation we cannot respond with technical rigidity, POs, QCAs, deflectors, PMs and other Community jargon initials."
"Common sense and goodwill are VITAL!"
"Spain/Portugal/The Azores"
"Madam President, I wish to express my sorrow at all the human and material losses caused by the disasters referred to in the motion."
"But I should like to refer especially to the floods that occurred in the Badajoz region on 6 November, causing 25 deaths and considerable material losses in the form of goods and equipment, housing and businesses."
"At the same time, however, I should like to underline the admirable solidarity that not only the authorities but the people of Estremadura, and the Spanish population as a whole, have shown in the face of this tragedy."
"It is therefore only natural that the European Parliament should take part in this solidarity by calling for concrete action to rectify this terrible situation."
"There will be time later to draw up measures to ensure that disasters of this type do not reoccur, such as requiring all urban projects to be accompanied by impact assessments that take account of the possibility of flooding."
"Madam President, the floods which have recently brought disaster to some regions, particularly in Portugal, are a cause for struggle and also food for thought on the policies we should follow."
"When 41 people have died in Portugal and 25 in Spain, our first words must be of distress at their loss, and of condolence with their families in their grief."
"It is to be hoped that the responsible national and Community organizations will provide the essential resources. We plead, as some of our colleagues have already pleaded, for immediate action and additional aid."
"Finally, the grief we feel obliges us to reflect on the conditions that caused, or at any rate aggravated, the consequences of the storms."
"It has become clear that means of relief in times of disaster are insufficient, because they largely depend on voluntary action by citizens themselves."
"Apart from that, it is important that due attention should at last start being given to forms of territorial planning and development that recognize that you cannot fight against nature."
"On the contrary, nature should be preserved and made to serve mankind in a proper way."
"Madam President, Commissioner, it is not possible to put a price on the human lives lost in disasters."
"And it is not simply a question of calling for economic aid to alleviate the effects of the disasters that are the subject of this motion for a resolution."
"It is also a question of fulfilling our duty of solidarity as citizens of Europe."
"In Melilla, as in Estremadura and in Portugal, considerable human and material losses have been caused."
"The European Commission and the local and national authorities cannot remain deaf to the appeals of Parliament - the voice of this disaster's victims, who are demanding solutions to their immediate problems. And words of condolence and solidarity will not suffice."
"A large number of people in Melilla have not only lost members of their families, but have been left without a home, or have seen their businesses and livelihoods destroyed."
"What can be more important than that?"
"Let us - at least, the Members of this Parliament - avoid entering into legal or political battles which do not fall within our area of competence. And let us avoid increasing, with our hesitancy, the despair of those who are calling on the public authorities - including the European authorities - for the material and technical aid with which, in all justice, they should immediately be provided."
"Madam President, I am sure that this was an oversight, but the Commissioner neglected to express his condolences to the victims of a disaster in another Spanish and European city: Melilla."
"Madam President, echoing what my colleague, Mr Hernández Mollar, just said, I should also like to hear what the Commissioner has to say about Melilla, which has also recently been the victim of a disaster that has hit the headlines throughout the media."
"Madam President, I would be extremely glad to rectify that."
"It was an involuntary omission."
"That surely makes the matter clear."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m., which is in two minutes."
"Votes"
"Mr President, the Commission's action plan for the single market, backed by the von Wogau report, presents an extreme vision of an internal market with largely unified laws and taxation, without any internal borders, and a single currency, in other words a market in which the independence of nations has largely disappeared."
"Furthermore, this unified market would have relatively vague external limits, since it would have to respect the EU's commitment to a free world market."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties had misgivings about the relentlessness of the European Commission in organizing mobility of the work-force between Member States, and in its opinion it wisely specifies that, of course, even if mobility can be encouraged, it is far from certain that people can be invited or forced to leave one Member State to go to another in order to find a job."
"But this nuance must have been held to endanger universal unification and was not included in the final report of Parliament."
"The Amsterdam Council on 16 and 17 June welcomed this action plan."
"Of course it also suggested that priority measures must be selected, but did not say which ones, and approved the general objective which, it said, would require political support so as to hasten the adoption of legislative measures for implementation."
"Yet this position is surprising when we know that the action plan includes measures as radical as the installation within five years from now of a new system of VAT, based on the country of origin principle."
"There is even a staggering passage in the plan, where we discover that the Commission should be able to implement urgent measures against countries which do not meet their obligations by adopting sanctions if need be. The strengthening of the executive powers of the Commission will contribute to the reduction of delays in solving problems."
"This action plan provides for both the obliteration of nations in the face of the internal market, and then the obliteration of the internal market in the face of the world market, and all of this is accompanied with the discretionary power of the Commission to make countries yield."
"In France and elsewhere there may be those in power who will subscribe to this, but I think that their people will one day ask them for an explanation."
"The report contains a series of points that we absolutely cannot support."
"First of all, we do not believe that the Member Statesʼ value-added taxes have anything whatsoever to do with the European Union."
"Nor can we back general formulations aimed at reducing the taxation of work in order to promote employment or adjust the excise duties."
"The report requires the establishment of three new European agencies and regulatory authorities for air safety, telecommunications and the approval of food additives and agricultural chemicals."
"Setting up centralistic authorities of this kind simply results in the production of more documents without leading to any appreciable change in the actual situation."
"Furthermore, we definitely cannot back the proposal made in point 12 of the report."
"Creating a common currency for the European Union would also create permanent unemployment."
"One thing leads to the other."
"When the internal market was about to be introduced, it was stated in the debate that the area of taxation would not under any circumstances be affected."
"Now it transpires that this area too is to become part of the EUʼs regulatory framework, which according to the report is to include such things as harmonized rates of taxation and a standard rate of VAT."
"I cannot back this."
"The nation states must have the freedom to determine for themselves at what level the rates of taxation are to be set; this is necessary in part in order to ensure that the public sector can apply the level that the citizens consider is appropriate in the state in question."
"Nor can I agree to the content of point 12, which unilaterally embraces the single currency, since I do not believe that EMU is to the advantage of the EUʼs citizens."
"The internal market should have come into effect fully on 1 January 1993."
"This was not the case."
"I agree with many of the criticisms made by the Commission, but note at the same time that this report clearly shows that the Member States are neither willing nor able to proceed so quickly."
"The report is a clear example that the proposals about the internal market are not keeping in step with the wishes of the Member States."
"The committee goes far beyond a mere free internal market by proposing harmonization of VAT legislation, common regulations for the taxation of capital and uniform regulations for the area of company law, introduction of the common currency and a common economic policy."
"This I cannot accept, and I have therefore voted no to the report."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the von Wogau report, which deals with the effect and the effectiveness of theiInternal market."
"The report is in accordance with the thrust of the Commissionʼs report."
"The Danish Social Democrats views the reportʼs recommendations regarding lower tax on labour in order to promote employment as positive."
"This is in accordance with the tax reform that the Danish government was able to introduce in 1993, which subsequently created more jobs."
"The report mentions a reduction in the VAT rates for small and medium-sized companies."
"The Danish Social Democrats do not agree with this position."
"The Danish Social Democrats believe that the route to a better employment situation must be through further investments and training of the European workforce."
"The trans-European network is cited in the report as an important element in the creation of an efficient infrastructure in the EC."
"The Danish Social Democrats regards this view as a positive one."
"Langen report (A4-0350/97)"
"The implementing regulations governing the EUʼs construction products directive are essential in order to allow for the application of the Directiveʼs regulations on labelling and standards for construction products."
"The Commission acknowledged in its report that it is a time-consuming task to draw up implementing regulations for the exceptionally large area in which construction products are used."
"The technical specifications that the materials need to satisfy are complex and vary considerably from one Member State to another."
"The report acknowledged these problems, but nevertheless invites the Commission to reduce the time-frame for implementation as much as possible."
"I am absolutely in agreement with the committee and the rapporteur on this point."
"Construction products account for a very considerable part of the EUʼs Internal Market, which is not yet free from barriers to trade."
"Faster implementation of the directive also requires flexibility and goodwill on the part of the Member States."
"This fact is underlined in the report, and I am pleased to be able to give it my full support."
"That concludes the votes ."
"Asylum, immigration and external border crossing (Odysseus programme)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0366/97) by Mrs Zimmermann, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Decision on a joint action adopted by the Council introducing a programme of training, exchanges and cooperation in the fields of asylum, immigration and crossing of external borders (Odysseus programme) (COM(97)364-9980/97 - C4-0427/97-97/0909(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the granting of asylum to political refugees, the acceptance of citizens from former colonies and the reception of people on telling humanitarian grounds are among the tasks which the European Union has undertaken since the Second World War."
"Since 1989 this range of tasks has received a new dimension, because large numbers of people have been arriving in western Europe from central and eastern european countries and the states of the former Soviet Union for economic reasons."
"Political action is urgently required."
"The governments of Member States of the European Union have raised asylum, immigration and border trespass to the status of subjects of special common interest."
"Member States are convinced that requirements in this field can only be met effectively and sensibly by joint action."
"Although there is consensus on this, Member States are hesitant about relinquishing authority to the European Union, despite the many statements about it."
"Previous agreements, particularly the Dublin Agreement, can only be looked on as a first, small step."
"Major effort and the will to find a common solution are necessary in order to fulfill the ambitious aims of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provides in the medium term for the so-called communalization of the subjects involved."
"This common measure which lies before us can be viewed, therefore, as a sign that the Council and Commission are prepared to undertake further efforts in this direction."
"For this they can be sure of the support of the European Parliament, which, despite the late consultation and short time for processing the matter, has been able to produce a complete and comprehensive report on the Odysseus programme."
"It is important to us that Parliament's opinion is particularly represented at the Luxembourg summit and can be included in it."
"It has based its views on the relevant Maastricht Treaty decisions concerning the European Union, but has always born the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam in mind."
"The European Parliament, therefore, would value being kept informed in detail on the progress of Odysseus, particularly where one year plans are concerned."
"It should also be possible for a list of priorities to be circulated, so that its items can be included in the one year plan."
"The Odysseus programme sets new standards of cooperation between Member States regarding asylum, immigration and exterior border trespass."
"The laws and procedures continue to be very varied."
"The aim of Odysseus is to bring them closer together."
"It is not the intention, however, for Member States to be brought closer by means of unified legislation, but by learning from one another by example."
"That will take place at the level of the officials who have to implement the regulations."
"They will not just become better informed by means of the projects sponsored by Odysseus, but will also learn how other Member States solve certain problems."
"It is valuable, for instance, to learn about the laws in different countries on uniting families."
"This can make clear that there are many valid solutions to one particular problem."
"I am assuming, therefore, that acceptance of the European Union's existing legislation in these fields will spread after the training of supporters within the Odysseus programme."
"Participants in the projects will then have knowledge available for use during the communication phase."
"I would expressly ask Member States to use this opportunity."
"It is much to be welcomed that countries applying for EU membership can also participate in the programme."
"In this way they will be given specific programme information about the institutional systems as well as the legal and administrative systems of participating Member States."
"This will, on the one hand, lead them closer to the standards of the Union, and, on the other, make cooperation with them in these areas much easier."
"The regulations in Member States for data protection must be safeguarded in the practical application of the programme."
"Only anonymous case histories taken from routine experience should be used in training exercises."
"Officials taking part in exchange visits who come into contact with original documents must be bound to secrecy about their contents."
"The Odysseus programme is based on experience gained from pilot projects in the Sherlock programme, which is now to be integrated into it."
"During its five year duration further useful experience will be gained, and this is to find constant reflection in the one year planning."
"Not only will Odysseus gain special value from this, but Odysseus and the common measure for protection of refugees also show that policies in these fields do not have to mean the destruction of Fortress Europe."
"On the contrary, these projects mean there is a chance for officials to see once again that there is a human element to their decisions."
"They bear just as much responsibility as any politician for seeing that people entering the European Union for political, economic or other motives are treated in a manner worthy of human beings."
"In the one year planning, therefore, the Commission should ensure provision for training, exchanges, research - not just in technical matters - and the checking of forged papers."
"Theoretical subjects, such as the rights of persons affected by administrative acts to information, legal advice and family unification, as well as, most especially, the rights of minors, must be covered."
"Certain NGOs have gained special expertise in this, and that should also be utilized as part of Odysseus."
"It is important, therefore, for ONACR and other inter-state institutions such as the International Organization for Migration to be encouraged to participate in these projects."
"Europe sees itself as the cradle of human rights."
"It also bears great international responsibility for refugees' rights."
"Odysseus is a programme that can play apart in allowing Europe to live up to these responsibilities."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Zimmermann on this excellent report, which was enriched by the collaboration of all the political groups, and whose subject, moreover, is an excellent programme: the Odysseus programme of training, exchanges and cooperation in the field of asylum, immigration and crossing of external borders."
"For someone like me, who lives in a border area - to be precise, the city of Melilla, which we have just been talking about, and which is on Spain and Europe's border with Morocco - and who witnesses daily the problems caused by immigration from the countries of North and Sub-Saharan Africa, the Odysseus programme is undoubtedly of particular interest."
"However, the first thing that I should like to say to Mrs Zimmermann is that immigrants are not criminals."
"I therefore believe that it is wrong to talk about ""combatting' immigration, and ""combatting' the entry and residence of immigrants."
"It would be better, in my view, to refer to legal or administrative measures, and leave talk of ""combatting' for those members of criminal organizations who use and abuse human beings, charging them money to transport them to our borders and advising them to destroy their identity documents in order to put themselves in an illegal situation and thereby prevent or hinder their expulsion from Community territory."
"It is therefore highly important to train officials in this field."
"In my view, this training should encompass three things: firstly, technical and professional training to enhance their knowledge of all the regulations governing immigration; secondly, provision of the necessary material resources to enable them to perform their functions in border areas with total assurance and effectiveness; and, thirdly, ensuring the ability to settle cases with sufficient flexibility to avoid delaying the resolution of waiting situations, which can give rise to breakdowns in reception centres, or require humanitarian assistance - which, with the resources of local or national authorities alone, it is not possible to provide with the dignity that everyone deserves - and which can also give rise to undesirable racist or xenophobic attitudes if they are prolonged."
"For example, human tragedies are being produced on an almost daily basis in the South of Spain, in which the victims are North African migrants trying to enter Europe who sadly die in the attempt."
"This programme must facilitate cooperation between not only officials, but also private organizations operating in this field."
"Borders are not desirable, but they are necessary."
"There is therefore also a need to avoid adopting a populist stance towards this urgent problem."
"I therefore believe that the proposed exchange of experience between officials, which have the difficult job of working in a field in which it is necessary to know how to combine humanitarian considerations with the application of the frigid regulations governing the different aspects of immigration, is very important."
"And I shall not conclude, Mr President, without underlining the responsibilities of third countries that a share a border with the Union, which must abide by the agreements on this subject that they have signed with the Member States."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to make it clear that our group will support this proposal."
"It is good, given improved cooperation."
"We also believe that the emphasis made by the committee is important, i.e. that the cooperation must expand and reinforce, and not merely maintain, what is already in place."
"At the same time, cooperation is to be developed with respect for the individualsʼ integrity."
"We must ensure that things do not occur for experimental purposes that we would not accept in other circumstances, e.g. the transfer of data in connection with Europol."
"I would like this programme to be able to lend weight to the cooperation with the applicant states."
"I am therefore pleased that Commissioner van den Broek is in place."
"We have a huge amount to gain - that is to say mankind has a huge amount to gain - from a reduction in the suffering that currently exists in the refugee camps in these countries."
"I am thinking especially of one camp in Lithuania which has been noted by numerous humanitarian organizations."
"There are a thousand refugees there waiting to be dealt with in some way."
"I hope that this programme will quickly be able to support the cooperation between EU countries and Lithuania in order to expedite their handling of the refugee issue."
"People who would like to return to their countries of origin are not being permitted to do so because the administration does not even sort this out."
"I therefore hope that Lithuania will be given priority, and appeal to the Commission to arrange this."
"I am also hoping for major participation from those Nordic countries that are outside the EU but participate in the Nordic customs union."
"It is my understanding that article 10 of the proposal makes this possible."
"The improved cooperation must also include them."
"Otherwise, perhaps we are forfeiting our Nordic customs union."
"At the same time, I would like to address a question to us all."
"This week we have discussed several programmes of this type, e.g. Fiscalis, Karolus, etc."
"Do we always need an exchange programme in order to bring about the improved cooperation to which we have committed ourselves politically and judicially?"
"I also want us to revise the question of administrative effectiveness, so that we have more horizontal rules for those provisions that are needed for financial control."
"But we do not always need to have them in detail in every single programme, as is currently the case, in order actually to comply with the Commissionʼs catchphrase less but better ."
"In conclusion, I would like to point out that there is, therefore, a need for further horizontal regulations for financial control."
"Mr President, the Odysseus programme aims to promote unequivocal implementation of the European asylum and immigration policy by training and better cooperation between national public services."
"More expertise, cooperation and uniformity are fine in principle, but unfortunately the treaties, resolutions and other instruments which have given shape to European asylum law over the past few years, not infrequently constitute a violation of the Geneva refugee treaty and of the European Treaty on Human Rights - international treaties the Member States are bound by."
"Better implementation of this substandard asylum policy is not by definition in the interest of refugees. And that is why my group has mixed feelings about Odysseus."
"Still it has to be said that the amendments in Mrs Zimmerman's report are generally aimed in the right direction."
"I hope that the Odysseus training schemes which will inform the civil servants in the Member States on the rights and responsibilities of the asylum seeker, will not ignore the contents of the asylum agreement or the relevant EVRM decrees, and that not only the restrictive interpretation of this by the European Union and its Member States will be an opportunity, but also the interpretation itself."
"The European Union shows shamefully little interest in this guardian of the refugee policy; the Treaty of Amsterdam protocol was ample proof of this."
"The Odysseus programme includes training in recognizing false documents, and I have a question about this for Commissioner van de Broek."
"IS Odysseus going to tell the civil servants concerned that if asylum seekers have false papers, this will not mean that they cannot be genuine refugees?"
"And is Odysseus also going to make this clear to the civil servants which Member States are increasingly posting at the airports of the countries of origin of asylum seekers, as extended forward border posts of fortress Europe?"
"Then there is the cooperation with the candidate Member States."
"It is fine that the candidate Member States are also able to participate in the Odysseus programme."
"But there is a big risk that the EU partners will merely teach them how to act better as a cordon sanitaire for us."
"My fellow group member Claudia Roth visited three Polish detention centres last year, and spoke to 122 detainees refugees some of whom had been returned by Germany."
"All 122 assumed that they were awaiting a decision about their application for asylum."
"But in reality only six applications were being considered."
"The Polish document which the others had signed, was not as they thought, an application for asylum."
"And we think of this country as a safe third country."
"If Odysseus will contribute to improved knowledge of the refugee treaty in Poland, I will be in favour of it."
"But something tells me that this is not the principal aim of Odysseus."
"Mr President, some surprises first of all."
"Firstly, in a text which deals with border crossing - external borders are understood, because in this situation internal borders should already have completely disappeared - the word Schengen is never mentioned."
"We should recognize that what is bothering us is not directly linked with this agreement, but the agreement is however the point of reference at the moment in Europe, especially as regards the movement of people."
"The second element which worries me and annoys me even more is the fact that in the great freedom of movement for capital, goods and individuals, it is human beings who seem to be paying most dearly."
"It only takes a few seconds, even a couple of milli-seconds for a million dollars to pass from the bank in Stockholm to Sydney."
"To go from Algiers to Paris, it will be necessary to go to the consulate a number of times, queue up and quite probably have your request refused after several weeks of fruitless effort."
"It is this which should remain at the forefront of our minds, and the main merit of this report, at least for me, is to force us to reflect on and debate basic freedoms again."
"If only here in the Parliament a large majority would mobilize to help ensure that these freedoms are protected, and if only the action of countries and governments were better coordinated, it will happen, and we will vote on it, of course we will be happy to vote on it, and, by the way I would also like to congratulate Mrs Zimmermann."
"But it is here at home in our own countries where the battle will be hard."
"Everyone knows the long road down which we will need to steer our own very sensitive administrations, which are prisoners to routine, and our civil servants who are often badly informed and constantly under pressure from their hierarchy to be the ones to prevent entry."
"This is true for the Member States and may be even more so for those now seeking entry, whose administrations for decades have used the vast majority of their time mainly to prevent their citizens from moving."
"As far as this report goes, with the exception of some clawed dragons with poisonous tongues - that was lucky, they are not here - of course a large majority will mobilize to ensure that these elements become properly coordinated and that we can do our work properly, but we must be aware that this is a long term undertaking."
"This is the very beginning of a battle which we will have to lead in our own countries."
"Mr President, before I go into Mrs Zimmerman's report I would like to say that I am pleased to be able to speak to her in our mother tongue, Dutch."
"Her report deals with an interesting and necessary programme."
"The ultimate aim of the programme is multi annual cooperation between the Member States' government services on asylum and immigration."
"To this end, training, exchange of civil servants and studies, and investigation are proposed."
"This is something we can fully support."
"Cooperation in these areas between Member States has become necessary since the single market without internal borders has come into being."
"In addition it is desirable for people working in this field to have a better understanding of each other's and the European Union's regulations."
"Only too often problems arise out of mutual misunderstanding of each other's legislation, or because national civil servants do not understand the Commission officials."
"By stimulating training and exchanges of this kind through this programme, the Union is investing sensibly in its future."
"As far as the future is concerned: I am very pleased that the aspiring members of Union will also be involved in this programme."
"This strikes me as extremely important."
"The report contains a lack of clarity which I would like to point out to Commissioner van den Broek and the rapporteur."
"In Amendment No 31 the European Parliament, without having been asked, augments the autonomy of the Commission in relation to the Council by increasing the said sum."
"At the same time the European Parliament restricts the autonomy of the Commission with Amendment Nos 15 and 17."
"Whereas the Commission has phrased the substantive elements on which action is to be based, fairly loosely, this Parliament has curtailed these with its additions."
"What is the Commission's position on this?"
"Finally, I would like to say that I think it is rather indelicate that the European Parliament in Amendment No 9 on article 1 is already referring to the decrees from the Treaty of Amsterdam, and is asking the Council to take these into consideration, whilst this treaty has not even been ratified by the various national parliaments in the Member States."
"It strikes me as an undemocratic attitude, and that we are running a bit ahead of ourselves, it seems to me."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Zimmermann has very profoundly explained the position o f Parliament on this common measure, so that I have no need to detail the views of the European Parliament on the Odysseus programme."
"I shall concentrate, therefore, on looking at the question of asylum, immigration and security of external borders from a different point of view."
"The European Union is a citizens' rights union."
"That is how we always describe it in the insider circle which meets here tonight."
"And so it should be."
"The European Union should also, therefore, guarantee the right to asylum, unified at the highest possible level for validity in all Member States."
"That means, though, that asylum law in the European Union has to be unified, i.e., it has to be communized."
"The Amsterdam treaty provided for this over a five year period."
"A unanimous Council decision blocked this, however, in the form of the so-called permanent national reservation, Mr President of the Council, but nevertheless, one is on the way to communizing the laws on asylum."
"The same applies to immigration policy."
"You may ask what asylum and immigration have to do with one another."
"If civil rights are to be guaranteed, and if victims of political persecution are to be guaranteed asylum, so that applications for asylum can be made in the European Union, then the European Union must declare what differentiates the politically persecuted applying for asylum from the immigrant who is not politically persecuted and must not be given the opportunity, or forced, to use asylum as a key to gaining entrance."
"If we want to avoid undermining asylum rights because of a lack of acceptance, with citizens of the European Union thinking that asylum seekers actually do not want asylum, but just the chance to immigrate, then we must have an immigration law to protect asylum law, and it should if possible not be split down into fifteen parts, but unified."
"Finally, if this is to function within the European Union, we need qualified security of the European Union's external borders, whose internal borders have already disappeared."
"I have had an opportunity of observing the Italian External Border Security Service, which is very keen and highly qualified."
"I looked at the Border Security element of the Italian Coastguard in the Bay of Naples."
"They are all excellent officers and I asked them what they saw as their status there. They stared at me, not having understood my question."
"I then asked if they were Italian or European officials - of course they are Italian: green, white and red."
"Their reply was that they had nothing to do with Europe."
"But that is not true."
"Since Italy became a full Schengen Member, and the borders between Austria, Italy, and Germany were thrown open, we have been aware that well organized gangs of human smugglers - this happened only yesterday - land ships on the Italian coast - yesterday it seems to have been with 800 Kurds on board whose objective was not Italy, but other European Union states."
"What is the significance of this for the other countries in the European Union?"
"It means that the Italian external border has become the German border, that it is also the Swedish border, and the French border, or that the border between Finland and Russia is now Italy's border, because anyone entering the European Union has freedom of movement, once he has been accepted by any Member State."
"We have a varying structure for external border defence in each of the States, however."
"In the long term that cannot function."
"We need unification of the external border defences."
"Mrs Zimmermann made mention of this in her report."
"The Odysseus programme for the training of individual national state officials is one important point, because the individual official, such as a Fin, must understand the significance of his job to his Italian colleague, and vice versa."
"In the final event, however, it will be of no avail if we do not take communizing steps in those areas where the European Union does not need increasing cooperation between states, but its own European laws."
"It is at this point that essential national interests are touched on."
"This is why Mrs Zimmermann's point, about harmonization being unavoidable as a sort of follow-up to training, is one of the central messages that Parliament must communicate in this declaration."
"Mr Schulz, I did not interrupt you in a speech which was distinguished by its brilliance and I allowed you to exceed your time. But I did not interrupt you for another reason also: you must be aware that I particularly appreciate the fact that almost all the colleagues in the Chamber at this time are among those I see regularly whenever I am in the chair."
"These are things we should appreciate and I must say that, personally, I appreciate them very much."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report talks first about amalgamating the Odysseus and Sherlock programmes."
"Amalgamating Odysseus with Sherlock is certainly extremely difficult, even with the help of gene technology, which is why I - though a fan of English detective novels - must talk about Odysseus. For we are actually on an odyssey as far as asylum law in the European Union is concerned."
"I think, however, that Mrs Zimmermann has pointed out the right path, not just in her speech, but in her excellent report."
"I think it really is necessary to ensure that asylum law is maintained by the training of officers."
"This asylum law can only be kept alive when its massive abuse and when illegal immigration are reduced and ended."
"For that reason it is very important - and this does occur to some extent on our external borders - that we take measures to lay down security criteria for internal security, just as currency criteria are laid down for currency policy."
"Austria is an example of where the mistake was made of joining first, and then undertaking the harmonization procedures which are now in hand."
"For that reason we should, with the future membership of central and eastern European states in mind, lay particular emphasis on including these states right from the beginning in the training programmes."
"These states are in the process of picking up Community standards with great effort, particularly in the field of internal and legislative policy, but obviously they have some catching up to do."
"That is why it should be our priority in this long-term project."
"We must see to it that within the European Union we come to look upon ourselves as a single unit - Mr Schulz expressed that very well."
"Spain really does border on Russia."
"Looked at in this way it is typical that a member from the southernmost country, Spain, spoke on behalf of our group, and I am a representative of the current eastern border."
"We should ponder on whether we can in the long term leave the security of our external borders to the most Southerly or the most Easterly states, or if we should not arrive here at communal measures such as, for example, a European Border Protection Service, which would take on and Europeanize the positive experience of perhaps the German Federal Border Guard."
"And so I believe that Odysseus could be a first step in the right direction, and I should like to join in the proposal by Mr Schulz that we must come to the next phase of European, Community measures."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner van den Broek."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Future of the ESF"
"The next item is the report (A4-0327/97) by Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, concerning the future of the European Social Fund."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although the social fund legislation does not expire until 1991, preparations for the new regulations are already running at full speed."
"The Commission has declared that it will present proposals in January, perhaps even December."
"If we want the Commission to know at the outset of their deliberations what this House expects from a new regulation, then we must say so now, and not only in December or January."
"This is why the Committee on Social Affairs and my group have been urging a debate on this initiative report today, and I must say I am really happy that we have achieved this together, despite all the technical difficulties we have encountered."
"Here and now we are concerned not with the existence or otherwise of the European social fund."
"The fund is not available for allocation, but we are concerned with altering the fund to meet changes in the employment market, and also to create procedural simplifications."
"This is not a matter of basic reform, but rather of a revision of the social fund."
"The most important points are, first, we want to maintain horizontal support by the social fund."
"That is very important."
"But we also want to give more financial support than previously to those regions where unemployment is particularly high."
"Secondly, we are also appealing for a common horizontal objective in place of objectives 3 and 4, i.e., in order to simplify planning and administration we want to amalgamate measures for combatting unemployment and measures for a preventive employment policy, in other words to amalgamate measures on behalf of people threatened with unemployment."
"Thirdly, we want above all to hold onto the twin aims of the Social fund, that is, we want in future by means of market-oriented qualifications to improve at short notice the employment opportunities for the unemployed and those threatened by unemployment."
"But we also want to give precise aid to those people - and this is very important - who are faced with becoming social outcasts."
"They too must have the opportunity in the long term of finding work."
"We want here to maintain specific measures for women and young people without jobs, for handicapped people and for the long term unemployed."
"Fourthly, we want the social fund to pose a completely new challenge."
"It should do more for the unemployed and those threatened by unemployment who are 45 years of age and older."
"Their qualifications are usually out of date, and above all most national schemes no longer offer them any new professional opportunities."
"Here our aim really is to fill a new gap with social fund measures."
"We are also concerned with technical points."
"Criticism of the value for money of the social fund, of delayed payments and of high administrative costs is well known, and the Court of Audit raises it repeatedly."
"We propose first of all to improve the payments."
"That will be achieved by paying Member States from the social fund in a single annual slice, not three instalments as previously."
"That will significantly simplify the administration."
"But in addition Member States will have for their part to ensure that they really shorten the payment channels and payment deadlines for passing the funds to the final recipient."
"Secondly, we propose a distribution mechanism which will finally put an end to our accumulating unused social payments from year to year."
"That means that, should we find at the end of the third and sixth years of the support period that funds are not fully allocated, the distribution system will operate."
"Thus, unused moneys will first be allocated to other regions within the same Member State, but then to other Member States. The requirement to become recipients of these moneys will obviously be that they must have exhausted their own social funds, and that they must have carried out high quality projects."
"So that these extra funds can be quickly allocated, because only that makes sense of this distribution mechanism, the most badly affected regions - our Objective 1 regions - will be able to get up to 90 % of the measures funded. Other regions will receive a maximum of 70 %."
"In plain words that means that anyone who does not secure the funds as planned with their own complimentary funds must reckon in future with financial sanctions."
"Those who put the funds to good use, however, will be rewarded."
"We think that as a result there will be no further place for ideas about national rights."
"Thirdly, a funding period of seven years is very long."
"We propose initially to place 5 % of the Social fund into reserves."
"The reserves would only come into use during the last three years, when they would be used to smooth out requirements."
"For this, however, the medium term use of funds by Member States would also be taken into consideration."
"Finally, we ask for better evaluation at all stages of planning and operation, so that projects can be more accurately assessed."
"All that only has any point, however, if Member States pass the necessary structural funds laws, including the social fund laws, in good time."
"The past has really taught us that Member States require one year to adjust their planning to new support criteria."
"If in the worst case the necessary passage of regulations should not be achieved, then we propose to introduce an interim year."
"Madam President, Karin Jöns has done this House a great service."
"It was a very illuminating report, which goes into considerable depth and detail on various problems, and puts forward some very interesting, concrete and, in some cases, novel proposals for the future of the Fund."
"For example, her last comment about a reserve and keeping money back from those who do not execute it well and giving it to those who implement Community policy well, is a measure which the Commission should give serious consideration to adopting."
"One of the problems in many of the debates in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerns the management and administration of the Fund."
"Sometimes it is the Commission's fault but, more often than not, it is what happens in the Member States, particularly in states like Italy where there does not appear to be a proper regional structure and where there are all sorts of problems with funds not being allocated properly."
"Indeed, in this week's report by the Court of Auditors - it is very timely that we should be debating it the same week - various areas of the social fund are singled out again for poor implementation."
"Italy, Spain and Portugal are three Member States which are given a dishonourable mention by the Auditors."
"So it is very important that we tighten up our act."
"We must improve our administration of Community taxpayers' money."
"The social fund is investment in people."
"Many of the other funds - infrastructure and so on - are going to industrialists or large companies."
"In these cases the individual has very little tangible experience of a fund, whereas a young person who gets some training and, as a result of that training gets a job, can see that some benefit has resulted from the European social fund."
"So it really is a people's Fund - it is human resources."
"It is not just young people: there are also many older Community citizens and, given the current demographic trends, there are going to be more and more of them."
"For example, in 1992 32 % of the Union's population were over 45; by 1996 that had risen to 36 % and by 2015 it will be over 50 %."
"Thus it is important that we consider the training of older workers, particularly when we have a flexible labour market and people will be going in and out of different occupations."
"In the report Karin Jöns also touched on this problem of additionality."
"This again was mentioned this week in the Auditors' report which stated that there had not been a proper definition by the Member States of additionality or cofinancing."
"Obviously, this is another area which the Commission must address."
"We in the United Kingdom have had considerable problems with this."
"The former Commissioner Millan was very anxious to do something about this and started an investigation into the regional fund and other funds but it was dropped."
"The Commission should take additionality up again and look at it very seriously."
"We have this recurring problem of administration, which we must get to grips with."
"Karin Jöns is putting forward in this report some very concrete and well-thought-out proposals."
"I commend them to the House and I am quite sure we will vote them through tomorrow."
"It is a tribute to the rapporteur that we are coming to the plenary with a report on something like the social fund and there are only about ten or eleven amendments to the whole report."
"It shows that she has convinced most of her colleagues in the committee."
"Many of the amendments are just tidying-up amendments and I think she will be able to accept many of them."
"Madam President, it's such a shame that a report that involved such a great deal of analysis and summary for the rapporteur, has been somewhat sacrificed in the debate. However, we are not underestimating the effect our contribution might have at this time."
"Our thanks to Mr Jöns are inversely proportional to the moment and time of discussion granted us and so we are deeply grateful, giving a favourable opinion both on the report and on the readiness to accept several amendments."
"Firstly, I would like to state and confirm that, for us too, this strategic role exists for the European social fund, a role that holds and will continue to hold respect for the new objectives laid down by the Treaty of Amsterdam, respect also for the forthcoming Conference on Employment, and respect above all for the drama of unemployment."
"The rapporteur clearly states that changes are needed; but this cannot prevent us from seeing the favourable impact this European social fund has had on integration, particularly between the training and education system and the in-service training system; it has had a significant impact on the overall system of governing training policies that have been reinforced in our countries."
"What the rapporteur is saying is this: the future lies in the changes, and these changes are those required by the economic, social and employment situation, but also in the management of the Fund itself which should be simplified and stricter."
"The social fund is the only fund that is directly beneficial to people and against social exclusion and it is the only direct line, the only incentive we have to exploit the human capital that may enable us to incorporate both competitiveness and social guarantees."
"It cannot be degraded to a simple financial channel incorporating other funds and has to maintain its characteristic as a place of experimentation and innovation. It has to be used, as has already partly happened, to initiate new offers and to support new methods of training."
"I believe that paragraph 10 of her report answers this objective and assumes responsibility for these new aspects. It should be read, in my opinion, in the sense that, to support the policies on employment, it cannot be limited to professional courses, but should encourage and finance ways of intervention in which different means have to be used to achieve a specific objective."
"The rapporteur very realistically dealt with the limited financial resources and their desired commitment, and the need to use them better; she also dealt with the subject of bureaucratic streamlining, cofinancing and, in particular, the reallocation of budgets; a gradual, rigorous procedure was provided for; aware that this paragraph might create problems in some countries, including my own."
"We would certainly have preferred reprogramming within the State itself;"
"I have to say, however, that we approve that paragraph as an incentive, because, although we can assume responsibility for the difficulties of decentralized programming that is sometimes laborious in some countries and should therefore be assessed for what it is it, it is no longer permitted to take responsibility for bureaucratic incompetence or for incompetent planning."
"Madam President, maintaining the European social fund is of extreme importance for the social face of the European Union."
"Be that as it may, a fundamental reform of the structural funds is needed."
"A number of aims and initiatives in particular need to be simplified, with similar procedures for the new aims."
"Mr Commissioner, I am delighted to be able to speak to you in Dutch, even though your are wearing your headphones, and am glad that as Foreign Affairs Commissioner you have to listen to a contribution from home."
"I completely agree with the Jöns report and it is extraordinary really that this Parliament is so unanimous."
"But it is a well-considered and expert report with good proposals on the simplification and efficiency of the ESF."
"Reports from the Court of Auditors still show that a large part of the available money is not being used."
"And in 1995 that amounted to approximately 15 billion guilders."
"In addition there are many complaints about the slow handing-over of the European social fund monies to the eventual recipient."
"This is not only the fault of the European Union, colleagues, Madam President, Mr Commissioner."
"In any case not in this case."
"It is often to do with Member States not passing on the money."
"I think it is excellent, therefore that this report suggest that the completion of payment procedures should be simplified, for example, by carrying out it once a year, and thus the red tape can be pushed back."
"In addition, the involvement of local and regional authorities must increase."
"This fund must be applied - and I ask you Commissioner, to pass this on to your colleague Flynn - to the new challenges of which we have so many in Europe, such as the effects of the information society, industrial changes, flexible working patterns, and so on."
"Only too often Member States reach for the till, and the Netherlands is no exception;"
"I myself haven been involved as Chair of a regional employment policy board, and then you see that national financial problems are solved through this fund, that money goes to regular education projects, and that money is used to compensate for cuts to an organization like the regional employment policy board."
"I mention these examples, as they are the ones I am most familiar with, but the same happens in the United Kingdom, Germany, and I should think it also occurs in France."
"So I believe that the fund should be used for what it is set up for."
"I hope this report will be passed unanimously tomorrow, that it will have a big impact on the reform of the Fund, and that you will give it your full attention."
"Madam President. First let me thank Mrs Jöns most sincerely for her report."
"The Group of the European People's Party voted against this report in committee. These points were, however, removed or at least blunted by compromise solutions."
"As a result I am not entirely happy, but at least the report now seems to be capable of receiving my vote."
"One point worries me. We now have different percentages, Mrs Jöns, for the reserves, for the payment rates, for the ESF as opposed to the ERDF."
"That will make the Commission's work more difficult in future."
"I think that it is inadvisable for Parliament to use different data for two funds."
"I believe the expenditure of the ESF will in future be more important and have greater coverage."
"Up to now the ESF has been partly successful, but there was a part which was less so."
"I must admit, however, that assessment of the various measures was difficult."
"Nevertheless, the results must in future be better balanced and be presented more quickly, in my opinion, so that conclusions can be drawn without delay."
"The ESF will certainly become more important because of increasing globalization."
"That is why I accept cofinancing so that the funds, which are essentially too small for 15 countries, can be increased."
"Subsidies of 70 % or even 90 % must remain the exception, or we shall be unable to increase the funds substantially."
"Finally I should draw urgent attention to the fact that the ESF must look more to rural areas and their populations, rather than conurbations. In my view, rural areas will otherwise become yet more depopulated, and we know the result of that."
"Conurbations increase in size, and we must avoid the results of that - increased costs, more problems - by use of the ESF."
"Madam President, may I, partly on behalf of my colleague Flynn, congratulate Mrs Jöns on her extremely well-considered and far-sighted report."
"I can say on behalf of the Commission that the Commission largely agrees with the opinions of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment on the fund, and we expect to have a constructive dialogue within Parliament as the reform of the structural funds progresses."
"The European social fund has been working for about 40 years towards a healthy, modern labour market in Europe, and generally speaking I would like to highlight the three main functions of the fund."
"First of all, within the less developed regions it is an important motor for the improvement of systems, education, training and retraining."
"Elsewhere in the Union, it helps Member States to better tailor their labour supply to the ever changing requirements of the economy."
"And thirdly, and by no means least, it is tangible proof of the large amount of attention the Union devotes to issues concerning participation in society, and equal opportunities for all."
"Points which are emphasized in the draft resolution."
"It is beyond doubt that the fund will have to engage in these aims in the future, but within a different context."
"In Agenda 2000 the new challenges it will be confronted with are laid out, and I do not want go into that today."
"When we place Mrs Jöns's report in the perspective the Commission has outlined, we see four fundamental points of agreement."
"Firstly, there is our mutual recognition that there is an essential role is for guaranteeing vitality and fairness in our labour market, or in other words, promoting both economic and social cohesion."
"The importance of these efforts is underlined by the work that the Commission has done for the summit conference which is taking place in Luxembourg at the moment; but also for the implementation of the European employment strategy and for the guidelines for employment which will be a result of that process."
"This will have far-reaching results on the European social fund in the coming period."
"Then a second point of communality. There is the recognition that the challenges agreed by the Fund have both a horizontal and a regional dimension."
"Mrs Jöns also pointed this out in her verbal explanation."
"The European social fund is the most important form of support the European Union extends to the labour market policy of the Member States."
"And in that sense it functions independently from all exclusive regional contexts."
"Integrated regional approaches are necessary but that does not mean that the European social fund should be separated from its most important task: supporting the reform of labour market measures and practices in accordance with European employment strategy, and in accordance with yearly guidelines for employment."
"Mechanisms which will guarantee this horizontal role in the next programming period, will form an essential part of the progress under which the reforms will be arranged."
"A third common point is our mutual assessment that a strong, innovative and transnational component of our activities should be maintained, in particular via the new generation of Community initiatives."
"We look forward to specific support for the new initiative concerning equal opportunities and for the measures against discrimination in the labour market."
"And the fourth point of common recognition is that the way in which the fund operates must be streamlined and modernized."
"Streamlining and modernization must go hand in hand."
"There is a double challenge."
"Firstly, finding the right balance between granting scarce public resources to the relevant authorities in a quick, flexible, approachable, but also responsible fashion."
"And then secondly, introducing a partnership system with the Member States which brings with it the advantages of subsidiarity and democracy on a national, regional and European level, but also via the European partnership lead to a distinct extra value."
"In our opinion the aspects of the new partnership must be as follows."
"First of all, more emphasis on policy development whereby the Commission and the Member States together are better able to benefit from the lessons from the past about improvement of the policy."
"And secondly, a new definition of management and financial responsibilities, whereby the Commission will concentrate on cooperation with the Member States towards the strategic aims and to concur with them in an agreement which binds both parties."
"This means more operational and financial responsibility will be left to the Member States, and for that it is necessary, as a guarantee of the interest of the Union in its entirety that a wide spectrum of interested groups takes part in the decision-making process."
"Finally, on behalf of the European Commission I would like to thank the Social Affairs Committee and in particular Mrs Jöns for their support of the main points of the Commission's own proposals."
"As I said, there are a few small detailed points on which the Commission would be delighted to exchange ideas once we have entered the phase during which our detailed proposals will be prepared."
"But generally speaking, I believe that this report is an important step on the road to the development of a new vision for the European social fund during the first years of the new millennium."
"Thank you very much Commissioner van den Broek."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, just a brief statement."
"It is about the Minutes from the day before yesterday."
"I apologize, but so as not to trouble our colleagues, Mr Pirker and I handed in a written note at the front during the vote to the effect that our voting machines were not working during the vote on the climate conference."
"I reported this at the front."
"I was told it would be recorded but it has not been recorded."
"I would ask for clarification as otherwise I will not be able to sort these things out in writing but will have to rise to speak as some other colleagues have, but that takes up a lot of time."
"Very well, Mr Posselt."
"The correction will be made."
"Madam President, it is with some sadness that I rise this morning to comment on yesterday's Minutes."
"Yesterday I rose to refer to an inaccuracy which had seemingly occurred with my colleague, Mr Macartney, regarding an error, he claims, in translation."
"Yesterday he claimed that in the original version of an amendment he had put down the words 'English beef' which had been translated in to 'British beef' ."
"This side of the House has now seen the original transcript which was submitted by his group."
"It quite clearly said 'British beef' ."
"I do not know whether Mr Macartney is a closet vegetarian and is trying to ban all British beef, but I suspect in this case he has been rumbled."
"Really, he should be apologizing to this House for misleading it and being economical with the truth."
"Madam President, it gives me no pleasure either, to have to respond to that kind of comment."
"I am not a closet vegetarian but I am a bit of a linguist."
"I am also very careful when I sign amendments that I know what I am signing."
"Sessional services can confirm that the original amendment deposited by our group used the phrase 'viande anglaise' ."
"What happened subsequently I am not responsible for, but we have confirmed it with Mr David Martin, who was in the chair at the time."
"Sessional services can confirm that."
"I hope we can put an end to this matter which is quite ridiculous."
"Anyway, Mr Macartney, we are now on the adoption of the Minutes."
"I am speaking both to you and to Mr Miller."
"So we will make sure that the points made by each speaker have been correctly set down."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Votes"
"Madam President, I should like to make a short statement concerning my report."
"Those who were present during the debate last night will have heard why the Commission is not prepared to accept the draft amendments relating to the Treaty of Amsterdam which have now been adopted by the Christian Democrats."
"I should like to state again quite clearly that my group has not given its assent to these draft amendments because the treaty has not yet been ratified and we cannot refer back to it."
"It is a pity that they have now been included in the report because that is what the majority wanted."
"But we have to go along with it."
"It has happened."
"However I should again like to stress that my group cannot accept a situation where we are referring back to something that is not yet in force."
"Madam President, I heard you give some names out of people who are going to make explanations of vote, but they are not here."
"Can you check that all the Members whose names you read out for explanations of vote are present?"
"Otherwise, it has to be an explanation of non-vote."
"Yes, you are quite right."
"Mr Vanhecke is here, and has just informed us that he will make his explanation of vote in writing."
"Mr Lindqvist has also just informed us that it will be in writing."
"Mr Holm and Mr Wibe are here."
"Everybody is here."
"That's excellent!"
"Congratulations everyone - especially since you are making your explanations of vote in writing."
"I think that next time you should do it orally, so that everyone will know that you are here."
"It is a good thing that refugee problems are being solved worldwide and that refugees can be dispersed among several countries."
"I am concerned that a common EU policy on refugees, asylum and visas may mean a tougher refugee policy and higher walls being built against the outside world."
"I am extremely concerned that the requirement made in Amendment No 3 to the report - that the Member States should gradually establish a uniform and concerted procedure with regard to asylum, immigration and the crossing of Member Statesʼ external frontiers - will result in the European Union building even higher walls against the outside world and make it even harder for political refugees to find sanctuary with us."
"I do not support the requirement that the EU should, through a process of supranationality, be responsible for the areas of asylum and immigration."
"I believe this is a question that it is most appropriate to settle at national level."
"However, I am, of course, in favour of intergovernmental cooperation within this area."
"The aim of this programme - to promote the cooperation between the competent authorities in the Member States - is therefore laudable."
"It is also a good thing that cooperation with the central and eastern european countries is being extended."
"Wheeled vehicles"
"The next item is the recommendation (A4-0342/97) by Mr Kittelmann, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the draft Council Decision with a view to accession by the European Community to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (Revised 1958 Agreement) (9868/97 - C4-0467/97-96/0006(AVC)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement has a long title but it is also a radically altered agreement that we will hopefully be adopting today."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations recommends that you accept the recommendation."
"We accepted the report as long ago as November of last year."
"However, in early January the Council informed us that it wished to withdraw its request for assent to enable the Commission's proposal to be revised and presented again."
"The plan was successful."
"The report that is now before us has been much improved."
"What is the 1958 Agreement of the United Nations Economic Committee for Europe about?"
"In 1958 some of the countries represented in the United Nations Economic Committee for Europe concluded an agreement on the adoption of uniform conditions for the approval of motor vehicle parts and equipment."
"I know that Mr Mombaur and Mr Malangré welcome this enthusiastically."
"To be more precise, it is about the mutual recognition between the contracting parties of type-approvals for automobiles which have been manufactured in accordance with these standards."
"The Commission's proposal provides that the European Community as well as its individual Member States should now accede to this UN agreement."
"I am very pleased about this as it makes clear that the European Union is also acceding to international agreements to a much greater extent and is entitled to vote as a legal entity."
"However, for legal reasons it is the European Community and not the European Union which is to be the party to the agreement as the EU, unlike the EC, does not have an international legal personality."
"The economic significance of such an agreement to the European motor industry is self-evident."
"Since the agreement came into being, about 100 specific provisions have been adopted, encompassing all items of equipment and parts used in motor vehicles."
"A revised version has been made necessary, among other things, by the completion of the European single market."
"It has also become clear that a set of internationally recognized legal structures is required as a result of the speed of technological advances in the motor industry and increasing international trade links."
"The present proposal differs from the first one in three respects."
"First, the role of the members after the EC's accession to the agreement is described in detail."
"Second, article 100a is being added as a further legal principle to the European Community's accession to the amended agreement."
"Third, an appendix, Appendix 3, which provides the practical details of the Community's and Member States' participation in the agreement is being added to the resolution on contributions."
"In particular this motion makes it easier for us to give our assent today than a year ago as this appendix contains the request which we made jointly with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to the Commission, to the effect that the latter should inform Parliament in good time before the formal tabling of proposals for enacting the new arrangements."
"In this way Parliament can make its wishes known at this early stage."
"This procedure for the provision of information has been promised by Commissioner Bangemann and confirmed in writing."
"Mr Bangemann keeps his promises!"
"This promise is now a part of the formal legal document and its quality has therefore appreciated."
"To enshrine the arrangements in Community law the codecision procedure must be applied, in other words Parliament has to give its assent."
"This guarantees our consultation rights, especially if we take into account the information procedure already mentioned."
"Strengthening this agreement by means of a streamlined decision-making process and the participation of the EC as a member will significantly enhance its international significance."
"Other major vehicle manufacturers will accede to the agreement sooner or later."
"This will further improve the sales opportunities for the European industry and the world market."
"We are giving our assent to an agreement which is necessary and worthwhile for Europe."
"Madam President, I am grateful to the rapporteur for giving us the technical explanation behind this report."
"The recommendation stems from one acknowledgment: that a widely recognized body of international rules was required in the field of motor-vehicle type-approval."
"We believe that if our aim is to globalize not only the market in all kinds of goods, we should encourage international work-sharing to the profit of poorer economies and ourselves."
"But we also want the globalization of human rights, social standards and respect for the environment."
"Therefore, we have an interest in keeping this process working through internationally binding legal structures in order to build up confidence, reliability and transparency in economic factors and mutual respect worldwide."
"That is why we support this report."
"I have to say that after some initial reservations, I am persuaded by the rapporteur that Parliament's place in the scheme of things is ensured, and I am grateful for the work Mr Kittelmann has done on that."
"I only hope that his confidence bears fruit in the months and years to come."
"Madam President, this agreement, which dates back to 1958, might seem a little out-of-date, but with the amendments made by our rapporteur and the Commission, we can certainly accept it and say that it still applies."
"This is also proved by the application made over this period of time: over 100 specific regulations have been applied without any major problems."
"I wish to point out the importance of this revised agreement to the European motor industry and employment."
"In the global competition between car manufacturers, particularly between European and American manufacturers, owing to the commercial penetration of the emerging new markets, the adoption of common, uniform technical standards for cars is all the more necessary, particularly as it allows us to define the parameters for a healthy and balanced competition; we also know how much this discipline is needed in many other fields."
"However, we should take into account the fact that the European Union's acceptance of the revised 1958 Agreement could lead some countries, such as Japan, Korea, China, South Africa and India, and emergent countries which will be competing in the future, which have shown an interest or even the intention of accepting the agreement, to take the final step, but to do so in the direction we want."
"Finally, in this scenario, the EU's acceptance of the revised agreement is vitally important to the European motor industry, which has started a series of joint ventures in many emergent countries."
"Acceptance would permit a faster adoption of the entire subject, but above all would allow the European motor industry to withstand the invasion of American industry, which has not been the case other fields."
"Madam President, Mr Kittelmann, imagine that you are a car manufacturer and are endeavouring to obtain approval for a new model of car."
"Let us also assume that in your view it is a very economical model even though it does not quite pass the elk test in some safety aspects."
"The EC's accession to the ECE Agreement would be like manna from heaven for you!"
"The Committee on Industrial Policy is of the opinion that accession by the EU would substantially reduce the scope of the codecision procedure in such sensitive areas as safety and environmental legislation and that the EU would be allowing its legislative powers to be exercised by an organization whose standards are less stringent. The rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs said that the Treaty of Rome provided for the highest possible level of environmental and consumer protection, whereas such standards were lacking from the ECE Agreement."
"It is a bad joke to believe the EP could prevent a sub-standard car, which is on the home straight having gone through the whole process, from being approved by withholding its assent, in other words a mere yes or no, as it lacks the necessary leverage to maintain a meaningful position, in other words codecision powers."
"In order to take account of the reservations expressed by the committees that were asked for an opinion, the Commission has undertaken to provide the EP with advance information in confidence."
"I have to admit, that is a nice gesture."
"But why should an emergency happen in any case, particularly with regard to safety and the environment?"
"The EC's accession obeys the logic of finding faster and better ways of penetrating world markets and forcing other countries to accede to the ECE Agreement."
"So why should we make the entrance fee more expensive?"
"And I suggest that we do not go rushing in first and then hope things get better."
"Instead we should be calling upon the responsible authorities to reform the ECE procedure first to benefit the environment, society and safety and then we could talk about acceding to the ECE vehicle type-approval system."
"In that case we would certainly drop our objections, quite definitely."
"I just hope we do not get an elephant test sometime!"
"Madam President, before I start I would like to get something off my chest about the procedure in the Committee on External Economic Relations, which voted hastily on this report on 21 October."
"The fact that six out of the fourteen members present abstained shows their great unhappiness about the state of affairs."
"The report was put on the agenda one working day before the meeting, and the Members did not receive the amended agenda until the day of the meeting."
"The report was not available until the meeting itself."
"An in-depth debate, let alone a wellconsidered opinion on this report, was therefore impossible."
"This procedure should certainly not be repeated in the future."
"All this does not detract from our appreciation of the rapporteur's work."
"We agree with him that, for various reasons, it is important that the EC enters the ECE agreement."
"Growing international trade and increased competition from the Japanese and Korean car industry means the European industry needs to be given a fair chance."
"By removing technical obstacles, exports from EC countries can be increased."
"Worldwide participation in this agreement is extremely desirable, and the USA in particular should take part. Despite US self certification, I hope that the European Commission will continue to work for that country and others to sign up."
"Now that the internal market is complete, it is all the more important that community regulation and ECE regulations are geared to each other."
"We would like to insist that the EC makes every effort to incorporate the approved community protection level into ECE regulation."
"We are pleased that the risk that entry to the ECE would lower this protection level seems to have been averted."
"Now that the Council has added article 100A to the legal foundation, we trust that health, security and environmental protection will continue to be guaranteed."
"The EC can take care of this, because it will be given an absolute majority in ECE decision-making, and after further enlargement will retain a minority veto."
"We hope that entry will lead to a more balanced protection of interest."
"The interests of the environment, of consumers and of traffic safety, as well the interests of car manufactures in the Member States should be considered."
"A Community approach has the added advantage that the interests of the national car industry will not lead to unilateral lowering of the protection level."
"As far as internal aspects are concerned, the position of the European Parliament is interesting."
"While as yet Parliament has no right of consultation with respect to manufacturing requirements and the approval of vehicles, after entry this will be replaced by the approval procedure for new ECE regulations."
"As far as we are concerned this means that parliamentary control has been guaranteed."
"Furthermore, now that we have been promised that the European Parliament will be kept completely informed by means of the modus vivendi procedure, we agree with the conclusion of the rapporteur that involvement of the European Parliament after entry to the ECE agreement has been guaranteed."
"I am less convinced about the involvement of the Member States."
"We share the Council's criticism on the European Commission's claim to intervene at every stage of the ECE negotiations."
"Is it true that under the Council's decision the European Commission will act on behalf of the EC, while Member States will be able to speak in the specialist groups?"
"Entry into this agreement shows that the powers of the EC stretch a long way in the international arena."
"The rapporteur has rightly tested this against the subsidiarity principle, giving a great deal of weight to the increasing globalization of trade and investments."
"We agree with him that joint action by the Member States in the ECE framework has clear added value."
"Madam President, the Commission first wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kittelmann, on the excellent report on this proposed decision."
"The report provides a detailed analysis of the content and internal procedure to be followed, from the time the European Community becomes a contracting party to this agreement."
"From a political and economic point of view, I would simply like to point out the growing importance of the development in international harmonization, not only with regard to industry but also from the consumers' point of view."
"I think that, from this point of view, those who have expressed concern in this House will find this instrument provides a further guarantee, because I think that multilateral harmonization alone can provide a further guarantee in a global market."
"The point the Commission wishes to make, but which has already been presented in detail by the rapporteur, Mr Kittelmann, relates to the procedure, and is a point that has raised doubts in this House."
"To be more precise, the Commission wishes to confirm that, before voting in favour of the adoption of a draft regulation or a draft amendment, the Community should ask the European Parliament for its favourable opinion in the event of new regulations or in the event of existing regulations that are adapted to technical progress, and submit draft amendments to the European Parliament in good time for the current procedure to be adopted at committee level."
"The Commission will also inform the European Parliament of all the stages in the procedure, particularly with regard to drawing up the work programme and the progress in work done."
"In the sensitive sectors, such as that of polluting agents and noise emissions, the Council and the Commission have agreed, in the context of a declaration set out in the Council documents, that the adoption of measures in these sectors should take place, at Community level, in accordance with the provisions of articles 100a and 189b and that the procedure for the adoption of an amendment to a regulation will only take place after completing that process."
"In this sense, the Commission has agreed to ensure that the European Parliament is involved in all stages of the procedure and in the provision of full and correct information."
"All participants should make their contribution so that this procedure can be carried out effectively."
"From this point of view, in the clear legal transition from joint decisions to other forms of cooperation, as required by this type of treaty, I think the Commission has paid attention to the involvement of the European Parliament, particularly with regard to the sensitive issues which, in my own sphere, relate to consumers' rights, pollution and noise."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the recommendation by Mr Kittelmann."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Like Peter Kittelmann, I think that we should sign this agreement."
"The function of these agreements is to ensure fair competition in a market that is becoming more and more internationalized."
"To do that, we must ensure that commitments made by third countries are respected."
"I could not accept - and the industry could not stand - unilateral implementation by the European Union of the various agreements that have been signed."
"The creation of the WTO, in 1994, will only have been worthwhile if it is able to ensure that the rules enacted are implemented."
"In order to do so effectively, it now appears necessary to reinforce the legal instruments."
"There are many examples proving unfair competition by some of our partners."
"These irregularities, Europe's reactions to which often seem timid, have had serious consequences in every industrial sector."
"Everyone can think of examples."
"The European Union can sign any number of agreements, but must remain vigilant as to their actual implementation by all. Europe must fulfil its commitments."
"However, it would be prejudicial to anticipate their implementation and put them into practice before our competitors."
"Cinema and audiovisual productions"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following six oral questions:"
"B4-0902/97, by Mrs Guinebertière, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on the Guarantee Fund to encourage cinema and audiovisual productions; -B4-0903/97, by Mr Monfils and Mrs Ryynanen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on the Guarantee Fund to encourage cinema and audiovisual productions; -B4-0904/97, by Mrs Pailler, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the Guarantee Fund to encourage cinema and audiovisual productions; -B4-0905/97, by Mrs Leperre-Verrier, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the Guarantee Fund to encourage cinema and audiovisual productions; -B4-0906/97, by Mr Ripa di Meana, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the Guarantee Fund to encourage cinema and audiovisual productions; -B4-0907/97, by Mrs Pack, Mr Pex and Mr Perry, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the Guarantee Fund to encourage cinema and audiovisual productions."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, you will recall that on 22 October 1996, the European Parliament decided in favour of the creation of a guarantee fund to encourage cinema and audiovisual productions."
"This financial instrument was intended to encourage the banks and financial institutions which provide financing in the sector to increase their activities to promote cinema production, in particular by providing a partial guarantee for loans offered to producers."
"Under the Irish Presidency, the Council meeting of 16 December did not accept the proposal, but adopted the idea of a 5-year experimental phase, basing its credibility on a study provided by the EIF, which provided guarantees with regard to the management of the fund."
"Under the Luxembourg Presidency, the Council of Ministers for Cultural Affairs is due to reconsider a compromise proposal."
"As Parliament's rapporteur on this subject, I have been able to gauge the expectations of professionals, both in the audiovisual industry and in the financial sector."
"The catalyst effect of the guarantee fund would not only make it possible to develop more productions, it would also make it possible to produce catalogues, the consumption of which is increasing because of the development of the market for new services."
"All the data that we analyze in this field highlights two situations."
"The first is that the development of numerous channels and the use of digital image transmission are continually increasing, and more in Europe than elsewhere, according to forecasts for 1995/2005."
"The growth of the overall income of the sector is estimated at an average of over 69 %."
"And films form an integral part of an industrial sector that is expanding daily, in particular with regard to training, education, information, trade, etc."
"The growth in the consumption of these productions is therefore extremely high."
"The second situation is the financial deficit with regard to audiovisual cultural exchanges between the European Union and the United States, which now amounts to 6 billion dollars to the detriment of the European Union, and unfortunately, represents 250, 000 jobs."
"At the time of the Luxembourg Employment Summit, at a time when every Member State is ashamed of its unemployment level, we politicians, in a position of responsibility, must do everything we can to give the sector the means to let those new jobs, which are often high-tech, come into existence."
"I am sure that the Commission, like the European Parliament, is very receptive to this argument, and aware of this potential source of jobs."
"I am therefore asking the Commission to help us to confront the Council, as I believe that together we can go quite a long way; the instrument would complement the tools of European audiovisual policy which, together with the Television without Frontiers Directive and the Media programme, have already enabled the profession to become more structured, and can be measured against the continual increase in demand for cinema productions."
"I should therefore like to thank the Commission for any support it can give us with regard to this matter."
"Madam President, as Mrs Guinebertière said, the guarantee fund is nothing new to the European Parliament; its creation was indeed proposed more than a year ago, and the system is both simple and inexpensive, yet extremely useful to the development of audiovisual production."
"So much is said about the link between culture and economics, that now is the time to show that actions speak louder than words."
"Cultural industries create jobs, which was proved long ago, so it is sensible to encourage the private sector to invest in them."
"But, as every audiovisual product is a prototype, the public authorities must accept responsibility for their share of the risk in subsidizing the cinema."
"The cinema is not only a source of jobs it is also the artistic expression of our similarities and differences and is a powerful lever of cultural policy."
"Increasing the subsidies given to the cinema means enabling European people to see, in the cinema or on the television, a reflection of their own identity, instead of being continually alienated by a foreign culture."
"For all these reasons, the guarantee fund seems to me to be a particularly appropriate additional tool for the development of European cinema production."
"Madam President, in Amsterdam, the Member States did not want culture to gain importance, and many Members of the House consider article 128 to be very inadequate."
"The Culture Ministers now have an opportunity, in part, to correct that mistake, by finally giving the go-ahead for the creation of the guarantee fund."
"Madam President, in 1988 the European Union's deficit on cultural trade in cinema, television and video productions with the United States amounted to $ 2.1 billion."
"By 1995, that deficit had more than tripled, to $ 6.8 billion."
"Indeed, the high growth in the audiovisual sector in Europe, with the creation of new channels, is mainly benefitting the United States."
"The percentage of American films shown in European cinemas is still increasing and has reached 80 %."
"These figures clearly show that the United States has taken the measure of the issues at stake in the cinema and the audiovisual industry, which are commercial and political issues."
"The European Union needs to fight against American domination in order, on the one hand, to stop the influx of American productions, and on the other, to defend and develop its own cinema and television productions."
"This is a real issue of civilization."
"By mobilizing professionals from the cultural world, and relaying their words in this House, we managed to impose the acceptance of the cultural exception principle, in the GATT negotiations, which recognizes the fact that cultural works are not commodities."
"It is even more necessary for this principle to be defended today."
"It must be defended during the present negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investments, within the framework of the OECD, from which the cinema, television and intellectual property should be excluded, but also by introducing and promoting suitable, effective, legal and financial instruments."
"The guarantee fund, which would complement the Media programme, despite its mandatory limits and financial inadequacies, would effectively help to encourage the production and distribution of cultural productions originating in the Member States."
"On 22 October 1996, the European Parliament adopted the Commission's proposal and reinforced it with numerous amendments."
"I consider it unfortunate that the Council has not yet reached an agreement, because of the opposition of some Member States."
"The main aim of this debate and the resolution tabled by my group is to suggest to the Council of Culture Ministers that its meeting on 24 November should end in an agreement."
"If the recent proposals of the European Federation of Audiovisual Film Makers are taken into consideration, it may be possible unlock the situation."
"By adopting the guarantee fund, the Council would show its determination to protect the cultures of European countries and to stand up to the economic and cultural domination of the United States."
"Madam President, in a few days' time, the Culture Council will decide whether to create a guarantee fund to promote audiovisual production."
"This question is not entirely new, as the Council has blocked this decision, which is however fundamental, since 1996."
"We are now starting to hope that the Council will finally let actions speak louder than words."
"Let me explain."
"Now that, for the first time, the Member States of the European Union are going to meet to define a common strategy with regard to employment, we should remember that the audiovisual market is expanding rapidly."
"It represents a potential source of two million jobs."
"Furthermore, it is a high-tech sector, at the centre of very important technological changes: the change-over to the digital system, the 16/9th, necessitate the development of a dynamic programme industry, if we do not want yet again to trail behind the United States and to put our cultural identity in danger."
"In this respect, we can see that the Americans, whose cultural invasion we rightly dread, have developed an audiovisual industry which in export terms, is larger than their car and pharmaceutical industries put together."
"We can but dream of a similar situation in Europe."
"The guarantee fund would act as a booster, and would stimulate investment in this sector, where the risks are high, but without however - and this should be emphasized - placing a long-term burden on the European Union's budget."
"It is even more discouraging to see the guarantee fund blocked, because the reduction in the budgetary envelope of Media II was to have been compensated by its creation."
"Yet again, it is the European audiovisual industry, which will be the loser, and it is even possible to say today that it has once again been sacrificed to the Council's unanimity rule."
"Madam President, one request and two questions."
"We are asking for a guarantee that the fund will not privilege mass production but will favour, in particular, joint production for producers in countries with a small linguistic area, thereby disseminating it to citizens of the European Union."
"We have two questions for the Commission."
"Is it familiar with the text of the commitment assumed by the Luxembourgian Presidency and, if so, what is its position in that connection?"
"Finally, do you think the Culture Council of 24 November could finally reach an agreement on the establishment of the fund?"
"Madam President, while writing my speech for today's debate, I reread Mrs Guinebertière's remarkable report, written almost a year ago today, together with a lecture by Commissioner Ortega, recently given in Munich."
"When thinking about this problem, one cannot help being struck by a number of figures, which indicate the scale of the problem."
"Several speakers have mentioned them."
"We, in Europe, have the luck to have an audiovisual market which is expanding more quickly than anywhere else in the world, and its prospects for expansion will double over the next ten years."
"However, although we are busy creating a large single market, and four of the ten largest multinational communications companies in the world are European, for the time being, the European companies' share of their own market does not even amount to one third of the total income of the audiovisual sector."
"This means that foreign companies are earning two thirds of the income in our own market."
"With regard to employment, the situation is unfortunately more serious that Mrs Guinebertière said, because she only mentioned the annual impact of the commercial deficit."
"If we compare employment in the United States for the whole of the audiovisual sector, which amounts to over 2.6 million workers, and in the European Community, where it only reaches 1.8 million, we have a shortfall of nearly one million jobs in the cultural sector."
"That is why I think the appeal we are making today to the Council has very great significance."
"I am not amongst those who believe, like the previous speaker, that the cultural exception is the be-all and end-all."
"I have also been pleased to see several non-French speakers take the floor, because I do not want culture to be assimilated with the French language."
"I am not one of those people who think that a system of quotas and productions, replacing some American productions with European productions, is the be-all and end-all."
"I believe that the future of the European audiovisual industry lies in quality, because that represents investment and investment must be stimulated."
"The guarantee fund mechanism is an extraordinarily simple and effective mechanism."
"A modest basic grant, a system of loans or security under market conditions - which is certainly not a convoluted bureaucratic mechanism - can have a significant leverage effect."
"The guarantee fund which professionals in the industry want has been proposed by the European Commission and is supported by the European Parliament, following Mrs Guinebertière's lead."
"Nothing remains but for the Council, or within the Council, one Member State in particular, to reach a decision."
"Could that Member State, the champion of liberalism, listen to those in favour of the development of Europe today, and say ""yes' on 24 November?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I used to be the rapporteur for the Green Paper on support for the audio-visual production industry in Europe and that was a long time ago."
"We set to work on three major instruments which were to provide this support, the Television Directive which has since been abandoned, the Media II programme which is going well and the European guarantee fund with which we are unable to make any progress as it has been blocked by the Council."
"But this would be an essential requirement for achieving competitiveness and marketability to take on foreign competition."
"We can no longer accept the promotion of small but beautifully formed arts productions, most of which are never seen in any cinema or broadcast on any television channel."
"In Germany only every second cinema film reaches a cinema in any case."
"They do not even make it to small arts cinemas."
"This is the disadvantage of flawed promotion and it is therefore extremely regrettable that as far as I am aware it is actually Germany that is doing the blocking in the Council."
"I very much hope that we can make use of the technical knowledge of film-makers, producers, bankers, media institutes and last but not least the film foundations and reach a different decision than previously."
"Only in this way will it be possible to exploit the opportunities which have been described here and promote great cinema, mainly in the form of coproductions, of course, which is now the norm in any case."
"We shall only have film in coproduction with television, if it is to be competitive."
"It is a major growth market."
"In the USA it is usual to provide venture capital, but unfortunately not in Europe."
"We wanted to use this guarantee fund to make up for this deficiency and if we want fine words to become reality it will depend on this guarantee fund also becoming reality."
"I hope the Commission will be able to exert sufficient pressure to achieve this goal."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we really have to get down to brass tacks here."
"In fact, what it is all about is the development of an industry which is of great significance for the future and constitutes in its variety and diversity what distinguishes the European Union from the other large blocks that exist in the world: its diversity, its variety and its creativity."
"It is therefore important that the Guarantee Fund should take account of the minority languages and small-scale productions."
"Small productions, Mrs Junker, do not necessarily have to be an unmarketable investment. That is an issue which has to be addressed at the same time."
"Of course we need coproduction, of course we need promotion and of course we need the guarantee fund, because that is the instrument which is potentially viable and effective now, while many other decisions have fallen by the wayside."
"In my opinion we also have to address the Member States like Germany which are keeping their feet on the brakes in this respect."
"It is not right for a country to maintain that it leads the way in European development and then put a block on all the major portfolios."
"Employment policy, audiovisual policy, the list is endless."
"This has to be tackled."
"Madam President, like Mr Deprez, I too have reread the report written by Mrs Guinebertière last year, and I should like to quote from it, because I could not express it better myself. ""There must be an alternative to a purely American view of the world.'"
"I am in complete agreement with this way of describing the problem and support all the requests which have been made by various speakers, to unlock the guarantee fund project, but if you do not mind, I should like to speak in terms of general policy, because it is too often forgotten that the cultural sector is perhaps the most privileged area in which political opinions can be expressed."
"We are in the habit of saying to ourselves that, as far as the past is concerned, our European project is based on a common history and traditions. That is true."
"As far as the present is concerned, it is true that it is based on a foundation of common values forged by our history, but as far as the future is concerned, it has to be said that literary, cinema, artistic and audiovisual creation will surely be our most important tools for the exploration of that future horizon, which we call ""European humanism' ."
"I believe that the problem is much more extensive, and is perhaps related to the crisis in the values of universalism, which are progressively becoming corrupted."
"For I do not believe that democracy can be reduced to a vague ideology of human rights."
"I do not believe that political liberalism is simply materialism without principles."
"I do not believe that international exchanges can be reduced to globalization which has no respect for people, and I do not believe that universalism can be reduced to uniformity."
"The loss of a sense of values in universalism is the direct cause of the increase in what must be called - for lack of a better word - ' identity-ism' , ethnicism, tribalism and the most medieval of religiosity."
"When we have surrendered completely to an international wave of pseudo-culture, supported by unprecedented financial capabilities, reproduced by communications tools which have become imperative, and sapped by its own success, when, finally, the most extreme form of liberalism has given us the freedom to choose between Pepsi and Coca-Cola, we must not be surprised to see millions of human beings seek a different future by violently affirming their own identities."
"Mrs Ainardi mentioned issues of civilization."
"I do believe in the main, that in order to defend European individuality and diversity, the fight we must fight is the modern equivalent of civilization's struggle against barbarity."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"Madam President, I will not go down the road of religiosity followed by the last speaker."
"I would simply say to Mrs Guinebertière, on my part also - coming from the Anglo-Saxon world and declaring my interest as someone who has worked in the audiovisual sector now for 35 years - ' stick it out, Mrs Guinebertière' ."
"You must never, never give up on this one."
"I want to say why."
"It is not because I believe this proposal is without dangers and difficulties."
"The reluctance some countries have expressed in Council - and certainly my country is one of them - lie in the fact that there is a fear of waste."
"There is a fear that a self-regarding circle of cultural elites would appropriate this money and make films which no-one would see."
"I reject that entirely."
"I think that if you have a guarantee fund effectively put together it should be a partnership between the private and the public sector, it should be on the basis of loans, not gifts, and it should be on the basis of a process whereby it can be audited and accounted for over a five-year period."
"Let us see after that whether it works or not."
"In my opinion it will work and I say that on the basis of my own experience of the television and film industry."
"Many small films, and not so much in the English-speaking world but certainly in the smaller countries of Europe, simply do not get off the ground in spite of the immense cultural impact they would have because of the difficulty of financing."
"They cannot attract the investment that is needed."
"Banks, with a long history behind them of reluctance and scepticism in this field, simply will not go with this type of investment."
"The only way they can be encouraged is if they themselves have some sort of secondary guarantee."
"The whole purpose of the guarantee fund was intended to do that."
"Any of us who have a passion for quality in this field ought to accept that with the enormous proliferation of television in the future the staple diet there ought to be the secondary market for films which will be made in increasing numbers."
"Otherwise you will have trash television seeping back like the backflow in a sewage system to affect the cinema industry as well."
"I would like to hear from the Commission if it is with us emphatically express the view that Parliament has expressed and the Committee on Culture has expressed in this matter, not just over the past months, but over years, whatever the temporary blockage in the Council may be."
"Madam President, as Parliament knows, throughout this period, the Commission has played a part in the process which followed the proposal."
"A budget of ECU 90 million was initially allocated to the guarantee fund referred to in the proposal."
"Then, the proposal met with the strongest possible resistance from the other Community institution."
"To such an extent that the compromise proposed by the Irish Presidency, amounting to ECU 60 million, did not even have a chance to be unanimously approved."
"To answer Mr Ripa Di Meana's question, the Luxembourg Presidency has now proposed ECU 30 million as another compromise, which is in fact, the lowest common denominator and, according to the Commission, at least has the merit of coherence, inasmuch as this quite large reduction in the total allocation, is the result of the limitation of the action to the cinema industry, and to small and medium budget productions."
"That is, in fact, the incentive we wish to provide, as it is in fact small and medium budget productions or coproductions which do not have access to private market loans, except at a very high cost."
"Furthermore, as Parliament knows, the European Investment Bank cannot finance such small and medium budget productions, as the minimum size of the loans it provides is ECU 25 million."
"That is therefore something completely different."
"Having said that, the Commission agrees with Parliament's concern, not only with regard to the cultural aspect and the importance of the diversification of cultures, but also with regard to employment."
"Furthermore, it may not be a coincidence, and it may be fortunate, that we are discussing this report at a time when a big summit meeting is in fact taking place in Luxembourg on employment."
"Amongst all the information which has been provided here by other speakers, there is one fact I should like to emphasize. During the 1990s, the American audiovisual sector has generated more jobs than the car, hotel and pharmaceutical industries put together."
"For the above reasons, together with all the other very interesting information that Members of Parliament have provided, the Commission is therefore going to exert as much pressure as possible at the Council meeting next Monday, so that the common minimum can finally be approved."
"Mr Elchlepp has a question for the Commission."
"Madam President, I wanted to ask the Commissioner another question."
"If the improved quality of the European film market is supposed to win back market share for the Europeans - and we have heard about the order of magnitude involved today - will ECU 20 million bring about a reversal of the trend?"
"How would you assess the situation?"
"From a financial point of view, does the order of magnitude involved not make this a token gesture?"
"What can you actually do with 30 million to bring about the reversal of the trend in film production?"
"Can you tell me what your experience is in this regard, your assessment of the situation?"
"I understand Mr Elchlepp's concern."
"The Commission's initial proposal was indeed ECU 90 million."
"Nevertheless, we are now in a situation in which, with ECU 30 million, that is, with the scope restricted to small and medium budget productions, in the Commission's opinion we can take the opportunity of giving it some value as a lever, the value of at least starting the procedure."
"In that respect, the question is whether or not half a loaf is better than no bread, and in some ways, you might think that it is not worth it."
"The Commission, on the other hand, considers that even if the budget is small, the fact that it exists is important, because it will open the door to the procedure and will at least provide some leverage for, let us hope, a more adequate initiative in the future in the field of audiovisual production."
"We note the enthusiastic support of the Commission and Mrs Bonino, and thank her for it."
"The joint debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote and I put to the vote a joint motion for a resolution on behalf of seven political groups."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Antarctic fisheries"
"The next item is the report (A4-0315/97) by Ms McKenna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down certain conservation and control measures applicable to fishing activities in the Antarctic and replacing Regulation (EC) No 2113/96 of 25 October 1996 (COM(97)0213 - C4-0285/97-97/0135(CNS))."
"Madam President, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is the management body responsible for fisheries in the Antarctic Ocean, excluding marine mammals."
"The Commission, which includes seven Member States of the European Union, met on 21 October and continued its work until 2 November in Hobart, Australia. The decisions taken at that meeting form the basis of for the present Commission proposal."
"The measures are generally applicable within the scope of the CCAMLR and have been the object of several amendments including, in particular, quota changes to existing and new fisheries."
"Several other relatively minor changes were made, such as to the internal EU procedure for authorizing a fishery, increased observer coverage, restrictions on the method of disposal of plastic wastes from fishing vessels and to the technical description of required longline fishing equipment to avoid seabird bycatch."
"Many of the decisions taken during the course of the meeting relate to the opening of nine new fisheries and mainlyinvolve the toothfish."
"The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources is proud of its conservation ethics and its support for a precautionary approach, and provides for a procedure to be completed prior to issuing the authorization for a new fishery."
"Only after the CCAMLR has given its approval and the total allowable catches (TACs) have been adopted is it possible for the fishery to open."
"During the year, however, the simultaneous opening of many fisheries was proposed in different regions close to the Antarctic continent."
"In view of the considerable amount of illegal fishing and its gradual increase, several members of the CCAMLR recommended adopting an attitude of greater precaution when examining applications."
"During the course of the year, the Scientific Committee recommended the adoption of significant TACs for these new fisheries, for volumes of 1, 980 or 2, 000 tonnes depending on the regions."
"A further significant amendment related to the tooth fish TAC around the Heard and McDonald islands, which has increased to 12 times the amount, from 297 to 3, 800 tonnes."
"With regard to the fixing of TACs, the approach adopted by the CCAMLR in 1996 does not seem to be inspired by principles of precaution, in our opinion. It would appear that the organization is now subject to increasing pressures to authorize fishing before making rigorous scientific analyses and implementing adequate control measures."
"Illegal fishing is without doubt the main problem faced by the CCAMLR."
"It is a serious threat both to the fish stocks, currently and in particular the toothfish, and to the credibility of the Committee."
"Illegal fishing takes various forms: fishing vessels authorized to fish, but committing violations; fishing vessels flying the flag of a member country of the CCAMLR conducting their business with no fishing licence, thus committing a serious violation; and, finally, fishing vessels flying the flag of non-member countries of the CCAMLR fishing without any restrictions."
"The European Union is interested both in the actions of vessels of its Member States and in those of vessels flying the flag of other countries, but owned by EU companies."
"The situation is so serious that, according to reliable estimates, the total illegal catches equal or even exceed the permitted catches."
"Since in the rest of the world the stocks are the object of ever greater impoverishment and the fishing capacity is constantly increasing, it is quite likely that an ever increasing part of the fishing effort is concentrated on the Antarctic Ocean."
"The situation is further exacerbated by the high price offered for the toothfish."
"For many years, the CCAMLR was able to put its principles into practice."
"However, to resolve the current crisis in the fishing sector recorded in other regions, characterized by depleted stocks, the CCAMLR will need a spirit of cooperation and determination, as the situation makes the adoption of far harder decisions than those approved during the 1996 meeting inevitable in the near future."
"Madam President, I would like to thank my old friend Mr Ripa di Meana for his presentation this morning."
"It raises an interesting point about parliamentary procedure."
"The rapporteur is meant to represent the committee responsible for the report and here we have Mr Ripa di Meana representing a rapporteur who has not asked the committee itself to find a substitute."
"It is wrong for a political group to present a report on behalf of a committee when it should be another representative of the committee itself."
"Could this rule be clarified at some point by the presidency?"
"Mr Provan, I think that there have been many precedents."
"We can, of course, in future, consider how things should be done formally."
"And if the procedure has not been observed, we can take steps to ensure that it is observed in future."
"Having said that, I am sure you know that there have been many precedents, particularly with regard to reports submitted on Friday mornings, which cause problems when the rapporteur has other commitments."
"Madam President, I am very sorry that Ms McKenna is not here today because I would have liked to have congratulated her personally on her very clear report on conservation and control measures for fishing in the Antarctic and the role played by the Commission for the conservation of Atlantic marine living resources."
"She highlights this body's role in managing fish stocks in the Antarctic and setting itself an ecological mandate."
"She also underlines the problems of enforcement of its regulations in these very remote waters, with few resources for monitoring or policing."
"The changes proposed by the CCAMLR include increased quotas of a number of species in different locations and new fisheries in a number of locations, most particularly for Patagonian toothfish in a number of places and a near doubling for krill in the southeast Indian Ocean."
"The UK is to benefit from increased squid quota around South Georgia."
"These very large increases in total allowable catches raise questions as to how far CCAMLR has just responded to requests from fishing nations for increased quotas and how far it has observed its own criteria for rigorous scientific analysis and control measures before opening up new fisheries."
"European Union-owned vessels are involved, sailing both under their own flags and under the flags of third countries."
"As fish stocks closer to Europe are depleted, Community fishermen are increasingly looking further afield for new fishing areas, like the Antarctic, to exploit."
"High prices for toothfish encourage still further this trend to fish in areas where controls are difficult."
"Some countries are more prepared to cooperate with CCAMLR than others as far as surveillance and monitoring are concerned."
"The Party of European Socialists welcomes and supports the amendments from the committee which underline the need for an ecological basis for fish stock management in the Antarctic Sea and for all nations fishing in the area to take responsibility for control of their vessels and their catches."
"Madam President, the fishing that goes on in a continent that feels so far away from where we are is unfortunately a good example of how easily we can forget the ecological effects of fishing."
"Ms McKenna's report describes the dangers to marine birds from fishing tackle."
"Species are being threatened partly as a result of being trapped in fishing nets."
"There are detailed codes of practice for trawlers to protect the welfare of marine birds, but whether or not these rules are being observed is another thing."
"There is no legal enforcement in the region."
"There are scientific reports on the situation but they very likely cannot be used in law against vessels which have violated the rules."
"Methods of countering illegal fishing seem just as ineffective."
"With general reference to the fisheries agreements, the means whereby the Council and the Commission have again reviewed the agreements are not acceptable."
"The Council gives its support for, and the Commission implements, using its influence, economic decisions without lending an ear to any other budgetary authority."
"The Committee on Budgets and the European Parliament have often opposed this kind of approach."
"Negotiations to review the procedures should commence right away so that the European Parliament can be properly heard."
"Could I go on to say that while the EU spends hundreds of millions a year on different fisheries agreements, though just a few southern Member States make use of them, I think it is legitimate to wonder why there is such a high cost-gain ratio relating to fishing opportunities achieved and the cost of economic assistance to be paid out of Community funds."
"Madam President, earlier this year in February I was privileged enough to go to New Zealand to look at some of the fisheries management that takes place very successfully down there."
"While I was there I was introduced indirectly to the Patagonian toothfish in that, at that time on South Island, there was a landing worth several million New Zealand dollars, which was the most valuable catch ever landed in those islands."
"It was being sold at something like ECU 2, 000 per tonne."
"It was part of a process that has started over the last year of a large influx of major fishing fleets into the southern and the Antarctic area particularly targeting this species, which has become a fashionable food in the Far East, Japan in particular."
"This is a species that has a very long life cycle and whose resources, once they have been depleted, will not recover, if at all, for many years."
"The result is the destruction of another species in Antarctica and its waters, which has a very fragile environment and, ironically, where the world has decided to preserve the resources on land but has yet to make similar decisions in its oceans."
"CCAMLR is an organization with an excellent remit in all sorts of ways, particularly environmentally."
"However, as speakers have already said, there are huge difficulties in that area."
"Firstly, it is a very large area of sea and ocean."
"The CCAMLR effectively has no real power outside the EEZs of these scattered islands, many of which are under the sovereignty of European Union nations."
"There are few controls even inside."
"It is very difficult for South Africa, France, Britain or other nations to control fisheries within their own EEZs."
"There is also the recurring difficulty on the oceans of the world of flags of convenience - vessels that are fishing very much for their own convenience and their own economic gain under the flag of some nation that has little control in terms of the fishing that takes place."
"I believe there are a number of solutions which can start to be applied here."
"It is not going to be easy but there are some that could be taken now."
"Firstly, we need to ensure that CCAMLR increases its powers of enforcement and observation."
"Although the NAFO organization in the North Atlantic is far from perfect, at least it has powers outside EEZs: powers of observation, enforcement and inspection that could be used similarly in the Southern Ocean."
"It should also insist that we have observers on all these vessels to ensure that TACs are observed."
"In fact, we need to move not just from TACs but to quotas so that we do not have the classic race-to-fish problem that we have here in our own waters."
"There needs to be satellite control."
"There needs to be tough action again on these flags of convenience."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner, as many of the signatories of CCAMLR, together with the EU itself, are European nations, whether we could take a radical stance here to ensure that not only is the land-mass of Antarctica protected but that we take very tough measures to protect the Southern Ocean in terms of its own marine environment."
"Only in this way will we save not just the Patagonian toothfish but whatever other species becomes the next fashion at the dinner tables of Tokyo and North America - and even Brussels as well."
"This is a very serious question."
"I thank the rapporteur for an excellent report and I would ask the Commissioner to ensure her own officials at future meetings of CCAMLR have this as a very high priority."
"Madam President, first allow me to say a few words to Mr Ripa di Meana who has told us that he takes a very environmentally-sound position in response to this type of question. I was therefore rather disappointed when he approached this report from a purely statistical point of view and only talked about quotas."
"I believe this report deals with an extremely emotive subject because we simply must not forget that both the Arctic and the Antarctic, just like the rain forests to which Mr Kreissl-Dörfler is constantly referring, are fundamental elements for maintaining the overall ecological balance on this planet."
"Thank God the Commission has slowly begun, to a certain extent, to regulate fishing in the Arctic from an environmental starting point in order to conserve living marine resources."
"For one thing we should not forget that the further north and south we go from the equator, the slower is nature's ability to regenerate."
"Anyone who has been in the Arctic or Antarctic and seen the way dead fish and other dead animals can lie around for years before they rot away, anyone who has seen vehicle tracks there or an oil drum lying around and how many years, how many decades they remain there, will know that we are discussing a highly emotive issue, an issue which we cannot simply sweep under the carpet."
"The themes addressed here, in particular illegal fishing, are of vital concern to us."
"We must make an all-out effort right from the start to put a stop to this even though we know it is very difficult."
"For this reason I am actually delighted that the report and the Commission's proposals are going at a relatively tough pace."
"I would hope that these words will be followed by actual deeds."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the current debate, on which I would like to raise a few points, deserves to be updated a little."
"The report in question refers to the measures adopted in 1996; as recalled, a further meeting has since been held, as the CCAMLR procedure is reviewed every year and it is therefore of interest not only to report the conclusions of the meeting held in 1996, but perhaps to update MEPs on the decisions taken in 1997, which seem to me to be positive with regard to the concerns expressed here."
"I will go through the points in order. With regard to illegal fishing, for the first time this year the CCAMLR accepted a proposal made by the Commission relating to vessels of non-contracting countries, consisting of the obligation for vessels engaged in fishing in the region to be subjected to inspection in the ports of the contracting parties of the CCAMLR, if they were trying to unload their catches."
"This is one of the possible measures, also to establish the amount of illegal fishing of which we obviously have no basic proof."
"This new compulsory measure can therefore serve not only as a deterrent but also to help us assess the extent of illegal fishing, which we all recognize exists."
"If the vessels are not able to prove that their catches have not come from the CCAMLR region, they will be prohibited from unloading and transferring their catches in all the ports of the contracting parties."
"A Commission proposal on satellite monitoring has also been accepted as a CCAMLR resolution."
"This may present a technical problem, but it has been accepted with a resolution as a Commission proposal."
"In addition, two more Commission proposals on procedural initiatives already adopted by the NAFO have been accepted, as Mr Teverson recalled, particularly with regard to the plan for observers and the plan for inspectors on board."
"One problem remains, however: the number of inspectors is very small, owing to meteorological reasons as well as various kinds of technical reasons, but a possible plan for observers and inspectors has been introduced and exists in the CCAMLR."
"It is now a question of encouraging the contracting parties to implement this plan that has now become possible."
"With regard to one point raised by Mr Ripa di Meana, the Commission would like to point out that the measures adopted by the CCAMLR at the meeting this year comply fully and totally with the opinion held by the Scientific Committee."
"This has been a major problem we have all faced before the Commission meeting but, at all events, the opinions of the Scientific Committees have been fully taken into consideration and reflect, better than we hoped, the precautionary approach supported by the Community which was only partially implemented at the meeting last year."
"For all these reasons, we believe that, certainly in the fisheries as we know them, the best is always possible and even to be hoped for."
"The Commission has to confirm that the last meeting held by the CCAMLR presented positive aspects for countries with a great interest in fishing in that region which obviously had a more resistant attitude."
"Thank you for your speech, Mrs Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Fishing off Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea and Cape Verde"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0300/97 by Mr Imaz San Miguel, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing the fishing possibilities and the financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on fishing off the coast of Guinea-Bissau for the period 16 June 1997 to 15 June 2001 (COM(97)0395 - C4-0448/97-97/0205(CNS)); -A4-0365/97 by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing the fishing rights and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ivory Coast on fishing off the coast of Ivory Coast for the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 2000 (COM(97)0520 - C4-0565/97-97/0269(CNS)); -A4-0364/97 by Mr Kindermann, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing, for the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 2000, the fishing rights and financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea on fishing off the coast of Equatorial Guinea (COM(97)0522 - C4-0567/97-97/0268(CNS)); -A4-0363/97 by Mr Novo, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining, for the period 6 September 1997 to 5 September 2000, the fishing rights and financial compensation provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cape Verde on fishing off the coast of Cape Verde (COM(97)0521 - C4-0566/97-97/0270(CNS))."
"Mr President, I shall be referring to the report on the agreement between the European Union and Guinea Bissau for the period June 1997 to June 2000."
"I should like begin with an appraisal of that agreement."
"This is a positive agreement, which is in line with the philosophy of the Union's fisheries agreements."
"There is a shortfall of fish in the Community market, and fisheries agreements therefore help to balance supply and demand."
"Furthermore, they provide the Community fleet - whose capacity is greater than the stocks available in Community waters - with fishing opportunities."
"In this sense, they provide the Community fleet with economic alternatives and thereby contribute considerably to maintaining direct and indirect jobs - something which is important when an Employment Summit is being held in Luxembourg, and when we are all endeavouring to gear Community policies to job creation."
"And they also provide local and regional communities which have genuine difficulties diversifying their economic fabric with an economic alternative, thereby ensuring their survival."
"And fisheries agreements achieve all this at a relatively low cost to Community coffers, when compared with allocations from the Community budget to other areas of economic activity. It should not be forgotten, moreover, that these agreements frequently contribute to development cooperation operations in the local communities in which fisheries resources are exploited."
"And they do so, of course, in keeping with an approach to exploitation geared to the conservation of those resources."
"The agreement that we shall be approving today is in line with these requirements."
"Turning now to the detail of the agreement, four aspects should be stressed."
"Firstly, the fishing possibilities correspond to the real rates of use of those negotiated under the previous protocol."
"Thus, for shrimp trawlers, a gross registered tonnage of 9000 GRT per year is provided for, in place of the 8800 GRT per year provided for previously."
"For cephalopod trawlers, the gross registered tonnage has been reduced from 4000 to 3000 GRT per year."
"All this is in line with the percentages of fishing possibilities used previously."
"Moreover, the agreement stipulates that the fishing possibilities in the abovementioned sectors may be increased if fishing resources permit, with - of course - a proportional increase in the financial compensation."
"As far as tuna vessels are concerned, the number of licences that may be granted has been substantially increased: from 26 to 37 for seiners; and from 16 to 52 for pole-and-line vessels and longliners."
"This is therefore a good agreement, which is adjusted to the degree of compliance with the previous agreement and protocol, and which, moreover, increases the fishing possibilities for the Community fleet."
"The financial compensation provided for has also been markedly increased: from ECU 6.35 million per year to ECU 8.5 million per year, in line with the increase in fishing possibilities."
"The cost to shipowners will also be similar to that under the previous protocol, with their licence fees being slightly increased as from the fourth year of application."
"I wish to point out, moreover, that the total cost of the agreement includes budget items earmarked for funding a scientific programme to improve information on fisheries resources, study grants for scientific, technical and economic training in the field of fisheries, as well as small-scale fishing and marine surveillance programmes."
"All in all, the agreement represents support for the effective control of resources and cooperation in the development of local communities devoted to small-scale fishing."
"To complete this summary description of the agreement, I would mention the requirement for Community shipowners to employ a certain proportion of local seamen and to take on board observers from Guinea-Bissau to check compliance with fisheries regulations."
"In short, this agreement will also serve as an instrument of development cooperation, and it is geared to the monitoring, control and conservation of resources."
"I therefore urge Parliament to approve this agreement, and I congratulate the Commission on its negotiations."
"I wish to end with a comment concerning the procedure."
"Parliament must defend and make good use of all its powers and responsibilities, including those relating to the budget."
"However, this should not in practice prevent the Commission from initiating negotiations on the renewal or implementation of agreements."
"This is quite another matter from requesting that our assent be required for the adoption of an agreement, and Parliament's actions must not undermine the flexibility that the multiannual implementation of these agreements demands."
"I would therefore ask Members to bear this in mind when voting on the amendments to the legislative proposal, and I would urge them to vote in favour of the report as a whole."
"Mr President, I should like to begin my presentation by pointing out that Parliament's services have unfortunately made an error - and not a minor error, moreover, since it appears in the title of my report. Indeed, the Spanish version refers to the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing the fishing rights and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire."
"Now, Côte d'Ivoire may well be the French name for that country, but in Spanish it has been called ""Costa de Marfil' for a very long time; and, although there is a certain amount of linguistic tolerance with regard to geographical names in my country, this is not usual in the international sphere. So I should simply like to ask Parliament's services to correct this material error, since, moreover, the corresponding Commission document also uses the name Costa de Marfil, not Côte d'Ivoire, in its title."
"Secondly, as always with this type of subject, there are questions of a procedural nature."
"This agreement was signed on 30 June, but, although Parliament was informed unofficially by the Commission, it was only formally consulted at the end of October, and then by urgent procedure - with the unusual circumstance that the first payment must be made before 31 December of this year."
"In other words, we have been consulted in time to give our approval, but the agreement has been in force since July, so that if Parliament now delivers an unfavourable opinion, it will put the Community institutions in a difficult position."
"However, one of the elements accompanying this report is the opinion of the Committee on Budgets drawn up by Mrs Jöns; and that committee would naturally like the procedures to be further tightened up. That is, as far as possible, before agreements are signed, before definitive commitments are undertaken, and especially before those agreements enter into force, it would like Parliament to have the opportunity to deliver an opinion on the subject concerned."
"Moving on to the protocol itself, this is not an agreement of overwhelming importance, but a modest agreement which concerns just sixty tuna vessels and three trawlers."
"While there has been a small increase in the number of vessels, there has actually been no increase in the total capacity allowed, so I do not believe that this agreement will have a great impact on the number of fish caught."
"Two species are concerned: yellowfin and skipjack tuna."
"While catch levels for the first are already high, and it would be very difficult to increase their capacity, it seems that there is greater scope for exploiting skipjack tuna; and the small increase in catches that may result from this agreement will therefore not substantially affect stocks."
"I should like to take this opportunity to point out that my report is accompanied by the positive opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. Indeed, the Committee on Development and Cooperation considers that fisheries agreements are also an instrument of development aid."
"Naturally, the Committee on Development and Cooperation would have liked greater amounts of money to be earmarked for specifically development objectives. However, of the total budget of this modest agreement - which consists of an annual Community contribution of ECU 1 million for three years; i.e a total of ECU 3 million - ECU 2.4 million has been allocated to compensation for fishing rights, whilst ECU 600, 000 has been earmarked for scientific programmes, training, and aid for public administration, marine surveillance and contributions to international organizations."
"In other words, a significant proportion of the agreement's budget has been allocated essentially to development objectives."
"In the end, I do not believe that it makes any difference to a country if we say ""OK, we will pay you this much for fishing rights and give you the rest in development aid' ."
"I believe that we should view the whole of Community compensation to developing countries - those that are prepared to give us fishing opportunities in their waters, thereby helping us to solve a problem mainly of employment but also of supply - as development aid."
"This is normal, and a better way to help them than simply giving them money."
"In my view, there is nothing worse than charity."
"If the Community were to replace these agreements - in which the countries concerned have to give something in exchange - with simple charity, it would probably not assist the economic development of those countries."
"Among other reasons, this is because - as you are well aware, Mr President, coming from a coastal town - fishing, both that of local fishermen and that of fishermen from other places, generates economic activity in fishing towns."
"I myself come from a small fishing village which has lived off fishing for a very long time, and not only that of local fisherman, but that of fishermen from other regions and countries who use our port, sign supply contracts, and so on."
"Consequently, I believe that Parliament must encourage the use of fisheries agreements as instruments of development aid, and I would particularly urge the Commission to continue along those lines - staying within the limits of the rational use of fisheries stocks, of course."
"Neither the developing countries nor the Community wishes to see the destruction of those stocks."
"To repeat something that I said to the Commissioner in the last part-session, I believe that the European Community is currently providing a good example with the way it conducts its fishing activity - although it could do so even more - inasmuch as it displays concern for the conservation of stocks and subjects European fishermen to Community supervision - which I hope will be reinforced in the future, so that those stocks are not depleted. On the other hand, we observe that in our own coastal waters, with which we are familiar, the fleets of other countries are not providing the same good example - and the Community will probably have to take action in this regard."
"The other day, I referred to educational action, but it will also have to take action at the level of international agreements, in order to ensure that the total fishing effort in the waters of the developing countries does not lead to the destruction of fisheries stocks."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I had an opportunity to see for myself last August, the government authorities and the various economic sectors of Cape Verde with whose representatives I had a chance to talk, are very much interested in the renewal of the fishing agreement with the European Union."
"Obviously the renewal of that agreement also greatly benefits the Community fishing fleet, because it will make it possible for Spanish, French and Portuguese vessels to continue to catch certain highly migratory species, especially tuna."
"The agreement provides for a significant increase in the number of licences. This is how they are distributed: 37 for tuna seiners (an extra 14 units), 36 for pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface long-liners (an extra 19 units) and also providing the same three licences for bottom long-liners."
"Nevertheless, this increase in the number of licences does not provide for a corresponding increase in proposed catch levels, which are kept at around 5, 000 tonnes per year."
"This fact, which apparently conflicts with the increase in licences, is explained by the need of fishing vessels to follow concentrations and movements of stocks, which result in their frequently moving in and out of Cape Verde's territorial waters."
"The overall costs of this are agreement are also subject to negligible or minimal increases: financial compensation of ECU 1, 086 million (2.1 % up on the previous agreement), ECU 267, 400 allocated to technical and scientific programmes (2.1 % up), and ECU 178 thousand to finance study and training grants, that is to say an additional 0.5 %."
"In my report I have expressed my unequivocal support for the renewal of the fishing agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde."
"That position and that recommendation of mine are, therefore, the reason why I have today emphasized certain issues which may improve the framework for the implementation of the Agreement Protocol, whether it be in the short or medium term."
"Firstly, I must emphasize that the Community fleet must without exception, and I repeat without exception, accede to all requests by the Cape Verdean authorities to put local observers on board its vessels. Unfortunately, although we all know why, there are not enough of them to cover all the Community vessels in operation."
"Secondly, it is essential to remind masters and owners of their obligation to send statements of their catches to the Cape Verdean authorities within the proper time. This procedure should be observed at the same time as statements are sent to other competent national authorities."
"Thirdly, we must ensure that Community owners help to support the canning plants recently set up in Cape Verde."
"This is a moral duty which must be converted into a formal obligation, the more so inasmuch as such supplies of raw materials can be processed at fixed prices for the international market."
"Fourthly, it would be desirable to develop increased coordination with other sectors of the Commission, particularly those concerned with development aid, to make it possible to set up automatic fleet monitoring systems which could be made available not only to Cape Verde but also other countries in that sub-region of Africa."
"This area of investment is all the more important inasmuch as it is a fact that Parliament especially emphasizes the importance of responsible fisheries measures, and also that the Cape Verdean authorities have used the specific financial resources allotted to technical and scientific programmes under the agreement very correctly - I was able to check that on the spot."
"Finally, the purpose of the legislative amendments I presented in my report, which were approved by the Fisheries Committee, is to try to improve coordination between the Commission and the Parliament as regards fisheries agreements."
"It is important, Madam Commissioner, that the Commission should once and for all present its reports on the implementation of agreements and the situation with regard to local fish stocks, well before the terms of the relevant protocols expire, to enable the European Parliament to make a decision on their renewal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is part of a joint debate on a number of proposals relating to fishing."
"This applies to the renewal of fisheries agreements with Guinea-Bissau for four years, and with Equatorial Guinea and the Ivory Coast for three years each."
"I am naturally going express a few brief thoughts on these."
"I am seriously concerned about the proposed terms of the protocol with Equatorial Guinea, which, as you know, is mainly about tuna, but those terms increase fishing possibilities by almost 50 %, the permissible number of licences is raised from 53 to 68, even though it has become very clear that the supervision and control measures are pretty toothless, the amount of finance allocated to scientific programmes is being substantially reduced and also that the territorial waters beyond the fourmile line are allowed to be used as a fishing zone."
"In my view that is unacceptable!"
"This does not appear to apply to the agreement with the Ivory Coast, which is also mainly concerned with tuna-fishing. In this agreement there is only a relative increase in fishing permits and licences, and a corresponding increase in the overall sums allocated to training and grants, supervision and technical and scientific programmes."
"The fishing agreement with Guinea-Bissau, which is the longest-established, fullest and most diversified of those we are discussing today, allows Spain, Italy and Portugal to take up to 9600 tonnes gross of shrimps per year, suggests a figure of three thousand tonnes gross of shellfish per year, to be used by Spain and Italy, and also establishes the possibility of granting 89 tuna-fishing licences."
"With the exception of the agreement with Equatorial Guinea, the draft terms of which, as I have mentioned, seem to us to conflict with the fundamental principles of conservation of resources adopted long ago by this Parliament, and allows operations in waters which ought to be exclusively reserved for local fishermen, our group will vote in favour of the texts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the code of conduct all three institutions undertook to do everything in their power to ensure speedy negotiation of the fisheries agreement."
"But paper is patient."
"Anyway, that still seems to be the Commission's motto almost a year after the code of conduct was signed as it is really consulting us with great regularity only several months after the agreement was initialled."
"This also applies to the agreements we are debating today."
"To be fair, the fact that we can now conclude the parliamentary procedures in less than a month is due to the Council's rapid consultation process by the Council and our rapid committee procedures."
"If the Commission would adhere to the code of conduct and conclude negotiations on time, this would prevent another evil."
"By that I mean the Commission's promise to third countries about fixed payment terms and sums which was made without any legal basis."
"With regard to the present agreements, too, the Commission has again gone ahead without waiting for Parliament's opinion."
"All this means is that the Commission is consistently circumventing Parliament in its role as the budgetary authority."
"I am beginning to find this really intolerable!"
"It is certainly also unacceptable to expect us yet again to accept the provisional application of four agreements just because the Commission's negotiations are behind schedule."
"All the agreements have already been running for six months."
"I therefore note that up to now the code of conduct has not improved the Commission's appalling management in the matter of fisheries agreements."
"Although we now receive the texts of the agreements immediately after signature in the original language, we do not receive details of the financial repercussions on the obligatory financial statement."
"And that, dear members of the Committee on Fisheries, is really not on!"
"To us members of the Committee on Budgets the financial statement is essential, and the fact that it is impossible to work with drafts is proved time and time again."
"In the case of Cape Verde the financial statement is still not right as of today!"
"Please let me restate this clearly, to my own colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries as well, as far as we budget people are concerned it is, as always, essential that international fisheries agreements are understood to be nonobligatory instruments."
"Mr President, I am going to state my opinion solely from the point of view of the Committee on Fisheries."
"I consider that the interventions we have heard, which put questions on procedural matters, have raised issues that ought to be dealt with."
"In my opinion, the powers of this Parliament to monitor the fisheries agreements are powers of the whole Parliament, and not just of one parliamentary committee or another, but in any case I would like to emphasize here that I am going to give an opinion on fisheries agreements and more particularly on the fisheries agreements with Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau."
"But I would also like to emphasize how difficult it is for us to maintain our position on the fisheries agreements when the Commission systematically violates the so-called code of conduct and when we are systematically placed in a situation where we have to give opinions on reports after the protocols have already been signed and when the process is already being rapidly adopted."
"In spite of all this, the whole thing can be seen from another viewpoint."
"It is obvious that we are more sensitive to this situation because the vessels that fish under the agreements come from Portugal, Spain and France."
"Those Members who do not have, shall we say, citizens to whom they are answerable, may perhaps speak in more radical terms."
"With regard to the agreement with Cape Verde, I would like to stress the following points."
"Between 1990 and 2000 - and thus between the first and this, the third protocol - financial compensation to Cape Verde was reduced by 40 %."
"At the same time, the number of fishing permits, especially for tuna, rose by 40 % from about 50 vessels under the first protocol to 73 vessels under the current one."
"That is to say, we are dealing with a country in financial and economic difficulties, which is fundamentally suffering from a strategy that has come to consist of a gradual reduction in financial compensation under fisheries agreements."
"I would nevertheless point out that the owners' share, especially as regards bottom longliners, increases by 30 % between the second protocol and the one now before us for approval."
"But I would like to stress once more that so far as Cape Verde is concerned there has been a 40 % reduction in financial compensation between the first protocol and the one we are now asked to approve."
"Finally, with regard to Guinea-Bissau, I should like to emphasize that since 1993 the amounts of the financial compensation have not been increased, and this calls for adjustment."
"We must not forget, where these countries are concerned - Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau - that they are heavily dependent on these fisheries agreements for their own economic sustainability, and it should also be said - as our colleague Mr Honório Novo has said - that, so far as investigative measures and technical grants are concerned, both these countries have tried to do their very best to see that the money is well used."
"Mr President, today we have before us five reports on which we have to rule."
"Four concern the international agreements and, as we have already heard, one concerns conservation and control measures in the Antarctic."
"The aspect of the international agreements which is relevant to fisheries policy is expressed in the decision of the European Parliament taken on Wednesday of this week concerning the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was also prompted by pressure from the Committee on Fisheries."
"What is required is for the assent procedure to be applied to all major international agreements once and for all."
"The fact that previously we were only listened to made it difficult, and in many cases impossible, for us - Mrs Bonino and others - to work efficiently."
"I am pleased to admit that, mainly thanks to the force of her personality, Mrs Bonino has improved the situation in the past, especially with regard to information which now reaches us much more quickly."
"However, it continues to be the case that the only way the European Parliament can exert any real influence on fisheries agreements with third countries is if the assent procedure is regarded as a general legal basis."
"Only then will we be able to use the proper means to implement the guidelines on third country agreements which were jointly worked out and recently adopted by the European Parliament."
"Before, sooner or later, another Intergovernmental Conference is held and we hopefully gain greater influence here in this House, we can hope for a positive outcome at the European Court of Justice because of international agreements - in this case the international agreement with Mauritania."
"This would really be a big step forward if a judgement was given in our favour."
"The result will hopefully be known soon and we look forward to it in eager anticipation."
"In the meantime we have to work with the options that are available to us."
"They are restricted, at least formally, to amendments from the Committee on Fisheries which the European People's Party group is pleased to support."
"However, we are unable to support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets."
"The requirement to inform and consult Parliament on time is right on principle and in future blocking measures by us are no longer out of the question either."
"However, this raises the legal question whether we are entitled to encroach upon a current agreement and therefore the legal mandate of the Commission."
"But something has to happen!"
"I would therefore ask you not to climb down on the outstanding key policy issues."
"Otherwise other people will be treading on our toes and our budget will be threatened with cuts."
"That will hurt!"
"We have to avoid it at all costs!"
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Tajani."
"We approve of the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Guinea-Bissau because it is of particular interest to Italy. In fact it is one of the very few agreements which benefit Italian fishing vessels."
"The protocol offers Italy possibilities of 4, 000 tonnes gross tonnage prawn fishing and 1, 000 tonnes gross tonnage for cephalopods and demersal fish."
"There are five Italian fishing vessels operating in Guinea-Bissau waters with a Community licence and a further three will be added as from January 1998."
"This agreement has been praised for years; it has no controversial aspects but offers the flexibility of being drawn up on the basis of requests made by the Member States."
"The renewal of the protocol brings several changes based on the current rate of use of fishing possibilities; thus cephalopod and demersal fishing, which has fallen by 1, 000 tonnes gross tonnage, has been adapted to the smaller catch volume of previous years, which only amounts to 20 % of the possibilities negotiated by the Community."
"With regard to prawn fishing, the Community fleet had used around 93 % and this justifies the increase of 800 tonnes gross tonnage agreed by this protocol."
"This adaptation establishes an improvement in the cost/benefit ratio between the quantity of fish made available for Community fishing vessels and the financial compensation paid to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, which amounts to ECU 34 million in three years."
"In addition to the financial return, at the request of the Guinean government, the European Community also participates, among other things, in the financing of research grants and scientific and technical programmes intended to improve the knowledge of the state of fisheries resources and the support of home fishing programmes."
"I will make one last comment on the amendments presented in connection with the fisheries reports examined today."
"This question, which relates to the classification as non-oligatory and the costs relating to the fisheries agreements, will be re-examined by the Council, the Parliament and the Commission and ad hoc budget procedures will then be applied."
"That is why our group will not support this type of amendment."
"Mr President, as I cannot go into the substance, I will restrict myself to saying that the Committee on Fisheries and Parliament as a whole constantly deplore various aspects of the agreements submitted to us, and these aspects have been pointed out today by Mr Kindermann and Mr Jöns: the costs, the fact that Parliament is only involved in the consultation procedure, apart from the agreements with Morocco, and the impact of these agreements on fish stocks and the local fishing community."
"Whenever these agreements are examined, Parliament ends up accepting them."
"If Parliament seriously wants the Commission and Council to take this critical state of mind into account, it should reject them today, without criticizing, but supporting the policy of the Commissioner for Fisheries, Mrs Bonino, and sending the Commission and Council a clear signal that such consultation is unacceptable."
"That is why the Green Group will vote against these agreements."
"Thank you, Mr Ripa di Meana, for endeavouring to keep your speech short."
"Indeed, as you well know, when in the Chair, I am strict with the gavel but lax with the clock."
"Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, Madam Commissioner, for being here today."
"Firstly, of course, I should like to congratulate the four rapporteurs - Mr Novo, Mr Kindermann, Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Imaz San Miguel - on their excellent reports, drawn up extremely quickly, but without loss of quality."
"I believe that, taken as a whole, these four protocols will be highly advantageous to both the European Union and the third countries concerned, both because of the general increase in fishing possibilities and the contributions from the Community budget to initiatives such as the development of small-scale fishing - especially in the protocols with GuineaBissau and Equatorial Guinea - and because of the monitoring mechanisms established for those third countries."
"Nevertheless, and for the benefit of all those who still think that Community fishing in the waters of third countries is carried out with disregard for the state of stocks and the future of fishing in the region concerned, I should like to draw attention - with reference to the report by Mr Kindermann, who, I believe, did not emphasize this enough - to the celebrated regulation plan to protect Atlantic tuna, which was launched on the initiative of the three main Community producers of frozen tuna."
"I believe that we, who frequently criticize this sector, should, on the contrary, increasingly support initiatives of this kind, because they demonstrate that this sector also knows its job and, despite the mistakes that it has made in the past, is working to protect resources in the waters of third countries as well as in those of the Community."
"I wish to make clear that this plan is designed to monitor tuna stocks by means of voluntarily taking on board observers who will carry out the surveillance of a vast area encompassing the waters of Cameroon, Sao Tomé, Principe, Gabon and part of Nigeria, as well as those of Equatorial Guinea."
"In conclusion, I also wish to refer to the Council of Ministers."
"I should like to address Mrs Jöns. Mrs Jöns, I thank you for your advice, but I wish to tell you that a large number of Members of this Parliament do not share the views of the Committee on Budgets, and if your committee, which always bases its arguments regarding the celebrated question of non-obligatory expenditure on the Interinstitutional Agreement of October 1993, does not agree with the classification made by both the Commission and the Council, it should condemn the Commission and the Council for failure to comply with the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Otherwise, some Members will continue to believe that this should be obligatory expenditure."
"Mr President, this has been a good debate and it is important for certain Member States."
"I am delighted that the procedures seem to be improving although most colleagues would agree that they are not yet at a satisfactory state as regards the proposals that come from the Commission and their treatment by us and the Council."
"My main concern is that as a parliament we try to make sure that we get our development policies for some of these developing countries and our fishing policies and opportunities correctly stated."
"I believe in making sure that we do not over-exploit some of those fish stocks."
"In the long term we have to make sure that those countries develop their own local fishing industries."
"That means we have to make certain that the considerable funds we make available are properly utilized."
"As far as I can see from these reports we are talking about a total of ECU 41 million which is a lot of money scattered around the number of vessels that are participating in this local fisheries we are having the agreements with."
"The future of the European fisheries fleet is closely tied to these agreements."
"The Member States concerned who are utilizing those funds should recognize that they may at some time in the future have to be diverted to compensate for fishing opportunities that will no longer be available."
"That is why it is important that these agreements be seen in the light of future opportunities which may not always exist in the future."
"We have to recognize the fact that while we are great consumers of fish, it may not always be European vessels which will have the opportunity of exploiting those resources."
"Thank you, Mrs Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Report (A4-0300/97) by Mr Imaz San Miguel, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing the fishing possibilities and the financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on fishing off the coast of Guinea-Bissau for the period 16 June 1997 to 15 June 2001 (COM(97)0395 - C4-0448/97-97/0205(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I know my way around Guinea-Bissau quite well and am very impressed by my friend Mr Imaz San Miguel's report."
"I am sorry to have to say that I had some reservations when I read it."
"Although I voted for it I am not completely happy with it as fishing is the mainstay of life for the people of Guinea-Bissau."
"The way in which the quotas have been determined creates the risk that in fact overfishing will result."
"Although it is a good thing that quotas have been established, there were none before."
"At that time the people lived mostly from fishing."
"I remember people telling me that you could catch enough fish in two minutes to feed a whole family."
"Today that is no longer the case and I should very much like to ask people to be very careful after two years, now that everything is to run for four years."
"We were unable to support the report in the vote."
"This position is based on a matter of principle and must not be regarded as a rejection of the rapporteurʼs work."
"We believe that the European Union should abandon costly fisheries agreements of this type and switch over to providing support above all to the developing countriesʼ own fisheries activities."
"Such a solution would make a better contribution to the task of developing the importance of fisheries for worldwide food supplies, boost these countriesʼ economic development and also remove the risks that may be involved in the fisheries agreements, e.g. that certain Member Statesʼ fisheries activities might receive indirect support to continue operating in a situation where the entire European fishing industry is in need of substantial restrictions."
"We would therefore like to see the situation developing in such a way that the Community neither enters into new agreements of this type nor extends previous agreements."
"We would also like to emphasize the need for this type of agreement with third countries to be subject to improved scrutiny with regard to the budget."
"Medina Ortega report (A4-0365/97)"
"We were unable to support the report in the vote."
"This position must not be regarded as a rejection of the rapporteurʼs work."
"We believe that the European Union should abandon costly fisheries agreements of this type and switch over to providing support above all to the developing countriesʼ own fisheries activities."
"Such a solution would make a better contribution to the task of developing the importance of fisheries for worldwide food supplies, boost these nationsʼ economic development and also remove the risks that may be involved in the fisheries agreements, e.g. that certain Member Statesʼ fisheries activities might receive indirect support to continue operating in a situation where the entire European fishing industry is in need of substantial restrictions."
"We would therefore like to see the situation developing in such a way that the Community neither enters into new agreements of this type nor extends previous agreements."
"We would also like to emphasize the need for this type of agreement with third countries to be subject to improved scrutiny with regard to the budget."
"Kindermann report (A4-0364/97)"
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for his accomplished work on the report."
"However, we were unable to support the report in the final vote."
"This position must not be regarded as a rejection of the rapporteurʼs work, but is based on a matter of principle."
"We believe that the European Union should abandon costly fisheries agreements of this type and switch over to providing support above all to the developing countriesʼ own fisheries activities."
"Such a solution would make a better contribution to the task of developing the importance of fisheries for worldwide food supplies, boost these nationsʼ economic development and also remove the risks that may be involved in the fisheries agreements, e.g. that certain Member Statesʼ fisheries activities might receive indirect support to continue operating in a situation where the entire European fishing industry is in need of substantial restrictions."
"We would therefore like to see the situation developing in such a way that the Community neither enters into new agreements of this type nor extends previous agreements."
"We would also like to emphasize the need for this type of agreement with third countries to be subject to improved scrutiny with regard to the budget."
"Novo report (A4-0363/97)"
"We did not support the report."
"This position is based on a matter of principle."
"We believe that the European Union should abandon costly fisheries agreements of this type and switch over to providing support above all to the developing countriesʼ own fisheries activities."
"Such a solution would make a better contribution to the task of developing the importance of fisheries for worldwide food supplies, boost these nationsʼ economic development and also remove the risks that may be involved in the fisheries agreements, e.g. that certain Member Statesʼ fisheries activities might receive indirect support to continue operating in a situation where the entire European fishing industry is in need of substantial restrictions."
"We would therefore like to see the situation developing in such a way that the Community neither enters into new agreements of this type nor extends previous agreements."
"We would also like to emphasize the need for this type of agreement with third countries to be subject to improved scrutiny with regard to the budget."
"Adjournment of the session"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my agreeable duty to thank Parliament's services, the interpreters, the ushers, and everyone else, for their assistance."
"Today, however, I have a gentle rebuke for the Bureau's officials, since, recently, as you will have observed, I have not had the opportunity of chairing this cosy end to the Friday sitting."
"The Bureau's officials have not appointed me to that task."
"Firstly, this has diminished the appropriateness of the affectionate name of ""Man Friday' given to me by Mr Kellett-Bowman, recalling the native who was Robinson Crusoe's companion on his island."
"This is, of course, a nickname, but it also demonstrates that Parliament is not racist, since even a native - albeit with some retraining - can rise to be a Vice-President of Parliament."
"But secondly, and most importantly, it has deprived me of the agreeable company of all you Robinson Crusoes, who remain here every Friday on this island, endeavouring to break our isolation from the citizens of Europe with patient and positive work in which I am honoured to collaborate."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.46 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 21 November 1997."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament sets great store by its relations with Russia."
"I am therefore pleased to announce the presence in the official gallery of a delegation from the Duma and Federal Council of the Russian Federation, led by Mr Vladimir Ryzhkov, the First Vice-President of the Duma and chairman of the delegation for relations with the European Parliament."
"I extend our official welcome to the delegation and congratulate them on their constructive and valuable work in the context of the first meeting between the European Union and the Russian Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of 21 November 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, in relation to the Minutes, has any progress been made by yourself and your offices in the matter of correspondence with a Member of this House who made charges of a serious criminal nature in respect of the buildings policy of the institution?"
"Several letters have been exchanged, Mr Cox."
"I would be happy to let you have a photocopy if you would like more information."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Agenda"
"Mr Bazin has asked for his report (A4-0369/97), which was due to be taken without debate, not to be put to the vote tomorrow, but postponed to the December part-session in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, the reason which led me to make this request is no longer valid."
"I would therefore ask you to consider this request null and void and keep the item on tomorrow's agenda."
"Very well, Mr Bazin."
"Unless there is any change, it will be on tomorrow's agenda."
"The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy has asked for the proposal for a Council regulation extending the programme to promote international cooperation in the energy sector (Synergy) (C40555/97) to be added to the agenda under the procedure without report (Rule 99)."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Enlargement - Agenda 2000"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0368/97 by Mr Oostlander and Mr Barón Crespo , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission ""Agenda 2000 - for a stronger and wider Union' (COM(97)2000 - C4-0371/97); -A4-0331/97 by Mr Colom i Naval, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on Agenda 2000: the 2000-2006 financial framework for the Union and the future financing system (COM(97)2000 - C4-0372/97)."
"Mr President, ten years ago anyone who suggested that central and eastern European countries might join the Union would have been accused of telling fairy stories."
"Now it has become a sober reality which we are facing."
"We have become quite accustomed to some people reacting by asking what it will it cost."
"In the meantime we should realize that we are living amongst half-realized ideals for which we are not prepared."
"I would like to bring up a few essential points."
"The Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam has brought many benefits to this Parliament and the Union, but the ministers did not manage to adapt the Union for enlargement to another dozen members."
"The Council's position that we do not need to worry about that until the Union has more than twenty members, has led to a proposal for a division of the candidates into an elite group of five against the rest."
"This proposal is very discouraging for governments and citizens who have to pursue, or indeed carry, a tough and courageous policy."
"We should be glad we have such courageous governments and citizens in central Europe, but we have to protect them carefully."
"I am thinking primarily of Bulgaria and Romania where changing governments are tackling corruption and other problems highly intensively."
"They do not deserve this two-tiered thinking."
"Moreover, that kind of thinking lessens the pressure on the chosen elite to work on diligently, and we know that all candidates have a lot more homework to do."
"It does not do us any good if the privileged position of a few means they come to us at once with their demands."
"The European Commission is fully aware that a rigid division of candidates is unrealistic."
"During each half-yearly, or as we suggest, yearly evaluation it might turn out that the order of states has changed yet again."
"Understandably, because all these counties are developing very fast, and, all being well, have ambitious governments."
"They are caught up in an honourable competition, one might say."
"Some might develop faster than others."
"It depends on the quality of their dedication and the quality of their public administration and their government."
"Almost the entire Parliament supports the justifiable wish of the Commission to hold an Intergovernmental Conference which will genuinely reform the Union, before the first accession is to take place."
"With this proposal the justification for classifying the candidates into two groups is removed."
"If an Intergovernmental Conference is held first, then afterwards we will only have to deal with ten very different central and eastern European countries and Cyprus."
"There is no need to arrive at a two-tier classification on the basis of a proposal by the Council which is no longer in effect."
"The political decision to take the road to membership via a strengthened entry and negotiation process with all candidates which are constitutional states, is a political decision that is being taken now."
"This road does not have to obstructed by broaching political decisions or particular issues, such as last chapters."
"They will be dealt with automatically when the time has come."
"No extra barriers therefore for less developed states."
"We call this the starting line principle."
"This means a substantive start and not just a symbolic one with a family photo."
"We all know that the bilateral negotiations will differ slightly in approach, because the partners are markedly different."
"Hungary will be able to start with Chapter 20, as it were, Bulgaria with Chapter 2."
"But they are taking part in the same competition."
"One is better prepared for a more intensive process than the other."
"The countries will reach the finishing line at different times."
"But this will not be the result of a political decision by us, but of the capability of the countries themselves."
"Not until the end of the road will our political opinion be given, yes or no, to their accession."
"Perhaps there are candidate countries which will surprise us with their speed, and perhaps others will disappoint."
"This all depends on the dedication of those countries and of course on our help with the improvement of their public administration."
"I am pleased to see in Agenda 2000 that such a high percentage of Phare aid is being made available for this."
"Talking about the quality of administration and the quality of the constitutional state, I have to say that I find it regrettable that Slovakia does not yet meet the Copenhagen criteria and the constitutional state, for which a democracy clause was incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam at our request."
"In the event that Bratislava changes course then Slovakia will belong to the most advanced candidate members."
"But perhaps the country needs a government which is better at presenting the European character of Slovakia than the present one."
"Nevertheless we do not want to isolate countries like this."
"In addition to the bilateral process, we propose multilateral negotiations."
"At the European conference we will be able to discuss issues of common interest in the second and third pillar with all applicant countries, including Turkey, Slovakia, Malta, whoever, during the annual Conferences of Ministers."
"Within this framework there is also a proposal to invite an even smaller group, only comprising the constitutional states for continuous in-depth negotiation about several matters of communal interest."
"This is intended as a kind of prelude to what will happen after full membership."
"The European Conference could be held from within this negotiation."
"For that matter, we believe that the absence of a full European policy towards Cyprus is unacceptable."
"We are seriously suffering from the absence of a foreign policy from the Union."
"The Union should not limit itself to talks about accession, but should apply sustained effort to the solution of the problem of this divide."
"We have someone in the Middle East; we can also have someone who, from a European perspective, helps solve Cyprus' problems from within."
"Turkey does not yet appear to be taking the road to membership of the Union; its actions suggest this."
"Otherwise this country would, for example, cooperate constructively on the Cyprus issue, or offer its services."
"The transformation to a true stable constitutional state is more difficult in Turkey."
"We should not underestimate the problems related to this."
"It will take a long time."
"We recognize that something like this cannot be achieved overnight."
"Partly because of many well-meaning friends in Turkey, the European Conference is also a suitable bridge to ensure that, in addition to the Customs Union, the links with Turkey will be enduring ones and will be protected."
"To achieve the ideal of enlargement of our association of constitutional states with a large number of countries, which until recently suffered under a totalitarian regime, one should not respond primarily with a calculator."
"It would be a bad sign for the quality of European culture."
"But calculating how we can foster accession financially and work out the cost implications is advisable."
"The positions on this vary in this Parliament."
"The difference between us amounts to approximately a quarter cent on a tax guilder."
"In other words, it is not very dramatic."
"I think that the present frugal policy of our Parliament will make it possible to achieve the enlargement within the financial parameters agreed earlier."
"Finally, Mr President, that we will all be distinctly better off, is shown by many an independent economic research institute."
"Substantial benefit is to be had in a guarantee of security and an environment in which human rights are respected: lasting liberation of peoples from the clutches of totalitarianism, a socially and ecologically responsible development based on a democratic legal system."
"Generations before us have longed for this."
"We can give them a little push, so that it will become reality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today, on the threshold of the new millennium, to inaugurate a new stage in the building of Europe."
"On the basis of Agenda 2000, we have to send a clear and concrete message to the forthcoming European Council in Luxembourg. I think we are witnessing a historic opportunity, and there are two fundamental aspects we need to think about."
"The first is that as citizens of the European Union we now have the historic opportunity to transcend Munich - to reverse the events of 1939 when the people of central and eastern Europe were abandoned - and this must be done on the basis of what we have built."
"I think it is a question of amending history, and we should welcome the opportunity to do so. It is a chance to add a Europe of goodwill to the Europe of liberty which eleven countries of central and eastern Europe, and Cyprus, wish to join."
"It is a shame that its current government has not seen fit to include Malta among these countries, since it is an old friend with whom we enjoy good relations."
"I believe Parliament is ready to recognize these countries' right to become members of the European Union, and thinks we should set out along the road towards enlargement and a rapid reinforcement of our relations with them. We need to start with a solemn act which will reflect this moment's historical importance, and also define a general framework, as we have done on other occasions, in order to proceed in an orderly and democratic fashion."
"I think these are the two first steps upon which the process of negotiation should be based."
"If you will allow me to do so, Mr President, I would like to draw an analogy between this moment and another of our great European traditions: the Olympic Games, which marked the first occasion on which the ancient Greeks called a truce in their wars."
"In this case we are going to set a single starting line, but not necessarily a single finishing line."
"These countries are going to have to make valiant efforts to conform to the rules and heritage which govern our relations, and they are going to have to do so based on the recognition of the rights expressed in our treaties and at the Copenhagen summit."
"They will need our help with this, because they face a triple challenge."
"They must consolidate their democracy, restructure their economy and learn the meaning of good neighbourliness in European Union terms. Mr President, you and I share the experience of having been forced to spend the greater part of our lives under a dictatorship, and we can appreciate what these things mean."
"For that reason, I believe we need to open our gates wide to receive these countries, and start the process of enlargement with generosity and openness."
"This solemn act needs to be performed on the understanding that this is an all-inclusive project - a process which must encompass everybody."
"I think the Commission will be sympathetic to this basic approach, and once the European Council has worked out the general framework, the Commission can begin the process of bilateral negotiations with these countries, with openness and a clear sense of its responsibility to Parliament."
"The second thing we have to think about, Mr President, is the impact, bearing in mind that this is a complex situation."
"We have to be able to adapt the national and Community interests we have created for ourselves to the solidarity and openness we are calling for, which will be needed in areas of trade and politics."
"This will not be easy, as is shown by the fact that in the last few months nearly all of our parliamentary committees have been busy working out which areas are likely to experience difficulties or conflicts of interest."
"Most of us sitting here today are the products of the progressive enlargements of a project which started off as a historical absurdity, but I am glad to say was gradually consolidated and came to change the face of history. I think we should remind ourselves today that all the enlargements which have taken place since the days of that initial nucleus of six countries have, on balance, had a positive effect overall, despite the many voices which predicted failure or disaster."
"Our common will to seek peace, democracy and prosperity has succeeded in proving wrong all those experts, and their voices of doom."
"I believe this is the approach we have to take now in planning this, the greatest enlargement - the greatest challenge of our history."
"The reasons are not just political;"
"I think there are also selfish reasons which we have in common."
"We can see a great market opening up before us, composed of eager countries with a lower level of income than ourselves, with whom we have a positive balance of trade overall."
"What we must do is not just take advantage of this situation, but open ourselves up to them, not just for the sake of our prosperity, but for the sake of the stability of Europe."
"Mr President, I am not going to go on much longer."
"I should just like to thank Mr Oostlander, my co-rapporteur, for the tireless and unyielding persistence with which he tackled the work, and also all those draftsmen of opinions who collaborated with us, and pointed out that certain very important matters need mentioning, which they will shortly do on behalf of their respective committees."
"Reference has been made to the cost. I believe we cannot talk about the cost without weighing up the benefits."
"However, I think the Committee on Budgets has established a good basis, to which we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy give our support. The estimates so far, which do not yet constitute the financial perspectives, depend not just on growth but also on the reforms we must make in agricultural, regional and other policies - not for the sake of enlargement, but just to survive."
"If we do not do this, we run the risk of turning this debate into a question of finance. The fact is, if this debate only considers the financial aspects, selfishness will prevail and we will not be able to take this historic step."
"I shall stop there, Mr President, because my time has run out."
"Please just let me conclude by mentioning that great European, President Vaclav Havel, who says that we human beings try to master history, but history is more dynamic, richer and more logical than we are."
"I believe that is the spirit in which we must confront this unprecedented challenge for the European Union."
"Mr President, firstlI would like to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets sincerely for their invaluable help with the preparation of this report. I am also grateful to the many MEPs who have contributed, especially the members of the Committee on Budgets."
"Their contribution has been so great that I am not going to say that I take full personal responsibility for this report, as is traditional with academic works. Since all of us in the Committee on Budgets voted for this report, I think I am justified in saying that my fellow committee members share the responsibility for both the good points and any errors in the proposal we are presenting to Parliament."
"To get down to business, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out that although today's joint debate is about enlargement, that is not the sole concern of this report by the Committee on Budgets."
"This is a first reaction report on the Agenda 2000 communication and, notwithstanding the importance of enlargement, it considers many other aspects as well."
"However, let me say that those of us who suffered forty years of fascist dictatorship, were not liberated by the Allies, and had no Marshall Plan at all, well understand the aspirations of the citizens of eastern and central Europe, and we support their hopes and wishes to join us soon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has fulfilled its political obligation, according to the Intergovernmental Conference, to present a post-1999 programme, which we could think of as a notebook containing the European Union's tasks for the first years of Agenda 2000."
"Among those tasks, the word enlargement is written in capital letters, but there are other entries in capitals too."
"In any case, enlargement affects them all."
"We must realize that whether or not enlargement takes place we have to reform and adjust our common agricultural policy, while our obligations to GATT and the World Trade Organization mean that we will have to change substantial elements of our current agricultural policy by 2003."
"We must remember that the structural fund regulations expire in 1999, whether enlargement is to take place or not, and therefore we will need to revise our cohesion policy, and everything included in the existing category II of the financial perspectives."
"As for monetary union and the single currency, these will be brought in regardless of whether or not enlargement takes place."
"Do we know what changes the euro will entail for our internal and external policies?"
"What will be the European Union's role on the world stage in the Twenty-first Century?"
"What is our contribution to the development of peace?"
"What are the consequences of the Treaty of Amsterdam for the Union's budget?"
"All these questions were waiting to be answered, and the European Commission has tried to answer them by means of Agenda 2000, which includes a financial framework for the period 2000-2006."
"It was a difficult task, and we think the Commission has been too pragmatic."
"On previous occasions, such as the Delors I and II Packages, the Commission evaluated the objectives and the requirements, and then made the most moderate and cautious financial proposal possible."
"We have the impression that on this occasion they used the opposite approach. It seems that their starting point was a prefixed and immovable financial ceiling - the sacrosanct 1.27 % of GNP - and, based on that figure, they balanced the finances to fit as much as possible under that ceiling."
"I am not going to say that it is impossible for things to happen as the Commission predicts."
"In fact, between 1988 and 1997 we have never reached the prevailing own resources ceiling, and there was only one financial year in which the budgetary authority (of which Parliament forms a part) was unable to make significant savings compared with the financial perspectives."
"Moreover, the amount saved between 1988 and 1996 compared with what the national parliaments authorized in ratifying the own resources decision, is greater than the total amount envisaged by the Commission for pre-accession and enlargement."
"Nevertheless, the Committee on Budgets thinks that the Commission's proposal is based on too many uncertain hypotheses."
"For example, that growth of GNP in the Fifteen should be 2.5 % per year."
"It is plausible, and we hope it happens."
"However, in the previous period, 1991-1996, the real growth among the Fifteen was 1.5 %, one point less each year."
"If it were to continue at 1.5 % during the period 2000-2006, the budget planned by the Commission would exceed the 1.27 % ceiling in five of the seven budgetary years."
"However slightly the interannual growth rate drops below 2 %, the Commission's structure will totter - and I do not mean the Berlaymont Building!"
"What would be the result of a different timetable for enlargement?"
"If the accession date or the number of new Member States changes, can anybody be sure now, in autumn 1997, what our future members' requirements would be, without even knowing the content of the accession treaties, or what the transitional periods will be - if there are any - for each country and sector?"
"The Commission's proposal oversimplifies the Council debate, but it is based on what we in the Committee on Budgets have termed ""virtual savings' ."
"They are possible, but they are by no means guaranteed."
"We are being asked to exercise austerity and responsibility and, for our edification, the Council rejects a reduction in cereal aid, a sector in which it has been shown that overcompensation was paid, to the tune of ECU 3 thousand million, by the member governments of the Council."
"If that is the Council's remedy for CAP reform, the Commission's proposal will experience an annual financial shortfall of about ECU 4 billion just in Category I - that is, agricultural spending."
"And that takes no account of the financial engineering they propose for objectives 5a and 5b of the structural funds, which they are trying to include in Category I."
"Similarly, the proposal contains a series of interesting points on cohesion policy, including the very maintenance of the cohesion fund, which will provoke more serious objections from Parliament in the future, although we may already hint at them."
"But what will happen, ladies and gentlemen, if not all the points in the proposal are approved?"
"To what extent is it realistic to assume that the Fifteen will accept a reduction in the structural funds directed towards their own territories and their own citizens?"
"I want to make it clear that we fully understand why the Commission is proposing to concentrate funds in the least welloff and least-developed zones of the current Union, taking it for granted that it is neither logical nor fair for enlargement to take place to the detriment of these regions."
"Enlargement should be paid for by everybody, in an equitable manner."
"All of this leads us to make the following offer to the Council and the Commission."
"We accept the financial content of the Commission's communication as the starting point."
"We are critical of it, and even question the timescale."
"But let us be clear about this: Parliament thinks that the challenges facing the European Union mean that it is advisable for us to have budgetary peace, and therefore we call for the formal presentation of the financial perspectives for the Union of the Fifteen, including of course a chapter on enlargement, and preferably an interinstitutional agreement on financial and budgetary discipline."
"However, that does not mean that Parliament is prepared to be taken for a ride."
"Budgetary agreements such as last Thursday's make the Committee on Budgets deeply suspicious of the Council's attitude."
"Therefore, we ask that our criticisms of and suggestions for the Commission's proposal should be heeded. We consider it an essential condition that a revision clause should be included, to make it possible to work out the budgetary implications of the various accession treaties, of course, but also the implications if the virtual savings are fulfilled - if reforms of the common agricultural policy and the structural funds (which in themselves do not aim to achieve savings) generate the savings predicted by the Commission, or if it is shown that the rate of growth of the Community economy exceeds the hoped-for 2.5 %."
"We also think that between now and enlargement we should update the budgetary procedure and the own resources system, to make them fairer and more transparent to the European public."
"Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Council and the Commission, the challenges of the next few years are important for Europe and, I would add, for the rest of the world."
"We should certainly tackle them with austerity and responsibility."
"However, the first rule of responsibility is not to try to deceive oneself, especially where money is concerned."
"Therefore, it is no good pretending that we can guarantee at this stage that the whole of Agenda 2000, including enlargement, will involve no cost to anybody."
"Europe deserves a more serious approach, and Parliament will demand that that is what it gets."
"And I still have 30 seconds left, as a symbol of economization!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, may I begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteurs, Mr Oostlander, Mr Barón Crespo, Mr Colom i Naval, and also to Mr Spencer who has had a coordinating role, and to the many other people who have contributed to the two reports, in the committees and the joint parliamentary committees."
"The two reports comprehensively cover the complex issues which will be on the agenda in the coming European Council of Luxembourg."
"The Commission would like to thank this Parliament for its constructive approach and observes with a certain satisfaction that the ideas of the European Parliament and the Commission largely coincide on a number of important issues."
"I would like to use this opportunity to touch briefly upon the main points of enlargement and financing proposals in Agenda 2000, and to draw attention to areas on which there might still be some disagreement."
"In politics it is sometimes necessary to make clear decisions, however tempting it may be to let a certain ambiguous situation continue to exist, and this serves a justified political aim."
"We believe that the Member States asked for clarity when they asked the Commission to give advice on the applications for entry from the ten countries in central and eastern Europe."
"Over a period of more than a year the Commission analyzed the information which had been supplied by the candidates."
"We then verified these using the most reliable sources in the Member States, and also international institutions; and the Member States, as well as the candidate countries, and recently also the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, have recognized that the Commission's evaluation and judgment have been professional and correct."
"Listening to the rapporteurs and reflecting on earlier constructive debates on enlargement which we have been able to engage in, I would like to underline how to the Commission, and we presume also to many in this Parliament, the enlargement operation is very much a process, a process from which none of the candidate countries should be excluded."
"No enlargement scenario is to be allowed which would lead to new dividing lines in Europe."
"This applies in particular to countries in central and eastern Europe, who have for too long been separated from us, and we from them, by the disastrous tide of history."
"The President of the Council also pointed out that this enlargement procedure included both the negotiations and the preparations."
"Whether a candidate is able to progress from preparation to negotiations is purely to do with the degree of progress."
"Whether a candidate negotiates or prepares himself for this, and let there be no mistake about this, it in no way influences their chances of membership, because the certainty of membership was, after all, already given to all candidates by the decree of the European Council in 1993."
"The historical character of enlargement and the historical duty which the European Union took upon itself not to exclude any candidates, was already announced and confirmed."
"That is why the Commission wonders whether a joint start in negotiations with all candidates would not be an extremely artificial approach."
"We have said it so often: differentiation is not discrimination but a natural consequence of the acknowledged differences in progress towards membership."
"In our opinion a joint starting line would only give satisfaction in the short term, which would then turn to disappointment and frustration when the negotiations did not show the expected progress through lack of sufficient preparation."
"Besides, the Council President pointed out just recently, that an earlier start to negotiations by no means automatically implies an earlier accession date."
"More than that: overtaking by the ""pre-ins' is possible, just as the ""ins' may experience delay."
"This all depends on the efforts and results of each individual country."
"Another important consideration for the Commission, in not opting for the joint starting line, is that to the candidate countries which are presently most advanced, there may obviously also be a risk of delay."
"For that matter, for the least advanced candidates it will mean a less effective operation which will hinder the necessary concentration on the implementation of partenariats."
"By the above I wanted to explain we adhere to the differentiation between more and less advanced candidate countries, and why we differentiate between negotiations and preparation, and that this differentiation cannot in any way be taken as discrimination, let alone disqualification."
"We express this not only in words, but also in action."
"The pre-accession strategy includes six or so core elements which apply to the ""ins' and to the ""pre-ins' , in other words to all the candidate countries in central and eastern Europe."
"This shows very clearly the all-encompassing nature of the enlargement process."
"We are talking about six elements; first, the entry partnerships."
"I will not go into detail; you know about those."
"Secondly, doubling the financial support to help each candidate country with preparations for membership."
"And as from 2000 the candidate countries will receive a total of ECU 3 billion a year, of which ECU 1.5 billion will come from Phare, ECU 1 billion from the structural funds, and ECU 500 million out of the Section I Agriculture, assuming that our financial proposals are accepted by the Council."
"In addition, the Commission is investigating whether it is possible to create what I would like to call a takeover fund out of Phare, which anyhow will be on top of the existing national allocations."
"A fund which, as the title of takeover fund suggests, is intended for those countries who have to make the greatest extra efforts, in other words, for the ""pre-ins' ."
"Third core element: the Commission proposes to introduce a permanent European Conference."
"Council President Poos also mentioned this, a multilateral forum in which all candidate countries are involved."
"It is important that the conference, despite its simple structure, be given substantial issues to deal with, because otherwise it will remain an empty shell and will have little value as a forum for candidates."
"Fourth core element: the Commission commits itself to evaluate the candidates' progress annually, starting in December 1998."
"This evaluation has to offer the necessary certainty and at the same time act as a incentive for them to continue with the requisite reforms."
"The fifth core element is to open up the possibility for all candidates to take part in a Community programme so that they are able to get used to our programmes, institutions and working method."
"And sixth, the Commission will recommend immediately that negotiations are opened up to include the remaining candidate countries as soon as they have fulfilled the necessary conditions."
"I thought it would be helpful to sum up once more why the Commission made the choices it is currently submitting to the Council, and about which it would like to hear the advice and opinion of this Parliament."
"The Commission, would also like to say a few words about Turkey. Agenda 2000 went into this issue, after all."
"The importance of close links with Turkey are generally acknowledged."
"Turkey has been linked to Union for some time already; through the Association Agreement, and the Custom Union, effected in 1995, reflects the special nature of our relations."
"Turkey, in particular in the run-up to Luxembourg, has asked a number of times for clarity with regard to its prospects of future membership of the Union, even though Turkey understands that it is a long-term issue."
"The Union for its part is asking Turkey for more clarity on its intention to overcome the political problems related to human rights, the situation in Cyprus, and the tense relationship with our Member State, Greece."
"The Commission is in favour of clarity on both sides."
"We therefore hope that the European Council in Luxembourg will be able to start registering positive steps in Ankara on the one hand, and that on the other hand it will formulate substantive conclusions on how Turkey might achieve EU membership."
"Vis-à-vis the latter, the Commission has come out with building blocks, including enlargement and deepening of the Customs Union, and participation by Turkey in a substantive European Conference."
"Furthermore, the Commission pleaded earlier for the implementation of financial cooperation with Turkey, which would form the logical and contractual complement to the Customs Union."
"It is entirely clear to the Commission that the Presidency obviously will want to avoid the summit in Luxembourg, which has enlargement as its main agenda point, degenerating into a summit in which the discussion about the future relationship with Turkey would dominate."
"This would do no justice to the reasonable expectations of our partners in central and eastern Europe."
"We hope that Luxembourg will be a significant step forward, which at the same time is able to promote a favourable climate for the start of entry negotiations with Cyprus, in which, it is the majority of the Member States' view, the opinion of the Turkish Cypriot community will have been included."
"In the draft report another important point is touched upon."
"The European Parliament rightly points out that, just as during the previous enlargement round, widening of the Union must go hand in hand with a number of necessary reforms, if it wants to be able to function efficiently and effectively."
"I think that in this, the European Parliament has chosen the same approach as the Commission in its Agenda 2000, which advocates that decisions about this should be made before the first new Member States join the Union."
"Finally, a few words about financing the enlargement."
"The report submitted by Mr Colom i Naval on behalf of the budget committee, meets the considerations which the Commission had in mind when working out the new financial framework on several essential points."
"It primarily dealt with the following aspects."
"The importance of retaining the financial prospects instrument is stressed, and of entering into a new interinstitutional agreement."
"The orientation which the Commission proposes in the province of common agricultural policy and in structural measures seem to appear in the report in broad outline."
"Strengthening Community policy areas which can contribute the most to employment and growth, are considered a high priority by both the Commission and the report."
"The financial framework and Agenda 2000 are reference frameworks."
"The Commission thinks it as important to come to a correct balance between the financial resources which the Union needs to carry out important tasks during the coming decade, and on the other hand the requirements for budgetary discipline to which everyone has to subject himself."
"The proposed framework shows that it is possible to continue implementing Community policy, and gradually absorb new Member States, with the own resources ceiling at 1.27 % of GNP, whilst at the same time allowing for considerable safety margins."
"The aim was to work out whether our various proposals displayed a proper general coherence from a financial point of view."
"This context being the starting point for the Commission, the discussion will undoubtedly have to be made more profound and further fine-tuned."
"So, in accordance with its obligations, the Commission will submit two kinds of financial proposal before the end of the coming six months: a survey of financial prospects for the period 2002-2006 for a Union of fifteen Member States, taking into consideration sums which will continue to be available to cover the cost of enlargement to a number of new Member States."
"This Parliament will have to give its opinion on this overview."
"The financial prospects will have to be adjusted in consultation between institutions when the accession of a number of additional countries takes place, dependent on the entry date and on the agreed entry conditions."
"At that point the actual developments of the economic parameters compared to original expectations can be taken into account."
"The budgetary consequences of the reforms the Fifteen will have started will also be better known."
"In addition, a report on the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement of 1993 will also be submitted, together with guidelines for a new agreement."
"On this basis a debate will have to be started on, in particular, some of the issues cited in the report, such as the degree of flexibility needed for the next financial framework and the resources necessary to improve interinstitutional cooperation during the completion of the budgetary procedure."
"As far as the financing system is concerned, the Commission acknowledges that the current system in force meets these expectations."
"The system succeeds in its most important task, namely to see to it that there are stable and sufficient means."
"The distribution of the financial burden, especially after the recent changes, is in line with the fairness principle, bearing in mind the relative prosperity of the Member States."
"The positions of the Member States on the budget does not depart much from the expectations at the time that the Delors II package was specified."
"It is unlikely that the situation will be profoundly modified during the coming period, except in the sense that inevitably, all present Member States will have to share the cost of enlargement."
"During the period of the next financial perspectives the preservation of the present finance system and the effects of the reforms of the principal Community policy areas will not cause any significant changes in the relative budget situation."
"These considerations have again been set out and specified in the working paper the Commission submitted at the informal Ecofin Council of 13 October 1997, which pointed out the restrictions and deficiencies of an approach which is too strongly focussed on the budget balance per Member State."
"It was the duty of the Commission to announce this requirement now in its Agenda 2000, and to indicate that as a result, a complete reworking of the system of means is not necessary."
"It goes without saying that, in accordance with the agreement the Commission has entered, it will submit a detailed report on the working of the system of own resources in the course of 1998."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, as an Austrian I am delighted to be the first speaker from my group - in fact, I come from a country which is considerably affected by the enlargement of the European Union, although I realise I am only speaking first because Klaus Hänsch arrived relatively late due to difficult circumstances and he was generous enough to allow me to speak."
"I also thank him for the fact - he played a decisive part in this - that we in our group were finally able to find common ground with another group, which I consider to be very positive."
"Over the past few weeks ""joining fever' has been raging in this House."
"The big question has been: are you in favour of regatta or are you in favour of five plus one?"
"At breakfast, lunch and dinner, and not just during meetings of the Committee on Foreign Policy, that has been the central question dividing people, to exaggerate a little, into friends and enemies."
"Ultimately, as befits both Parliament and ourselves, we are in favour of both. But that is not just a lazy compromise - it is also a good compromise, as the President of the Council and the Commissioner have already pointed out."
"So this has kept us intensely busy, and for us it is not just a matter of fact question, it is also a very emotional question."
"What better verdict on of the European Union can there be than the fact that so many countries are queuing at the door of this Union with one predominant desire, namely to become a member of this Union?"
"However critical we may be, however dissatisfied with so much, and our citizens even more so, it is nevertheless the best possible sign for a community when, really, all those inside it want to stay there and all those outside it want to come in. That is what our neighbours want and we should help them."
"In fact, they see in membership of the European Union the opportunity to overcome all the grief, all the bad economic developments, all the political difficulties of the past decades, and it is our downright responsibility and obligation to help them triumph!"
"After all, the fall of the Iron Curtain, the destruction of the communist regime does not bring about, on its own, the peace and prosperity we want for them and which is necessary for us as well."
"Of course we should give equal consideration to the fact that many of us are frightened of this enlargement process, because there will be migrations, because there will perhaps be less money for us or for some of us, or because some of us will be asked to pay more money."
"This fear should be taken seriously, for without our own people and their approval we cannot conclude this expansion process positively, so that it is supported by our people not only in form but also in substance and we ought to say that."
"We should tell them that it is a huge opportunity for Europe and for all of us."
"Enlargement is not a game in which one wins and the other loses, in which Hungary, Poland and all the other countries win because we lose."
"No, enlargement is a chance to create a common area of welfare and security in Europe, and we must seize that chance!"
"Despite this positive emotional attitude we should also be frank and honest. It is not an Easter stroll, with spring already here and summer just around the corner."
"It is a difficult, protracted process of negotiation and discussion which, given goodwill, can be properly concluded. But it requires goodwill on both sides and of course it requires the applicant countries to carry out reforms."
"It will take time to carry out these reforms and therefore I would discard any short term prognosis."
"The essential point is not what prognoses we venture to make as to when these countries may join. What is decisive is that next year we begin serious negotiations, immediately, that we start work immediately to introduce the reforms, both in the countries which want to join and in the countries of the European Union."
"The formula we have found, or are in the process of finding together - by this evening we will have to consider it - is in my view a thoroughly practicable formula."
"We want everybody to participate in this enlargement process, so that nobody is excluded, nobody feels forced to stay outside, without knowing how long the wait will be. Above all, we want negotiations to take place with those who espouse democracy not only in theory but also in practice, and we want intensive negotiations to take place with those now proposed by the Commission."
"If something changes in these countries - and things can change rapidly, as we see in the Czech Republic - then we simply negotiate with those who have meanwhile improved."
"In this respect I would like to thank the Commission and pay tribute to its work, even if the proposal has now been changed."
"We could only change it, we could only reach this compromise, because it was possible to build on the Commission's proposal."
"In this sense we have found a very good solution."
"In this sense it is possible to carry out this process of enlargement without weakening the European Union, for we want enlargement to strengthen the European Union."
"We will succeed if we work at it together."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is today holding its second debate on the enlargement of the European Union by ten states from central and eastern Europe and Cyprus."
"On 16 July the European Commission introduced its Agenda 2000 and we discussed it on the same day."
"Today we are debating on the basis of the reports by our colleagues, Arie Oostlander and Enrique Barón Crespo, and I would like to talk about these two reports."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party to express very sincere thanks to Mr Oostlander and Mr Barón Crespo for their difficult and excellent work!"
"The people of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Rumania would like to belong to the European Union because they share our convictions and ideals for Europe in the 21st Century, in order, as stated in the Treaty of Rome of 1957, and I quote: ""... to lay the foundations for an ever closer union ... (and) ... by thus pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty ...' ."
"This wish is shared not only by the people in the five countries which the Commission has proposed for entry negotiations but also by the people in all ten states of central and eastern Europe which are associated with the European Union by European Agreements. Let us not forget that in 1989-90 it was the people of the states of central and eastern Europe who by their desire for freedom, their struggle for democracy, their desire for a market economy made possible the change in our continent, and we must not disappoint these people, who engendered the peaceful revolution in Europe, by the decision which we take now."
"(Applause) These are people in central and eastern Europe who live as we do in a free society and therefore the Group of the European People's Party is convinced that all Europeans have a political and moral right to live in security, peace and freedom."
"Therefore for us the First Commandment is that entry negotiations must begin. We must not discriminate against any country and let us not be so arrogant as to say what discrimination is, rather let us hear how these people themselves might feel discriminated against by our decisions."
"We must therefore make our decisions so as to encourage these States, these people, to carry forward this difficult and frequently painful process of reform in anticipation of entry to the European Union."
"The people need encouragement."
"Therefore the Group of the European People's Party calls upon the Heads of State and of Government at the Summit on 12 and 13 December in Luxembourg to send a signal to the peoples of central and eastern Europe that they belong to the European family and that they will grow step by step into the community of nations of the European Union."
"The Group of the European People's Party passed unanimous resolutions on 1 October and 26 November in Brussels and then at its congress in Toulouse on 11 November 1997."
"The discussions, and I agree with Mr Swoboda, were very difficult, but we finally reached unanimous resolutions and recommend the following process for enlargement: first, an intensified accession and negotiation process with the central and eastern European countries which meet the political conditions for membership, together with Cyprus, should begin in 1998; secondly: intensive negotiations on an individual basis should be pursued with those countries which have made most progress; thirdly, an enlargement dialogue, in which the candidate countries participate, should create an informal network, in order to discuss all areas of European Union policy; fourthly: the European Conference proposed by the Commission can be a useful instrument of cooperation in order, in particular, to strengthen relations with Turkey."
"The process of enlargement is becoming difficult and there are many stones in the path to enlargement which must be cleared away by the applicant countries but also by the European Union itself, which must prepare itself via the necessary institutional and political reforms for enlargement."
"We should not just talk about the tasks the applicant countries must perform."
"We should also be talking about the tasks which we ourselves as the European Union have to perform, because we want enlargement to lead to a strengthening of the European Union and therefore we must make this European Union more capable of action, we must make it more democratic, so that the peoples of central and eastern Europe will enter a Union enables all Europeans to achieve a stable future for the entire 21st Century."
"We, the European Parliament, which today represents 370 million people must be the advocate of the peoples of the whole of Europe."
"If we are not the advocate then who will be?"
"We, the Members, must be the advocate."
"Europe is not just the European Union of today!"
"We must work to ensure that the peoples of central and eastern Europe with whom we want to begin the intensified accession and negotiation process at the start of 1998, also send their representatives step by step to the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament, where we are now, here in Brussels - we have just moved into the new offices - is certainly much too big to be merely a European Parliament for the European Union of today!"
"We must open up this Parliament!"
"Let us work together to ensure that as soon as possible in the next decade, which will also be a new century and a new millennium, we will be able to welcome freely elected representatives from central and eastern Europe here in the European Parliament."
"A few years ago this idea was still utopian."
"Today it is not even a vision any more but a probability which will soon become a reality if we ourselves are committed to work for it."
"The Group of the European People's Party sets itself this historic task for our old continent of Europe, which is constantly renewing itself."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the most important foreign political responsibility of the European Union in the coming decades will be contributing to the security and stability of this continent."
"The historical responsibility for our generation is to do for the whole of Europe as the generation Adenauer, Beyen, Monnet and Spaak did for France and Germany: to build one communal house, a joint framework within which power is subordinate to the law."
"Ten central and eastern European countries, as well as Cyprus, have applied for membership."
"All will be able to join once they have fulfilled the conditions."
"When this happens is largely in their own hands."
"My group agrees with the Commission's view that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia are the best prepared at this moment in time."
"As far as the current fifteen Member States are concerned, enlargement is in the national interest of all of them."
"That is why they should not put up any financial barricades."
"Net receivers and net contributors ought to remember that security is more important than subsidies."
"This is particularly the case in areas such as asylum policy and combatting crime."
"The Member States will be prepared to introduce these reforms under external pressure."
"This pressure will come about once our citizens discover that with each new Member State the Union not only imports decision-making problems, but also extra crime."
"The sooner the Union is widened, the sooner it will be deepened."
"Enlargement to the former communist countries will fundamentally alter the Union's character."
"From a primarily economic organization, the Union will develop into a geopolitical factor of growing significance."
"This is obvious from the Union's attitude towards the Baltic region."
"When, in a few years time, Estonia indeed becomes a member of the Union, the EU will have taken a step which NATO was not prepared to take."
"But the Union is not ready for its new responsibilities."
"It will only be able to fulfil its role as a cornerstone of stability and security effectively if it intensifies its relations with three important countries: Turkey, Russia and America."
"The Union is not a religious organisation."
"Turkey's membership application must therefore be judged by the same criteria as apply to other countries."
"But if Turkey ever wants to join the Union it must behave as a European country."
"As long as there is no freedom of speech in Turkey, and as long as torture, even of children, occurs everywhere on a daily basis, starting negotiations with Turkey is out of the question."
"Yet it is a country that is important to Europe."
"It is a parliamentary democracy, it is member of NATO, it is a regional power."
"That is why it is important that Turkey is included in the European Conference."
"Greece's resistance to this idea is shortsighted and misplaced."
"As far as Russia is concerned, the Union lacks a framework for relations which reflects the enormous significance of European-Russian relations."
"NATO has brought about a permanent joint council with Russia."
"The Union ought to consider strengthening its political relations as well."
"An annual summit at presidential level would enable the Union to deepen its relationship with Moscow."
"That leads me finally to relations with the United States."
"Whilst transatlantically our economic relations remain good, it seems as if we are drifting apart politically."
"That is dangerous."
"Investing in stronger political relations between the Union and the United States is urgently desirable, particularly in view of the political management of enlargement of both the Union and NATO."
"Nobody has forgotten Mrs Tansu Ciller's threat that Ankara can obstruct enlargement of NATO in the event that there is insufficient progress in Turkey's membership negotiations with the Union."
"Nor has anybody forgotten Greece's Prime Minister Simitis' threat to block enlargement of the Union if Cyprus does not join soon."
"NATO enlargement and the enlargement of the Union are independent processes, but they are two sides of the same coin."
"Both require careful and constant consultations between the European Union and the United States."
"Mr President, we are entering a phase in which the Union will change character fundamentally."
"History gives us few such opportunities. Let us seize them."
"Mr President, so much has been said and written recently about the enlargement and Agenda 2000 that there is a real risk that the analyses and proposals made by the representatives of the people of Europe will not be noticed, or at least will seem less important in the eyes of the public and even the Community institutions."
"Therefore, I will try to express the views of the European United Left concisely and simply."
"We arrived at these views on the basis of the reports being presented today."
"In the case of the Colom i Naval report on financial perspectives, our group feels able to give its support."
"Our messages are as follows: Yes to enlargement, which is the appropriate response to the challenge of building Europe at this decisive moment in its history."
"However, enlargement cannot be tackled without attending to its institutional, economic and financial consequences."
"Enlargement should not be at the cost of renouncing the objective of economic and social cohesion among the current Member States, accompanied by an alarming reduction in the structural funds and the cohesion fund, with reform going way beyond the stated aims of concentration and effectiveness."
"We need an Intergovernmental Conference to tackle the institutional review which did not happen at Amsterdam."
"This needs saying clearly, and the date needs to be specified: as early as possible - the year 2000, to be precise - without waiting until the Union has been enlarged to 20 Member States."
"Accession negotiations should be initiated with all those countries which satisfy the political criteria."
"Given that none of them satisfies the economic criteria, initial discrimination could have serious effects on the countries concerned."
"We are very critical of the proposal to freeze the Community budget, with 1.27 % of GNP as the own resources ceiling."
"That would certainly mean paying for enlargement out of the current structural funds."
"We think Agenda 2000 makes very specific proposals in some sectors of the common agricultural policy, apart from the effects of enlargement -because the enlargement will have effects on the common agricultural policy."
"That is the case, in Agenda 2000, with the three bovine meat sectors, milk quotas and cereals, not to mention Mediterranean products."
"Agenda 2000 eagerly envisages a second reform of the common agricultural policy, following the 1992 reform, which should be judged not just by improvements in agricultural income, but also by the loss of more than a fifth of the sector's jobs."
"A misplaced focus on enlargement, added to the social consequences of the so-called Stability Pact, and the conditions for nominal convergence, could become a serious obstacle to job creation, both in the Member States and in the candidate countries."
"That would go against the proposals recently decided upon in Luxembourg."
"Finally, faced with an enlargement to cover the whole of Europe, we need to strengthen our political unity in view of the risk that the European Union might become just a huge free trade area."
"The Europe of the twenty-first century cannot be simply a market, it must be an integrated area of democracy and solidarity."
"Mr President, it was yearning for democracy that brought down the Berlin Wall."
"The impetus for this democracy movement came from Prague and Gdansk."
"Now we have a unique opportunity to create an entire Europe of peace, of democracy and freedom."
"The Commission's plan is however not exactly an invitation, but rather an obstacle for those who in previous decades, at the cost of great personal privation, supported the idea of a democratic Europe in the east."
"The basic decision of Copenhagen to accept the central and eastern European states was the logical political consequence stemming from the historical situation."
"Agenda 2000 lags far behind that."
"It contains no convincing strategy for enlargement."
"On the one hand high ranking politicians from the Member States bask in praise in eastern capitals for their statements about future prospects."
"On the other hand they could not agree in Amsterdam on reforms which would make the EU democratic and capable of enlargement."
"Germane institutional questions were deferred."
"As a consequence the European enlargement process now faces disaster, since the preparatory work for the acceptance of new applicants has begun but there is as yet neither a substantial strategy nor a timetable."
"Now we are trying, by means of petty reforms, to cheat on the timetable."
"Therefore the Commission's proposal to begin negotiations only with five plus one corresponds to the readiness in the Council to provide in future the 20 Commissioners equivalent to one per EU Member State."
"In Agenda 2000 there are no concrete proposals or ideas to solve the problems associated with a possible second wave of applicants."
"The impression is thus created that the five plus one enlargement merely opens the door to the EU a crack and it will then close again for a long time."
"With this separation of the applicants from central and eastern Europe into welcome rich countries and the poor backyard, the Commission is already causing a political mess."
"The rejected not only have the disadvantages due to the drawing of international borders in Europe, but they are also held responsible by their people for the whole wretched state of affairs."
"Their efforts to make progress with democratic reforms and economic stabilization in their countries receive no international recognition."
"The negative effect on the readiness of foreign capitalists to invest is preprogrammed."
"Great hopes are vested in this parliament."
"It is possible for us to send out a signal that we do not want any drawing of borders in this continent."
"For a long time a clear majority in the Foreign Policy Committee has spoken out in favour of supporting the democratic forces in central and eastern European countries and not giving them the boot."
"But why, dear Social Democrats, are you toppling over like ninepins?"
"Is it a sound argument that merely to accept Estonia will have massive effects on the free trade and free movement area between the Baltic states, now of all times?"
"Dear Christian Democrats, why are you so laboriously withdrawing from a position which has been achieved, like the one in point 3 of the Oostlander Report?"
"We in the Green Party are in favour of the common start of negotiations with all applicants who have created the necessary democratic conditions and who recognize human rights and the rights of minorities."
"Of course it is sensible to have a differentiated form of entry and negotiation process."
"We give top priority to the cooperative character and the multilateral dimension of the entry process and therefore demand a substantial strengthening of the European Conference."
"We support the proposal of the French Government which seeks to extend cooperation to further areas such as institutional reform, economic cooperation and cross border projects."
"The European conference also offers the chance of political dialogue with Turkey and Slovakia and will not let it be interrupted."
"Civilian methods of conflict regulation in this country have of course not yet been developed by the European Union."
"In Agenda 2000 scant regard is paid to the progress made by the central and eastern European countries towards meeting the environmental and social standards of the EU."
"We regard that as a central, important matter."
"In addition we need comprehensive and targeted support of a financial, legal and technical nature. In terms of the political challenge which enlargement on our European continent represents, the Commission must be corrected and needs more courage to be honest."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Commissioner, only a few days away from the European Council of Luxembourg, this is an occasion to state Parliament's position on what will be the great issue in years to come, the enlargement of the Union eastward."
"Without repeating all the points, I will insist only on those which to me seem essential."
"First, as you have said, Mr President-in-Office, this enlargement is an opportunity for Europe and for ourselves."
"An opportunity because it is an occasion to reunite what the tragedies of recent history had torn apart."
"An opportunity, too, because it is the occasion to open up a market of 500 million inhabitants, to stabilize our continent and to increase its strength in the world."
"This being so, and even if this may seem very optimistic and even paradoxical, the enlargement of the European Union could favour the emergence of a true common foreign and defence policy and a true European identity."
"Because the CEECs are well placed to appreciate how useful a guarantee a strong political union is for their future and their security."
"I stress this opportunity for, as time goes on, enlargement is too often being perceived and presented as a sort of inevitable threat, fraught with danger."
"But for this beginning to be a success, it still needs to be achieved under good conditions, by surmounting the incontestable difficulties of the exercise."
"First, may I remind you of the importance we attach to institutional reform of the Union."
"I will not press the issue: our convictions on this matter are well known."
"Amongst the difficulties to be overcome there is also the temptation to distinguish the good candidates, those better able a priori to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria."
"The Commission succumbed to this temptation, which seemed to have the advantage of lightening its task and reducing the costs of negotiations, and of enlargement in general."
"Happily, and I congratulate the rapporteurs on this, Parliament is moving towards a text which sets the same starting line for all the applicant countries and I sincerely hope that the European Council, under the beneficial impetus of the Luxembourg presidency, will have the wisdom always to choose what unites rather than what uselessly divides, for what separates the good candidates from the bad is not so important as the risk of splitting them into two distinct groups."
"In fact, the way they are presented is not a neutral act."
"It has a psychological and political impact, even if it is not discriminatory, Mr Commissioner."
"Furthermore it is in this spirit that I would like to see Slovakia dealt with."
"Certainly, today, the political climate which dominates this country is not favourable to a strict respect for democracy and human rights, but changes are entirely possible and we must be ready to encourage Slovakia to rejoin her Czech twin sister and all the other central European countries."
"The question of Turkey is a more difficult one."
"In our group we are largely in favour of the text proposed by the rapporteurs in point 28 of their proposal for a resolution."
"It is a cautious text, which deals with the future and leaves the European Conference, the Commission and the European Council the margin for manoeuvre that they will need in order to map out our future relations with that country."
"Clearly, Turkey does not respect our standards in the area of human rights and nothing final can be decided without progress in this extremely sensitive area."
"But in the interim, and whilst encouraging Turkey on the path to democratic reforms, we must together reflect on our common future, avoiding situations which prevent progress, putting to one side prejudices and assumptions and above all showing some imagination."
"After all, our future relationship, which will be as important for Turkey as for the Union, could take a variety of different forms, with a minimum of good faith and audacity."
"We must be able to do something other than curse or remain transfixed in immobility."
"I would like to highlight another point."
"It relates to the financing as it is proposed in Agenda 2000."
"Just like the rapporteur, Mr Colom i Naval, I have some real concerns in the face of the Commission's proposals, which furthermore concur with the finance ministries of the Member States."
"To do more with the same money is always an attractive proposal, but it is hardly realistic."
"The applicant countries are clearly trailing economically, and even if on their part they make remarkable efforts, the ECU 76 billion over eight years forecast for 110 million inhabitants will not be sufficient."
"The European Union will have to support them to a far greater extent."
"From now on, should we reduce the aid which our regions and sectors in difficulty benefit from?"
"Should we revise the common agricultural policy downwards?"
"Certainly, the list of beneficiaries needs to be revised, along with the criteria and rules for allocation of resources."
"But the situation in some of our regions and some of our social strata is not buoyant enough for an overall reduction in the aid budgets to our Member States."
"If this was done, we would risk introducing the ferment of division within the Union and of favouring an unhealthy competition."
"In addition we risk making enlargement to the eastern and central European countries intolerable, if public opinion feels that the latter are taking away from us what is rightfully ours."
"On these financial questions, as on the procedure for enlargement itself, the approach must be political, in the widest sense of the term."
"Of course, technical factors, facts, figures, must be known and taken into account."
"The Commission's executive, by proposing Agenda 2000 has, from this point of view, done a good job, which clearly has to be completed and clarified."
"I am, however, happy to see that Parliament has not been satisfied with this technical approach."
"Thanks to the clarity of the rapporteurs, it has embarked on a more political approach and I hope that when the time comes to vote, tomorrow morning, the House will not backtrack from this sensible line."
"I also hope that the European Council of Luxembourg will confirm this political approach.That is its duty and I hope that, this being so, it will respond positively to the remarkable efforts of the President-in-Office of the Council, whom I congratulate."
"Mr President, a bad text based on bad proposals: that is what the ambiguous, confusing and contradictory report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on Agenda 2000 appears to be."
"It is certainly difficult to draw up a good report on an unsatisfactory basis."
"Let us not forget, indeed, that the Agenda 2000 proposals are covering up a huge political failure."
"The fact that we have had to wait for almost ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall in order to initiate negotiations which recognize as fully European the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, all those who have been lumped together under the dreadful acronym CEECs and who have written the pages of European history as much as we have, and participated in the development of its civilization to the same extent as we have. This says a lot about the unsuitability of the concepts which the Commission uses in an intangible way to the new European reality."
"By persistently opposing enlargement and consolidation, two archaic concepts born during the Cold War, the Commission has delayed as much as possible the advent of enlargement."
"It has considered it as a threat, a threat to its ideology and to its bureaucracy instead of seeing it as an opportunity, an opportunity to modify radically the way in which Europe is made up so that each one can find in it their place."
"We all have the feeling that we have missed a great historic rendez-vous and that the two lungs of Europe have not been reunited as they should have been, through our inability to reform Europe in time."
"It would have been sufficient to opt for an infinitely variable Europe, so that from the moment of their liberation from communism, the countries of east and central Europe could immediately participate in circles of cooperation, thus recognizing them fully as Europeans."
"Does Agenda 2000, at least, finally open up this debate?"
"Does it lay out the different possible options enabling a great Europe to be built in the best interests of each of its members and of all?"
"No."
"The Commission continues its course unperturbed, as if nothing had happened, and as if there were only one direction possible, forever building a federal Europe."
"The debate will therefore be initiated elsewhere."
"It could have been initiated within this Parliament."
"This was not the case, since instead of correcting the dogmatism of the Commission, the report presented to us endorses it."
"It wants to impose federalism on us all."
"It says so quite explicitly."
"It does not question the arbitrary pre-selection that the Commission is carrying out between first class and second class European, and orders an unfounded ostracism of Slovakia."
"It omits to note that the euro, if it is brought in, will be a new and powerful factor of division between the Member States of the wider Europe."
"It endorses the participation of Turkey in the European Conference, which takes any real significance out of it."
"Our relations with that great country merit an approach other than this headlong rush into double-speak, unworthy of us all."
"The report nowhere protests at the distortion of the CAP surreptitiously carried out in favour of enlargement."
"The report raises no objections to Agenda 2000's neglect of Lomé and the ACP countries."
"So it is in the national parliaments that the real debate will be initiated."
"It is already beginning, since we heard only yesterday, in the French National Assembly, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs wondering out loud wether Europe still responds to the hopes previously vested in it?"
"Does its construction strengthen or weaken us? Good questions, to which the European Parliament's report unfortunately does not give any answers."
"That is why we cannot vote in its favour, for we will not build a great Europe with old recipes of federalism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if today's debate is not the most important of this legislature, it certainly deals with one of the most significant issues, not only in this legislature but in the recent history of the European Union."
"The coming enlargement is the direct and logical consequence of that revolutionary act which was the foundation of the construction of Europe - I refer to the Schuman Plan - revolutionary because it has weakened the nationalist culture which had been laid down over the centuries, east and west of the Rhine, giving rise to wars and tragedies with monotonous regularity."
"That act underlies fifty years of peace and prosperity for the west and is also the indirect origin of the liberation of eastern Europe from the communist regimes."
"The Europe which is being extended towards the east - a great man once spoke of a Europe extending to the Urals - can surely be an essential factor for equilibrium and progress on our planet."
"But the enlargement must take place with all the guarantees that are needed to meet such a challenge; and I am extremely worried by the fact that not all of these guarantees seem to be there."
"The resolution on the Commission's communication ""Agenda 2000 - for a stronger and wider Union' seems to me to be primarily about a wider Union; I have my doubts about a stronger Union."
"There is one point which does not appear in the recitals to the resolution, a phenomenon which is spreading through our countries: the return of the issue of national structures."
"How can we claim to have a strong Union if its foundations are constantly being weakened by the advance of the separatist leprosy? Also, this frequently generates terrorist violence and can only be explained by the actions of a few individuals who are myopic enough to prefer narrow interests to great ideals."
"So in Spain, Belgium, Italy and elsewhere, we witness tensions which may originally have been justified and legitimate, but degenerate into dangerous attacks on national unity and democratic institutions."
"I am worried about this and would therefore have liked to see, amongst the many recitals in the report, at least a hint, a recommendation, a spur to greater internal cohesion in the Union."
"Still in the context of the necessary strengthening of the Union through the consolidation of the Member States - because, I repeat, only a Union that is strong in every sector can sustain the shock which an enlargement of this size will inevitably produce - it is necessary to stress the management of the other two weaknesses which, together with terrorism, currently constitute the flaw in the Union: unemployment and crime - a dread combination - the one a function of the other, to which the antidotes have not yet been found."
"The issue at the Luxembourg European Council was not employment but unemployment."
"I cannot disguise my concern about solving this dramatic problem, and I also feel a responsibility towards the unemployed people who voted for me and for others."
"This is no time for professional demagogues to wave magic wands, inventing formulae which too often resemble slogans to be trotted out at political meetings - repatriating the immigrants or having a thirty-five hour week - but nor is the time for endless debates about the sex of the angels, which reverberate from part-session to Council, from Council to part-session and so on."
"The situation is moving fast."
"The European Union is facing increasingly fierce competition from countries with low labour costs where, amongst other things, many companies, including European ones, are relocating their centres of production, thus creating a real vicious circle."
"The enlargement must take place, but beyond the institutional reforms it is necessary to rediscover economic growth - and perhaps the single currency may not be a good trampoline - because otherwise we risk seriously disturbing the economic equilibria achieved with difficulty by candidate countries like Poland, which is today achieving success with its own development gamble to create thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"But will these small and medium-sized enterprises succeed in surviving tomorrow's enlargement?"
"Will small and medium-sized European enterprises succeed in withstanding the impact of competition from products using cheaper labour?"
"Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that I appreciate the emphasis the rapporteur places on Turkey and hence Cyprus."
"Resolving the Cyprus problem in an equitable way means pacifying Turkey and guaranteeing it against the temptation of religious fundamentalism which, if it should prevail in that country, would mean exponential growth in the tragedy currently being experienced by Algeria."
"Mr President, I will be speaking first as co-rapporteur for Bulgaria."
"Everyone who has followed the developments in Bulgaria knows that its government and population are extremely motivated about joining the Union."
"The Bulgarian Parliament has declared itself unanimously in favour of this."
"Enormous efforts have been made in the transition to a market economy."
"The budget deficit was pushed back spectacularly."
"During the first months of this year inflation was 300 % a month and has now been pushed back to 0.5 %."
"All are clear signs of an immense amount of hard work in order to not miss out on accession."
"It is evident that decisive measures will also have to be taken in the fields of environment, transport, agriculture and energy."
"A thorough reform of the administration will require a great deal of energy."
"Yet the Committee for Foreign Affairs was of the opinion that the most important political criteria had been met, and that opening negotiations will give a new impulse to the reforms in Bulgaria, and that, in addition, the Bulgarian population will start to feel a sense of belonging. What is more, the presence of the Union will be strengthened in a region which from a political point of view is very unstable."
"On behalf of the Green Group I can confirm what Mr Swoboda said, namely that the toughest point of political dispute in Parliament had been the question: do we want to start the negotiations with five plus one, as suggested by the Commission, or do we want this start to include all?"
"I have to say that I am little surprised at the categorical statements by Commissioner van den Broek, as what he is saying today is exactly the same as what he said in July."
"It is as if there had been no clear political signals questioning these issues, naturally above all from the countries which will end up in category B. I fully understand and even respect people who display great tenacity, but on the other hand, closed-minded stubbornness can be counterproductive politically."
"It is clear that the countries ending up in category B have the feeling that they were excluded, and clearly see this as a loss of face toward their own population."
"It should not be forgotten that many of them have had the door shut in their faces twice, as they were not allowed to join NATO either."
"They also foresaw a deterrent effect on foreign investors."
"That is why we as a Green Group prefer a flexible system with a joint start for all, but obviously individual arrivals related to the progress actually made."
"The Bulgarian Government, for instance, has said publicly in its own country that they know very well that it will take at least eight years before it will be able to qualify for membership."
"I therefore think that we must, in particular, keep our ear to ground with respect to those who were in category B."
"Secondly, I would like say that the entire process will only really have a chance of success if we manage to carry out serious agricultural reform within the Union."
"I must express great concern about the way the Commission's proposals, which were partly aimed in the right direction, were received at the Council of Ministers of Agriculture."
"There were very distinct signs of obstructions, and if we do not succeed in implementing agricultural reform in the right sense, this will have disastrous consequences for the already extremely shaky agricultural structure in the eastern European countries, which is very important in terms of employment - an average 20 % of the population still works in agriculture - and therefore accessibility for the population."
"Our big question is whether this Parliament in its majority statement should continue to choose the option preferred by the Commission on 19 November, and that there should be a clear signal from this Parliament, with a view to the Luxembourg summit, so that a courageous agricultural reform which truly meets the needs of eastern European countries could really take shape."
"Mr President, the three Baltic Republics share certain common characteristics."
"All three were occupied by the Soviet Union for more than 50 years, interrupted only by German occupation during the Second World War."
"All three have sizeable Russian-speaking minorities, especially Latvia and Estonia."
"All three are small countries."
"And all three have made tremendous advances since national liberation in 1991."
"I do not wish to be a Cassandra but I still consider they have a very long way to go."
"I hope they will make it by the time the Union has made the necessary institutional reforms."
"As rapporteur on Estonia and supporting the Commission's view on that country, I am afraid that taking only Estonia, among the Baltic states, on board is creating a new borderline between the haves and the have-nots."
"There should not be a new Yalta Agreement supported by the European Union."
"I understand the reasons for excluding Latvia and Lithuania but I do not see a big difference between the three countries in terms of development towards accession."
"I therefore respectfully support an open approach."
"We Finns had to face the challenge of the Soviet Union attacking us and wishing to destroy our country in 1939."
"Having today's Russia as a neighbour should not be considered a threat."
"It gives us a chance to participate in a development that will lead, hopefully, to a still larger family of European nations, including Russia."
"In terms of security, joining the Union was for us a way of underlining where we belong in a community of independent democratic nations."
"I know that the Baltic Republics share the same aspirations."
"Personally I see the minority questions in a far more optimistic light than some people, especially in Estonia."
"In many part of Europe we have seen the destructive effects of so-called ethno-nationalism."
"Building stable institutions and the rule of law must one day lead to a multicultural, multilingual society where nobody will be excluded."
"Whatever is being decided here, it is my conviction that we are starting an irreversible process which will change the face of the whole of Europe."
"Mr President, as rapporteur on Hungary I was very pleased to discover that throughout the discussions of recent months Hungary was always cited as an example."
"I believe that is only too justified."
"I happen to know this country really well and am also probably the only Member who speaks Hungarian, whose mother-tongue is Hungarian."
"I therefore communicate more easily with the people than anyone else here."
"There are objective reasons why Hungary is today in a favourable position vis-à-vis Europe."
"First there is the fact that this country has always been European in outlook, ever since its establishment 1, 100 years ago."
"That has never been shaken, it has always been European in outlook."
"The best proof in our time is Hungary's freedom-struggle in 1956, which, if the cold war is regarded as the Third World War, might really be described as the Stalingrad of the Third World War, for since that Battle of Budapest, relations with the Soviet Union have gone steadily downhill."
"All that was due to a great national unity which existed in Hungary and which is a characteristic of this nation."
"I would like to refer to a fact which I only came across when I was researching for the drawing up of this report: as early as 1982 - and at that time there was absolute one-party government in the country - the government had already issued orders to the various sectors of the administration to frame all laws and regulations so that Hungary might one day join the European Union."
"If therefore the Commission states in its report how positive it is that in Hungary the ""acquis communautaire' , particularly on the legal level, will not meet the same difficulties as elsewhere, then this is due to the initiative of these people who were all official members of the Communist Party but who, in decisive questions, acted as patriots and not as communists."
"These are contributions to Europe which somehow remind me of what Spain brought to Europe."
"I have been in this Parliament since 1979 and at that time I had the honour of being a member of the joint committee with Spain."
"At that time, one of the most encouraging things was seeing how Spaniards across the political spectrum were united on the question of Europe, and therefore they have handled the transition better than any other country."
"From the outset democracy in Hungary was taken for granted, and it was fortunate for Hungary that following liberation the free elections brought to power first a conservative government and then a left-wing government which, however, represented uniform views and worked together on the basic issues facing the country."
"We also have the great advantage in Hungary that there is not a single representative of the extremist parties in the Hungarian Parliament."
"None of them were elected."
"During the last referendum both fascists and communists joined forces to oppose NATO membership for Hungary, but the Hungarian people voted by a crushing majority of over 80 % in favour of NATO and that result is still significant."
"These are things which show that Hungary has really belonged to Europe from the start and therefore has a right to be accepted as soon as possible, quite apart from the fact that the Hungarian economy has a thoroughly western style and has made great progress."
"Thank you!"
"Mr President, as rapporteur for Latvia, I would first like to underline what Mr Donner has already said about Estonia."
"Latvia is one of the three Baltic countries which were part of the Soviet Union only six years ago; it is a country which has made extraordinary progress given the tragic legacy of the Soviet system, a country which has made huge steps towards a very efficient market economy, with privatizations which should be concluded in June 1998, an inflation rate which will be 9 % by the end of 1997 and set to reach 7 % in 1998, and a budget which is very likely to be in balance in 1998."
"I do not know how many countries in western Europe will be able to boast a balanced budget."
"Well, Latvia is doing all that."
"Certainly there are problems: there is an administrative system and a legislative system to be reformed, also the legacy of a Soviet system which had in fact devastated any possibility of protecting the state of law."
"But it is clear that the progress achieved by Latvia up to now cannot be regarded as second rate and therefore, Mr President, we cannot raise new barriers where barriers have never existed."
"Let me state clearly that it would be a resounding blunder to start negotiations with series A countries and series B countries at different times, especially for the Baltic countries."
"We should remember that we have to put Yalta behind us, and likewise Munich agreements and Ribbentrop-Molotov pacts!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am the rapporteur for Lithuania."
"I can honestly say that it has given me pleasure, because I have noticed the great effort being made in Lithuania and I could write a whole catalogue of things that have been achieved with political reforms, with the market economy and the removal of restrictions with regard to foreign currency, prices, the movement of goods and so on. And I might point out that Lithuania does not have problems with minorities in the same way as Estonia and Latvia."
"But the crucial thing for me is to point out that the idea is to get this Europe repaired and bind it together again."
"A characteristic of this part of the world is that for centuries at regular intervals we have bashed each other over the head, and time and time again Europe has been dismembered."
"In fact you have to marvel that this part of the world has survived at all."
"But now at the end of this century the important thing is to organize relationships in this part of the world and to repair the damage that was done in the first half of the century."
"The task therefore is to screw Europe together again in the political workshop after the Stalin-Hitler pact - also known as the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact - and the division of Europe into spheres of interest."
"The task is to repair post-Yalta Europe and its subsequent division by the Iron Curtain in 1945."
"There were three independent countries which suffered heavily under this division of Europe, and they are the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania."
"For me it is natural to think of these three countries together, since these three countries were erased as independent nations and were under the Soviet Union for 50 years."
"We Danes have a special interest in this question and a special relationship with the Baltic states. They are our neighbours on the shared Baltic Sea."
"Of course we would also think of them as separate countries, but I am pleased that the attitude of this Parliament appears to be in the direction of a practical joint start for all the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe and therefore also the three Baltic states."
"That is what I want too."
"I have visited Lithuania and Latvia several times and meeting the people in these countries, not just government representatives, has made a strong impression on me."
"I have noticed that they are working hard to qualify as full members of the EU."
"There is still a lot to do, not least in the area of administration, and also in the securing of borders, which will become the external borders of the EU."
"There is a need for support, a lot of support, but there is also a need to control the financial investments in order to counter crime, mafia activity and fraud."
"Honourable Members, for me it is important to stress that these are independent countries, not just accession areas, but countries with their own identity and history and their own languages. They are countries which have reclaimed their freedom and rediscovered themselves."
"That is something which people should respect, which people should recognize and acknowledge, including the EU, and which should characterize the current forthcoming dialogue with these countries."
"Mr President, it looks as if we might reach a good compromise on the question of how the European Union should be enlarged."
"I was from the start of the opinion that in the new phase of the development of the European Union all applicant countries which would meet the political and economic criteria, must be invoked. There must be no ""ins' and no ""outs' , as has already been said, in a process which concerns the formation of Europe."
"Of course the most intensive enlargement negotiations will be with the countries which have achieved the greatest progress."
"These include Poland, the country for which I presented the report."
"This is especially pleasing because there is in this a portion of historical justice."
"The political signal for the democratic movement in central Europe stemmed from the Solidarity Movement of the 1980s."
"Now, as we begin the transition into the 21st Century we have the great chance of moulding the European Union in such a way that we, and the generations which come after us, will in future live in peace and democracy, in prosperity and stability."
"We must make use of this opportunity. We must not miss it."
"Poland will have a very important role to play in this and therefore it is good that the new Polish government regards itself as part of the tradition of peaceful revolution of 1989 and seeks to align the future of Poland in the European Union."
"Poland's Foreign Minister Geremek stated last week in the Committee for Foreign Affairs that its policy will be directed towards developing good neighbourly relationships with Germany, with the Russian Federation, with the Baltic states and with the Ukraine."
"I would like to encourage the Polish Government and also the Polish Parliament to continue with this harmonizing policy."
"Foreign Minister Geremek also said last week that the timing of the entry of Poland itself into the European Union depends on its reforms and its efforts to modernize."
"Poland is a very large country, in its history, its culture, its spiritual and intellectual bases."
"It will return to Europe and in future share in the building of our common future, and it will make up for what 40 years of Communism withheld from it."
"Poland is also a big country in terms of its geography, of its population figures and of its economic potential."
"Poland is also a country with the typical structural problems of an as yet unmastered modernization."
"Poland must and will modernize."
"A process of transformation and structural change is required, particularly in agriculture, in the coal and steel industry and in the removal of environmental destruction."
"My report describes the problems and the Commission's analysis in Agenda 2000 is very clear in these matters."
"After its entry, Poland will represent an important external border of the European Union."
"But it must not be an invitation to international migration and criminal movement."
"Therefore it is important that as soon as possible - and Foreign Minister Geremek underlined this himself - the Union and the applicant countries work closely together in the sphere of justice and home affairs and start, even today, to develop joint initiatives to solve problems in the fight against international crime."
"The planned European Conference is an important forum for this."
"So I appeal for the conference not to be simply the scene of an exchange of views, but a committee which gives concrete impetus to joint actions in the realm of the second and third pillars."
"Keeping entry to the EU as a goal firmly in view, there is a clear indication of the pace of the modernization process."
"The yardstick is the ""acquis communautaire' ."
"The EU will help Poland with all its resources and facilities, as well as it can."
"The entry of Poland into the European Union should take place as quickly as possible and as well as necessary."
"Mr President, I would like to stress that the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left fully supports the enlargement of the European Union to include the countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus."
"This enlargement should be a process which will allow us to create political, economic and social benefits for the citizens of the Member States and the candidate countries."
"There would be no sense in turning this into a source of unnecessary problems, and causing sections of European public opinion to turn against the idea."
"For this reason, we do not go along with some of the basic proposals which the Commission has included in Agenda 2000. We think that if they were implemented, they would end up slowing down the process of enlargement and creating unacceptable malfunctions."
"Firstly, we think that negotiations should be initiated simultaneously with all the countries of central and eastern Europe which, judged objectively, are ready to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria in the future, rather than with just a sub-set of them. Obviously, the criterion which demands a system of democracy must be met."
"We are therefore in favour of the so-called regatta method: that each country's accession should depend on its own ability to become a member of the European Union, at the appropriate time."
"Therefore, we are opposed to any delay or conditions imposed on the start of negotiations with Cyprus, which should begin at the same time as with the other countries and involve the legitimate Government in Nicosia. If there is a European Conference, it should be for the purpose of discussions about the second and third pillars, and Turkey should not be involved."
"Turkey is a very different case from the countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus. It is not a full democracy, and its government has allowed itself to make totally unacceptable threats in relation to the initiation of discussions with Cyprus."
"To tackle enlargement properly will require a substantial increase in the own resources ceiling proposed by the Commission which, at the level of 1.27 %, is clearly inadequate."
"The cost of enlargement should be borne by all the Member States together, in a spirit of solidarity, making sure that the least-developed do not end up paying for it indirectly."
"Therefore, we are opposed to any questioning of or reduction in the structural funds and cohesion policies. These aspects have to be considered as additional to enlargement."
"Nor do we accept in any way that enlargement should be used as an excuse for an inadequate reform of the common agricultural policy."
"We believe that the accession of new members to the European Union should strengthen rather than undermine the European social model, which should aim for job creation and improvements in working conditions and living standards."
"The Union should not lend its support to ultra-liberal policies, the harmful results of which everybody is aware of."
"In this respect, questions such as strengthening essential public services, promoting equality between men and women, and protecting the environment should be given priority status."
"By the same reasoning, we do not think the Union's enlargement process should be artificially speeded up, since this might result in economic shocks with harsh social consequences for the new Member States."
"In the area of the common foreign and security policy, enlargement ought to imply an increase in the European Union's own capacity for external action, but we note that unfortunately other organizations, such as NATO, seem to have taken sole charge of the security aspirations of some of the candidate countries."
"As far as institutional matters are concerned, we ask that the necessary reforms (which were not adopted at Amsterdam) should be carried out before enlargement takes place."
"We continue to call for consolidation as well as enlargement."
"In conclusion, we are in favour of enlargement, but we cannot help being highly critical of the content of the Commission's proposals."
"In our view, that is the message this Parliament should give out, but unfortunately this has not been sufficiently stressed in the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"Mr President, in my capacity as co-rapporteur on the Czech Republic for that report, I should like to stress that the Committee on Foreign Affairs is fully in favour of starting accession negotiations with that country, notwithstanding our demand that that country should quickly find a satisfactory political solution to current discrimination against the gypsy minority, and to the various other problems related to the administration of justice and the financial system."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the founding fathers laid the bases of the Community, they stated two fundamental conditions for being a part of it: firstly and obviously, to be situated geographically in Europe, and secondly, to have democratic institutions."
"In their eyes all else was no more than practical detail."
"On the eve of the greatest enlargement we have ever experienced, it is perhaps useful to recall this approach, which signals a certain concept of Europe, political, open, generous, long term."
"I sincerely believe that each time fundamental decisions have to be taken in Europe, it is this concept that must inspire us."
"But for all that, we cannot forget the practical details, for the success of this enlargement depends on respect of a certain number of rules, particularly economic ones."
"It is clearly this that the European Council meant by asking the Commission to examine the situation of ten applicant countries, with a view to democratic criteria, certainly, but also with regard to economic criteria such as their capacity for competition or mastery of the ""acquis communautaire' ."
"The Commission has done its job."
"It has done it well, and this is acknowledged by virtually all the Member States and applicants."
"We should particularly note two interesting proposals, that of the European Conference and that of reinforced partnership."
"Nevertheless, the study of the different countries, particularly from the point of view of economic criteria, led the Commission to make proposals which have given the impression that it was setting itself up in judgement by distinguishing two categories of countries amongst the applicants."
"It did not require much perception to anticipate that the second category would see this as a division."
"It is the reason why, based on the Commission's objective analysis, I repeat again that Parliament, playing fully its role, wishes to move on from this analysis by introducing a more political and more cultural judgement into the issue of enlargement, along with a longer term outlook."
"The countries in the second group know very well that the road to accession will be a long one for them."
"But they need to be indisputably told once more that they are a part of the European family."
"They need a sign of encouragement and a message of hope, and they need them now."
"By way of example, I would like to take the case of Romania."
"Only a few days after its application for membership of NATO was turned down, Romania found out that she was not amongst the countries with which the Commission considered the European Union could open accession negotiations. For this country of 23 million inhabitants, European by culture, by history, geography and now by democracy, it was a harsh blow."
"Of all of the former satellites of the USSR, Romania is certainly the one which had to endure the harshest dictatorship."
"Its international trade has had to be reoriented extremely quickly, and it has had to cope with the difficult consequences of the embargo on Yugoslavia."
"On a geostrategic level, Romania plays an important role in the stability of the region, particularly in the numerous accords it has entered into recently with several of its neighbours."
"Furthermore, a very large consensus exists amongst the Romanian people in favour of accession, and the efforts to reform and transform Romanian society achieved by the current government are worthy of being mentioned, as are also the truly remarkable sacrifices which the Romanian people accept with stoicism in order to introduce the necessary factors of change and modernization into their society."
"This people and its leaders would not understand if the European Union did not give them a firm helping hand."
"The concept we have of Europe, that of a generous and united continent, demands that Romania, too, should be invited to negotiate her entry as from next year."
"Furthermore, the speed of negotiations will depend on the capacity of Romanian society to cope with the reforms."
"Nobody knows the date they will join, but we must not today give the impression that the door to accession is closed."
"We must offer Romania an outlook worthy of the idea that it is becoming one of us."
"Mr President, I think one point should be a very clear in this debate: this new phase of enlargement of the European Union is of unprecedented historic and political importance."
"We cannot diminish that significance or set limits on it. What gives the enlargement that significance is not just quantity, the number of countries applying for membership, but the process of democratic stabilization and cohesion it involves."
"For these reasons, we, as the European Parliament, have a great political responsibility."
"There are two main issues we have to confront: first, accompanying the enlargement with consolidation and reform of the European institutions and, secondly, ensuring that the process of enlargement gets off to a good start, without excluding any countries which meet the basic requirements, without causing disappointment and division."
"So it is fundamental that negotiations should start with all those countries which respect the political and democratic criteria."
"I hope and believe that the European Parliament will express itself clearly to that effect and will send a clear message to the Council along those lines."
"As regards Slovenia, I just want to make some fundamental points."
"The country is starting from a good basis for negotiations with a view to membership."
"The political and democratic situation is solid and the economy is dynamic."
"Of the applicant countries, it is the one with the highest average per capita GDP and where the rate of employment in agriculture is similar to that of the existing fifteen Member States of the European Union. It has a positive budget position and is doing its utmost to bring the other macro-economic criteria under control."
"Naturally, there are many problems in this country too, which are being confronted with seriousness and continuity to achieve the objective of an open and competitive economy, to modify the internal structures, to transpose Community legislation, and to intensify training and information."
"But what I want to emphasize and what I have directly observed in drafting the report on this country is the commitment and awareness of the leaders of Slovenia, the determination of the government and the parliament to pursue these objectives, as is also demonstrated by the preparation - I think it is the only country to have done this - of a strategic document which was presented this week, an important and binding document, setting out deadlines, stages and methods."
"I think it sets a good example for others."
"Naturally all this must proceed consistently, without uncertainty or ambiguity, but the political fact of the commitment of the institutions and leaders should be emphasized."
"Slovenia can play an important political role for the European Union, filling a territorial gap, integrating that part of Europe politically, establishing new relations with neighbouring states, and providing positive stimulus for other entities created from the dissolution of former Yugoslavia."
"I believe that should be seen as an important factor too."
"For all these reasons, I not only believe negotiations can quickly begin, but that they can possibly enter an intensive and highly advanced stage very soon."
"Mr President, on behalf of this Parliament I have been able to deal intensively with Slovakia, one of the 11 candidate countries, over the past few months."
"I would like to say many things about the general aspects of the Union's enlargement, but I will deal with only one issue, Slovakia."
"Others have already said enough about all the other issues."
"Slovakia is important enough in itself."
"The future of a country and its population are at stake."
"In the debate on enlargement, Slovakia stands out in a distinctly negative way."
"In Agenda 2000 the Commission expresses the opinion that Slovakia, or should we say the present government of Slovakia, does not fulfil one of the most important conditions for EU Membership, namely the establishment a stable, political democracy in which human rights and minorities are respected."
"Otherwise the country would be able to meet the criteria in the medium term."
"The Commission is of the opinion that it is not possible to negotiate with Slovakia as long as these problems have not been solved."
"We have tested the Commission's opinion carefully in many discussions held with all those involved in Slovakia."
"We have had to recognize that the government is indeed trifling with the constitution, the rights of parliament and the Hungarian minority."
"The European Parliament and its delegation for Slovakia pointed this out earlier."
"We recall only recently the case of Gaulieder, the Member of Parliament who was removed from the national parliament in an unconstitutional way."
"The European Parliament did not only pronounce judgment, it also tried directly and indirectly to influence the situation in Slovakia."
"There has been a great deal of contact."
"In June this year the joint parliamentary delegation even published recommendations on what measures Slovakia should take, in particular on a number of important democratic issues."
"This joint effort, or should I say pressure, has led to some progress over the past few months."
"The President, who is virtually opposition leader in Slovakia, and the Prime Minister are communicating again, albeit haltingly; this was a big problem."
"Opposition and governing parties have promised to champion Slovakia's EU interests to a greater extent."
"This is not enough to change Parliament's judgment, however."
"That is why it is being suggested that Slovakia is excluded from the concrete negotiations as long as democracy fails to function normally."
"How Slovakia is to be involved in the wider negotiation process, is still unclear."
"This depends on the negotiation formula."
"Should the Council or this Parliament opt for simultaneous negotiations with all candidates, then we do not think Slovakia should be included at the moment."
"In the event of a half-regatta, to use another phrase, the situation would be different; if there was to be a more symbolic start to negotiations, and subsequently more concrete ones, then Slovakia would be able to join in the first phase."
"But as I said, our critique of the government in this country is the main thing."
"At the same time we do not want to shut the door on Slovakia, and its population."
"It is and will remain a European country which must not be allowed to disappear over the European horizon."
"It is Europe's youngest state."
"This can lead to extra problems."
"That is why we support the creation of an entry partnership and regard Slovakia's inclusion in the European Conference as a positive counter sign for everyone in that country."
"That way the responsibility for Slovakia's failure will be placed where it belongs: with the government."
"It is unacceptable that a government should treat the interests of a country in this way."
"We hope that the opinion of the European Parliament, but also that of European Commission, will make those responsible in Slovakia think again."
"Better to change now than to find a closed door later."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Bertens our distinguished rapporteur on Cyprus."
"He is in Canada attending the conference on landmines."
"With regard to Cyprus Mr Bertens says that we are today repeating a debate we had in this House in June 1995."
"Both Parliament and the Council have several times expressed the view that the accession negotiations with Cyprus will start six months after the IGC."
"Today we confirm this position."
"Cyprus is a special case."
"As the Commission stated in Agenda 2000, Cyprus is economically and politically ready for Union membership."
"It is evident says Mr Bertens that we cannot allow a foreign occupant to dictate the date and pace of accession negotiations."
"Therefore, the negotiations should start as planned."
"Neither the negotiations nor accession should depend on a solution of the Cyprus problem."
"The Union should contribute massively to the solution of the Cyprus problem."
"The UN efforts of Cordovez deserves all support."
"By extensive information to both communities and dialogue with and amongst them the Union can improve the atmosphere on the island."
"It should push for representation of both communities in the enlargement negotiations."
"The Union can make a difference if it acts coherently and consistently."
"Mr President, I have listened to the speakers representing the various political groups with interest, along with the oral reports on the Commission's opinion."
"I was extremely pleased to note that the European Parliament by and large shares the analysis of its rapporteurs, Mr Oostlander, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Colom i Naval."
"Your rapporteurs have said that this fifth enlargement, Mr President, is a great opportunity for Europe. It is clear that if, on the one hand, enlargement has a cost, it also creates new markets and thus new jobs, and it substantially increases the weight of Europe in the world, an important secondary effect that cannot be measured in financial terms."
"Many speakers have highlighted the global nature of the enlargement package."
"Mr Pöttering, for example, said that it was necessary to strengthen and deepen the European Union, reform its policies and its institutions and the way its institutions work, so that it may welcome eleven new Member States."
"With regard to the procedure for negotiation, Mr Swoboda spoke of an accession fever."
"He spoke of an accession fever in this Parliament, but I fear that this fever has not yet touched public opinion in our own countries."
"A great effort is needed to explain to the people of the fifteen Member States, which the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the Commission and the fifteen governments will need to support."
"In the coming days we have to find a procedure which discriminates against no-one."
"In this respect, your Parliament's motion for a resolution, which is under discussion, is a good compromise, as Mrs Hoff said."
"It says, in point 3, that all the applicants have the right to initiate negotiations at the same time, but in point 6 it clarifies that it shares the Commission's opinion which states that intensive negotiations should first begin with those countries which have achieved the most notable progress."
"There is therefore on the one hand the date of commencement of negotiations, and on the other the speed of negotiations."
"This therefore acknowledges a differentiation based on the state of preparation of applicant states."
"There must be no exclusion, but a differentiation, within the very nature of the negotiation process with the eleven applicant countries."
"Mr President, the discussions within the Council are currently moving in the same direction."
"The idea of a European Conference has not been challenged during the debate."
"You have acknowledged, through your position, that a multilateral framework is required for the eleven applicant countries."
"It needs an instrument of political cooperation."
"With regard to Turkey's participation in this conference, that question currently remains open."
"Your Parliament is calling for a difficult step."
"The Commission, through the intermediary of its Commissioner, Mr van den Broek, has expressed a wish for clarity."
"But the Commission and the Council also hope for positive signals from Ankara."
"Whilst waiting, the intention of the Presidency is to propose to the Council that Turkey should have a place in the enlargement process and that a strategy for closer ties should be defined between Turkey and the European Union."
"I would also like to thank Mr De Vries for having placed enlargement within the context of the common foreign and security policy."
"In fact, the incorporation of new members from the east and centre of the European continent should be seen in the same context as our relations with Russia, the United States and Canada."
"A strengthening of our relations with Russia has been brought about through the partnership agreement which came into force on 1 December and of which the implementation and execution will be achieved through the high level meetings anticipated in this agreement."
"Regarding links with our transatlantic partners, the United States and Canada, I would like to inform you that a summit is taking place tomorrow and the day after in Ottawa and Washington, during the course of which we will deepen our relations and strengthen dialogue on all questions of current concern, including enlargement of the European Union, with our transatlantic partners."
"Let me add to this list some partners who are not to be neglected because we are embarking upon the venture of enlargement, our Mediterranean partners."
"The Community must not become unbalanced through enlargement and we must at the same time strengthen our ties with our southern partners."
"Finally, regarding political reforms and the financial framework, I note that these were questioned by no-one."
"Opinions diverge once you begin to talk figures."
"Failing an agreement today on figures, let us be agreed on a principle, that stated by Mr Puerta, for example, who said that a Europe of the 21st Century must be not only a market, but also an area of solidarity."
"Solidarity between the fifteen former members, but also solidarity between the old and the new."
"I am convinced, Mr President, that the European Parliament and the Council are on the same wavelength on this point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement of the European Union to the CEECs and Cyprus is certainly one of the most important challenges for the future of the European institutions."
"But to have two minutes in which to present to you the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on two such important reports, you will agree, I am sure, is very little."
"Be that as it may, the pitfall to avoid is both that of weakening existing Union policies, particularly the common agricultural policy, and of disappointing applicant countries."
"The Committee on Agriculture has declared itself to be in favour of this enlargement, on condition that a European agricultural model which makes use of the space and development of the countryside is respected."
"We would like to remind you that it is agriculture which moulded our European civilization, and that it goes back more than 2000 years."
"An extraordinary European summit on employment recently took place."
"It would be good to try to solve the problem at the source."
"I would like to remind you that, in the agricultural sector, the European Union lost 230, 000 jobs in 1996 and in the same year nearly 800, 000 farms disappeared."
"These figures are terrifying, Mr President, terrifying for future generations."
"So, the question is, has the Commission exceeded the mandate entrusted to it by the European Council? The reply is probably yes."
"From the commissioning of a technical study has come 1500 pages, duplicated into millions of copies, of a real political programme with no consultation."
"A programme in which you anticipate, with meticulous care and detail, the development of our European policies, enlargement, reform and budget, although budget, reform, enlargement would have been a more realistic order."
"A programme which makes, under the pretext of harmonizing agricultural and structural policies adapted to the new cycle of the World Trade Organization, the same mistake as in 1992."
"Will the American task force already have caused Europe to fold in on itself, even before the deadline?"
"Under the pretext of enlarging Europe eastward, which will need structural and not agricultural funds, and under the pretext of budgetary constraints, guidelines and other convergence criteria with, for good measure, a growth rate of 2.5 % in Member States and 4 % in the CEECs between the years 2000 and 2006."
"It is true that if you want something done it is better to do it yourself and that the best way of doing it is simply to confuse the issue so that only a few insiders understand what is going on, in this case the Commission..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the initial political decision on enlargement has already been taken and this has been reaffirmed in the debates and speeches that have taken place here today."
"We must therefore focus our attention on attempting to implement this political decision correctly, that is, on the ways in which enlargement is to take place in the smoothest and most effective way to ensure it achieves its objectives, which we have all outlined on various occasions."
"For this reason, some basic principles, chiefly those regarding the financial sector, which I am about to discuss, and the issue of European Union resources, must be accepted from the outset and must always be debated on this basis without continual changes in policy."
"The first thing is that reform of the economies of those states is a long and difficult process."
"We must also bear in mind that, if this reform does not happen, accession which does not fulfil these conditions will create very serious problems not only for the state concerned but also for the European Union."
"No in-depth analysis is necessary for us to realize that if we accept in our midst a society and an economy which has not advanced to the point which will enable it to fulfil the conditions which accession entails, then there will be enormous problems for both."
"For this reason, there must be adequate pre-accession aid and a pre-accession period to allow these states to prepare their economies adequately for proper accession."
"I listened with great interest to what Commissioner van den Broek said about the creation of a fund to make up the difference."
"This proposal has been elaborated by the European Parliament regarding the change to the Phare programme and I assume that what we have just heard is the development of this proposal."
"Of equal importance is the issue of pragmatism and flexibility."
"We cannot fashion inflexible frameworks when we do not even know if the conditions that we have set will be met, nor what the future progress of the economy will be."
"For this reason, Mr President, I think we must look at the totally inflexible proposal to formulate an immediate schedule of financial perspectives for the year 2006 extremely carefully."
"As you have seen, the recommendations of Parliament say that we must have a certain flexibility in this matter, that is, there must be provision for a reform clause which will adapt the financial perspectives to the situation that has developed."
"I am sure that, when it drew up Agenda 2000, the Commission took account of the fact that the conditions it contained would simply serve as an economic model, without being, of course, the kind of issues which would not incite any debate and which a priori would not undergo any change."
"For this reason I believe that the recommendations of the European Parliament for flexibility in the matter of financial perspectives are quite correct and I think that we will eventually come to an agreement on that issue."
"However, to give the impression at the present time that we are adopting an inflexible policy and that we are beginning negotiations with some but not all of the applicant countries, which, fortunately, is now changing, creates all kinds of erroneous impressions, as well as political problems for the applicant States. These problems are sometimes of such significance, although logic tells us that they should not be, that they may have very serious repercussions on the progress of the issues."
"However, whatever changes may come about, Mr President, and whatever the debate on cutbacks and on internal changes in the context of the financial perspectives, they must concern all areas and not focus on a few."
"We must not reach a point where enlargement takes place with a reallocation of funds in the context of the financial perspectives, as proposed for the year 2006, which would damage efforts to deepen the Union."
"Whatever happens must cover all actions of the European Union."
"One final point, Mr President, which was extremely well set out by Mr Oostlander, using the Cyprus issue by way of example, in an objective and proper analysis: it is high time that the European Union assumed a political dimension."
"What we see emanating from our debates is that, if we do not have a proper political dimension, everything that we debate henceforth will remain ineffectual."
"This is therefore something which we must take into serious consideration."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy I would like to point out, first, that enlargement is obviously our greatest challenge in the coming period."
"As far as energy is concerned, our attention is particularly focussed on nuclear power stations."
"We observe that in this area no ""acquis communautaire' exists in Europe."
"It is therefore extremely important that we make every effort now to bring the existing nuclear power stations in central and eastern Europe up to Western safety levels, and to ensure that industrial safety is checked, against the negotiating power of the IAEA."
"It is also important, of course, that we make safety checks on highly radioactive waste. Euratom could play a significant role in this."
"We advocate that countries from central and eastern Europe are able to participate in the fifth framework programme. Where this might not be possible, then this should at least be able to continue with Copernicus which has been extremely successful."
"Participation in the European Union's information society projects is very important."
"That way we can ensure that we are making an investment now which will lessen any claim on the structural and cohesion funds later is lessened."
"That way we can also make sure that we will have a win-win situation, both here and over there."
"Now I would like to make a few remarks on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party about the starting model."
"Rightly, the Commission and Council President Poos pointed out that preparation and negotiations are part of the same process."
"And everyone has pointed out that at the moment there is no single country we can admit, as no single country is ready."
"Fine, I would say. But let us not only give an explanation of the rational factors needed to make such a choice, as the Commission did, but also let us look at the psychology."
"In countries like Romania, Bulgaria, etcetera, Yalta 1944 still lives on."
"They have interpreted what is happening at the moment, whether we like it or not, whether we think it is right or not, as dividing Europe for a second time."
"Their assessment of the security situation and stability in Russia is different from ours."
"But they live closer to Russia, and they have personally experienced it for 45 years."
"I would like to argue strongly and emphatically that these kinds of feelings and this kind of psychology are taken into account as well."
"These countries in central and eastern Europe are rightly facing enormous reforms which have yet to take place."
"We are not talking about small reforms, we are talking about fundamental, far-reaching reforms which will adversely affect countless people."
"If you cannot offer any true prospects, such as accession to the European Union before too long, the outcome of the debate in Luxembourg might be interpreted differently than it is over here. Rationality is not immediately obvious to them, so motivating the population once again to continue with such heavy reforms and high unemployment is not easy."
"It requires a great deal of courage from politicians."
"Investors, too, in the end make choices about whether to go Estonia and not to Lithuania, because it will be argued that the latter is a country which is not in the first round."
"So I sincerely hope that we will not have two groups of countries, and that we will be able to find a way to make rationality on the one hand go hand in hand with a feeling of solidarity on the other."
"I would also like to make a forcible and emotional plea to the Commissioner to find a solution which will include everyone, because we want to have an inclusive process; this will have to find expression in our strategy."
"Mr President, there are no precedents for this process. Enlargement should therefore be seen as a historic undertaking, but also as a political necessity in the context of our search for European identity and an opportunity in the context of future economic developments."
"We think the Commission's proposal for pre-selection is a mistake."
"It could damage and delay the adhesion process for some prospective members, causing rifts between them, and might create different opportunities at the outset - such as the opportunity to attract foreign investment - which would discriminate unfairly between them."
"It would also be a mistake to retain the 'untouchable' 1.27 % ceiling, because that ceiling is dependent on an underestimate of the enlargement costs for purely tactical reasons, with a dubious allocation of two-thirds of the financing to the cost of economic growth. This will very probably cause a reduction in the weight of political structures at the present time, when major disparities exist between the regions."
"It would be equally wrong not to allow for the possibility of financial reviews, if they prove necessary, because it would be the poorest countries which would bear the cost of enlargement, and that would undermine their solidarity and cohesion."
"It is neither acceptable nor consistent to support enlargement without providing the means that are needed to realize it with the greatest possible functional efficiency, which must be in all our interests, and strictly according to the existing rules, using the European agreements by which countries become associates or members of the World Trade Organization as an important reference framework."
"It is also consistent to support the proposition that enlargement will be an alternative, instead of complementarity and interdependence, to other existing programmes, such as those proposed for the Mediterranean or ACP countries."
"To down-value the redistributive aspect and function of the Community budget and underestimate the costs of enlargement for reasons connected with the present internal politics of one Member State or another would be not only a deplorable mistake but a near reductio ad absurdum of this process, which is decisive for the future of the European Union."
"Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs shares the Commission's concern about the inability of the applicant countries to apply Community legislation in their administrative and judicial systems."
"This is included in the resolution."
"Furthermore, we stress the need for intensified measures in the applicant countries to increase knowledge of Community legislation."
"The Committee has also proposed, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy has taken up the need for effective and reliable systems for property and company registration."
"When there are deficiencies in this system, you do not have the conditions, that is, the basis, for a market economy."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy also stresses that the protection of minorities is of crucial importance and that the Commission should solve this problem as quickly as possible jointly with the applicant countries."
"This wording is too vague."
"I am disappointed that the proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, that the Member States and the applicant countries should, as a first step, ratify the Convention of the Council of Europe, has not been reconsidered."
"It is the argument and evidence of the Council of Europe which are fundamental; and this is the work we must take as a basis if we are to be credible."
"We cannot create a stable Europe without respect for the rights of minorities."
"I consider it to be an even greater weakness that nothing is said about the rights of children in the applicant countries."
"The Committee's report is even weaker than the Commission's investigation of the position of children country by country."
"I noticed that the Commission only mentioned children in Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania."
"The UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child is only mentioned in the case of Romania."
"I therefore wonder whether, in its future annual assessments of human rights, the Commission will investigate how the Convention on the Rights of the Child is being carried out, especially the obligation to report progress, since all European countries have signed up to this convention."
"In the future assessment of the Phare programme we should also find out how funds have been used to improve the position of children."
"We must also press for the banning of child prostitution in all applicant countries."
"It is a well known teaching from the Bible that the way we treat our little ones tells us what we are: humane or inhumane."
"Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the question of enlargement to the East is a matter of making good use of the historic opportunity for Europe."
"Making good use, however, means that in this extremely decisive question for the future, policy cannot be made over the heads of the people concerned."
"The massive difference in prosperity arouses on the one hand justified hopes for a better future, but on the other hand there are fears of declining prosperity and the loss of jobs."
"The way in which this question is dealt with is undoubtedly crucial for success."
"If the social dimensions, the social development of our new Europe is not driven forward purposefully or with the necessary sensitivity we are heading ever more certainly for new social conflicts and that is particularly the case in the border regions of the European Union."
"It is precisely that which we must avoid."
"The ""how' has been discussed by the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs in its opinion, and proposals have been made."
"The conclusions were almost unanimously passed on to the Committee for Foreign Affairs."
"But one conclusion of the Social Committee, relating to the transition periods for freedom of movement of employees was rejected by a majority of one vote."
"It is this conclusion which is now before the full house for a decision to be made."
"We need this proposed, very flexible condition in order to reduce the pressure on the European social model in the first phase, and particularly in the EU-border regions we must help to remove the citizens' fears with the aid of credible transition regulations."
"Only in this way will we be able to begin a good cross-border dialogue in order to promote the structure in the applicant states of a lasting development."
"On behalf of my group I therefore urge you to support this motion."
"Mr President, I do not wish to go into what the rapporteurs of the leading committees have said about regional and structural policy."
"I will only say this: a reform of the structural policy, of the structural funds, is indispensable, with or without enlargement."
"We should not lose sight of that in this context."
"From the conclusions drawn by the Regional Committee the authors of the reports have kindly accepted some points."
"I would like to deal with two points here."
"The first point is that the applicants for membership should be required to create efficient local, regional and national administrative structures, that they should encourage non-governmental players and that they should improve the systems of financial control, so that they will at least be in a position to receive and administer structural funds properly, in order to remove disparities."
"I would refer to the fact that the applicants for entry together and separately, apart from Cyprus, have had to live under conditions of real socialism, where there was no such thing as regional policy."
"There may well have been an economic policy, a financial policy, a cultural policy, irrespective of how good or how bad these policies were, there was the concept of these policies. There was no regional or structural policy."
"To that extent it is very important to develop amongst the potential candidates for entry at least an idea that regional and structural policies must exist."
"The second point taken up by Mr Oostlander and Mr Barón Crespo is that we must seek a strategy with the central and eastern European applicants for entry so that after a first wave of enlargement it would not turn out that the prosperity gap between the European Union and the countries which do not belong to it is not just pushed, in a sense, a few hundred kilometres eastward."
"That way we shall have gained nothing."
"In other words, the candidates for entry must take care as soon as possible that the areas close to their particular eastern neighbours are not allowed to slip behind, thus creating new conflicts there, because the fact is that in connection with enlargement the maintenance of peace in freedom remains, as ever, the most important goal of the European integration."
"Allow me in conclusion to thank the rapporteurs."
"All three rapporteurs have displayed not only great knowledge of the subject matter but also in particular a very high degree of sensitivity, and I believe that this sensitive topic demands both!"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to present the viewpoints discussed by the Committee in connection with this report."
"Traffic is, as you know, increasing rapidly in Europe, and many new trading relationships which increase the level of traffic have been set up, particularly with the establishment of the new democracies."
"It is the Committee's view that the new Member States should live up to EU policy on sustainable mobility."
"In that context the required initiatives and the required support should be set up."
"The priorities, as set out in the trans-European networks, should also apply to the new Member States."
"It is also important for the Committee on Transport to stress that the rules on health and safety should apply in a transport market which does not recognize borders, which is transnational."
"The single market for transport is already hectic. For competition reasons and out of consideration for the environment and workers, it is necessary for us to implement binding agreements so that the traffic development is balanced and takes the environment into consideration."
"New Member States should receive support for this process."
"So Mr President, I would like to add, that I am pleased to hear that there is now talk of a softening with regard to negotiations and to the possibility of starting them with the applicant countries."
"Today we have heard that all the applicant countries have the same opportunity, but we are still talking about a selected group and the rest."
"That is a bit self-contradictory."
"Perhaps it is connected with the fact that I disagree with the Commission's methods of measuring."
"Who is furthest ahead?"
"Is this being assessed from an economic viewpoint, or on the basis of ability or will to participate in the European Union?"
"What is the difference between preparation and negotiation?"
"The Commissioner said it was one process, but the Commission still has a start group as part of its strategy."
"From the budget attached to Mr Colom i Naval's report it appears that there are three times as many euros for the first group."
"I do not understand that if you are talking about equal opportunity."
"But today the Commissioner has talked about a new fund, as far as I understood."
"From today's debate I would conclude that, regardless of what model is chosen and regardless of how the parallel conferences are organized, an applicant country which has gone through the technical preparations and is ready for negotiations will be invited to concrete negotiations, and that is the decisive factor."
"If the assurances of the Commission and the Council hold good, the reality of who will be included first will be very different."
"Mr President, from an environmental point of view this Parliament's Committee on Environment has chosen the least possible distinction between the countries, because in order to reach the environment ""acquis' , countries who are not in the first round may show a certain passivity, whilst those who are in the first round may display a certain selfsatisfaction."
"This is what such a distinction may result in."
"During my visit to a number of applicant countries my impression of the environmental issue was confirmed."
"The enlargement of the Union is primarily a politically driven process, but that does not mean it should jeopardize European policy."
"This is a danger with regard to the environment."
"The cost of meeting the environmental legislation in the Member States is so enormous - it is estimated to be ECU 120 billion - that this cannot be reasonably produced within 20 years."
"Despite this time bomb which is slowly ticking away, enlargement will go ahead."
"To defuse this time bomb, the Committee on Environment adopted some amendments which have partly ended up in the plenary reports."
"It is of course evident that in order to be able to join, environmental legislation related to the internal market White Paper has to be complied with, but as far as the other environmental legislation is concerned, we must ask the European Commission to set priorities."
"Otherwise it will take too long for the entire ""acquis' has been incorporated."
"Then it might not be until 2020 or 2030 that the first country is able to join."
"We would like to have a copy of that priority list."
"Another important amendment is that we call for, together with EIB and EBRD, a kind of guarantee fund to be set up for banks in regions which as yet are little prepared to lend money to small and medium-sized companies for profitable environmental investments."
"It would be helpful if we could support this initiative."
"Private finance will thus be released for accessions."
"Finally, we should not underestimate the lack of capacity in these Member States, nor the lack of capacity amongst their citizens. I hope we will also allocate Phare funds for this."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education and the Media on the Oostlander, Barón Crespo and Colom i Naval reports, I welcome the fact that in Agenda 2000 the Commission describes enlargement as a challenge for the Union and as an opportunity vis-à-vis its security, economy, culture and its position in the world."
"The cultural diversity of Europe will be a source of creativity and prosperity."
"The entry of new Member States will increase the weight of the Union and its international influence."
"Education and culture are an important component of confidence-building measures to secure an enlarged Union."
"They also represent one of the few spheres where there are no differences between poor and rich countries, between those who have made more or less progress, but where Member States and applicants work together on the basis of equality and partnership."
"Therefore we regard the spheres of education and culture as particularly important in an age where nations are planning to draw close together."
"A clear sign of this is that the applicants for membership are already taking part in cultural and educational programmes and have a particular interest in the Community programmes Socrates, Leonardo, and Youth for Europe."
"Therefore, in the view of the Committee on Youth, Culture, Education and the Media, it is absolutely essential to increase the financial resources for these programmes."
"This amendment was unfortunately not accepted but at least the declaration of intent, that the promotion of cultural and educational programmes are of equal importance for both Member States and applicants."
"Here I would like to appeal to everybody, but above all to the Committee on Budgets to raise the budgetary resources in real terms from the present total of 0.48 % of the total budget for general professional education, culture, media and information, because it is precisely in the realm of educational and cultural policies, quite significant effects can be wrought with only small financial resources."
"The basic principle, the culture and education are the key to the success of rapprochement strategies, has been recognized, and I therefore ask the EU institutions to accept our motion and also to deal with cultural and educational topics at the European Conference."
"It is also accepted and obvious, that cultural and educational policies not only create jobs but also exert a significant influence on the quality of life, the strengthening of Community solidarity, of Union citizenship and of democracy itself."
"So it is important to me that our European Parliament, which I belong to, accepts our amendment tomorrow and raises the status of education and culture in an enlarged Union."
"Mr President, with the process of enlargement, there are countries lining up for EU membership, who all display one common characteristic: a low level of income to qualify."
"When you realize that the intention behind enlargement policy is to keep within the present budget, we can expect economic problems to emerge in areas other than in the relationship between Member States and an EU that has duly expanded and is expanding now."
"In terms of GDP many applicant countries are at the same stage as mid-level developing countries, and some even have a lower level of income."
"Despite the statistics, however, these countries are not considered to be developing countries as far as their educational systems, health care arrangements and existent infrastructure are concerned, although they are in pretty poor shape in many respects."
"Negotiations are going on, at least partly simultaneously with those on enlargement, between the EU and countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific countries on relationships beyond the year 2000, when the fourth Lomé Conference resolutions expire."
"It is quite likely that the meagre resources available for the EU enlargement process will make it tempting to redirect funds traditionally used by the EU and its Member States to help developing countries towards the candidate countries."
"If this were to happen, it would mean that the poor developing countries would be, to some significant extent, funding EU expansion."
"This is totally unacceptable."
"The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs is to be congratulated on its approval of the point in the report which excludes the possibility of shifting economic resources dedicated to the developing world to aid new and future Member States."
"The EU with its Member States is the world's largest provider of development aid."
"This brings with it a responsibility to avert poverty in the world, at a time when in our immediate environment revolutionary changes are taking place which demand huge amounts of investment."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs targeted and concentrated all its discussions and then its final opinion on enlargement towards the creation of an extended area of freedom, security and law."
"From this point of view we reached the unanimous conclusion that enlargement can make a decisive, positive contribution to this, both for the present Member States and the future new Member States."
"This result will only be achieved if special efforts are made by participants, by the present Member States, by the institutions of the Union and by the applicant countries."
"These efforts must above all serve the following goals: the improvement of protection of basic rights and the protection of minorities, in particular of the Roma and the Sinti."
"We must require the applicants to abolish the death penalty."
"We must require them to contribute with us to increasing of nuclear safety, if necessary also by decommissioning and closing down nuclear power stations."
"The creation of administrative and legal authorities able to cope with the full implementation of the ""acquis' must be guaranteed, in order to secure for the new citizens of the Union all the rights which the Union guarantees them."
"It requires the setting up of efficient border controls which conform to the Schengen Agreement on the future new external borders of the Union."
"We need a concept, and I cannot yet find one in Agenda 2000, of where and when these external border controls will be deployed."
"We need a European Conference, which creates binding common procedures in the spheres of justice and internal security, and a reform of the Union which guarantees greater powers of decision-making in the spheres of justice and internal security."
"Mr President, as spokesman for the Committee on Budgetary Control, I support a statement on key problems seen in relation to securing an effective and transparent administration in the countries of central and eastern Europe, both before and after accession to the Union."
"The applicant countries should give priority to acquiring well-functioning legal systems and preventing and fighting corruption and criminality, and we should contribute to this through our cooperation and economic help."
"The applicant countries should also give priority to border controls. They must build up an effective customs service and so on."
"All of these are tasks and requirements which are common to all applicant countries."
"The same applies in a lot of other areas, such as environment, infrastructure, safety of nuclear power, etcetera. If the countries have the same tasks there must, in principle, also be the same need for economic support."
"I am therefore quite unable to understand why the Commission is setting the scene for such a drastic difference in treatment as is the case, particularly in category 2, structural measures, with an allocation of ECU 38 billion for the countries which are admitted first and only ECU 7 billion for the rest."
"This points to a totally unreasonable preferential position and one which could contribute to increasing social and economic inequality."
"The countries which are left at the starting post, so to speak, by not being admitted to membership in the first round, are precisely those which will have a special need for help in order not to be left out."
"The Commission's proposal lacks logic."
"Normally we give most support to those who have the greatest need."
"The Commission has carried out some GNP calculations under conditions which appear both unreasonable and unreliable."
"The figures themselves cry out when it is proposed that ECU 70 per inhabitant per year be given in pre-accession support, while at the same time support per inhabitant in the new Member States will increase from ECU 92 to ECU 248."
"There does not appear to be any consistency in the Commission's proposal, either politically, economically or in terms of need."
"And I would therefore appeal for the distribution to be changed."
"It is not reasonable for the countries which are not yet ready for membership to be punished further by substantially lower economic support."
"On the contrary, we should use our energy and funds to make it possible for all the applicant countries to achieve membership."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, it was essential that the most important factors of the opinion adopted by the Committee on Institutional Affairs were included in Mr Oostlander and Mr Barón Crespo's report, and I congratulate them on their work."
"It was therefore with conviction that I co-signed Amendments Nos 43 and 44, tabled by Mr Martens, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, along with Mr Tsatsos and others."
"I thank them for this initiative."
"A simple reference to the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos would not have been sufficient."
"It was necessary that the institutional reforms considered to be the most urgent should also be brought, in this report, to the attention of those countries applying for accession to the EU."
"May I remind everyone that institutional reforms must be carried out before any enlargement takes place, that the conditions for the effective work of the Commission must be specified, that the Council's way of working, that is that with five exceptions there must be a qualified majority in any vote, the political mandate given to our House and the power conferred on it with regard to the adoption of the procedure for institutional reform, are truly very important."
"In summary, Mr President, this is the opinion of the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"Mr President, the Committee on Fisheries has looked at this from a technical point of view because it is a very technical subject."
"Eight candidate countries have a coastline and three candidate countries are just interested in fish farming."
"For the first time we will have an involvement in the Black Sea and later, with all the countries which wish to join the European Community, we will have by far the largest coastline around the Black Sea."
"That will have a huge political impact eventually on the European Union."
"From the technical point of view, it has been difficult to get a lot of information. We held a hearing when we had representatives from the delegations and ambassadors of the applicant countries."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, the main interest lies with Poland and the Baltic states."
"Eventually, as I said, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey will have a large interest too because the Black Sea is greatly polluted."
"Poland and the Baltic states are important because of the overall size of the fleets and the social and economic dependency of the coastal regions."
"For instance, Poland ranks thirty-five in the fifty main fishing countries of the world."
"Historic performance is going to be important."
"Everybody knows of the difficulties of fishing quotas but historic performance will mark up those quotas for the future."
"Probably one of the most significant things as far as the European Commission is concerned is going to be the maintenance of new third country agreements that will come on-stream with Russia, the United States, Canada, Sweden which is already a member of the European Union, Norway and Mauretania."
"There are limits to expansion for the fleets from incoming applicant countries."
"Restructuring is going to be necessary and structural funds will have to be made available."
"The administration of the fisheries sector within practically all the applicant countries except for Cyprus is not going to be compatible with the requirements of the European Union nor will the hygeine requirements be met."
"So a huge amount of work will have to be done within the fisheries sector if we are going to see proper trade taking place with those countries."
"This is all summed up very nicely in paragraphs 71 and 72 of the report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and I commend those paragraphs to the House."
"Mr President, a democratic system of government and a viable market economy are the conditions which have been imposed on those countries seeking membership of the Union."
"Besides these conditions, the applicant countries must also fulfil certain social conditions before they can be allowed to become members of the EU."
"For example, they must be helped to bring in legislation on job protection and product safety, which must meet EU monitoring requirements."
"This is important, not only for the citizens of these countries, but also to ensure that bad working conditions or dangerous products cannot get to be a tempting source of competition in the internal European markets."
"We also have to be able to create adequate labour systems for applicant countries."
"The well-matched system of negotiations between employers and employees is a part of democracy and European welfare."
"A condition of accepting new Member States must be that their labour market systems for negotiating and agreement are sound within the context of the European internal markets."
"Obviously, enlargement creates costs for the EU."
"The Commission's assessment that the costs of enlargement might be covered by economic growth seem over-optimistic."
"That is why I agree with Mr Colom i Naval that the whole framework has to be checked mid-term if there are significant changes to what we suppose to be its basic tenets."
"The Committee has not been fully with me on this point."
"We must be wary of pitting the present problems of the Member States, especially unemployment, against the costs of helping applicant countries meet the criteria for membership."
"The EU has to sort out both these problems efficiently and rationally, and use its resources to aid employment in a much more enlightened way than before."
"The equation will not be met, though, if money is not going to be spent."
"Expansionism has its price, but it is a price that must be paid willingly for the consolidation of peace and stability in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to applaud the efforts made by the Commission in putting forward the Agenda 2000 proposal."
"We applaud the concern for ambition, the effort in planning, and the desire for interconnection and coherence between the different European Union activities."
"Ambition because it is the great issue of the next ten years, along with monetary union and perhaps the emergence of serious political union."
"It is the great issue of the European Union to reunify Europe by opening up to the part of it which was kidnapped."
"Effort in planning since, at last, when the governments have their noses on the handlebars and a deadline of six months, we have the desire to look a little further than the end of our nose."
"It is to be applauded."
"Finally, effort in interconnection for it was good, it was necessary, that the greatest expenses which as a whole characterize the European Union - the common agricultural policy, the structural funds, the costs linked to enlargement - should be put into perspective in a single document."
"In spite of this effort, in spite of this applause, we are all the same forced to put our compliments into perspective."
"For we have the feeling that, in this issue, the Commission has offered us, not a smokescreen, far from it, but a document which expresses far more constraints than choices."
"We do not hold that against it."
"We understand that it is constrained in its actions and that it was confronted by some who said ""I do not want to pay more, I want to pay less' ; by others saying ""do not touch my structural funds' and by a third group which maintained ""take care of my agricultural guideline' ."
"So I am, we are, well aware that you are constrained in your actions."
"In spite of this, in the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the result is quite worrying."
"We consider that worries emerge which touch on the evaluation of needs, the financial forecasts, the economic management of appropriations and the administrative and accounting implementation of the expenses."
"On the subject of evaluation of needs, there is not much to say on the CAP."
"There are objectives, they could be questioned."
"It is not the purpose of our committee to do that."
"They could be confirmed."
"That is not our purpose either."
"On the other hand, there is a coherence between objectives and means."
"Regarding structural funds, we are rather worried."
"We witnessed, during the previous budgetary exercise, a growth in the number of categories of structural funds."
"Today we are witnessing their contraction."
"We cannot avoid seeing, Mr Commissioner, in this concertina movement, an effort, perhaps not deliberate but in any case successful, to prevent effective comparisons between what was spent yesterday and what will be spent tomorrow, in the different areas of the European Union."
"We are also worried about monetary union."
"It is the one main thing that is absent from this document."
"It goes without saying that to reduce asymmetric shocks we need a budgetary tool."
"It would have been good to think about this, it would have been good to provide effectively for more flexible, more active instruments which would enable the negative consequences of possible asymmetric shocks to be compensated for."
"It is above all regarding enlargement that we are worried."
"For here we have the feeling that what you are giving us is not a sum, but a balance."
"It is not a sum of appropriations, reflecting needs, it is the difference between two scales, neither of which you have mastery of. On the one hand contributions which must remain static, on the other, expenses benefiting the fifteen Member States, which are fixed."
"Between the two there is a balance and it is with this balance that the applicant countries must be satisfied."
"We have the same worry concerning financial forecasts."
"We do not question the reasonable nature of your forecast."
"We are concerned about its fixed character."
"If you do not make the deadlines, the results, that you anticipate with regard to growth, what will you do?"
"Will you reduce expenditure, will you increase contributions?"
"You have put yourselves inside an ultra-rigid system, even if your forecasts bear the stamp of common sense."
"We also have a great worry regarding economic management of appropriations."
"In reality, and this directly concerns enlargement, in the enlargement you will not be spending amounts in the new states..."
"Ah, I see I have already spoken for five minutes."
"I have gone over my speaking time."
"I will very rapidly conclude therefore."
"I would say that you do not anticipate ways of managing appropriations which are adapted to the new needs."
"You do not consider the principle of additionality, you do not reform your administrative structures, you do not demand sufficient compensation from the states in the area of management of appropriations."
"In short, you clothe what it is possible to clothe but you do not raise the problems of enlargement to their true extent."
"That is what we reproach you with, even if we know very well that you are only partially to blame."
"Mr President, the President-inOffice has spoken about an area of solidarity."
"Speaking on the budget, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, it is clear that we are far from that."
"Of course one can call the Commission's position realistic in not proposing a change to the budgetary procedure or any modification of the balance of own resources to make it more equitable."
"For the Committee on Institutional Affairs, it is very clear that this is a short term view."
"The theory of just returns, which Commissioner van den Broek has indicated is not the Commission's approach, can only be stimulated by staying within the existing structures. In the medium term we believe it is very important that the financial perspectives are changed to take into account that own resources are not giving a space of solidarity."
"For that reason we need also to revise midterm the financial perspectives taking into account that a lot of changes may take place which require institutional reform, as the Commission also recognizes with its idea of having an intergovernmental conference where institutions will be reorganized."
"Mr President, it is pleasing and sensible that the Commission has included fisheries in its last communication on Agenda 2000, because although fisheries make up a small part of the total economy, it is an important part."
"There is a problem with regard to resources because a 13 % reduction in structural funds for the 15 Member States has been announced."
"If this trend continues for the new Member States, it is doubtful whether it will really be possible to finance the needs."
"It must be remembered that fisheries are going through dramatic structural change and that these structural changes are causing a lot of people to give up fishing."
"That means that other things must be put in the place of fishing in the areas concerned."
"I would like to point out that the fishing industry is a very important industry."
"Not only does it provide us with protein food, but it also has a cultural function and that is very important for the tourist industry."
"If fishing disappears in the small fishing communities, there will also be no opportunity for tourism."
"Mr President, if you had had the courtesy and kindness to listen to me earlier, you would have understood that I have speaking time in my role as draftsman of the opinion of two committees, plus thirty seconds on behalf of my group."
"Also, if you will allow me to take up the train of my text once more, and if you agree to my linking the two speeches together, I will continue."
"If not, this is of no importance and I will stop."
"It will be no worse than the Committee on Budgets voting on this issue before the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"So, are we reforming in all directions?"
"By insidiously introducing, under the agricultural guideline, expenses until now non-compulsory, you cloud the distinction between the two types of expenditure."
"Either the non-compulsory expenses thus transferred are requalified as compulsory expenses, or they keep their current qualification and Parliament will have to look into the expenditure which figures in the agricultural guideline, which will lead to difficult arbitration between its position and that of the Council."
"With regard to the EAGGF-Guarantee appropriations, these are regularly under-utilized."
"If they were put towards financing measures of a structural nature, of interest to the rural environment, they would run less risk of later being arbitrarily reduced."
"You are also going to present a proposal authorizing Member States to make direct aid payments conditional on respect for environmental measures."
"We would be curious to know what, and under what conditions, since they will add to the flexibility of the agricultural aid that you recommend and encourage."
"It is evidently an excellent political remedy to the policy of levelling down and a good way of gleaning a few ECUs to round off your month end."
"It is imperative, Mr Commissioner, that you clarify your intentions."
"It is clearly more difficult than proposing, all goods taken together, a reduction in general prices, and I would not be able to prompt you to refer to a Europe linking agriculture to its land by maintaining Community preference rather than a Europe where agriculture is linked to nothing but world prices."
"That would be a bad calculation."
"Mr President, I hope nobody listening to this debate is in any doubt about the seriousness of the course we are about to embark upon."
"We are about to engage in a historic process which in my opinion will either make or break the European Union."
"If we handle this process properly the European Union will become a genuinely wide European Union, not simply a Western European Union."
"It will become a zone of stability and prosperity which will improve the quality of life of all its citizens and it will become a major force for good in the world beyond its borders."
"However, if we get this process wrong, the European Union will at best become a bloated introverted structure incapable of making effective decisions and it could become one which will be in danger of losing any concept of a common vocation."
"At the very worst we could see the European Union begin to crumble to the deafening sounds of mutual recriminations and contradictory ambitions, as well as endless disputes about obscure matters of European law."
"Quite simply the challenge which is facing us today is to make quite sure that we get it right and that enlargement benefits the European Union and does not undermine it."
"We have to make sure that at the end of the process we have a European Union which is effective and efficient, built on democratic legitimacy, which respects the relationship between small and large states and which respects the principle of subsidiarity."
"That is a tall order."
"It will not be easy."
"It is the challenge we must confront at the beginning of the new century."
"If the challenge of the 1980s was to complete the single market, the challenge of the 1990s to complete the single currency, the challenge at the turn of the century must be to create and make enlargement work for the benefit of the European Union."
"It will require imagination, sensitivity, goodwill and, above all, honesty of political approach."
"Our political message here today must be simply this: yes, we believe in enlargement, we want it to go ahead and we are not going to renege on our historic commitment to the countries of central and eastern Europe."
"Secondly, we believe this process should be an inclusive one, that all countries in central and eastern Europe and Cyprus are in the pipeline to European Union membership, although they may be at different stages of that pipeline."
"But we must also recognize that process will be immensely difficult."
"We talk glibly about taking on the ""acquis communautaire' , for example."
"We often do not point out that the ""acquis communautaire' now covers 80, 000 pages of text and 20, 000 legal acts."
"That is quite a lot to take on."
"We must also remember that these countries are all poorer than we are and they have to go through major problems of economic restructuring."
"So our next message must be that it is vital for the European Union to step up its preaccession strategy, to increase the speed of preparing these countries for membership."
"In particular, I would urge greater attention to be paid to the administrative and judicial capacity of these applicant countries."
"In my view that is the biggest obstacle to accession to the European Union."
"We also have to say that some countries are more ready to go through this last stage down the road to European Union membership than others."
"Therefore, we have to accept the Commission's recommendations that we should proceed with five countries in addition to Cyprus."
"A further message is that no country is in the European Union yet."
"Starting this process does not guarantee you will finish it."
"A lot of work needs to be done and, equally, if a country is not part of those initial negotiations, they can still join if they make great strides."
"It is a flexible process."
"We must also make it clear that the European Union has to change."
"When we talk about change we must remember that enlargement has to be ratified by every single parliament in the European Union and by this parliament."
"Therefore, all the changes we propose must have the consent of the people."
"We cannot go beyond what they wish to see."
"Finally, our message must be that the European Conference gives us a major opportunity to create a European political space that will allow us, while waiting for these negotiations, to engage in a sensible structured political dialogue with the countries which wish to join the European Union in the shorter or the longer term."
"I will conclude by saying that, above all, we should remember that this is a political process, not a technical one."
"It will require political courage and political decisions."
"Once we get the single currency on the road we must give every ounce of our political energy to making enlargement work for the benefit of the European continent."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the fall of communism gives the European Union a changed agenda."
"The original challenge was twofold: first, through close cooperation, to subdue an historic hostility which tears our continent apart in order instead to build up friendship and understanding, and secondly to provide political and economic strength and thus the confidence in our system based on democracy and market economics, which was necessary to be able to resist the external threat which the Soviet Empire posed on the dark horizon."
"Through its successes the European Union has changed the path of world history."
"Former arch enemies now make up the Union's backbone instead. A trusting cooperation characterizes the members of the Union, and the Soviet threat has been out-competed."
"Its successes make the Union an example in the new historic era."
"After previously being oppressed in the Soviet Empire, new countries in central and eastern Europe are looking to the Union to consolidate their economic and political freedom."
"The challenge for the Union now is to offer membership to these countries which belong to the European circle."
"After the institutional changes in the Union's decision-making mechanisms which are a condition for admitting more members, the Union can contribute to stability in a wider Europe."
"The peaceful revolution in the east has its roots in the peace which it was the European Union's original task to create."
"This is our historic mission."
"In the new historic era, our task is not to be able to face up to someone through our strength."
"Instead, by virtue of its successes through a deepened cooperation in the fields of foreign affairs and security, the European Union can contribute to stability, even in parts of the world which are outside the Union."
"The conditions for this future task are improving to the extent that countries in central and eastern Europe are gaining membership and can thereby be given a role within the Union."
"Let us make a comparison with the EMU project, which is already a success because the efforts by countries to fulfil the conditions for membership of EMU have had a beneficial effect on economic policy and have thus provided lower interest rates and lower inflation."
"In the same way, the Union's other giant project, enlargement to the east, has already produced important results for us and for the applicant countries."
"The efforts to fulfil the requirements which are a condition for membership have meant that the applicant countries have improved their policies."
"Important economic adjustments have laid the basis for market economics. Reforms have strengthened the democratic system, the judiciary and respect for human rights."
"The desire to become members has also got these countries to make great efforts to resolve conflicts, or potential conflicts, partly between themselves and partly with Russia and Ukraine."
"The value of this is easy to underestimate, because good health is quiet."
"However, the tragic experiences in the former Yugoslavia teach us how easily nationalist politicians have been able to exploit latent conflicts in the turbulence following the fall of the Soviet Empire."
"We should give all the countries which apply for membership a clear opportunity to feel that they are not inadequate, and that it is worthwhile to continue the work of reform."
"Several of the countries have a long way to go before they succeed in getting to the stage where they can become full members."
"But it is perhaps especially important for those countries to be able to feel that the goal is not so distant that popular short-termism begins to take the upper hand in politics."
"It is difficult to carry out reforms - you have to be able to see the goal."
"That is why the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is recommending that Parliament decide that a strengthened enlargement process and negotiations should be opened up with all countries with European Agreements who fulfil the basic democratic and political requirements."
"At the same time, however, and this is of crucial importance, the Committee stresses that intensive negotiations should quickly be taken up with those countries which have progressed furthest with their reforms."
"The Committee shares the Commission's view about which countries these currently are."
"Only through this clear instruction can the European Parliament give directions on how to set the enlargement process in motion."
"Enlargement to the east is already having its budgetary consequences and will continue to do so when the new countries have become members of the European Union."
"These costs must be kept down through transitional arrangements and through the reforms of agricultural policy and regional policy which still have to be carried out."
"Whatever happens, budget costs must not be allowed to cause us to lose the enormous gains, both economic and political, which enlargement to the east is going to bring."
"The European Union was founded on the idea that integration brings gains, not burdens."
"These gains are particularly evident in the Baltic area, which at the beginning of this century had Europe's fastest economic growth."
"The development was interrupted when an iron curtain even divided the sea."
"But with the Baltic states and Poland as members, and engaging Russia and in particular the important St Petersburg region in peaceful economic cooperation, the Baltic area can again become one of the centres of European growth, which also makes an important contribution to political stability in a region which otherwise contains the greatest risks of conflict in Europe."
"Madam President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to express, personally and on behalf of my group, fervent appreciation of the excellent and committed work carried out by Mr Oostlander, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Colom i Naval."
"With the enlargement to the new countries, Europe is entering a historic stage which will mark a turning point in the geopolitical evolution of our continent."
"We have completed the internal market, we will have a single currency, the other major pillars are being consolidated and as soon as possible we will have an institutional order more fitted to deal with the present and future challenges of the Union."
"Today we are debating and deciding on an equally historic stage but perhaps the most important of all since the signing of the first treaties, in that it is born of the truest and most intrinsic vocation of the European Union, growth and progress for the peace and prosperity of the peoples of Europe."
"Throwing open the doors of the Union to the countries history has divided from us for too long because of ideology and nationalism condemned by that same history, is perhaps the greatest political act in the Union's forty years of existence. It means finally sealing over those divisions which have brought destruction, poverty and marginalization to many parts of continental Europe; it means helping the young democracies to consolidate and recover a spirit of solidarity, friendship and - why not? - supporting that part of the continent which has inspired democracy and provided models of development for the whole planet; it means, above all, uniting peoples belonging to the same continent, whose history and culture are intertwined by centuries of history."
"That is why, Madam President, my group has, from the start, put out a clarion call for none of the candidate countries to be excluded from this process of enlargement."
"Why, in a process of union willed and sought by us, ourselves become the cause of new and indeed dangerous divisions?"
"If the European Union intends to be and recognizes that it is, first and foremost, a political as well as an economic union, it has a duty to help those very democracies which are governing on shaky legs and which expect help and encouragement from us."
"We address another, different, call to Malta - I do so particularly as former vice-chairman of the EU-Malta delegation - to rediscover the reasons for its political, cultural and economic membership of our continent."
"While this process of enlargement must represent a reciprocal opportunity, it is necessary to ensure that the Union seizes the occasion for an appropriate institutional reform, which we believe must be completed immediately, even before the entry of the new countries; thus, in line with the Italian, French and Belgian Governments, we make this a priority condition, just as we demand a serious and responsible effort from all the institutions, so that all the outstanding knots can be loosened in time. We think it is implausible to hypothesize the future financing of the Union on the basis of long term forecasts in an uncertain and fluctuating economic period, and in the reform of the Union's intervention policy - the structural funds and the common agricultural policy - we also have the duty to guarantee development which does not penalize our existing regions."
"The solution to these problems, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, certainly calls for an important effort, but if we want our enlargement process to be a responsible one - and I underline responsible - we have to take account of the fact that the Union's prospects must be shared by all, and by our citizens first and foremost."
"In supporting the objectives of the enlargement, my political group will be equally vigilant and seriously committed to achieving all this in a spirit of harmony and prosperity for all."
"Madam President, the enlargement of the Union is the best way to strengthen the freedom, security, peace and economic development of Europe."
"It is therefore the strong wish of the Liberal Group that the process gets going quickly and that all the applicant countries become members as soon as possible."
"The enlargement process includes all the applicant countries."
"All European democracies who share the Union's values and objectives, and who wish and are able to accept the Union's laws, have the right to become members."
"The distances which the applicant countries have come in their development differ."
"On the instruction of the Council of Ministers, the Commission has carefully analyzed which countries now appear to have the best chances of fulfilling the requirements for membership."
"The others should be given all possible help by the EU to get there."
"For the Nordic and Baltic countries it is very gratifying that Estonia is in the first negotiating group."
"Estonia's participation is also important for Latvia and Lithuania."
"It does not create, as some people here are thought to believe, rifts between the countries."
"On the contrary, it draws them all in the right direction."
"Membership of the EU for some of the Baltic states will also be a the final proof that the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact has finally been dumped on the rubbish tip of history."
"We already know that tomorrow Parliament is going to give its full support to negotiations for EU membership with countries which have been forced for a long time to cower in the shadow of the Iron Curtain and under the pressure of Soviet bayonets."
"The doors are now being opened to a healed and whole Europe, a Europe founded on democracy, mutual respect and trust."
"Nothing like it has ever been seen before."
"This is an historic event which fills us all with gratitude and humility."
"Madam President, everyone understands the considerable impact of the process of enlargement of the European Union on the countries of east and central Europe."
"It takes us inevitably back to strategic choices."
"""Tell me how you envisage enlargement and I will tell you how ambitious you are about European construction.'"
"If we have the desire to build the links of our own co-development, to promote exchanges and to consolidate peace on the continent, as well as begin to make a break with the merciless logic of current globalization, then the building site of the wider Europe must respect the rules of true partnership: an effective dialogue with all the applicant countries on an equal footing, taking into consideration the real situation of these countries, a joint evaluation of the efforts of enlargement, within the perspective of a well understood mutual interest and, on this basis, the mobilization of financial means which measures up to the objectives set."
"If, on the other hand, the intention of Europe is to resolutely commit itself to planetary economic war, enlargement risks being translated into draconian constraints for applicant countries, into a growth in the inequality of development between privileged and underprivileged regions, into the revision downwards of the gains of the common agricultural policy and structural funds, into an encouragement of competition between workers, into a blackmail for relocation."
"In short, a fool's bargain for the populations of both the old and the new members of the Union, which would not fail to translate into dangerous disillusionment and thus tension within Europe."
"Who could expect any good from an enlargement of the number of workers in the Union, if this enlargement is designed to respond to the expectations of those who, like the chairman of Siemens, now declare that what interests them in the CEECs is the fact that there, for an equally qualified person, one hour's work costs DM 4.5, as opposed to DM 45 in Germany."
"Conversely, what benefit to their daily life can the populations of the CEECs expect from the strict application of the current rules of the Union on countries whose gross domestic product per capita is less than half or three quarters that of our states."
"As the Philip Morris Institute noted, membership of the European Union will plunge the former communist economies into the icy waters of the single market."
"What compensation for this course of liberalism does ECU 76 billion of structural funds for 120 million inhabitants give, when the 450 billion dedicated to Germany for its new Länder in the East, with a population of only 16 million people, did not prevent a particularly sharp economic and social crisis."
"The Commission's directions, to be submitted to the European Council of 12 and 13 December next, fall more within the second than the first alternative that I have just summarized."
"This is why the effective achievement of the declared good intentions resembles the squaring of the circle."
"My conviction is therefore that we should consider working through this issue once more."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the impending enlargement presents the European Union with its most important challenge since its foundation."
"It thereby fulfils its central goal, to create a united Europe and can simultaneously learn the lessons from both recent history and from the global challenges of our age, that is the danger of warlike disputes, ecological destruction, dealing with poverty and discrimination by means of the ever closer economic and political integration of Europe."
"The Union is condemned to be successful."
"Mistakes in the enlargement process would not only obstruct development in central and eastern Europe but also expose the existing structure to a credibility crisis of considerable proportions, and, what is more, in the matter of financial requirements."
"We can learn this lesson from the German unification process."
"Let us remember for example, the words of Kurt Biedenkopf from the year 1990: nobody will have less, but everybody will give up some of their future growth in prosperity."
"This policy of the German government lodged in the consciousness of the people as painful arrogance towards Germany's economic power, as a missed chance for reforms and consequently as the absence of any visionary consideration."
"This policy was made at the expense of future generations, has contributed to considerable new gulfs between the people of West and East Germany and shares responsibility for the barrier to reform in Germany which is bewailed on all sides by our partners in Europe."
"Let us not repeat the same mistakes at the European level."
"Let us learn from the German unification process."
"Let us be honest in our analysis and more logical in our proposals."
"The enormous transformation processes created under difficult conditions by our neighbours in central and eastern Europe since the historic turning point of 1989 should not be answered by a simple call for protection of rights of possession on our part."
"On this premise the financial section of Agenda 2000 must be regarded as a failed attempts as a pre-entry strategy."
"Even worse: basically the newcomers are themselves financing a considerable part of the eastward enlargement."
"The built-in margin corresponds exactly to the sum of their own resources which those countries which have joined in the Commission's model should contribute to the budget from the year 2002."
"That is however a very difficult venture, if one considers that in the event of fairly slight deviations from the planned growth assumed by the Commission in the gross national product amounting to 2.5 % there will be bottlenecks."
"With all due respect to the Commission's optimism, the average growth in the last eight years has been only 1.8 %!"
"A little more conservatism in the calculations would not have gone amiss."
"On the other hand conservatism in the worst sense has spread in the meagre proposals for reforms of the agricultural and structural policy."
"Basically the Commission is not developing any agricultural policy at all for the applicant states, merely relying on the beneficial effects of the world market and thus accepting to some extent a second class membership in the EU, whereas the present recipients of agricultural subsidies remain to a large extent unscathed."
"Any considerations with regard to freezing agricultural subsidies, the step by step transition to cofinancing, the more rapid removal of export subsidies and the diversion of the agricultural industry to regional market structures, for which there are actually good conditions in central and eastern Europe, are not even thought about."
"In the structural sphere the same is happening."
"The cohesion fund is to remain untouched, but how can that be justified to the new Member States, who after all also want to become members of the single currency?"
"It would be logical either to extend the fund to those countries which in the foreseeable future will meet the criteria for monetary union or to cancel it completely as we recommend."
"The tortuous efforts towards the necessary concentration of resources remain stuck in the blocks."
"What is even worse is the fact that after the first planned wave of entries the actual new Member States are to participate by up to 28 % in the structural funds, whereas the remaining candidates will receive only ECU 3 billion."
"To put it more clearly: the Commission has no concept of the entire enlargement; in fact it does not even have a concept of a second round of enlargement, and hence it simply divides the central and eastern European countries from one another."
"Instead of this the Commission should, particularly in the financial section of Agenda, with no ifs and buts, have followed the starting line model."
"Irrespective of when a country joins, all candidates must have the same access to net transfers in the context of structural policies, as far as their capacity for absorption and cofinancing allows."
"It is precisely this separation of the negotiating level from the budgetary level which fulfils the rule of equal treatment so unyieldingly demanded by the countries of central and eastern Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in July the Commission presented the substance of two grand scenarios to us: one restricting the number of countries making up the first enlargement train to six, and the other setting the 1.27 % limit, that is to that maximum which must already be in force for the fifteen Member States to ensure that cohesion, the possibility of making the internal market practicable, positive and useful, without accentuating differences which have barely been flagged up, and which by some a miracle should apply to an enlargement to eighteen, twenty or twenty-five countries."
"Tomorrow the European Parliament will again debate the scenario as regards the six countries, selecting or proposing another route which, of course, will also be that of the European Council of Luxembourg."
"In my opinion, then, our Parliament is doing the right thing with the Colom i Naval report, by placing the other problem on the table, though perhaps not forcefully enough. It is right to put the Commission on its mettle by asking whether it is sure its lack of ambition is indeed up to the challenge we are setting ourselves."
"This is a greater challenge than we have faced in recent years. Are we sure that, as institutions with the task of proposing scenarios which then need to be ratified, it was necessary to demonstrate quite so much timidity?"
"Are you sure that in seven years, with a rigid system which will not, of course, allow revision of the financial perspectives in the course of the exercise, and therefore no longer according to that planned five-yearly term, are you sure it will be enough and that the challenge can be victoriously met and surpassed, both by us and by the new member countries?"
"Now the new scenario is opening up a different prospect, thanks also, I hope, to this report which stresses, not by chance, that the question of own resources and all the other questions on the table have not even been outlined by you."
"Are you sure that this midstream change of horses does not make it necessary to review the blueprint on this point?"
"We think it does, and that is why we will vote with conviction for the Colom i Naval report, with some important amendments which need to be passed tomorrow, because this can be the message which accompanies the other report and which will enable you - I fervently hope so - to go to the Luxembourg European Council with a revised blueprint and perhaps - if I may say so - with a little more ambition as regards a noble and important objective: making the enlargement the genuine success we all hope it will be."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the coordinated European Right, of my colleagues in the National Front and the Vlaams block, I will express an opinion on the enlargement project underway in the European Union."
"With this in mind, let me remind you of the truly prophetic behaviour of Jean-Marie Le Pen, who was the first to bring into this Chamber, as a European member of parliament in 1984, a gentleman of Romanian origin, Mr Gustave Pordea, who we see as a symbol of the oppressed peoples."
"Nevertheless, should we subscribe to the idea, which seems attractive, of extending the European club of the European Union to new members?"
"Should we extend membership to the countries of east and central Europe, to Turkey and Cyprus?"
"With regard to Turkey, we consider that this great state has a distinguished role to play due to its geographic location, that of a bridge between Europe and Asia, and not one member of the Union amongst others."
"For neither Turkey's population, nor its language, nor its culture - wonderful as it is -, nor its religion, nor its history are European."
"Saying this is not insulting to Turkey, on the contrary it shows respect for its difference and its identity, and for the pride of the Turkish people."
"Regarding the east and central European countries, I have listened to a great number of speakers, Mr Oostlander, Mr Pasty and many others, who say that it is appropriate in order to rescue them from totalitarianism."
"I have heard people say that it is necessary to turn the page at last on the Yalta division of Europe, of Stalin's control over half of our continent."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, who are they fooling?"
"This has already happened. This liberation, it has to be noted, owes nothing either to the European Union or to the policies followed by our states or to the policies followed by the political groups represented here, be they conservative, liberal, socialist or anything else."
"The communist system, the most dreadful totalitarianism ever, with its streams of tens of millions of deaths, of deportations, its restrictions, its terror, its sadness, has quite clearly collapsed thanks only to the courage of a handful of heroes and martyrs within the countries themselves who fought with determination when all the political leaders of the right, the centre and the left sided with communist dictators, with communist doctrine, with communist manoeuvres."
"So do not rekindle the spectre of communism from which these countries, asking nothing from you, liberated themselves, in order to absorb them into the new internationalism of which you are the standard-bearers."
"And what arrogance there is in the political criteria imposed on these countries."
"You talk of respect for minorities."
"A bitter joke!"
"In my country, in France, nearly ten million people, supporters of the National Front and their families, are denied parliamentary representation, denied on a daily basis the right to freedom of assembly, harassed, illegally prevented from standing in workplace elections, persecuted in their profession, in their free time, in their most fundamental rights, and their position is a great deal more worrying than that of the minorities you talk about."
"Yes, we consider the countries of eastern Europe, sometime martyred, as sisters, and it is because we consider them as such that we say to them: what you need is a flexible, gentle structure, organized around concrete projects."
"Not a Europe of the Maastricht Treaty, bureaucratic, specializing in taxes, ruinous, a new Leviathan, which aims to regulate all aspects of the political, economic, social and cultural life of hundreds of millions of Europeans."
"What you need is an organization which guarantees your security whilst respecting your sovereignty, that is, a Europe of nations."
"You, for example, the Baltic states or Slovenia, one of whose first acts, as soon as independence was gained, was to give yourselves your own currencies. As this was the first element of your liberty, are you going to abdicate this liberty, so recently gained, in the single currency system, and hand over essential financial authority to a prestigious assembly in Frankfurt, whose members you do not know, who will be known neither to your people nor to your elites, to whom you will be able to put neither names nor faces, who it will not be possible to dismiss and whose orders will not be open to discussion?"
"You, Christian nations, are you going to allow the setting up of compulsory abortion clinics in public hospitals to be imposed on you, in the name of free movement of services?"
"In actual fact, because the first duty of friendship is frankness, we say to the governments of eastern Europe: you want to join the European Union because you want to adopt the prosperity, what is more, the relative prosperity of our nations in relation to your own."
"But this prosperity, where it still exists, is the fruit of liberty and not of a Europe of the Maastricht Treaty."
"Is Switzerland, for example, is Norway - which rejected membership of the European Union - the poorer for it?"
"It is therefore because we are the friends of these nations of eastern Europe that we say to them: do not embark upon this brilliant and luxurious cruise which you are being offered."
"Rather, think about the name of the ship. The ship is called the Titanic!"
"Madam President, thank you very much indeed and I hope that my contribution will be somewhat more constructive than the previous one."
"Could I say that I warmly support the broad thrust of the Agenda 2000 document."
"I believe that enlargement is an historic opportunity for the European Union and we should not shy away from the challenges which are presented to us."
"Could I also say that in particular I warmly support the fact that the Commission, very realistically, says that the own resources ceiling should stay at 1.27 % of Community GNP."
"That is quite right and proper."
"More specifically, with regard to the references to economic and social cohension, I think the maintenance of the 0.46 % of allocations for cohesion policies is something which should command a consensus amongst all Member States."
"It takes fully into account the economic realities."
"Similarly, I note what he said about the cohesion fund and its continuation and what he said about the new objective 1 which is outlined in the document."
"These are all supportive comments I am making but I would like to express three reservations."
"Firstly, I would like to say with regard to the proposals for the new objective 2 that we need far more clarity from the Commission with regard to this new objective."
"It is simply not enough to put together industrial, rural, fishing and urban areas and somehow make the assumption that in practice things will work out alright in terms the addressing the needs of these specific areas."
"We actually need commitments and clarity as to how the very particular demands of these areas can sufficiently be met in future."
"Secondly, while I accept what he said about Community initiatives - we have had too many of them in the past - I think it is rather too draconian to reduce their number in one fell swoop from thirteen to three."
"Finally, could I say with regard to the suggestion for an efficiency reserve that it is great in principle but I think there will be problems here."
"It could lead to confusion and conflict and I certainly hope that does not happen."
"I am hopeful that many of these points will be taken on board by the Commission and that something will be clarified between now and the publication of the regulations."
"I also hope that a constructive dialogue between the Regional Policy Committee and the Commission will continue in the future."
"Madam President, basically everything has been said in the debate."
"We all wish that at the end of a process eleven eastern European states and Cyprus will be members of the European Union, and we know that not all will enter at the same point in time."
"We have found a compromise between the regatta model and five plus one."
"Therefore, I would summarize it as follows: if lack of clarity is a feature of good policy then we shall win a prize for good policy with what we decide tomorrow!"
"You notice the irony; I hope it also comes across in the translation."
"If of course the New Testament is to be taken as a guideline when it says your words should be yes and no, then tomorrow we shall fail!"
"Well, that is politics."
"What I found lacking in the debate is a reference to the fact that the European Council will set in motion a process in the course of which we must find the answers to three questions."
"We must find those answers, I tell you!"
"The first question is: how big can Europe become?"
"The European Union cannot be extended to infinity."
"We are however acting as if it could irrespective of whether or not that is in the interest of the Union or in the interest of other states."
"We talk of not putting up barriers at the start of negotiations, and we do not mention that during the process, when one joins and the other does not, much higher barriers will be erected."
"We do not talk about that!"
"The second question is how expensive may Europe become?"
"We are here throwing around billions and percentages!"
"We also know that we must not calculate small-mindedly, that we must not only add up what entry costs but we must also add up what non-entry costs."
"All that is true."
"But we must also know more clearly than hitherto that there are limits to the loads which can be borne by the Member States and by the population of the Member States."
"I say to everyone in advance: if it is a question of making sacrifices in the sphere of agricultural policy, if it is a question of making sacrifices in the sphere of the structural funds then all the Member States and all our colleagues from the corresponding Member States here will speak a completely different language than that being used in many contributions to today's debate!"
"The third question of principle is: how strong is Europe becoming?"
"Or, how strong must Europe become in order to cope with enlargement?"
"On this point, I tell you, what is described in the Treaty of Amsterdam is in any case too little, as we all know."
"With the consequences of what we decide in our resolutions on the reform of the treaty, we are nowhere near as advanced as we really ought to be if we are talking about a stronger Union."
"Where were the Member States in the past?"
"Where were our colleagues who now talk about the Union having to become stronger and deeper?"
"Where were they in the past, when it was a question of making sure that concrete progress was made, in Maastricht for example?"
"I did not see them there!"
"The states in eastern Europe basically have an easier task than ours."
"They start from a position which from their point of view is very bad and they want to develop into members of the European Union."
"Everything they do is basically a step in that direction."
"Our situation is much more difficult."
"We must ensure that they can join us and at the same time ensure that what we have achieved in the past 40 years is preserved."
"To combine both things is a much more difficult process than just concentrating on entry."
"A final point which I shall phrase in very general terms: the generation of politicians of the 1950's had the courage and the foresight to remove the thousand-year-old antagonism between France and Germany in a European Community."
"Our generation of politicians will have to develop the courage and foresight to give the whole continent, for the first time in a thousand years, an organization of peace and cooperation."
"Here we must be alert."
"The courage and foresight of the 1950s' generation of politicians consisted of making progress, not with all European states, not even with all the states in the west, but with those which were ready and able."
"Their courage and foresight consisted of holding fast to the goal of a United States of Europe."
"To set themselves intermediate goals which were achievable in single steps, that was a sign of the courage and foresight of this generation."
"I am eager to find out whether we in this Parliament and also our Heads of State and of Government can produce the same courage and foresight."
"The opportunity is there, do not let is pass us by unused!"
"Madam President, may I as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee start by thanking the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for their close cooperation in the somewhat hectic months since July."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteurs, not just the three primary rapporteurs but all 13 on my committee, the draftsman of the opinion and the chairmen of the Joint Parliamentary Committees."
"This has been a joint effort by hundreds of people in this Parliament so that we could do our duty today, which is to give the first political response of this Parliament to the Agenda 2000 document."
"I do not want to repeat the excellent speeches we have heard this afternoon but I do want to do two things."
"The first is to respond to Mr Pasty's speech in which he said not to open negotiations with Slovakia was to interfere in the private affairs of a democratic sovereign state."
"That is to miss the point entirely."
"It is precisely because Slovakia is not by our standards a democratic state that it would be utterly wrong to open negotiations with Slovakia."
"I also want to address myself to what Mr Swoboda described elegantly some hours ago as enlargement fever, the excitement of the debates about regattas and five plus-ones, buses, stadiums and the rest."
"We have generated a great deal of energy but I suspect that history may show that the details of the debate are less important than its educational effect."
"I suspect that the last six months have been a crash course for all of us in the geopolitics of eastern Europe, particularly for the existing Member States of the Union."
"I want to play tribute tonight to the governments of Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania and the rest."
"By their efforts they have inserted themselves into the political reality of the European Union."
"In recent weeks, and indeed in recent days, we have seen for the first time what a political system with 26 countries would actually look like and we have learnt and benefitted from the experience."
"I regard our key parliamentary role as being to act a reflector of reality into the sometimes arcane discussions in this Union of ours."
"I am pleased that we have played that role in this discussion amongst enlargement fever."
"On 17 November the Commissioner will recall that my committee voted a triple response, what we have come to know as the Russian dolls approach to enlargement strategy."
"We said that we want everyone in the enlargement process, we want to open negotiations with all the applicants except Slovakia and we want to open intensive negotiations with the five plus one countries identified by the Commission."
"As I understand it, yesterday's meeting of COREPER produced a diagram; I have not had the privilege of seeing that diagram officially but if I understand it correctly it may well be the precursor of what is agreed in the Luxembourg Summit."
"It seems to me very much to reflect the Russian dolls approach."
"As I understand it, they are suggesting a European conference, which is the enlargement process, with a side helping of extra political support for Turkey."
"Then in the second doll, free accession discussions with the ten plus one, supplemented by additional preparatory discussions with those countries which have not immediately been selected for the opening of article O negotiations."
"It is that third doll, that central doll, the need to proceed with those negotiations with the five plus one countries, which I particularly welcome here tonight."
"I think it would be a mistake if we regarded our discussions here tonight as the end of our discussions of enlargement - they are hardly even the end of the beginning."
"In my remaining seconds I would like to warn anyone who is listening against the dangers of seeking to take hostages in this process that will stretch out in the years ahead."
"These negotiations on the enlargement of our Europe, and the extension of the practice which, as Mr Hänsch pointed out, started on the Rhine and is now to be carried down the Danube and into the Baltic, are too important to be taken hostage either by a country, by an institution or by a lobby."
"I believe in December 1997 we have made a good start, even if I suspect that the conversation will stretch many years ahead of us."
"Thank you, Mr Spencer."
"Before I give Commissioner van den Broek the floor, I shall allow Mr FabreAubrespy to rise on a point of order."
"Madam President, I see that, in effect, Mr van Den Broek has asked to speak pursuant to Rule 107, paragraph 5."
"I do not deny him that right, quite the contrary."
"We will be very happy to hear the replies he wishes to provide regarding the different comments, but I note that he is making his request in this third series of speeches, even though all of the speakers have not yet been heard, and that he wishes to speak after the representatives of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People's Party have spoken. There is still a representative for each political group."
"I wonder why he makes such a distinction between Members of Parliament. Would it not be wiser, out of respect for equality amongst Members, to wait until all have been heard?"
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, Mr Commissioner van den Broek will now address the House pursuant to Rule 5 of the Rules of procedure, and he will also speak again at the end of the debate."
"There is nothing at all in the Rules which objects to that."
"Madam President, I certainly will be here for the rest of the debate tonight and will also listen very carefully to the other speakers."
"There are very few subjects where so many speakers are involved in the debate."
"We appreciate that very much, so maybe I can give an interim reaction."
"My feeling as I listen carefully to the various interventions is that there is more that unites us than divides us."
"The prime approach which we have in common is that we all feel very motivated, both Parliament and Commission, to make absolutely clear to the candidate countries that they are all part and parcel of the same process and that nobody is left out."
"The difference between us may be how we want to make that clear."
"To be very frank, when I look at the various amendments such as Nos 12 and 101, I am afraid there is a risk of a certain ambiguity towards those countries which we recommend to continue their preparations as if they were fully entitled to start the negotiations while recognizing that they are actually not sufficiently prepared."
"I agree with Mr Hänsch that we could get into a situation, by starting negotiations with those who are not sufficiently prepared, that halfway, when things are not moving fast enough, the pressure is going to mount, for purely political reasons, to accelerate that negotiation process and maybe eventually settle for less fulfilment of the acquis or other conditions from Copenhagen than we normally would have imposed upon new members of the European Union."
"I think that is also a factor which we have to take into account."
"Finally on this point, when I read those amendments, what strikes me very much is that there is mention on the one hand of the accession process and on the other hand negotiations."
"In our approach and concept, negotiations are part and parcel of the accession process."
"The accession process contains both, negotiations and preparations."
"When you make a recommendation to the Council for an official launch of the enlargement process which implies negotiations for those who are fit for it and preparations for the others, with the whole of the pre-accession strategy attached to it including the partnerships, in which the Council also is going to be involved because it wants to co-decide with us on the priorities to be set, then the signal in the direction of all candidates would be one of being part and parcel, all without exception, of an all-inclusive process."
"Whereas now I fear that we are going to have a debate between the Member States in Luxembourg and ambiguity will come out of it as a result."
"I obviously respect that the Parliament says that we have to look at this process and at the solutions that we are proposing in a political way."
"Of course, and although we have been analyzing a lot of technical data and statistics for a year and a half, I hope that Parliament understands that the Commission is not there only to look at the figures but has a political notion of its own."
"It has been in regular contact with each and all of these countries and knows full well what it means to give the wrong political signals."
"That is exactly why the all-inclusiveness of the process, with all the elements and instruments that we have put into place: finance, procedures, annual reports, partnerships and everything has been worked out so scrupulously in the very first place for that political reason."
"I think that the Commission may ask the Parliament for a minimum of recognition for its work of that kind."
"We should not be accused of not knowing about the past of these countries, that they were behind an Iron Curtain and we must indeed watch out that no fear of discrimination is provoked."
"Again, if we have a difference of opinion there then I hope it is more a difference in wording than substance and certainly not a difference in political approach."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner. Perhaps because of this different interpretation of the decision-making an accession process we should accept a new chapter in the dictionary."
"I have already been asked about it several times."
"There does in fact seem to be some confusion."
"But now we in fact have the official interpretation of the Commission and that is recorded in the minutes!"
"The sitting was suspended at 8 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m."
"Mr President, at the outset I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs and the draftsmen on their reports which give an excellent opportunity to Parliament to debate the future of the Union, its enlargement and the consequent cost."
"My contribution may appear to be narrowly focused in European terms."
"I merely wish to look at enlargement and how it might affect my country and my constituency of Connaught Ulster which is on the periphery of the Union."
"I welcome the recent statement of the Regional Affairs Commissioner, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, when she stated that adequate funds must remain for continuing special support to the present four cohesion countries, namely Spain, Portugal, Greece and my own country of Ireland during the next structural funds round."
"I hope this will help to assuage some of the concerns of my own country and my own constituency regarding the future allocation of funding to Ireland."
"Enlargement of the Union is not conceivable economically or politically without firm guarantees in favour of the Union's existing poorest regions."
"If such guarantees are not put in place the whole enlargement project is threatened."
"I am confident, however that the poorer regions which suffer from infrastructural deficiencies will not be left behind and the Commission will ensure that these regions continue to receive the necessary funding to bring the infrastructure in those regions up to reasonable and realistic standards."
"If such regional policies as outlined by the Regional Affairs Commissioner are implemented, it will be good news for my country but particularly good news for the western seaboard and the border counties which I represent."
"This will entitle such regions to the maximum amount of European regional, agricultural, fisheries, social and cohesion funds post-1999."
"Regions within Ireland, such as the western seaboard and the border counties will therefore continue to merit the designation of objective 1 status in accordance with the average standard of living in these areas."
"In other words, the situation may well arise whereby the region of the north of Ireland and the west will secure greater European monies post-1999 by being granted objective 1 status, while other areas in Ireland will lose objective 1 status due to enhanced prosperity."
"I wish to put down a marker at this stage. There is no doubt that arrangements are needed to ease the passage for a country losing objective 1 status to provide for a softer economic landing."
"It is important that any agreement on concentration - in particular geographical concentration - should have clearly linked to it a firm commitment to adequate transitional arrangements as envisaged by the Commission."
"But there are regions that need more than merely transitional arrangements."
"These regions must retain their objective 1 status."
"I represent the most peripheral region in Europe - the west of Ireland and the border counties - one which for decades has lived in the shadow of the conflict of Northern Ireland, has suffered unemployment and emigration among the worst in Europe."
"In discussing the status of less well-off regions, there is often too much emphasis on economic statistics."
"Ultimately what really matters is people and communities and the structures that must be put in place to maintain these communities."
"In conclusion, these regions still have very basic infrastructural needs in terms of roads, transport and water treatment and these issues must be addressed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission's proposed financial framework for the period from 2000 to 2006, contained in the document commonly known as Agenda 2000, was submitted in July, it was clear to us that the laissez-faire attitude and general inadequacy of that document was incompatible with the political and socio-economic challenges facing a Union which could be enlarged to embrace an almost indeterminate number of new Member States in the course of that period."
"Apart from being a document which in certain respects contains omissions or incorrect data and figures, making it difficult or indeed impossible to make a comparative study, the Commission's proposal on new financial perspectives does not represent an accurate and rigorous estimate of the costs that will inevitably arise from the new needs enlargement will bring with it."
"At the same time, furthermore, the foundation it offers for any increase in resources is no more than a frankly optimistic, and for that reason alone more than doubtful, economic growth forecast."
"The Commission's proposal keeps the same limit on internal resources, without taking into account the conditionality and the economic and social consequences of economic and monetary union."
"In the same way, it makes no allowance for the need to maintain and develop efforts to achieve the minimum acceptable levels for real internal cohesion, whether it be the level that the existing Member States are aiming at or the level that is increasingly imposing enlargement on countries which generally represent a third of the per capita gross domestic product of the fifteen-State European Union."
"Contrary to the proposals in Agenda 2000, that conditionality, and those old and new needs, call for the clear and unequivocal strengthening of the resources and instruments designed to bring about economic and social cohesion, for which no provision whatever is made in the Commission's proposal."
"The reforms suggested by the Commission in the document do not, therefore, make it their central objective to achieve any kind of cohesion in an enlarged Union."
"Their objective is to aim to mobilize resources found by means of cuts and savings and do not genuinely take any account of the real need to make the Commission's instruments more efficient."
"Thus the Commission mentions the reform of the common agricultural policy, which is bound up with the interests and opinions of the World Trade Organization, and will involve re-nationalization and continuing imbalances, particularly for production in the Mediterranean countries and for small producers."
"The Commission talks about reforming the structural funds, which will involve substantial cuts for existing beneficiaries. This plan may result in the least developed countries in the Union at present becoming the principal sources of finance for the new needs that will come with enlargement."
"And so far as internal policy is concerned, there is likely to be a major reduction in spending, which could be the ruin, right from the start, of the resources recently made available at the Luxembourg summit to fight the scourge of unemployment, resources which in themselves are already restricted and worse than inadequate."
"The Colom i Naval report seems positive to us, because it brings together most of these ideas, although in some respects it could have been clearer."
"The inclusion of the alteration concerning the future of the cohesion fund does certainly contribute to clarifying it, while at the same time we hope this House will reject any alterations which would neutralize the significance of the report completely or at any rate render it completely toothless and inconsequential."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact is that in our view European solidarity will not be achieved at the cost of those who already have little or continue to need a great deal."
"On the contrary, European solidarity will be effective only if those who continue to have much more - and on top of that are getting ready to demand the lion's share of the economic benefits of enlargement - are aware of the need to contribute more."
"Mr President, does the EU really want to enlarge into a general, pan-Europe cooperation organization?"
"Or is the enlargement project just an example of the classic divide and rule strategy, a tactical trick to enlarge the power of the Brussels bureaucracy."
"Even Carl Bildt has criticized the EU in his new book because of divisive tactics in the former Yugoslavia."
"Is there going to be more of that?"
"That is what is being decided now."
"The fundamental question is this: is there to be a joint start to negotiations or not?"
"The Commission's proposal divides not least the Baltic states. The Committee's proposal is unclear."
"Should the applicant countries be divided into first and second class?"
"On this point it must be made clear that real negotiations will start with all nine applicant countries."
"Another key question is whether the new Member States will have a say in the EU's future or not."
"By demanding a new treaty amendment before any new members are admitted the Commission is saying no."
"The existing EU States would therefore have a monopoly on the future."
"This is a slap in the face for the applicant countries which the Green Group cannot accept."
"New walls are now being built between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, something which the EU could aggravate if Slovakia is completely isolated."
"Of course Cyprus cannot become a member of the EU if only the Greek population is involved."
"The accession process must therefore be part of a peace process."
"Turkey must have a full right to EU membership in principle, otherwise the EU will become an appendage to the Christian Religion."
"Finally, a Fortress Europe must be avoided, that is, border contacts with Russia and Ukraine should not be made more difficult for countries which are close to these two countries."
"Are the people or the elite to decide?"
"The Green Group wants it to be done by the people through referenda."
"It should be obvious that an EU which has been enlarged to cover the whole of Europe, cannot have the same centralized character as the original association of six states."
"Many people want to have more members, but still the same EU."
"Those who do not submit to the prevailing EU ideology are described as anti-Europeans."
"Swedish criticism of EMU is seen as blasphemy."
"Enlargement will be a success if it puts an end to such totalitarian tendencies and shows that European cooperation is something other than Franco-German power politics."
"Mr President, both the Commission and the rapporteurs stress that enlargement of the Union should go hand in hand with a further intensification of the European integration process."
"This overlooks the fact that an increase in the number of Member States puts limits on the communal approach, and the job responsibilities of the European administration."
"Why has no attention been paid to the question whether it might be possible to simply elaborate on the existing model?"
"The problems this model presents with regard to manageability, legitimacy of the European Administration and democratic control are being ignored."
"This leaves unimpeded that the enlargement of the Union with central and eastern European countries is extremely important."
"We support the rapporteurs' idea to start simultaneous negotiations with all candidate countries."
"Because the terms under which the candidate countries are able to meet the conditions for membership vary, some kind of selection takes place automatically."
"The fact, that for the time being, Slovakia is excluded from the entry negotiations, seems right to us."
"Recent contact with a Slovakian parliamentary delegation made it clear to us that in Slovakia the constitutional state and democracy are not fully developed."
"As a matter of fact, should it not be a clearly specified where the geographical border of the European Union is to be?"
"Otherwise there is a great danger that in some countries expectations may be raised which will never be fulfilled."
"Will countries like Russia or the Ukraine in future be able to lay claim to membership?"
"Should it not be brought home to Turkey that membership of the Union looks unlikely?"
"We regret that, as far as structural measures are concerned, a mere ECU 45 billion has been set aside for the candidate countries."
"Considering the ECU 230 billion which remains available for the present Member States, that is a mere pittance."
"We call upon the Council and the Commission to share the deployment of resources more evenly."
"We support the Commission's proposal to set the expenditure for the period 2000-2006, as well as its proposal to maintain the maximum ceiling at 1.27 %."
"We can do without all kinds of escape clauses to get out from underneath."
"Mr President, long term financial planning must also take into particular account the border regions along the present-day external EU frontiers."
"Not only the applicant countries themselves but also their neighbouring regions ought to be prepared for the eastward enlargement."
"Negative consequences, which could result from the anticipated distortion of competition, must be prevented by a specific support system."
"We must provide our own border country support which complements our support for the applicant countries."
"In the regions of Austria's very long EU border the citizens have justified fears of economic disadvantages which might arise because of the eastward enlargement."
"This is an extraordinarily sensitive question which must not be disregarded during overall planning of enlargement and in the reforms of the agricultural and structural spheres."
"Eastward enlargement must not create winners and losers."
"The concept of cohesion must in this connection be given a new dimension."
"Another essential point which in connection with the planned reforms must not be allowed to drop is the preservation of the rural Alpine area."
"This landscape formed and given a special character over many centuries by farming is threatened with economic ruin and emigration."
"The current agricultural policy is not applicable to the higher Alpine regions and 5b support is not being continued."
"Farmers in the Alpine valleys form the backbone of the economic and cultural life of large areas in some Member States, including above all Austria."
"This section of the population must not become the victim of an agricultural and structural policy which applies totally inappropriate standards."
"It is therefore absolutely necessary with regard to the maintenance of cultural and scenic diversity and to the strengthening of farming jobs in the Alps, to set up in this region their own target area."
"Mr President, I want to speak to the Colom report, not the others."
"I have to say that during previous debates on enlargement members of the Committee on Budgets have been called all kinds of names."
"At one time Mr Spencer referred to us as mere bean counters."
"Mr Titley once referred to us as those tyrants in the Committee on Budgets."
"They say those things because we look for the pragmatic approach."
"One of the answers we were looking for in the previous debate was what price were we prepared to pay for enlargement."
"That seems to give the impression that we are against enlargement when we are not."
"The members of the Committee on Budgets are fully supportive of enlargement but at the same time, as I said, we are pragmatic about what will be needed."
"The Agenda 2000 documents set out what the Commission believes that cost will be."
"If you read Mr Colom's report and you look at the total amount compared to the GNP of the Member States over that amount of time, one could say that it is peanuts. We will not use that word in these harsh economic times but it is not great amounts of money we are talking about."
"However, that cost still has to be borne by the taxpayers and by the Member States."
"The Commission has agreed with the Member States that the finances have to be strict but let us be clear that Parliament also has to agree what those finances will be."
"In his speech Mr Colom outlined a Committee on Budgets position absolutely perfectly."
"His report is to be commended to Parliament as a sensible approach to what lies ahead."
"As the coordinator for the Socialist Group, I believe that report should be unamended."
"We should vote on it as it is without any additions."
"We should not be trying to implement structural or agricultural policy or any other type of policy through this report."
"It should be seen for what it is."
"It is a rapier going straight to the point."
"It is not a broadsword that has to be weighted down with unnecessary amendments."
"Whilst I believe it should be unamended, you cannot win them all."
"Therefore, our group will be supporting four amendments, namely Nos 2, 26, 27 and 28."
"We consider they do not take anything away from the report."
"It still maintains its thrust and they do not give excess baggage to it."
"This is a report that will not lie on some shelf collecting dust."
"It will be read in depth by the Council and by the Commission and they will know exactly Parliament's starting point when it comes to getting an agreement on a future financial perspective."
"There are differences in our approach compared to that of the Commission and we need to make one or two things absolutely clear."
"We have to say loud and clear, as it says in the explanatory statement, that there will be no financial perspective without an interinstitutional agreement."
"A financial perspective which is adopted unilaterally by the Council would in no way be binding on the European Parliament and that would not be in anyone's interest."
"The Colom report shows the necessity for the Council and Parliament to get an interinstitutional agreement and an agreement on a financial perspective."
"If we manage that, enlargement will be much easier."
"The process will go far smoother."
"This report is one of those that is genuinely worth reading and supporting."
"For those who make the effort to do so, they will see Parliament at its best."
"Mr President, we all realize that the European Union is at a crucial stage and that if we do the right thing we can create an unprecedented area of peace, democracy, liberty and economic development."
"Indeed, this is a historic opportunity which we cannot pass up or fail to make use of, as the rapporteurs, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Colom i Naval, have already said."
"We Spaniards are perhaps more sensitive to this challenge than other Europeans, because of all the citizens of the European Union, we were the last to move from an autocratic regime to democracy, twenty years ago."
"Therefore, it is easier for us to remember what it means to achieve two aspirations: membership of the European Union, and the consolidation of a system of democratic liberties."
"Therefore, we have an increased share of the responsibility for opening the door to those who knock, asking to be let in."
"This responsibility is shared by us all, the only condition being that the candidates must fulfil the political criteria expressed at Copenhagen, of a stable political order, respect for human rights and protection for minorities."
"It would not be fair to make distinctions between the candidates, since none of them fulfils the economic criteria, and if anyone is excluded the result will be political instability and irreparable economic damage, for which we will be partly to blame."
"So let us allow each country to determine its own accession timetable, according to its own efforts."
"Commissioner van den Broek said that to allow multilateral negotiation could provoke frustration in the candidate countries."
"Our opinion is that such frustrations, if there are any, should arise from those countries' own inability to fulfil the criteria, not as a result of a political decision."
"Mr President, the Union we offer to the candidate countries should be in no way inferior to the one we enjoy today."
"Tomorrow this Parliament is going to make an important statement about the problems which an inadequate financial framework could cause in relation to enlargement, the consolidation of the internal market, economic and monetary union and, above all, cohesion, which is a real keystone in the building of Europe."
"Discussions of the Colom i Naval report, both in the Committee on Budgets and in the main political groups, have been dominated by consensus. This is the best indication that this Parliament feels responsible for providing the European Union with an adequate and stable financial framework to cover the seven years of the forthcoming financial perspectives."
"However, this consensus should not hide the fact that Agenda 2000 contains underlying problems. For example, if the Union is to be financed in such a way that the budgetary burdens of enlargement are borne by cohesion, then that method of financing will lack solidarity and the political groups will object strongly."
"Any proposal for a method of financing will be doomed to failure if it does not resolve the threat of a potential budgetary crisis caused by a lack of resources to fund the Community policies of an enlarged Europe."
"Finally, if the principle aim of a financing proposal is to ensure that budget lines are limited by an unassailable ceiling of 1.27 %, then that proposal can very quickly lead to a drop in the quality of Community policy overall."
"Nevertheless, we have high hopes for Agenda 2000 because it is a serious attempt to provide stability for the process of enlargement. We hope that in the negotiations which are about to begin, between us we will be able to solve all the problems which I have just outlined."
"Mr President, the implications of Agenda 2000 are of great importance to my country, Ireland."
"It goes without saying that any sudden adjustment or withdrawal of funds would have a detrimental effect on the Irish economy and would serve to undermine the success that we have achieved in recent times."
"Tonight, while I welcome the Commission's presentation of Agenda 2000, I remain to be convinced in relation to certain aspects of the budget implications."
"Due to our economic success in recent years, Ireland is set to reach the threshold of 75 % of average per capita GDP."
"Consequently, there is great concern about the implications for the Irish economy and for the employment situation in particular, resulting from a loss of objective 1 status."
"It is vital therefore that any financial adjustment must be gradual and carefully planned."
"In other words, well-constructed, transitional arrangements should be put into place to provide an economic soft landing for the Irish economy."
"Additionally, there are regions within Ireland, including the midland region, that still fall well below the EU average in terms of employment and economic growth."
"It is vital that these regions continue to retain objective 1 status if they are to achieve the same level of growth as other regions within the European Union."
"Within the overall context of the European Union, Ireland is uniquely dependent upon agriculture; it is one of the foundation stones of the Irish economy."
"The common agricultural policy has served Ireland well over the years and while we accept that it is in our interest that European agriculture becomes more competitive on the world market, there are very legitimate concerns about the effects of future CAP reform."
"Reform must take place in such a way that it ensures that the interests of all Member States are taken into account in a balanced manner and above all else, that the interests of farmers and rural communities are fully respected."
"Most importantly and in conclusion, we must be ensured guaranteed compensation for any reduction in market support."
"Mr President, with enlargement, once again, the European vision is back on home territory in many ways."
"Once again, we are striving for peace, democracy and security, this time across the central and eastern regions of our continent."
"As opposed to 40 years, there is a big difference."
"Our citizens are bored, they are uninspired and the mission of building a new Europe has little resonance with them now."
"There is very much a practical outcome in that you could say there is no appetite for extra taxation."
"This is in many ways the irony of monetary union."
"By the need to meet the Maastricht criteria with the EMU project, we are offering unprecedented unity for present members, that is true, but we are actually threatening the integration of new members because of the financial stringency that is being introduced across the continent."
"So I believe that the 1.27 % ceiling is very realistic but to actually achieve it, and achieve it we must, real internal reforms have to be delivered."
"There is no walking away from them."
"So, yes, keeping within 1.27 % must be kept a firm target but at the death it must not become an unyielding barrier that prevents enlargement."
"The last thing I want to say is about Turkey."
"I feel personally very strongly about this issue."
"To me, the Copenhagen summit laid down fundamental principles for accession They were very clear, they were democracy, rule of law, human rights and respect for minorities."
"To me there must be no discrimination between Turkey and the other states that are trying to accede to the Union."
"There need be no discrimination, it is not necessary."
"Like every other applicant, Turkey's candidature must succeed or fail on those same principles."
"Mr President, it is quite incredible that the Union is entering into this mammoth political project with such poor preparation and poor ground-work."
"No cost analysis has been carried out."
"There is no overall concept on budgetary policy."
"There is no analysis of the effects on the current Member States."
"There is no analysis of the social effects, or of what greatly increased food costs will mean for the people of central and eastern Europe."
"Dictatorial demands are being made on the countries to submit to the whole of the ""acquis communautaire' , demands which would, among other things, have a negative effect on certain environmental regulations in some of the applicant countries."
"You have to ask yourself whether people in the main EU institutions really believe you can have 25 countries in a giant supranational organization which concerns itself with almost every policy area in existence?"
"People ought to see that the only sensible option is an intergovernmental organization which concentrates on some of the major pan-European problems and they should instead carry out a corresponding transfer and decentralization of a lot of other matters to national responsibility."
"Mr President, the proposals before us this evening and for the last number of months will ultimately change dramatically the European Union we have known and it will open up vast opportunities in the years, and indeed the decades, that lie ahead."
"I believe very strongly that we must move forward with caution."
"It would be intolerable if, by expanding the European Union and by encouraging other countries to come in, we encouraged increased resentment within the existing Member States."
"We must ensure that those countries who enter the Union have a long lead-in period so they can evolve towards the standards we would require of them."
"We must not force the pace."
"Such a policy would not succeed and certainly would also be detrimental."
"I am extremely concerned at the financial implications of enlargement and the effect this will have on the existing regions within the European Union, the future of the common agricultural policy and the very existence of our family farm structure."
"None of these proposals can be expected to cost any less at any time in the future."
"There must be greater in-depth budgetary scrutiny before we move any further forward."
"I understand these proposals will change and develop over the next two or three years but I certainly believe that we require firmer proposals from the Commission on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"There must be wider consultation before we go further down this unknown route."
"Could I make it very clear, Mr President, while I am totally in favour of enlargement in principle, that I feel there are those who want to achieve this goal without giving the real recognition that is required to the major problems that enlargement will create for the existing Member States."
"That is a challenge that beholds us all."
"Mr President, in this Parliament I represent the Northern League for the independence of Padania, a nation and people steeped in authentic history, today engaged in a struggle for freedom against the Roman centralism of the Italian Government."
"The very fact that I am speaking indicates Padania's readiness to give new nations, new states, a positive welcome to the Union."
"We are convinced that the Union has to fight two important battles simultaneously: the first task is to create a Europe with democratic instruments, that is, with a Parliament able to legislate freely, a Parliament based on the peoples, the lifeblood of democracy, before the leaders of the nation states succeed in their project of cancelling out the people and consigning Europe to American globalization."
"The second battle is to enlarge western Europe to the countries of eastern Europe, so as to have a state reality not only democratic, that is, based on the peoples, but in a position to block the bi-polar world reality project which would contrast with the spirit of peace and development, the development of the whole world."
"Padania and its constituent parliament therefore welcome the new member countries today and hope that together we will build the real Europe of the peoples and not the Europe of the merchants."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to give an opinion today on Agenda 2000 is to give an opinion on the future geography of our Union, for we today have the opportunity of reuniting our continent."
"After the fall of the Berlin wall we must define our political project, and know where our border lies."
"In fact, this enlargement is not really an enlargement, it is more a conclusion, with one or two exceptions, which requires us to consider it as a global package."
"No-one should have the impression that we are diluting the process, or that the first served will be the best served."
"For that, two conditions are necessary."
"Firstly, that we give full meaning to the European Conference, that it caters for us as fifteen plus twelve, that is, including Turkey, and that within it we may discuss all subjects, including economic cooperation, projects of common interest, particularly everything regarding infrastructure networks on a European scale and, to give but a few examples, the question of nuclear safety."
"The second condition is that the negotiations commence as soon as possible, I would even say the very day it becomes possible, for each of the other applicant countries, beyond the Commission's proposal, without waiting for the first round of negotiations to be concluded."
"But to enlarge our Union is also to wonder about the impact of enlargement."
"It will not be a success for the new members unless it is also a success for its current members."
"And from this point of view, I think that we must ask three preliminary questions: first the question of cost: it has obviously not been clearly raised."
"They tell us 1.27 %, fine, but is it reasonable?"
"Let us recall, for example, the conditions of enlargement to include Spain and Portugal."
"We had to pay for it."
"Enlargement has a cost, we must say how we are going to achieve it."
"The second precondition is clearly the institutional question."
"The building work will commence next December, after Luxembourg II, for we know that institutional reform is, by definition, long and difficult: we have sad experiences of it."
"The desire for enlargement means recommencing institutional reform immediately, as from the date of the December Council, without awaiting the end of the ratification process of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"If not they will say to us: but no, you see, it is too late, these countries are waiting, we cannot say no."
"And I mean institutional reform and not simply a rearrangement of the sense of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We think that enlargement must be on condition that true institutional reform is undertaken."
"In my opinion, this has a minimum of three factors. Of course, balance, the composition of the Commission, increase in the qualified majority, in codecision."
"But also the question of the way of working out article N, and also the question of democratic control of EMU."
"Finally, and I will finish on this point, Mr President, third precondition, we must define our political project: the ""acquis communautaire' is also a project in the area of defence."
"Let me state that for the political project of the Union, the market is not sufficient."
"We want a political union, we want a successful enlargement."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to express my appreciation of the reports under discussion, in particular that presented by Mr Colom i Naval, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, inasmuch as it frankly faces up to what I consider the main problems. First of all, the recognition of the right of all the applicant countries to a simultaneous start to negotiations, without prejudice to the fact that the rate of progress and date of conclusion of the same will depend on the capacity of the candidate countries to meet the conditions and criteria of membership."
"Another point that is fully supported is the need for adequate institutional reforms, which are already indispensable today and will be even more so in such an enlarged Europe."
"In this respect the institutional framework resulting from the Treaty of Amsterdam delivers us a Europe with a paralyzed decision-making capacity, increasingly resembling a huge market and less and less like the Europe our fathers wanted and this Parliament hoped for."
"Coming to the financial aspects of the enlargement, it has to be stressed that the restrictive policy of budgetary improvement, pursued by member countries with a view to monetary union, makes the financially painless achievement of a political operation as extensive as the enlargement an absurd idea."
"Hence the pretext that the own resources ceiling is sacrosanct until 2006."
"I am convinced that the start of monetary union will revive the process of development and growth, much decelerated today, and this could lead to revision of the financial perspectives at the mid-term assessment rightly called for in the report we are debating."
"From the sacrosanct 1.27 % derives the consequence of financing the enlargement by squeezing either the agricultural policy or the cohesion policy."
"The Commission has decided the enlargement should substantially be paid for by the cohesion policy, and I think that is a mistake."
"It involves the risk of further weakening regions which are already the weakest in Europe. This is demonstrated by the fact that the 0.46 % of Community GDP decided on at Edinburgh at the time of the enlargement to Fifteen, will fall to 0.39 % in 2006, still in relation to the existing member countries."
"So to guarantee solidarity between regions of Europe and genuine balance in their development, we need to be thinking, as of now, from the current design stage for the new structural funds, about policies and instruments which will avert the risk, in the early years of the new millennium, of the great majority of currently disadvantaged regions of the Union ending up excluded from the cohesion policy."
"So in conclusion, taking the cue from the title of Agenda 2000, a definite yes to a wider Union, provided that the conditions for an institutionally and financially stronger Union, which do not exist today, are created."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen survivors of the ""nutritional decimation' , along with the achievement of the single currency, the enlargement of the European Union to ten new countries is for Europe the major issue of the end of the 20th Century, that of the advent of a great Europe."
"Enlargement, a process which is going to be undertaken in a difficult period of austerity, unemployment and also doubts, is an historic opportunity, but also a true challenge."
"Its need cannot seriously be questioned."
"In effect, Europe's vocation is to develop itself, unite itself."
"In the absence of progress in this direction, it could not acquire the importance it aims to achieve on the international scene, nor play the role it wants to play and would thus condemn itself to stagnation."
"The problem is another, it is that of conditions and means, which must not conceal the extent to which this enlargement is a difficult one."
"Enlargement must be thought of in terms of budgetary cost, and to want it is one thing, but to want to pay the price is another."
"I admit that the Council's attitude which, at least for the moment, is that of wanting a cut-price enlargement, is a continual source of worry."
"Already, they can be heard stating that whatever the cost of enlargement, the ceiling of 1.27 % of GNP cannot be transgressed and must remain as it is."
"In other words, it is for us to define the new financial framework within the context and objective of stabilization of Community expenditure, which can be translated as: in line with the balancing of national budgets."
"Certain delegations within the Council even theoretically qualify any debate on a possible increase in the GNP ceiling."
"So without a new financial perspective and without any reevaluation of the GNP ceiling, where will the money come from?"
"Let us make no mistake."
"If you follow the Council's position, the money will come from common policies, by reforming and adjusting them, in the name of solidarity, to the new needs."
"I am thinking here of the structural funds, cohesion funds, and above all the common agricultural policy, that obvious expiatory victim of financial solidarity, as we noted last week during the Trialogue on the 1998 budget, for where farmers are concerned, solidarity is often synonymous with sacrifice."
"How far can you go in the implementation of anticipated CAP measures: a planned overall decrease in prices and a maximal decoupling of compensatory aid, in order not to compromise the situation of farmers, who are often living at the limit of what is tolerable."
"An enlargement of the unbearable conditions of agriculture would be unacceptable."
"Whoever says enlargement says financial framework appropriate to enlargement, and this financial framework, as the rapporteur Joan Colom i Naval clearly highlighted, remains to be built."
"Not all of the uncertainties have been raised on the conditions for the future financing of the European Union, far from it, and this is the true keystone of the envisaged reforms."
"It is the maintenance, or surpassing, of the 1.27 % GNP ceiling which will largely determine the content of the reform of common policies."
"Yes, enlargement must be a factor in the development of the European Union."
"Yes, enlargement must be a factor in institutional progress, but enlargement must be just as much about avoiding the dismantling of existing policies, and even be about consolidating them."
"Enlargement of the European Union must mean the deepening of the policies of the European Union."
"It will require a new interinstitutional agreement."
"A revision of the financial perspective will be required."
"And the GNP own resources ceiling will need to be considered according to the financial needs of the Union, in accordance with its objectives."
"But in no case can our group accept that the enlargement should serve as a pretext for an automatic revision of the financial perspective or of an uncontrolled explosion of the Community's own resources."
"And I think that this should be an excellent occasion for us to reflect on how we must participate in the development, but also in the balancing, of the budget."
"The path towards a successful enlargement is a difficult one and the achievement of the financial aspect is an essential factor."
"Other than these difficulties, it is our obligation to respond to the immense hope that Europe represents for the applicant countries, of whom the majority are discovering, after long dark years of communist totalitarianism, the promising road to democracy."
"Mr President, I am not going to talk about Padanian independence or other such grandiose issues. Instead I will restrict myself to certain specific points which may seem modest but which are concurrent with the enlargement."
"Amongst these, the position of the European regions bordering on the CEECs deserves particular attention. Although proximity offers them greater prospects of collaboration, it is also true that this makes them more exposed to a competition still impaired by the existing socio-economic disparities."
"So the European Union, which needs to reduce pre-accession friction, should avoid any possibility of such regions suspecting they are having to pay a higher price than the rest of Europe."
"That suspicion is all the more pernicious because the frontier areas have already suffered the chains of half a century of cold war, so in recovering funds for the pre-accession process, it is important not only to avoid taking away those they enjoy today but also to promote programmes to mitigate the competitive aspects and encourage the development of cross-border cooperation in the interests of the enlargement process."
"Mr President, the eastward enlargement project is without doubt of historic significance."
"After the fall of the Iron Curtain it is a logical consequence that the Union continues with the building of the common house of Europe."
"In order to do justice to this historic task, the people who already live in this house must be given the security that both the foundations and the enlarged structure are built on solid bases."
"Without doubt broad sectors of the population have a sceptical view of our steps towards enlargement."
"It must be the task of this Parliament to take seriously the fears and anxieties of the Union's citizens and to incorporate these into the assessment of the enlargement project."
"With Agenda 2000 the Commission presented a paper designed to show the way to an enlarged Union."
"To stay with my image: Agenda 2000 represents only a sketch of the enlargement structure but not by any means a detailed building plan."
"Therefore a large number of corrections of an institutional, financial and political nature are still necessary. I am an Austrian member."
"Austria is like no other country in the Union, surrounded by potential candidates for entry."
"So it will probably feel the effects of the eastward enlargement of the EU more directly and more sensitively than many other Member States."
"Just how sensitive the question of enlargement actually is can be seen from a unanimously passed resolution of the Upper Austria State Parliament."
"In this all party representatives were requested to ensure that there would be no entry negotiations with the Czech Republic until further work on the building of the Temelin nuclear power station was abandoned."
"This is the stated wish and aim of a democratically legal Austrian Parliament which the Austrian MEPs were requested to represent."
"The house of Europe needs solid foundations."
"In order to enlarge it stone must be laid on stone, or rather stone after stone."
"Willy Brandt declared at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall that what belongs together, grows together."
"Let us give Europe the time to grow together!"
"Mr President, as I follow today's debate in the House I find myself being reminded of the miracle of the strange enlargement of the loaves."
"I want to stay with that image."
"Because today we are still discussing the fairly abstract structures we can also quite quickly come to agreements and understandings on matters."
"But you will have noticed in the most recent contributions that when it is actually a concrete question of a particular colleague's own preserves then generosity quickly recedes!"
"We have a cake which at the moment we divide into fifteen pieces both in our agricultural and our structural policy."
"We know that we might possibly - so the Commission presumes - increase it with an annual growth of 2.5 %."
"We then say that the pieces will remain almost the same, we shall just cut ECU 1.5 billion out of the agricultural and structural fund and we shall use what grows on top of it for the purpose of bringing in new members."
"There are moreover some others - I come from this country too - who say that they want to pay less for the cake in future."
"That is all very marvellous!"
"Those are in fact also the ones who scream loudest that the first candidates should become members of the European Union around the year 2000."
"This is a madman's debate!"
"It is full of lies and deception!"
"I say here quite clearly: you need all your fellow citizens in your countries, in the countries of the fifteen Member States for the entry of central and eastern European countries, and we must convince the people in the fifteen Member States of the fact that the candidates can only become members if extremely drastic reforms take place!"
"Where are we living if a country like the Czech Republic has the lowest unemployment in the entire European continent?"
"Certainly not in reality!"
"Now we see of course where the crown has gone!"
"The problem which arises there is that there was so much downright lying, for if the public domains would get out of their aid policy, if the right to Community aid in the Czech Republic became a reality, then there would be unemployment figures which would rise in double figure leaps!"
"This lying debate which claims that those who shout loudest are the ones who really accept the central and eastern European countries is going to take place without me!"
"I want enlargement!"
"I really want it, but if I really want it then I have to make it possible."
"Then I must also mobilize majorities for it in the Member States of the Union and in the eastern European countries."
"Therefore it will be inevitable that we carry out agricultural reform and what is more within the Community."
"It cannot possibly be a healthy relationship when the European Union supplies more potatoes to Poland today than the Poles supply potatoes to the European Union."
"Not because the potatoes in Poland were of poorer quality but because we subsidize them with 50 pfennigs per mark or with half an ECU per ECU, which the Poles, however, are actually in a position to subsidize 15 %."
"Therefore we are using our subsidized potatoes to oust their own potatoes from their own market!"
"Anybody who cannot understand that reform must begin in our own house, if we are to be capable of enlargement is completely and utterly our of touch with the real world!"
"The same applies to the structural policy."
"When I hear that the Irish need money, when I hear that the objective 1 areas need money, when I look at my own Federal States in the Federal Republic of Germany, which on Friday in the Federal Parliament made the decision that everything in our structural policy must remain unchanged, then I tell you that that is impossible!"
"We need a reduction in the population limit, we need a reform, just for our own sakes."
"But we need them even more for enlargement, for it is absolutely unrealistic to accept Member States which have a current per capita GNP on average 31 % of the Community GNP!"
"I once said in a discussion in the House of Lords in Great Britain that if we try to bring the two curves of 2.5 % growth in the Community and 4 % growth in the central European countries to a single point - and there we see moreover how far apart these countries are - then Slovenia needs fourteen years to reach the average GNP of the Community, Poland well over thirty and Romania even over fifty."
"If then a colleague from the Green Party will sit down and explain to me that we would introduce a first and second division then I can only say that we have a ten-division league!"
"The countries are so very different and therefore to create the impression that one can pack up large parcels here and accept everybody quickly has something to do with heresy and absolutely nothing to do with politics!"
"Therefore I am very much in favour of us becoming much clearer and much more honest."
"The Commission's solution - and I say that also to my own group - would be preferable for me."
"We should have said five plus one, no more no less, for everything else is unreal!"
"This is all sham and facade, it is not realistic politics."
"Here I entirely agree with what Klaus Hänsch said today."
"I wish there were much more honesty, for that is what the people in eastern Europe really deserve - much more honesty, so that they really have a chance of becoming members!"
"Mr President, Mr Oostlander's report is clear on one point: all countries applying for accession to the European Union must be democratic."
"Freedom of the press must be guaranteed."
"In Belgium, a founder member of the Union, there is a free press, but one that is subsidized by the powers that be on condition that it is politically correct, that is, supportive of the system."
"Free elections must be organized."
"In Belgium, elections are free, but fixed due to the public financing that is reserved for the old parties of the establishment, fixed due to the control of the media, fixed due to the judiciary arbitrarily throwing out, when it wants to, the National Front list, a party which represents 175, 000 voters in Brussels and in Wallonia."
"And we have the impertinence to demand protection of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, protection which is, however, quite evident, or protection of the Russian speaking minority in Latvia."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 150, 000 French-speaking Belgians with less rights than the Hungarians in Slovakia and no more rights than the Russians in Latvia live only a few kilometres away from our Parliament."
"I will finish by asking this question: how should we describe this obstinate wish to see a non-European country, Turkey, join the Union?"
"Neo-colonialism or cultural and intellectual poverty?"
"Mr President, I would like to agree in general with what Detlev Samland said about enlargement."
"I think he struck the right chord on that subject."
"I would like to add one more remark about the general problems."
"I think Turkey should be included in the conference, and that this conference should be substantive, or to quote my late group member Mr Schäfer: the Turks cannot live on rubbish either."
"I will limit myself to the Colom i Naval report."
"I support the report, no problem."
"But I would like to point out that the report is surrounded by a large number of uncertainties."
"The data the Commission has supplied is theoretical."
"The Commission's forecast on spending, and to which it adheres at 1.27 %, is extremely theoretical speculation."
"If I look at the present political situation in the Council, I am extremely doubtful that the Commission will be able to stick to this time frame."
"Because it looks unlikely that the financial problems within the Council will have led to the necessary solutions, enabling us to take the lead in the enlargement negotiations."
"I think that the disagreement which is already there, and where there are different positions with regard to agriculture as well as structural funds, will continue for some time yet."
"If the enlargement process is to be taken seriously, then it is advisable that the finances are geared to the policy to be pursued."
"The impression I have at the moment - and Mr Samland has in fact already said this - is that we seem to be more engaged in distributing money among the fifteen existing Member States than in an enlargement process."
"This has been confirmed from all sides in this plenary."
"I cannot hide my concern about the scandalousness of these views."
"With great regret I even begin to gain greater understanding of the Dutch net position discussion."
"Because, of course, it should not be permissible that enlargement is transferred to those countries which find themselves in an exceedingly difficult net position."
"I find the net position discussion, and I say this immediately, a mistaken discussion, but it happens to belong to the political reality that countries like Germany and the Netherlands are faced with. When the discussion goes the way it does in this debate, with the Irish wanting their money, the Portuguese wanting their money, and the Spaniards wanting their money, then at some point the moment will have to come when we find ourselves in a political crisis in this Community, with the risk that the candidates for enlargement, which should be able to benefit from the relationship with the European Union on time, will end up being the victims."
"I wanted to raise that in this context."
"I would like to make another point with regard to accession."
"The Commission based their forecast on growth of 2.5 %."
"Mr Colom i Naval expressly asks whether this is an achievable option."
"I have another question."
"What is the relationship between this 2.5 % and the time frame which the Commission specified with respect to accession?"
"Moreover, the agricultural policy reform, the structural funds reform are sufficient to cushion the problems within the 1.27 %."
"On that, too, the Commission is extremely ponderous."
"When I look at the objective 1 areas I notice that there are considerable opportunities for savings, for instance."
"I take as my example the Dutch Flevoland, but I think that a large number of objective 1 areas can do without the fact that, now that there are no more objective 1s, it will take another six years to cut back the objective 1 position."
"This can be done in a much shorter space of time."
"They either are or are not."
"If they are not, there is no automatic right to benefit from their advantageous position."
"I think that the transition arrangement which the Commission has in mind will, as a result of restrictions in duration, have to offer further opportunities for adjustment than are presently provided for, and to see that other solutions are found."
"Because again, the present proposals on the structural funds point to the fact that countries with few objective 1 regions - and who do not even share in the benefit of the shift in agricultural policy - will have to foot the bill for enlargement."
"If I look at the opinion polls in the Netherlands, Germany and other countries on how the people feel about enlargement, following this scenario will lead to serious political risks."
"Hence my warning."
"I have already said that I think that the discussion on net contribution is a mistaken one, but I have to acknowledge that it has become a political problem in a number of our Member States, and I think it is therefore necessary to arrive at a balanced distribution of the budget, whereby criteria other than the typical net contribution discussion are applied, whereas other criteria are needed."
"This is also necessary to create more financial space within Agenda 2000 for the entrants than there is at the moment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to associate myself with what our colleague Mr Dankert has said here."
"It is very interesting that we are now faced with a more or less concealed fight over distribution within the European Union which very much reminds me of what we have already discussed at the beginning of the 1980s."
"I am sometimes amazed that the arguments which at that time were ranged against the southward enlargement of the European Union are coming today from those countries which were at the time accepted into the European Union."
"People ought to search their conscience to see if the arguments were not wrong even then which persuaded us not to accept these countries."
"We should not follow the bus theory: we ourselves are sitting in the bus and the bus is full."
"That is, I believe, sometimes a difficult situation."
"The significance of the enlargement of the European Union, the historic opportunity has frequently been evoked, and I can only underline this."
"In my opinion we should use two definitions when it is a matter of not discriminating."
"We must not discriminate in the sense that we give some candidates no hope."
"We must set in motion a process which offers them objective chances of becoming members of the European Union."
"At the same time we must arm the chief negotiators with objective criteria so that they can make such a differentiation so that the countries which have developed further do not have to wait when they have finished negotiations, for the others who are not so well developed."
"For this reason I believe that the compromise solutions we have reached meanwhile can be interpreted in such a way that the Commission and the Council have at their disposal this scope for differentiation."
"This is of extraordinary significance, for when the first country comes in much later than it would have been possible then this means falling hopes for those countries which would come in later in any case."
"Therefore it is the wrong start to just throw everything into one pot."
"We must all do our homework."
"The applicant countries must do their homework in order to get fit to be in the European Union, but we must also do our homework, on the structural policy, on the agricultural policy, on the institutional reforms, not in the exaggerated sense but in a way which is necessary for enlargement."
"We must do this homework and we organize ourselves so that the opportunity to enlarge the European Union does not lead to new conflicts."
"Enlargement must have opportunities for transition so that it does not end up in a conflict between the applicant countries and the present day Member States of the European Union."
"Also the new border of the European Union means that we must build bridges to those countries who in the long term or in the foreseeable future will not get into the European Union and if in building bridges we lose sight of the Ukraine and Russia then we shall also be making a mistake."
"Mr President, I would like to support our colleague Mr Samland's appeal for honesty and add three aspects to it."
"First, as Elmar Brok has just said, it would really be a scandal if a country which already meets the criteria and a Member State of the European Union imposes a veto until its candidate for entry is ready."
"Mr Brok knows what I am talking about, I am referring to Poland."
"That must not happen!"
"Second point: the reform of the institutions."
"I cannot get rid of the suspicion that many people address the reform of the institutions with the ulterior motive of using it to postpone enlargement for a while."
"Therefore we must be on our guard to ensure that the institutional reform is tackled quickly and logically so that we do not waste any time and the enlargement process is not thereby delayed."
"A third point, which is also not very straightforward: I have the impression that several countries who are now doing particularly well out of the support system, have no interest whatsoever in enlargement because they will then lose their financial privileges."
"That too must not happen."
"In these points we need a great deal of honesty and political logic, and I hope that we can really manage this, at least here in the European Parliament!"
"Mr President, I am delighted with the Colom i Naval report because of the quality and precision of the motion for a resolution."
"I substantially agree with its premises and the criticisms of the Agenda 2000 document presented by the Commission."
"Important historical processes like the enlargement to the countries of central and eastern Europe and the achievement of economic and monetary union, which are now being initiated, will reach their culmination, in terms of results and consequences, actually within the timespan covered by the financial perspectives and paradoxically, for the first time, notwithstanding the importance of such changes, we are faced with a political context which is not open to the prospect of increasing the financial resources of the Union."
"The reason for this position is twofold: on the one hand I believe there is a pause for reflection on the process of European integration and, on the other, the choice - supported - to prioritize the Maastricht convergence criteria."
"This faces us with the need to be realistic and effective with regard to the range of the objectives set by Agenda 2000, objectives which involve not only the enlargement but all the policies the Union will pursue."
"There is no ignoring the fact that the Commission bases its forecasts on a rate of growth for member countries of 2.5 %, which majority opinion considers an over-optimistic estimate, and keeping a fixed ceiling on the resources for funding expenditure. This necessarily implies the reform key Union policies, that is, the CAP and the structural funds, to finance the enlargement in the long term."
"The process of enlargement in still undefined in terms of timescale and cost, and the forecasts for the economies of the candidate countries remain uncertain. So it is evident that the purpose of achieving an enlargement in stable financial conditions requires a realignment of expenditure between the various Union policies."
"As already emphasized in Agenda 2000, the Commission is espousing a principle, a procedure, which is the opposite of what has happened in the past."
"We are faced with a financial package where political and economic objectives are absent while the resources ceiling constitutes a given, established a priori."
"This is a low profile approach and there is therefore a strong risk that the scope of the simultaneous objectives of enlargement and deeper integration may be changed."
"Left out of consideration from the ceiling is the actual system of own resources which ought to be the subject of serious rethinking and reform to bring them more into line with the wealth and prosperity of the citizens and more transparent in their eyes."
"Unfortunately the Commission has not actually proposed this objective, even at a propitious time like this."
"Agenda 2000 is based on automatic renewal of the financial perspectives which does not strengthen Parliament's room for political manoeuvre as a budgetary authority."
"So I share the rapporteur's view when he emphasizes the need to improve the operation and flexibility of the agreement itself."
"For this reason, and for the better functioning of the institutions, a review of the agreement would be useful."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that given the many relevant uncertainty factors involved in the seven-year period for the financial perspectives, it is right to envisage the possibility of a financial re-examination by including a revision clause."
"So regular checking is necessary. The development of the process and the financial consequences of enlargement, which constitute the central question and the major concern of the financial perspectives, are not exactly foreseeable; basing ourselves on the Commission's figures we recognize that, in actual fact, the estimate of the cost of the enlargement for the timescale of this perspective constitutes a sum which, in absolute and percentage terms, does not represent an impossible challenge; notwithstanding this there will be a significant impact on the continuation of certain internal policies of Member States."
"Taking account of this and of the considerations already developed on the centrality of the question of the enlargement and the need for a realignment of Union policies, it is confirmed that, in the present situation, the financial perspectives must provide for a margin of development for existing policies, both internal and external, from the viewpoint of the need to calibrate in an intelligent and effective way the management of the existing policies and concentrate more specifically on the difficult challenges of today, for example unemployment, and balanced socio-economic development within the integration."
"This means that it is necessary to confront decisively certain reforms, for example in the agricultural sector - the success of the enlargement depends notably on the capacity of the Fifteen to modernize agriculture - just as more attention needs to be devoted to regional policy and employment, following up the new approach in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to pay tribute to my colleagues Mr Oostlander and Mr Barón Crespo for their excellent report which I support."
"Personally, I am an enthusiastic supporter of enlargement but equally I have strong views as to how that enlarged Europe should be constructed."
"In retrospect, the last enlargement, without deepening, was premature."
"As a consequence we have inherited a large body of political and public opinion which is not committed to European integration and this has acted as a brake on our European ambitions."
"We must not repeat this mistake."
"The European Parliament must make it clear that we will not give our assent to any accession unless and until there is fundamental institutional reform."
"We must use the powers we have to force Member State governments to convene another IGC and rectify the failures of Amsterdam."
"If we fail to resolve this issue before enlargement we will have abandoned the goal of a United States of Europe and replaced it with a glorified large free trade area with additional rules and regulations."
"While we maintain this pressure on governments, we should in parallel open negotiations simultaneously with all applicant states with the exception of Slovakia."
"This would send a symbolic message to the citizens of these countries."
"We would indicate that we want them to join as soon as possible and as soon as they fulfil the necessary conditions."
"By not creating a first and second class category of membership we would also be sending a positive message to potential investors which is essential if these countries are to successfully meet the economic criteria for membership."
"I conclude by saying that I have no time for the arguments of those who view enlargement in selfish nationalist budgetary terms."
"Where is their vision?"
"There may well be an initial demand on the EU budget but such costs will be minimal when compared to the huge peace dividend that will accrue from an enlarged and fully integrated Europe."
"Mr President, my watchwords for enlargement are peace and stability in Europe."
"Therefore we must not create instability through a selection method which enforces distinctions between the applicant countries."
"Regardless of how well Commissioner Hans van den Broek argues his case, which he did excellently here earlier this afternoon, he cannot escape the fact that the Commission has created a distinction which is not even strictly objective, but political, which the Commissioner also said himself."
"With its chosen strategy the Commission has turned enlargement into a horse race in which the participants will inevitably feel like winners and losers. An A team and a B team have been created."
"It is clear enough that there are differences between the countries, including with regard to how close they are to fulfilling the requirements made by the EU, but seen in the light of the process of change Europe is in the middle of, it is the wrong time to make such a static division."
"The Commission's strategy is connected with the fact that its watchwords are something other than peace and stability."
"Agenda 2000 talks of the strengthening and enlargement of the Union, but it is not the Union which is to be strengthened, it is instead the citizens of Europe which are to be strengthened, and it is the ability of the citizens to decide over their own lives which shall be enlarged through Union cooperation."
"Therefore the enlargement process must also not be taken hostage for the Union's need for reform."
"Only through an equal cooperation with the applicant countries will we be able to secure popular backing for the EU, and without that the project will collapse."
"Mr President, Agenda 2000 for a larger and more powerful European Union, and the enlargement of the European Union through the incorporation of the countries of eastern Europe, constitute the historic integration of Europe, reparation for the historic paradox of a divided Europe, and at the same time, a guarantee of growth and stability in Europe and throughout the world."
"This is a great political choice for the European Union concerning its evolution, a choice which I want to believe constitutes a decision that has already been taken at all levels of the European Union."
"All aspects of this historic undertaking have been analysed from every angle in a process which is, by definition, in parallel with, and bound up with, the deepening, strengthening and reinforcing of the European Union in its present form."
"Of course, this evolution must be unambiguous, and devoid of inconsistencies, paradoxes and procrastination."
"With the Copenhagen decisions and criteria, in accordance with the specific demands of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and following the lengthy pre-accession processes of the structured dialogue in the context of European association agreements, we are now on the threshold of the final decision concerning the implementation of this policy with the onset of accession negotiations."
"I am delighted to see that the European Parliament as a whole is coming to the view that the process of accession negotiations must begin simultaneously and from the same starting point for all applicant countries in eastern, central, northern and south-east Europe."
"The ten applicant countries have thrown themselves with determination into the long and difficult fight for rapprochement."
"Or should I say, the ten plus one, or rather, and I emphasize, the one plus ten countries. Cyprus is surely a completely separate case."
"I remind you and refer to the positive decision taken by the European Union in 1995 on the accession of Cyprus."
"According to this decision accession negotiations are to start in April 1998."
"This constitutes the European Union's historic debt to Cyprus."
"Unfortunately, within this overall picture, Turkey has no place."
"I totally agree with Commissioner van den Broek on the following: there must be no sidelining or overshadowing of the important issue of enlargement by the matter of TurkeyEuropean Union relations."
"This does not mean, however, that we can allow Turkey to worm its way stealthily into the European Union."
"Some governments may need a certain leeway in the exercise of their foreign policies."
"The European Commission may aim for overall regulations."
"But we, the European Parliament, must maintain firm principles."
"I agree that the matter of Turkey is open for debate."
"However, it does not fall within the remit of this debate."
"Today Turkey does not fulfil the basic conditions, unfortunately for Turkey, and unfortunately for the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to make three remarks on this debate which essentially revolves around enlargement."
"Nine years ago a border fence came down in Hungary, a wall came down in Berlin, yearned for by some, feared by others: the revolution had arrived."
"At the time we were already agreed that the greatest challenge to the European Community would be not only to have achieved the unification of Western Europe but also to contribute to the process of unification of the whole of Europe."
"It was not merely a matter of the re-unification of Germany, to a certain extent it was also about the reunification of the European continent and we are quite clear about it: this could only happen under the symbol of democracy, of the rule of law, of human rights and the market economy."
"Today we are discussing the implications of this response which, we have decided, and the others are waiting for our answers and above all for us to display our will to give this answer."
"Second remark: countries are coming to us which are completely changing their historical role."
"I take Poland as an example."
"Poland has always been crushed between its powerful neighbours."
"Today it is to change from the suppressed country to the partner."
"It is a country with borders."
"The border is changing as it were from the west as the borderland to the east, where it will later be the borderland for the European Union."
"For the first time in its history - at least in its recent history - it will have to take on an active role for its neighbours, which certainly is not easy."
"Applying to join is not hard, but becoming and being a member is on the other hand very difficult."
"This is what the other countries which have applied for membership ought to know."
"We must also see, and this is the third remark, that we have compiled an examination paper, according to which, as it were, entry is the certificate of capacity for democracy, and all countries are measured against this capacity for democracy."
"Therefore we must approach this question with great sensitivity."
"Human rights, constitutionality, democratic procedures, the protection of minorities: these are the examination questions."
"This is a difficult path - I have just come from Romania - if one has long experience of dictatorship."
"Democracy, and we must all learn this, nevertheless needs constant supervision, even amongst friends!"
"We must learn to tolerate this, for it is the cement which ultimately binds us together and the fact that we can also argue in friendship about political goals is itself also a little bit of freedom!"
"Mr President, I would like to support the critical comments contained in Mr Colom i Naval's report."
"The Commission is caught up in the role of a Molière character, who is asked to eat well with little money."
"It tries to show us that enlargement can take place without much expense, or more precisely, without Member States having to pay more."
"Hence this basic premise and own resources ceiling of 1.27 % which governs the overall thinking."
"We can see the reasoning behind this."
"The Commission wanted to pre-empt the desire, or more precisely the lack of desire, of the Council, instead of making proposals based on consideration of the realities."
"And it is galling to note that, whilst after Amsterdam we were requesting institutional strengthening as a precondition of enlargement, the thinking on enlargement today shows us the current insufficiencies of one of the institutions of our Union, the Commission, which is abandoning its previously dynamic role in order to become a planning committee of the Council."
"Mr President, the end of communism and the division of Europe have opened the way to a change in the very nature of the European Union, which can now include all European peoples and states."
"This is the historic change enlargement represents."
"The Union and its Member States must therefore be capable of adopting enlargement as a political objective which is essential to the future of peace and democracy in Europe."
"It is a case of supporting the consolidation of democracy and human rights and also a sustainable transition to the market economy, making allowance for the noble aim of resolving as quickly as possible the serious social crisis into which undisciplined liberalism has plunged nearly all the countries which have emerged from Communism."
"For a country like Portugal, whose democratic consolidation and economic development has benefitted so greatly from joining the Community, there can be no doubting our support for the central and eastern European countries' applications for membership, in addition to those of the other candidates."
"So I reject any internal institutional, financial or other strategy of the present Member States which involves taking applicant countries hostage."
"This great historic design of enlargement therefore renders politically and morally illegitimate any attempt to rank the candidate countries, as the Commission has tried to do in the famous five plus one proposal."
"I congratulate myself on the fact that the European Parliament is moving in the opposite direction."
"I congratulate myself on the fact that Parliament demands that everyone should start off equal, regardless of the results, and the completion date for the negotiations should be decided according to objective Community criteria."
"I also reject any attempt to exclude Turkey for cultural or religious reasons, overlooking Turkey's European history and the decisive contribution her membership would make to peace and unity in Europe, provided the democratic requirements are fulfilled."
"We need to help Turkey to join and not exclude her from the start."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that such a great historic design requires more than weak-kneed accountants to deal with governments!"
"It needs political and moral leadership that can build solidarity and has a sense of history."
"That leadership is frankly lacking in the European Union."
"It is only thus, by displaying political courage and telling the truth to electorates whipped up by populist, nationalist and anti-European rabble-rousers, that we shall be able to bring to fruition a process which will demand wide reforms of certain existing policies, such as the CAP, and an increase in the Community budget to back the structural support policies that are needed by the prospective member countries, without causing them to be financed exclusively at the cost of the under-developed countries and to the detriment of economic and social cohesion."
"That is what it would mean if the internal resources maximum limit is held at 1.27 % of GDP."
"Enlargement is indeed a new opportunity for Europe, for peace, for democracy and for solidarity between its peoples. That objective is incompatible with divisions between the applicant countries or a reduction in social and economic cohesion funds, both of which could in themselves bring about the disintegration of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from an economic point of view Slovakia is not one of the strongest applicant countries."
"It quickly overcame the difficulties of its separation from the former Czechoslovakia."
"The high economic per capita growth, the fall in the unemployment rate, the inflation rate and the foreign debt, which compared to other countries is low, are impressive elements in this."
"Politically the constitutional framework for democratically constituted and effectively operating institutions has already been in place for some years."
"But one institution, the government, and for this Prime Minister Meciar and some of his ministers bear the major responsibility, is not working in the way that one might expect in a constitutional state."
"His attitude to the role of the State President, his disregard of the decision of the constitutional court, the partial exclusion of the parliamentary opposition from important decision-making bodies and his treatment of the Hungarian minority are important proof of his hitherto antidemocratic attitude."
"On the other hand the Slovakian administration and the Parliament are in the process of adapting the relevant legislative areas quickly to the Community law of possession."
"The recommendations of the joint EU-Slovakia Parliamentary Committee about which my colleague Rübig will speak later, have set some things in motion."
"All in all, however, we find that the Slovakian government does not meet all the political criteria of Copenhagen and great efforts on the part of the Government and in particular of the Prime Minister are still needed to achieve more democratic practice and constitutionality in order to be given a place in the group of candidates to be taken seriously."
"Mr President, I welcome the great role that Parliament has in the process of Agenda 2000."
"With regard to Agenda 2000, it has been said over and over this afternoon that the Commission is proposing a whole new financial perspective for the period under review."
"It covers the entire broad range of EU policies and assumes that expansion towards the east will take place over the next ten years."
"We all know that the European Union will face its greatest challenges over this period."
"We have to move to EMU."
"We have to incorporate anything up to ten additional Member States."
"On a personal level, I regret that Malta, by its own decision, is not one of those countries."
"As you probably know, I was the rapporteur for Parliament on Malta's accession and I hope that at some stage it comes on board."
"Another challenge we shall have to take into account is another round of international trade negotiations."
"With regard to the financial perspective, the present one which runs from 1993 to 1999 was accompanied by an increase in the EU budget ceiling to 1.27 % of EU GNP."
"The Commission is rash in assuming an average EU growth rate of 2.5 % for the present Member States."
"The Commissioner does not seem to be taking into account the possibility of unexpected economic shocks under EMU."
"For this reason I have serious doubts about the proposal to maintain the present budget ceiling into the next perspective."
"The structural funds have been very effective in poorer areas and peripheral regions in helping Ireland to reach the average standard of living of the richer regions of the Union."
"Ireland has benefited enormously over the past ten years and we have made very good use of our structural funds."
"Our standard of living has now reached the EU average for the first time ever."
"Today's budget in Ireland reflects the good health of our celtic tiger."
"However, we still have enormous developmental and structural needs."
"Anybody who has been to Dublin recently will know of the seriousness of our traffic congestion problems."
"It is emerging as a huge barrier to investment and the government is doing very little to remedy this situation, apart from giving endless employment to consultants."
"I accept the Commissioner's reasoning that there must be greater concentration of resources in the next perspective."
"It makes little sense that almost half of the EU population lives in areas that are eligible for structural funding."
"There should however be no sudden cutting off of structural funds."
"Even though structural funding represents an everdecreasing factor in our economic prosperity in Ireland, no country could go through a drastic cutting away of investment without undergoing enormous internal disruption."
"The Commission has confirmed that this will not happen."
"Any agreement on concentration must include a firm commitment to proper transitional arrangements."
"Mr President, first of I all I should like to say that I agree completely with the sentiments and the concerns expressed by my colleague John Cushnahan."
"I too am concerned about diluting and weakening the European Union through too quick enlargement, although I am encouraged by progress towards monetary union.."
"I want to address the Colom i Naval report and say that ever since the Berlin Wall came down there has been a remarkable consensus in favour of admitting the countries of eastern Europe."
"This consensus applied not only in the institutions and the national governments but with the EU public as well."
"It was also accepted that enlargement would not be achieved without some cost and that a contribution would be required from all Member States in proportion to their ability to contribute."
"So, we might ask why the Commission is proposing to admit 75 or 100 million very poor people without any expansion of the resources of the Union."
"At this point we know that the new countries will come in - at the most optimistic estimate - with something like 30 % of the GDP of existing Members."
"In the old European Union of twelve Member States there were 80 million people with a GDP of 65 % of the average and in order to bring about an acceptable convergence of economies, we raised resources of ECU 24 billion per year in order to encourage their development."
"How can the Commission propose that an acceptable regional policy can be extended to the new states with just ECU 11 billion?"
"The situation in agriculture is similar."
"It is extremely difficult to project how the economies of the 15 members will go, how the cost of the CAP will go, how the applicant countries will go over the next five to eight years."
"But, within that limit of 1.27 % it is very difficult to see adequate resources being provided to ensure that this enlargement will satisfy the applicants and their citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first a brief word about Mr Schwaiger who spoke just before about Slovakia."
"I do not wish to anticipate my colleague, Mr Rübig."
"However, when we look at the reports on the countries which our rapporteurs have written, and, for example, look at the report on Estonia and think that Slovakia would treat its Hungarian-speaking minority in the same way as Estonia would treat its Russian-speaking minority, then I do not know what the verdict on Slovakia would be."
"I doubt that this five plus one formula is the best solution and I believe that should be stated clearly in this House."
"I also hope that the Member States ultimately come to similar conclusions in Luxembourg."
"The rapporteur for the Budget Committee, Mr Colom i Naval, added in point 37 of the supporting statement of his report what he calls a final note on the administrative expenditure."
"He states that the Commission did not include in the accounts any charge relating to the linguistic problems of an enlargement of the Union additional to the direct costs, that is, the employment of administrative staff, linguists, etcetera, the costs of the infrastructure such as offices, booths in the assembly halls etc."
"I quote this apparently minor example - perhaps not too many colleagues noticed it - because it is very indicative of the imperfection of Agenda 2000 submitted to us by the Commission."
"Once again we are shirking a very sensitive question, which is in this case not so much budgetary as political."
"Let us stay with the example of Slovakia."
"What is the difference between the right of five million Danes to speak their own language and that of five million Slovaks?"
"In the context of Agenda 2000 we did not ask ourselves this question."
"We failed in Agenda 2000 to speak clearly to each other and I believe it is one of the achievements of Mr Colom i Naval as rapporteur of the Budget Committee, that at exactly the right time he also addressed the right questions."
"To reduce it to a common denominator: anyone who does not want to reform the agricultural and structural policy, anyone who does not then at the same time want to pay more, that person cannot or will not enlarge."
"I say that in this debate also to all the colleagues some of whose government representatives have taken up extremely strange positions in the various Councils in the past in Luxembourg."
"On the one hand they wanted to pay in less, at the same time they turned a blind eye to the agricultural policy and its share in expenditure of 50 % of our budget, and then the Foreign Minister said: we want to enlarge eastward."
"These are things which we cannot tell our citizens and therefore it was important that for once we tabled clear and also critical questions above all in the budget area."
"We owed that to our people and we likewise owe it to our future colleagues in central and eastern Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is indeed a very great historic challenge."
"It is first and foremost a complex political act and, above all, the supreme expression of European Union foreign policy."
"In consequence, insistence on, or gnawing away at, only the economic aspects of enlargement devalues its very essence."
"What would be of great significance is the message that must be given to all who are in need of it following the 1989 earthquake which demolished integration on our continent."
"Unfortunately, however, there is a discrepancy in the timing, if not a paradox, in the announcement of this lofty policy."
"The European Union is moving towards enlargement without first having institutionally consolidated the common foreign and security policy, and without having solved the crucial problems of its fundamental and effective operation."
"The revision of the Treaty of Amsterdam, with the focus of attention on economic and monetary union, has seen fit to defer the solving of these fundamental problems."
"The shortfall is huge. At the very least let us not compound the shortfall by making mistakes."
"It would be a mistake to divide the countries who wish to accede to the European Union into category A and category B. It would be a mistake to embark on accessions without first confronting unresolved institutional issues."
"It would be a dangerous mistake, for the sake of economic interests or even strategic considerations, to devalue respect for human rights or to underestimate the coercive, aggressive policy of certain states towards Member States of the European Union."
"It would be a tragic mistake for the European Union to appear unreliable concerning the accession of Cyprus, to which it has committed itself, by laying aside this issue out of friendship towards a country which, moreover, recently declared that it was not interested, that it indeed disregarded the Conference for which its friends are going to so much trouble, and for Cyprus, to which the European Union has an obligation, to remain at the mercy of Turkey, as Commissioner van den Broek has quite rightly pointed out."
"Mr President, the European Union is embarking upon one of its most historically important projects since its inception; enlargement to eastern and central Europe, taking in the island of Cyprus."
"EU membership will help underpin democracy, peace and prosperity in central and eastern Europe."
"At last, that Iron Curtain, which in Churchill's memorable phrase stretched from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, has been lifted."
"Enlargement will ensure that the old iron curtain is not replaced by a velvet one, excluding part of the continent from the benefits of belonging to the European family."
"It is right, of course, that the enlargement process should be allinclusive."
"None of the eleven applicant countries should feel excluded from enlargement."
"All eleven have an equal chance for membership, with reinforced accession partnerships and annual reviews of progress towards the aim of accession."
"Much needs to be done, as has been said this evening, by both the applicant countries to prepare for membership and the EU itself so that its policies and institutions are reformed in order to meet the challenges of enlargement."
"Inevitably, this includes reforming the common agricultural policy."
"The Commission is also right in its report, Agenda 2000, to point out that some countries are further down the road to accession than others."
"The five plus one option involving early negotiations with Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus is the only realistic strategy."
"To pursue other options, such as the regatta formula of starting negotiations with all the applicant states, bar Slovakia, would merely slow down the whole process and encourage unrealistic expectations."
"Finally, I welcome the proposal to call a European Conference in London next February, where all applicant countries can come and discuss matters of concern to all Europeans, including the common foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs."
"Mr President and Mr Commissioner, enlargement must succeed for all our sakes."
"Mr President, drafting this report has proved to be a difficult job."
"Combing the work of several reports it has turned out to be pretty coherent, for which thanks are due especially to Mr Oostlander and also to the chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Tom Spencer."
"The report is Parliament's message to the Luxembourg summit on how to proceed in this historical enlargement process."
"It is, as such, a marvellous opportunity to be heard."
"I am satisfied that the fine line in the report between the Commission's five plus one option and the regatta formula will not be interpreted as a clash of ideas."
"The report approves, albeit in unclear terms, the marching order proposed by the Commission, making sure it includes all applicant countries in the process."
"One serious drawback in the report is the vagueness of the terminology used, both intentional and otherwise."
"The arguments for separately staged negotiations or the effective negotiation and accession process as a counter-weight to the option put forward by the Commission lack any concrete sense."
"Semantic gobbledy-gook is of no interest to Parliament."
"Parliament desired responsibility for, and a clear role in, the enlargement process, but now it appears that it cannot take a position on the form of negotiations nor on questions of funding."
"Proper negotiations cannot be conducted simultaneously with all applicant countries."
"The Commission is seeking, through its own proposal, a dynamic enlargement process, which will not be achieved through the so-called regatta formula."
"Might one ask what reasons there are for a joint accession process?"
"Such a process would become a kind of power struggle, where countries with strong support in the present EU, would perhaps selfishly elbow their way to the front."
"It would also prolong things, making it easy to put off changes in Union policy."
"Is this what we really want?"
"It is good to see that Parliament does not have an opinion on separate negotiations and accession timetables for the various countries."
"The committee was quite horrified that many members wished to lump together the Baltic states as one block, sweeping away these countries' entirely different historical, social, and socio-economic backgrounds."
"As chairman for the Estonian delegation I can say that we are fully aware of the sacrifices Estonia will have to make, and we support this country's place in the front row of applicants."
"Estonia's inclusion on the Commission's five plus one list will not only be a step in the direction for Latvia and Lithuania, but for the Union's whole northern aspect."
"In summary it might be said that, in the light of the content of the report, in voting for it support is given for no one enlargement strategy, or possibly all of them, so subtly does this paper deal with them."
"It is enough to hope that in the future the commitment of individuals to the enlargement process is dealt with better than in the EMU projects now in progress."
"Otherwise, in the final straight the politicians will be talking but the people will not be interested."
"Mr President, if the Union gets larger, what else grows?"
"Stability? Security?"
"Human rights? We hope so."
"There are still a few problems to solve, though."
"Differences in social conditions in the Union must not get larger as we extend towards the east."
"Neither must the intellectual differences among us broaden as we grow and change into an information-based society."
"That is what is happening, though."
"So the borders that exist within our societies must not be allowed to get larger, as we extend eastward."
"In the candidate countries we must expect social problems, not to say social upheaval, as a result of stringent application of the demands of membership."
"The criteria for economic and monetary union have caused such phenomena already amongst ourselves."
"Enlargement will not bring security unless the basis for it survives."
"We cannot bring down our border with Russia either."
"We therefore need the northern dimension view and a Baltic Sea policy."
"We need the commitment of Russia to Europe and not Asia or a Greater Russia, which are the alternatives."
"There is no European security without the participation of Russia."
"You could say that NATO's spread eastward is seen in Russia as a gift to the Communists."
"EU enlargement, though, is regarded as something positive for Russia."
"That is why we should be concerned, not that Europe should extend its borders, but that those borders should decrease in number."
"Mr President, I would like towards the end of our debate, which has quantitatively certainly been extensive but also qualitatively appropriate to the subject, to try, both for the relationship of the European Union with Latvia and also for its neighbour states Estonia and Lithuania, in other words for the relationship of the European Union with the Baltic states at least to indicate a greater connection in time and space."
"One of the topical and more particularly future basic questions of European policy will be the form of relationship between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"In this matter I can only agree with Mr Paasilinna."
"It is clearly in the interests of the European Union that this relationship should be constructive and stability - orientated."
"In this respect particularly important is direct cross-border regional cooperation."
"This is shown particularly by experiences of recent years of an increasingly intensive cooperation, the formation of numerous euro regions on the eastern borders of the European Union."
"We should project these explicitly positive experiences of recent years and decades into the future."
"It is precisely the three Baltic states which would as members of the European Union be potential partners in cross-border cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"The Baltic states could thus make a specific, almost irreplaceable, substantial contribution to the solution of one of the key problems of European policy."
"The next and most important condition for this is the possibility of being able to join the European Union."
"Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will only be able to perceive and desire this desirable political function, that is supporters of cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation when they are firmly anchored in the European Union and when they feel themselves to be equally valuable and justified partners."
"Accession strategy should not be characterized only by the current framework conditions but also by future factors which are deliberately influenced and formed by us."
"To enter the European Union as quickly as possible would also help to solve other marginal problems, about which I can unfortunately not go into detail at the moment."
"Mr President, the enlargement of the EU will be an historic decision."
"The instruments which the EU has at its disposal, that is, the political, economic and diplomatic tools, are extremely valuable and much more effective than military ones for building lasting intergovernmental cooperation."
"Parliament's work has been both extensive and intensive."
"It was not easy to find a compromise between immediate negotiations for all and negotiations just for some."
"The most important element must be that all applicant countries are included in the enlargement process, regardless of their level of readiness."
"Obviously all countries must be judged on the same terms and be treated in an even way."
"It has to be clear to all the applicant countries and their populations that they are part of an enlargement process and that they will become members when they fulfil the criteria for membership."
"None of the countries fulfills these criteria today."
"Under those circumstances it is hardly appropriate to select just a few countries."
"Nobody knows with certainty what the situation will be in the applicant countries in a few years' time."
"There is a political will to enlarge the EU."
"It is important to encourage this will, not least among the applicant countries."
"These are young, fragile democracies."
"To close the door in their faces is not right."
"We would send the wrong signals by only selecting certain states."
"All the applicant states must be given the opportunity to begin negotiations for membership at the same time."
"Concerns have been expressed that that would risk delaying the process for those countries who are regarded as being ready for negotiations."
"It is important that the applicant countries are not set up against each other."
"Therefore a common start to negotiations should be made with all at the same time."
"After these multilateral ""acquis' negotiations, which could take a year, bilateral negotiations should be started with those countries who are ready, probably the five plus one which the Commission has selected, but also other states if they are ready."
"What we gain by such a solution is that we do not rule out certain countries in advance, but encourage them to continue their ambitious efforts to be ready for membership."
"Mr President, in December 1997 the future of Europe will begin."
"Ultimately this is only an opportunity to be allowed to live in the future in peace, prosperity and security."
"We see that opening up of the east has accelerated the economy, that mutual relationships have become very much closer, that trade will profit, that both sides are profiting from this opening up."
"My first concern - and I come from a blacksmith's forge in Austria - about the opening up of the east was, what does the future hold for us?"
"I went over to these countries and saw for myself the opportunities which exist there."
"If one sees the demand which prevails there for products, for services, what all these things can do for us, then that is twice the opportunity."
"I believe we must place these opportunities which this eastward enlargement gives us at the centre of our policy, although we must also not forget the risks."
"But it is above all an opportunity because of course market restrictions disappear and globalization has a positive effect."
"We cannot on Sunday talk about jobs and on Monday be against eastward enlargement."
"I believe that eastward enlargement will create jobs on both sides."
"This is a chance we must take!"
"In particular, security considerations such as Schengen, nuclear safety, are also absolutely central issues for us and I believe that in future we shall also in this sphere still have a great deal to do."
"As vice-chairman of the Delegation for Slovakia, it is my concern to say that very probably enormous progress has been made and in particular we should see that the opposition became more deeply involved, but that also on the other hand the Gaulieder case is not yet solved, but will be solved next year at the latest with the Elections."
"Therefore we should not here choose the formula minus one but plus one."
"That is a very important aspect."
"I would like to say: the door is open, but we are not forcing our way in!"
"Mr President, I found this a lengthy and interesting debate, and I have already trespassed on your generosity to intervene twice, so I will be brief, and thank the speakers for the important interventions which we have been able to hear today, which covered a large part of what the Commission together with the proposals on EMU regards as one of its most important proposals during this term of office."
"The debate today has, I think, given a quite a complete picture about what discussions are awaiting us between the Member States."
"I am not so much and not primarily thinking of discussions about the enlargement scenario, and of trying to prevent any country from feeling excluded."
"I am thinking more of the discussions which are to take place about financing the enlargement."
"Now, I believe that we do not have to or are able to draw any conclusions from this in view of the fact that the European Commission will also have to make further proposals."
"But it is in any case good to be able to ascertain that today the uncertainty which still exists about certain sections of the internal policy reforms, and their financial consequences, as well as about the financing of enlargement in its totality, evidently give no cause for the overwhelming majority of this House to exercise restraint with regard to starting the further enlargement process."
"I am more inclined to detect an encouragement to speed up the programme."
"If financial motives should disturb the enlargement rhythm as such, or would occur at the cost of the least advanced candidate countries, only then there would be a case of actual discrimination."
"Today it became very obvious that in this House, too, there would objections to this."
"We await tomorrow's votes with interest, and over the coming months we would very much like to exchange views further about how satisfactory answers can be given to the as yet unanswered questions."
"Thank you very much Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I have asked for the floor on a point of order pursuant to Rule 48 of our Rules of Procedure."
"On 19 November in Brussels, I did in fact make a declaration pursuant to that Rule which I hoped to see included in the register on the regularity and transparency of procedures governing certain expenditure of our Parliament."
"I did so because I think ordinary Members need to make their position clear on the allegations that have been made and solutions need to be found to deal with the problems affecting certain parliamentary operating expenses and investment expenditure."
"Initial reactions from all the political groups were extremely favourable."
"Yesterday, Mr President, you stated that my written declaration was unacceptable, when the only condition laid down by Rule 48 of our Rules of Procedure is that this declaration must fall within the sphere of activities of the European Union."
"Yet declarations on issues such as a general ban on landmines and other subjects have been ruled acceptable, as you are well aware, Mr President."
"You pointed out to me that other bodies are responsible for dealing with these questions: the Bureau, the Quaestors, the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"That is true, Mr President, of any written declaration dealing with the activities of the European Union."
"My written declaration deals with one of the fundamental activities of the European Union - the way elected Members can use public money."
"Mr President, I would like to know why you have ruled this written declaration unacceptable?"
"What are you afraid of?"
"Why are your people advising you not even to allow distribution to all Members of a declaration making it possible to deal with an issue which everyone knows is fundamental?"
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you are very well aware of the reasons why I think your declaration is unacceptable, because I sent them to you in writing."
"All the same, as I am always careful to preserve the rights of Members, I did not want to decide the issue myself. I sent it to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure which is responsible for deciding whether my decision is the right one or not."
"You are a member of that committee. You can set out your arguments in that forum."
"This is not an issue to consider today."
"The Committee on the Rules will make the decision and we will abide by that decision."
"Mr President, in view of the complete blockade in British ports for Irish beef, could I ask the Commission to make a statement to say what they intend to do about this very serious and deteriorating situation, which is an interruption of trade."
"At this time the blockade is spreading and nothing seems to be being done by either the British Government or the Commission."
"I am asking for a statement."
"Mr Gillis, you know exactly how to ask for a Commission statement and if you use the proper method the Commission will comply with your request."
"It cannot do so immediately."
"Mr President, while I accept the Rules of this House, we must also act on an ad hoc basis when a serious situation arises."
"When Irish beef products are being dumped in the sea at Holyhead and containers prevented from travelling through the UK, there is an onus on this House, the British Government and the Transport Commissioner to ensure that these Irish containers can travel through the UK unimpeded."
"I appreciate that the protesters..."
"Mr Gallagher, you know perfectly well this is not the time to raise this matter."
"I gave Mr Gillis an answer and the matter is dealt with."
"Votes"
"Mr President, the Green Group supports this compromise."
"We have also signed it and would like that to be recorded please."
"I note that the Green Group in the European Parliament supports the same amendment."
"I presume the rapporteur is in favour, since he has signed it, but I should like to know exactly what his position is."
"Thank you very much, Mr Oostlander."
"Am I to understand that the House gives its assent for this amendment to be put to the vote?"
"It appears so, but Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is asking for the floor."
"Mr President, I ask that the two parts of this amendment be put to the vote separately."
"On Amendment No 114"
"Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party asked for a split vote on this."
"I think now is the actual time to put this to you."
"Would you allow me to propose the split, or would you prefer to vote on the amendment first?"
"I think we might end up in serious trouble if we combine the two."
"This is not only an amendment which is extremely difficult to understand, I think it is also a very political amendment, because I assume that the Group of the European People's Party will vote against the first part of this text."
"In actual fact this means in relation to the compromise amendment, adopted in paragraph 3, that Slovakia will not be offered a pre-accession agreement."
"As rapporteur I am in any case against this."
"We are against concrete negotiations with this country, but we do not want to rule it out."
"Which is indeed why in my text I proposed to offer them a pre-accession agreement."
"If we leave this section out of paragraph 140, in relation to what has been adopted in paragraph 3, it will result in Slovakia not getting a pre-accession agreement. I am therefore against Mr Oostlander's proposal."
"Mr President, if this remains as it is, then it will only say that Slovakia, and none of the other countries, will be given a pre-accession agreement as we agreed."
"That is a bit odd, which is why I asked for it to be removed with regard to Slovakia as well."
"That is the issue."
"But I will be pleased to go along with your proposal."
"We will take a vote on the sections as you indicate."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I am extremely satisfied with the end result."
"I wonder whether you would give the Commissioner the opportunity to respond specifically to the strategy which we defined together, particularly as we would like to know how our discussions will be presented in the Commission."
"Mr President, we have been following this vote with great interest."
"It is obvious that this Parliament and the Commission agree in their judgment that the enlargement process is a historic challenge for the European Union, and that all relevant candidates need to feel involved in the enlargement process, and that no discrimination should be applied between them."
"This is also the view of the European Commission."
"Naturally, we will study the amendments adopted in detail, and we will discuss these matters at the summit in Luxembourg where the government leaders will ultimately have to give their opinion."
"But the message given by the adoption of the report with its amendments is, I think, a clear act of solidarity towards the countries which are presently preparing to join the European Union."
"Mr Colom i Naval would like to clarify something."
"Mr President, I should like to draw attention to a couple of small technical errors."
"Firstly, ever since 27 October I have been trying to get the last sentence of Paragraph 6 of the resolution to read ""...if appropriate reforms of the agricultural and structural policies are not realized or if the estimated rate of growth is not attained' ."
"The published text reads ""...and the estimated rate of growth is not attained' ."
"I do not know how this mistake got there, but it is not a translation error, because the text we voted on in committee was in Spanish, and said ""or' ."
"Secondly, I think there are quite a few problems with the English version, especially in paragraph 22."
"It has been suggested to me that the words ""only then' or ""then only' should be added to the end of the paragraph."
"I do not know."
"I am not the right person to sort it out, but I would like to request that this version is checked particularly carefully, because many of my British colleagues understand the text, having worked on it, but are not happy with the version they have seen."
"Lastly, the German version of Amendment No 26 is completely unrelated to the English text, which was the original version, or to the Spanish version I was given, or to the French version which I have also checked."
"This is a very sensitive issue, so if you will allow me, I would like to read it out, as best I can."
"The last sentence should say, in German: ' Befürwortet die Beibehaltung eines Kohäsionsfonds' ."
"That is very different from what the German version says at the moment, and that is how it should stand if the amendment is approved."
"I mention this because it was a compromise amendment, and the compromise was written in German and then translated into other languages."
"So that is the text which applies if it is adopted."
"On paragraph 15"
"Mr President, I have been asking for the floor for three minutes."
"You have begun the vote."
"Finish it now, I will ask for the floor afterwards."
"That makes three minutes I have been asking your assistants for the floor on paragraph 15."
"You have the floor, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"Mr President, when a group calls for a roll call vote, I would just be grateful if you would take that vote."
"It was on paragraph 15."
"It is in the voting list and you left it out."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, before we reached the original paragraph an amendment was passed which replaced it."
"So it was not in order to vote on an amendment to it."
"Mr President, first of all, the two amendments you refer to were rejected."
"Furthermore, an amendment adds an element to a text."
"The initial text may be poor, the amendment may be good."
"In that case, we vote for."
"If the original text is poor, we vote against, and we vote against the whole thing."
"If a roll call vote has been requested on an original text, it is still necessary to put the request to the vote."
"That is quite normal."
"Moreover, the two amendments involved were checked electronically and not by roll call."
"When a roll call is requested I think account must be taken of it, as you generally do for all the groups."
"No, I am sorry, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, that is not the case."
"We voted on Amendment No 9 from the Liberal Group, which was passed."
"We then voted against Amendment No 21."
"The text is therefore replaced by an amendment that was passed."
"You did not ask for a roll call vote on Amendment No 9, only on the text."
"So if the amendment is approved, you are left without the option of a roll call vote."
"You just have to ask for a vote on the amendments as well."
"It is up to you to do that, I cannot repeat a vote on a text which has been replaced, whether by roll call or not."
"It is impossible to do that, I am sorry."
"If you do not interpret the position in the same way, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure will take it up."
"That is a perfectly acceptable practice."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"The control of port states is a principle which is long overdue in the European macroregion."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that it is finally being taken seriously and as an effective control which, as the report puts it with incredible naivety, also guarantees ""actual adherence' to the ISM Code at least."
"It must be hoped that this too will become practice."
"We shall all, however, have to keep a careful eye on this so that it does not remain a mere hope."
"The report itself draws attention to a new problem which is already making itself clear: if the IMO and ISM Codes also have to be seriously applied in Europe then there could be tendencies to evade them!"
"On the other hand in the long term the only way the situation can be helped is firstly by developing a European policy into the worldwide regulatory institutions for maritime traffic, which aims at binding, socially and environmentally supportable, clear rules and secondly puts into effect our own European guidelines for the ecological safety and social supportability of sea traffic in this, the largest economic area in the world."
"In any case, the Bazin report takes some perceptible steps in that direction."
"We therefore support it, however convinced we may be that it remains necessary to proceed in a clear and precise manner."
"Oostlander and Barón Crespo report (A4-0368/97)"
"Madam President, when future historians come to judge our epoch, the chapter on the wall between east and west will be important."
"The question is whether we will call the chapter the fall of the wall or the moving of the wall."
"It is the fall of the wall which we are all happy about, but what we are in the middle of doing is moving the wall."
"Walls are now being built around 'Fortress Europe' . Throughout northern Africa the poor can remain in their poverty."
"We dump produce on their agricultural markets and cause hunger."
"We have barriers against the sale of their products."
"They do not get the necessary or possible help to help themselves."
"In central Europe we are moving the old wall from the border of Germany eastwards."
"The Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia could indeed be allowed in, in the year 2004, but for the poorest and most populous there are problems with our determination."
"In the Baltic we want to make the Bay of Finland into an EU sea by negotiating with Estonia with its 1.5 million inhabitants, but Latvia with 2.6 million and Lithuania with 3.7 million inhabitants must wait for better times."
"Divide and rule, that is the same logic of power which lay behind the old wall, but we now have the chance to create a whole and undivided Europe."
"The strong peace movements of the seventies and eighties did not manage to overcome the division of Europe."
"Nor did the hawks manage it with their military build-up and deterrence."
"It was the eastern Europeans themselves who knocked down the wall, and now we are trying to gather the fragments to put it up again."
"From the iron wall to the silver curtain."
"We must not be remembered for that."
"Europe must be open to everyone."
"We must create open, freer and more flexible European cooperation from which nobody is excluded."
"The name of our group is Europe of Nations."
"We want to have a Europe of All the Nations."
"Madam President, on behalf of the British Labour group of MEPs I would like to stress that we fully support the principle of enlargement and the greater part of the Oostlander-Barón Crespo report."
"However, by abstaining on the final vote we are making a statement that we feel that the final text is insufficiently clear on the question of differentiation."
"In our view, it would be better for the EU and applicant countries to be clear on the envisaged enlargement process."
"In these circumstances, absolute clarity is required and for that reason we believe that the five plus one option, with a reinforced accession strategy for all applicant states, is the right way forward."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize that we wish the enlargement process every success and look forward to the accession of all the applicant countries which fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"Madam President, in a referendum Austria rejected the use of nuclear power and our aim, shared by the Federal Government and all the parties represented in Parliament, is a nuclear-free central Europe."
"It was therefore natural - I hope for Austrian members - to vote for Amendment No 39."
"Madame President, Mr Bonde clearly wrote his explanation before the vote."
"Today was a great day for the Parliament, because the heaven and hell strategy of the Commission has foundered, namely the idea of raising five countries into heaven and banishing five to hell, although all ten - including the EU itself - belong in the purgatory of profound political and economic reforms."
"Therefore we have put on blinkers."
"We want a flexible procedure, because in these countries nobody knows how the weightings will change politically and economically in the year-long process of application for membership."
"There would be no point, as it were, in issuing reports at the beginning of the school year."
"That discourages those who get good grades and those who get bad grades: the one believes he already has the situation in his pocket; the other believes that there is no point in making any effort."
"We want a process of application for membership which is, as it were, open as far as the results are concerned and which includes all applicant countries."
"This is what Parliament today declared with a large majority to be the will of the European peoples, and I appeal to the governments to join them in this."
"We consider it important that all applicant countries are included in the enlargement process, regardless of their level of preparedness, and that all countries are measured on the same terms and are treated in an even way."
"Therefore a joint start to negotiations should be introduced with all of them at the same time."
"After multilateral ""acquis' negotiations, which could take a year, bilateral negotiations should be started with the countries which are then ready, probably the five plus one which the Commission has selected, but also other states if they are ready."
"The benefit of such a solution is that we do not rule out certain countries in advance, but instead encourage them to continue their ambitious efforts to be ready for membership."
"We have about ten years available to make a success of the European Union and become organized with some thirteen new Member States."
"So it is indispensable, as of now, to establish a precise strategy for this unprecedented enlargement."
"First of all, there is the emergence of new fissures between rich and poor countries and regions. There is also the dilution of the decisions of the European Union and its common policies."
"I support the broad thrust of the Oostlander-Barón Crespo report, especially when it emphasizes the need to plan institutional reform of the European Union rapidly, in advance of any new accession."
"On the other hand, as regards the timetable for opening negotiations, I am amongst those who think that it is necessary to spread the discussions over time, as a function of the degree of democratic and economic development of the candidates."
"Individual negotiations with each country would stimulate all the candidates, whatever their aptitude to attain Community standards."
"The enlargement would thus progress in a concrete way thanks to this dynamic, which would intensify the preparations and help the laggards reduce the gap."
"The simultaneous opening of accession negotiations, by contrast, seems to me risky because of the weight of the procedure."
"The least collapse in the negotiations would slow down the reforms already launched and would immobilize all the efforts of the candidates."
"So I will be voting for the Oostlander-Barón Crespo report, but definitely stressing the full importance of the accompanying and pre-accession measures."
"It is our duty to ensure that they are strengthened, and that our partners develop within the already existing European programmes."
"The time has come for our Parliament to take a position on the Commission communication ""Agenda 2000 - for a stronger and wider Union' ."
"First of all, we pay homage to the excellent work of the rapporteurs for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, who have highlighted the delicacy of the enlargement exercise."
"We want to enlarge our Community, certainly, but not at any price."
"We are already suffering as fifteen from the operational limits of our institutions."
"What will happen when we are twenty?"
"Europe must not abandon this challenge."
"Let us go forward with a strengthened pre-accession strategy. This should be expressed through a European conference of candidate states, the brainchild of Lionel Jospin."
"Similarly, we must extend our thinking on the guidelines for the enlargement."
"How to solve a difficult equation: keeping the own-resources ceiling and not touching the internal policies (CAP and structural funds)."
"It is true that the enlargement will necessitate concessions, but they must remain limited and be properly thought through."
"The Oostlander-Barón Crespo report, which the European Parliament has just devoted to the enlargement strategy proposed by the Commission in the Agenda 2000 programme, is about a politically indispensable change, but a descent into a financial impasse at the same time."
"It rejects the arbitrary pre-selection the Commission has suggested applying to the eastern candidate countries, and by contrast demands, with only a few nuances, that all the candidates should participate in the enlargement process from the outset."
"We think this position is politically justified, because we cannot risk marginalizing a section of our neighbours in the east right at the start, when it is clear that they will have to join us some day."
"In passing, there is an innovation here: the European Parliament is dissociating itself from the Commission and correcting an exaggeratedly technocratic proposal."
"May it do so again, and frequently!"
"Regrettably, this correct political position is also followed up by unfortunate financial proposals: the report proposes introducing a revision clause to uprate expenditure and Community resources, if the ceiling of 1.27 % of GDP proves insufficient."
"Now this will obviously be the case if there is stubborn insistence on rapid and egalitarian economic and political integration of the eastern countries into the economy and institutions of the Union."
"Some speakers, sensing the danger, have ventured to suggest that, to make the enlargement a success, the European project needs to be changed to seek political union before economic uniformity."
"This idea demonstrates progress in the right direction, but insufficient in our view."
"In fact, what do the fine words ""political union' signify?"
"The expression bears every interpretation, including European super-state, and the ""federal perspective' of the existing Union, as in paragraph 35 which this House has specifically just voted for."
"Now, we reject any definition of political union which would end up letting the concept of ""integration' - which partisans of a Europe of nations obviously do not want - back in through the back door."
"We particularly reject the haughty, indeed scornful, approach adopted by the Oostlander-Barón Crespo report, of demanding that the eastern countries adopt our rules and cease to be themselves if they want to join the Union."
"Is not the European Parliament demanding of Estonia in paragraph 96 of the resolution, that it should ""fully extend... citizenship to members of minority groups' ?"
"And that is just one example amongst others."
"What business is it of ours?"
"Our concept of the Union is very different."
"As our colleague, Mr Souchet, put it so excellently yesterday evening, on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group, Europeans have been going down blind alleys for ten years because they conceive of the Union as a monolith."
"We could have made much faster progress in cooperation with the east before the fall of the Berlin wall if we had accepted the idea of a variable geometry Europe from the start. That would have made it possible to establish different levels of cooperation in the most urgent fields immediately, encompassed within a wider and not necessarily constraining circle, which would have been called the European Union."
"Then we could have gone forward in a flexible way, without excluding anyone or putting pressure on anyone."
"But obviously this strategy would have assumed that a margin of manoeuvre was recognized to the nations, hence a sovereignty inside the Union, which the gurus of federalism could not accept."
"However, we also record positive developments today, showing that all is not lost: in particular, the Commission and the Council have just taken a step in the direction of variable geometry, by accepting the idea of a European conference able to provide a forum of discussion and an area of intergovernmental cooperation between the countries of the Union and the candidate countries."
"Unfortunately, this good idea risks being compromised by the initiative of France, which has meant the inclusion of Turkey in the conference, thus reducing the margin of possible discussion within this circle."
"Will we be forced to set up a second conference without Turkey?"
"SDP Members will vote in favour of the Oostlander-Barón Crespo report, in accordance with their position which in principle is in favour of the enlargement of the European Union to include those European states which meet the necessary political, economic and social conditions."
"We wish to emphasize that this enlargement must not, however, jeopardize the balance we have spent so much effort in achieving throughout the history of the building of Europe."
"Balance between policies - the internal market and economic and social cohesion - balance in our budgets and, most of all, balance between institutions in the European decision-taking process."
"So far as the evolution of our institutions is concerned, we think we must move forward gradually, as provided in the Amsterdam Treaty, fully observing the principle of equality between Member States."
"The SDP places equal importance on the clarity of this report in making the acceptance of new Member States absolutely conditional upon their respect for democracy and individual freedom."
"We therefore consider that Slovakia is not at present in the same position as the other candidates."
"We believe there is general agreement between all the political groups in the European Parliament and all the countries of the European Union that Cyprus is eligible for full membership of the Union."
"Cyprus is capable of adopting the acquis communautaire, integrating into the economic and monetary union and participating in our common external defence and security policy and thus all the requirements for Cyprus to join are fulfilled and her application deserves to be accepted."
"The problem of the forced division of Cyprus into two communities could certainly find the beginnings of a solution if Cyprus were to join the European Union, and so provide Turkey with the motivation to resolve this and other issues with a view to better relations with our Union."
"For these fundamental reasons we support Cyprus's application to be admitted to the European Union and elect to deal with the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as sole negotiator at the forthcoming talks, which is the United Nations position."
"We in the Swedish Left Party have chosen to abstain from the final vote."
"We are doing so because we do not share a number of the conclusions drawn in the report."
"Our fundamental position on the enlargement of the EU is that the Union should welcome European states which fulfill the requirements of democracy, and in which the majority of the population have shown through a democratic process that they want to be part of the Union."
"In cases where the countries concerned not choose not to accede to the EU, the Union must contribute to other forms of European cooperation."
"It is important to recognize that many countries in eastern Europe today are not candidates for membership of the EU."
"Pan-European cooperation between independent states throughout Europe is therefore the most important thing for Europe's future."
"We have voted against several paragraphs in the report."
"We do not believe enlargement can be made conditional on new centralistic institutional reforms."
"On the contrary, we think that increased centralization, a common defence policy and EMU are obstacles to cooperation between several of Europe's countries."
"We are not prepared to increase costs in the EU's budget."
"Instead there is a need for real cutbacks and reforms in regional and agricultural aid."
"We therefore also reject the demand for long phasing-in periods into the EU's agricultural policy."
"Membership for the new countries must not be a second-class with poorer terms than for other members."
"Nor can we accept the almost total demand for one-sided adaptation to the EU's single market and its set of rules."
"A future enlargement must instead be characterized by respect for the applicant countries and their circumstances."
"We have abstained from voting, even though in some respects the European Parliament's decision represents an improvement compared with the Committee's and particularly the Commission's line."
"The compromise with regard to paragraph 3 made during the previous sitting without members having access to the text is both Parliamentarily questionable and unclear."
"We would have preferred the Committee's clearer recommendation for a joint start to negotiations."
"But above all we cannot accept a new treaty amendment aimed at taking a further step on the road towards a 'federal state' being made an absolute condition for entry for any new Member State."
"We think new Member States should be given a say in the development of the EU."
"We agree to the Amendment No 97 relating to point 85 of the Oostlander report."
"The question of the transitional period depends directly on the point in time when the membership treaties come into force; since this at the moment cannot be estimated it is difficult at this point in time to lay down fixed transitional periods."
"The first part of the sentence deleted in the amendment relating to the time and financing plans appears to be sensible."
"The signatories have frequently requested that the applicants for membership submit plans and programmes in which precise time schemes and goals for the bringing into force of the individual items of legislation are indicated."
"We should consider that the demand for a very rapid acceptance of the whole acquis could also result in the fact that applicant countries commit themselves to something which they cannot then carry out or that the environment is used as an excuse to postpone the entire eastward enlargement of the EU."
"Another point against the naming of too short a period of time is the fact that the financial resources made available by the EU together with those which are available in the relevant states themselves, are limited and the demand for a short time scheme could result in the demand for more money."
"Since we have agreed to considerations 0 to Q, we do not wish to allow the wording of consideration 0 - concerning Slovakia, to pass without comment."
"It was in fact the last session of the joint parliamentary committee with Slovakia which showed that concrete steps were being introduced in order to take greater account of the political criteria for a subsequent membership of the EU."
"Even if we are furthermore of the opinion that the Copenhagen Criteria must continue to be the focal point of the Slovak efforts, we would nevertheless like to plead, on the basis of the recommendations of the joint committee for the Slovak Republic to participate fully in the current discussions about the enlargement of the Union."
"Slovakia has made intensive efforts in order to enter the European Union."
"We must therefore for our part work in future to create the necessary conditions for the achievement of this important goal."
"Today the Danish Social Democrats voted yes to the report on 'Agenda 2000 - for a stronger and wider Union' ."
"We did so in view of the fact that the report stresses that all applicant countries should be included in the enlargement negotiations."
"The report distances itself from the Commission's proposal that only five plus one countries should start negotiations for accession to the European Union."
"This is important from the point of view of the Danish Social Democrats, because we believe it is very important to send a signal to all the applicant countries that they have the possibility of joining the Union."
"However, the report on 'Agenda 2000 - for a stronger and wider Union' poses problems in some areas."
"It was therefore necessary to vote against some paragraphs in the report."
"The report makes institutional reforms a condition for allowing enlargement to begin."
"We think that is regrettable, because the European Parliament should not put obstacles in the way of enlargement."
"I cannot vote for the Oostlander and Barón Crespo report, in spite of the fact that the report formally recommends that accession negotiations be started with all applicant countries at the same time."
"That is a recommendation which I can fully support, even though I would always recommend to the countries of central and eastern Europe and their populations, for their own sake, not to become members of the EU."
"In reality the report merely reproduces the Commission's current attitude to the demands on the central and eastern European countries."
"Recommendation R says there will be no opportunity for opt-outs or derogations with regard to the treaty for the countries of central and eastern Europe."
"Seen together with the opinions in paragraph 5, this confirms that the countries of central and eastern Europe will not be allowed any negotiating room to obtain, for example, economic derogations to make the path to EU membership easier."
"These opinions show not only the economic and political arrogance which characterizes the EU's relationship with central and eastern Europe, but also that political EU integration itself takes priority over consideration for central and eastern Europe."
"For these reasons I cannot support the report."
"The best thing would have been to start negotiations with all the applicant countries at the same time without any reservations or division into groups."
"That would give all the applicant countries the same opportunities."
"The Commission's proposal of a division into an A team and a B team creates new walls between the applicant countries in the Baltic for example, and makes the enlargement process more difficult."
"Enlargement is important for the creation of a pan-European cooperation in which there will be more emphasis on cooperation between independent states than on the building of a union."
"The committee's proposal is very close to the ideal, and so I voted yes to the report."
"I also supported the proposal for a European Conference for all the applicant countries including Slovakia and Turkey."
"However, I cannot support the demand for another Intergovernmental Conference before enlargement can begin."
"We have always voted in favour of enlargement."
"We have gone even further and rejected the hypocrisy of some supporters of enlargement and the deviousness of others whose motivation was either that it opened up more markets for them or that it would make political union harder to achieve."
"We have gone further, because we have always stressed the moral aspect of enlargement, because it is the consolidation of democracy in those countries that is at stake - one of Europe's greatest treasures, and one for which their peoples had been longing for decades."
"But we do not want enlargement on any terms, regardless of its nature, nor do we accept the high and mighty attitude the European Union has been deliberately adopting."
"In our view, there should be at least three criteria for enlargement."
"In the first place, the first consideration must be political: the pre-adhesion negotiations must be founded on the great European principles from the outset."
"Secondly, nothing will be achieved if for any reason, and that obviously includes budgetary considerations, the economic and social cohesion process currently taking place among the existing fifteen Member States is impaired, however slightly."
"Thirdly, and contrary to the Commission's proposal, no particular country should be favoured when negotiations commence."
"The lottery in which we are all about to be involved is quite bad enough, without turning it into a kind of Russian roulette!"
"Finally, the condescending attitude of the European Union."
"Rather than presuming to lecture peoples who may perhaps have something they can teach us, or at least help us to learn, about how to overcome certain difficulties, we would do better to examine ourselves a little and, before we try to impose our will at all costs, make a determined effort to resolve the problems we say only other people have."
"In conclusion: we say yes to enlargement, but not regardless of the price!"
"At least let us be a little bit realistic..."
"The Cold War is over and the EU has a unique historic opportunity to be able to bring together a Europe, which has too often been the setting for bloody and destructive wars."
"There is therefore no doubt that the European Union should take the necessary steps to unite central and eastern Europe with the EU."
"During the accession negotiations the applicant countries should be treated as full and equal partners."
"That creates trust and will encourage greater responsibility with regard to the EU's democratic and humanitarian ideals in the future Member States."
"All the applicant countries should therefore have the right to initiate negotiations for accession to the Union at the same time and the negotiations should begin at the same time."
"The length of the negotiations may vary according to the ability of the individual countries to adopt the acquis communautaire and according to their ability to develop competitive market economies, stable institutions which guarantee the rule of law, democracy, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities."
"Before the admission of the new countries the EU should initiate an institutional reform which can ensure that an EU with 25 countries can also function properly and effectively."
"It should also be stressed that great weight should be given to EU rules in the area of the environment, and the length of the transition period for the future Member States should be reduced further."
"However, all in all we must express great satisfaction both with the Parliament's report and the Commission's Agenda 2000."
"Under cover of an essential matter, the enlargement, and because the Commission did not want to approach it in the only reasonable way, that of a variable geometry Europe, it is the agriculture of the European Union of the fifteen Member States which must, if these proposals are followed, be the real financial contributor to the enlargement."
"In its communication, Agenda 2000, commonly called the Santer Package, the Commission quite simply fails to start by defining a European agriculture model, as opposed to the American model or that of the Cairns Group of countries."
"It uses a certain number of artifices in order to try to push through a complete reform of the CAP, indirectly and as smoothly as possible, even before the next round of WTO negotiations starts in 1999."
"What are these artifices?"
"First it proposes six objectives for the future CAP, which we cannot but approve of."
"Unfortunately, when we move from principles to means, we see that the means proposed by the Commission contradict the principles is has itself established."
"So, while the Commission pretends to be promoting an environmental agriculture, it wants to lower the price of beef and ""overlooks' compensation for production of grass-fed milking cows."
"Then, the Commission is pretending to compensate for the low prices it is proposing for the period 2000-2006, but our studies show that in reality the compensation will far from balance the programmed fall in prices. Certain sectors of agriculture will lose up to 50 % of their income and, in general, European agriculture will lose some ECU 20.5 billion, or more than 20 % of its net added value for the year 1996."
"This loss of income threatens to strangle the farms which will be subjected to this major, and sometimes brutal, drop in income."
"Furthermore, and in an underhand way, the Commission proposes setting a ceiling on aid per farm."
"European farmers will therefore have to use legal devices to continue to live, or rather to survive, off their labour."
"For our part, we put one simple question. Why not consider setting a ceiling on aid per working person instead, so that only real farmers can benefit from European aid and so as to develop employment in agriculture and in the countryside?"
"Why has this option not been examined by the Commission?"
"In conclusion, we want a proper agricultural policy, that is, a policy which links products closely to the land where they are produced, and not an agriculture which is exclusively a provider of raw materials, produced anywhere provided that it is at least cost, determined exclusively on the world market, so that production is fatally subject to the process of relocation."
"The link to the land and Community preference constitute two essential features of what ought to be a European agricultural model."
"The resolution we have just examined should have been the occasion for this Parliament to send a strong and clear message to our partners in central and eastern Europe."
"But we are sending them a confused text, a legal and political hotchpotch, which, and this will certainly be its only quality, will give them a glimpse of what the European Union has become today: an obese and impotent supranational entity which does not have the strength to make use of the prerogatives it squeezes out of its Member States and which abandons itself to the delights of empty legal nit-picking."
"If the CEECs want to enter the Union, it is because that entry signifies for them a definitive break with the parentheses of fifty years of communist domination."
"It also signifies entry into an area of joint prosperity and the prospect of unlimited finance for the structural reforms they hope to intensify."
"But if, as the resolution we have just adopted recalls, the Commission and Parliament want lengthy debate, full participation of the populations in the process of enlargement, they run the risk, unless propaganda steals a march on information, that the populations of the candidate countries will discover the real face of the way the European Union operates."
"The Community's ""what is mine I hold; what is yours we discuss' negotiations threaten to bring back painful memories for them."
"Have the candidates really taken the measure of the delegation of sovereignty they will have to agree to?"
"Have they understood the nature of the institutional reform which the European Parliament is hoping for and calling for?"
"Have they understood that they must subscribe to a federal union, in advance and without discussion?"
"I am very much afraid they have not."
"Under the circumstances, the enlargement being prepared for us will be a fool's game."
"Colom i Naval report (A4-0331/97)"
"The scenario for the financial perspectives presented by the Commission in the Agenda 2000 programme at least has the merit of demonstrating that, keeping the policies constant, equilibrium is, in the end, impossible."
"In fact we see two major contradictions."
"First, on the single currency."
"We are told that it is absolutely imperative to preserve the 1.27 % of GDP ceiling for Community contributions, in order not to compromise the efforts of the states to satisfy the convergence criteria."
"But at the same time, we know very well that, in the present situation, the single currency will not be able to hold without greater inter-regional redistribution at European level, hence without higher Community contributions than today."
"To summarize: the success of the euro requires both Community contributions with a ceiling to contain the deficits, and increased Community contributions to oil the system."
"Where does the solution lie?"
"In our opinion, in postponing the euro."
"Second contradiction, on the enlargement."
"In Agenda 2000, we are presented with the prospect of an enlargement where the new arrivals will fairly rapidly attain a level of economic and political integration allowing them to participate on an equal footing in the mechanisms of a monolithic European Union."
"To support this demonstration, the Commission is obliged to put rather unrealistic growth hypotheses and reduce the benefits to agricultural policy and structural actions to the detriment of the existing fifteen members of the Union, in order to free up the margins for subsidies to the eastern countries."
"Even so, the exercise is proving impossible."
"The Commission is not succeeding in freeing up the ECU 76 billion of subsidies over eight years, while, by comparison, an effort comparable to that made by Germany for the eastern Länder would have required ECU 3, 400 billion."
"Consequently, the model for integrating the eastern countries into a standardized Europe and bringing them up to the level by dint of subsidies, as espoused for Agenda 2000, is colliding with the restrictions on our resources."
"The only solution, here too, is to reconsider this model, and I go into more detail on this in my explanation of vote on the Oostlander report."
"Madam President, the ambition of the Agenda 2000 proposals is to remodel the face of the political structure of Europe."
"While we agree with the principle of concentration of objectives out of concern for greater efficiency, we are, on the other hand, very worried by this new formula objective 2 project the Commission has pulled out of its hat."
"What do we find?"
"A huge cauldron containing urban issues, industrial zones, rural areas and maritime facades, all pell-mell."
"Should the European Union intervene everywhere and in everything, giving in to moralizing and demagoguery and as a result dispersing the aid highly inefficiently at the very time when we are rightly considering how that aid should be concentrated?"
"There are two eminently contradictory approaches here."
"And it is much to be feared that rural development is the main victim of this very indigestible cuisine."
"At the risk of repeating ourselves, we reaffirm our will to see this new objective 2 at least include a specific and independent sub-objective entitled ""rural areas' and another called ""maritime zones' , with, for rural policy, a programming period equal to that of the CAP."
"For our group, European aid should, as a priority, go to regions which are becoming depopulated, rather than those where a process of overpopulation has been in operation for some time."
"If we really mean to embark on an ambitious policy for employment and the environment, a better territorial balance is needed first."
"As we cannot currently find a satisfying response to our expectations in the Agenda 2000 proposals, we are obliged to condemn its existing content."
"Paragraph 13 of the report says the Union's financing as things now stand is not considered suitable 'to ensure that the European tax burden is fairly distributed.'"
"We do not, of course, have anything against a fair tax burden, but the question is what form this shall actually take."
"Our position is, firstly, that the ceiling of 1.27 % of GDP should remain, and, secondly, that Sweden's net contribution should not be allowed to increase under any circumstances."
"Concrete proposals concerning this issue are, of course, always welcome, but our starting point is clear: Sweden, as the largest net contributor per person within the European Union, should not pay a higher membership fee in future."
"We also distance ourselves from paragraph 18 of the report on keeping unused funds in a special reserve fund."
"We believe unused funds should without question be repaid to the Member States."
"Members of the Social Democratic Party will vote in favour of the Colom i Naval report because it presents a politically balanced and technically correct view of Agenda 2000."
"It is certainly unrealistic to place an upper limit of 1.27 % of GDP on the budget for 2000 to 2006 from the start, when we do not know how many new Member States will be joining the European Union, when the adhesion process will be completed, what sort of reforms will be made to the Union's internal and external policies - particularly the CAP - and how radical those reforms will be, and what growth rate European GNP will achieve."
"As the rapporteur says, the Commission's proposals were based on extremely tenuous premises, for no-one can foresee the real effects of the introduction of the euro, the new round of negotiations within the World Trade Organization - especially in the agricultural sector - and, more generally, the combination of accelerating technological change and the globalization of the economy."
"This report attempts to introduce ways of making reviews of financial perspectives more flexible - on both the income side and the spending side -and we may need those reviews in order to make enlargement viable without jeopardizing our present policies, particularly those relating to economic and social cohesion."
"What the SDP finds unacceptable in the Commission's document (Agenda 2000) is that, apart from the uncertainties mentioned above, the burden of enlargement is placed on those States of the Union which have the lowest development rates."
"We are in favour of enlargement."
"But we do not agree that it should basically be financed out of money at present allocated to the structural funds."
"In presenting Agenda 2000 the Commission expressed its intention to offer a clear and coherent vision for the European Union as it enters the new millennium."
"In order to assess whether or not these expectations can be fulfilled it is important to ask searching questions in relation to the proposed financial perspective."
"In opting for maintaining the 1.27 % of GNP guideline there are doubts whether or not the Commission's proposals will be sufficient to meet the ambitious challenges it details in the Agenda 2000 document."
"Enlargement has significant financial implications."
"Does the financial perspective provide sufficient resources to implement it?"
"Given the fact that fundamental reforms of CAP and the structural funds are also proposed, are we allocating sufficient funding to the key policy areas."
"Also, what will be the implications for the EU budget if Germany, Holland and Sweden are successful in obtaining reduction for their contributions to the budget."
"These are all fundamental questions which require answers."
"Obviously from an Irish point of view I will be fighting hard to ensure that there is no abrupt end to the allocation of structural funding as promised by the Commission."
"In view of the inevitable ending of our objective 1 status it is imperative that there is an 'objective 1 in transition'' status."
"Furthermore, given the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy it is essential that adequate resources are available for the compensation measures proposed under CAP reform."
"However, despite raising these questions about the financial perspective, I totally support enlargement and strongly believe that our approach should not be based on pessimism or narrow selfish national interest."
"Whatever the cost of enlargement we must recognize the benefits of bringing many millions of new consumers into the EU market."
"Furthermore the economic and political stabilization of central and eastern Europe will have a positive impact on the economy of the European Union."
"There is far more to be gained than lost both philosophically and economically from enlargement and for these reasons we should enthusiastically support it."
"We have abstained from the vote on the report because we do not want to pave the way for a further increase in the EU's total budget, partly for reasons of principle, but also because we fear that new resources for the EU, even if they are intended to support central and eastern Europe, will be taken from aid for developing countries from the Member States."
"Today the Danish Social Democrats voted yes to the report on 'Agenda 2000 - the Union's future financing.'"
"We agree that reforms of the common agricultural policy and structural policy are necessary for a sensible enlargement."
"However, the report on Agenda 2000 poses problems in some areas."
"It was necessary to vote against some paragraphs."
"From our point of view it is very regrettable that the European Parliament wants to try to put obstacles in the way of enlargement by demanding that all institutional reforms should be in place before enlargement begins."
"Furthermore we are concerned by the Commission's proposal for the division of funds between the applicant countries in the first and second rounds of the enlargement process."
"We believe the fact that countries in the second negotiating round will receive only around a third of the allocated funds sends an adverse political signal to these countries."
"Our reason is that this will make these countries feel their chance of being admitted in the near future is substantially reduced."
"It is important to provide these countries with a continued incentive to prepare for a future admission to the European Union."
"The report goes further than the Commission on the question of the ceiling on taxation and can conceive of a taxation in excess of 1.27 % of GDP."
"Alternative methods of financing are also being considered, i.e. new ways of providing the EU with funds."
"The Committee mentions a more direct connection between the taxpayers and EU institutions - a more definite EU tax."
"Such a development of the Union would be moving in the wrong direction."
"I have therefore voted no to the report."
"My group has made it clear in its declaration that it is voting in support of Mr Colom i Naval's report, not accepting that the limit of 1.27 % of GDP for the Community budget is 'untouchable' , when there is no reliable assessment of the needs we shall have to face at this historic time, nor that the funds to be distributed should only be drawn from Category 2, that is to say, they should only be taken away from the present beneficiaries of structural funding; from regions which, like Portugal, still have enormous deficits and whose per capita GDP is less than half the Community average."
"I would add that if we were to sacrifice our structural policies we should be sacrificing policies of major benefit, with an enlargement of the market which will eventually benefit the Community as a whole."
"Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of a policy like the CAP, whose distortions and injustices would actually be made worse under the present terms of Agenda 2000."
"Finally, although I agree with the thoughts he has expressed, I think the rapporteur should have gone further, emphasizing the positive indications of the Maastricht Treaty and Agenda 2000 by doing away with the regressive aspect of internal resources, e.g. by a system based entirely on GNP contributions."
"The experience of the admissions of Greece, Spain and Portugal into the Community and of Germany's reunification have shown that such accessions pose problems and can demand greater economic sacrifices than people are initially able to assess."
"The report recognizes these difficulties, and the Committee on Budgets cautions the Commission against being too optimistic in its assessment of the current ceiling on own resources of 1.27 % of GDP."
"The report also points out that the time has come for a thorough analysis and perhaps a change in the way in which the Union is financed."
"I quite agree with the Committee in those views."
"It is too early to say that the ceiling for own resources is untouchable when we are facing the admission of 100 million new EU citizens who will increase the total GDP by only 5 %."
"But it is our duty and it is in our own interests to have the new countries admitted as quickly as possible."
"It might be more expensive than the Commission initially expects, but our shoulders must be broad enough to carry the burden."
"I am therefore glad to be able to give the report my full support."
"Third stage of EMU"
"The next item is the report (A4-0378/97) by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on Economic Policy Coordination in Stage 3 of EMU: Common Ground and Ways Forward (II/523/97 - C4-0574/97)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured to present this report on economic policy coordination in Stage 3 of EMU - in other words, the policy which constitutes the basis of the euro. This report has an undeniable importance at this moment in time, since it establishes the position of the European Parliament with regard to the new dimension which the European economy will attain with the creation of economic and monetary union, and the euro."
"This new situation represents a qualitative change of great importance for the consolidation and creation of the economic and monetary dimension required by a genuine economic and monetary policy of the scale of EMU."
"The guidelines we are presenting are not nearly as extensive as those which would be arrived at using a more polished theoretical model."
"However, we are not presenting the ideal choices here, but possible choices, based on what was established in the treaties, Regulations 1466/97 and 1467/97 (on surveillance and coordination of economic and monetary policies and excessive deficits) and the stability pact, to which has been added the recommendation of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, incorporating what was established in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the conclusions of the Luxembourg summit on employment."
"This report is based on three fundamental points."
"The first is an ever-increasing coordination between European policies, which is vital for the cohesion and stability of the European Union."
"The second point is that this coordination has three aspects: to establish the basis of a coherent and effective economic policy at European Union level; to ensure political debate on the various economic choices; and to improve the decision-making process to ensure effectiveness and transparency."
"The third point is that the Member States should adapt to the process of multilateral surveillance and to a better coordination of their economic policies, in accordance with the aforementioned Regulation 1466/97."
"As regards the first point, it is clear that there has been efficient economic convergence, leading to economic and monetary union being created on a wide and solid foundation."
"This situation should be reinforced by the establishment of a balanced approach to economic policy, so that the economic dimension can be consistent with the monetary dimension, bearing in mind the economic and monetary objectives based on instruments to guarantee employment and development within a framework of monetary stability and solvency."
"We call for the Commission to participate in the analysis of potential negative effects which might arise due to adverse situations developing in certain Member States, or as a result of asymmetric shocks among those joining EMU."
"We need to guarantee a basis founded on social consensus and democratic supervision."
"Therefore, we propose applying article 118 of the Maastricht Treaty - dealing with social dialogue at the European level - and setting up an annual conference, involving the economic and social partners, encompassing the recommendation of our colleague Mr Fourçans in his report, approved by this House, on the establishment of a committee of economic experts within the European Parliament."
"The proposals about guaranteeing transparency in the decision-making process, about the participation of the Economic and Financial Committee and Parliament (according to articles 103, 104C and 109C of the treaty) and about article 103.5 on derived legislation are all very important."
"Lastly, Madam President, I should like to draw attention to Amendment No 5, presented by myself on behalf of my group, and to Amendment No 4 by Mr Donnelly on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, concerning the possible creation of a committee or group - the so-called Euro Council - to be composed of those Member States which join EMU, to adhere to and implement the stability pact."
"Given the importance such a project would assume, if it were to happen, I think it is essential to ensure that the European Commission is included in it, as I hope our amendment makes clear. This would mean that it would cease to be strictly intergovernmental in nature."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions we have addressed in this report, which was approved unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, will be discussed in the forthcoming European Council summit in Luxembourg."
"It is important for this report to be approved, and for the Council to take more notice of our proposals, to ensure that the European institutions - the Commission and Parliament - can play a greater role, and to guarantee the new dimension for economic and monetary policy, reinforced by democratic supervision, social dialogue and improved, transparent procedures."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in our turn we support the broad lines of the Gasòliba I Böhm report."
"We are in fact completely in agreement with the oft-expressed need to coordinate economic policies better once monetary union is achieved."
"As regards the question of the Euro Council, I agree with Mr Donnelly when he calls for this body to be a Community body, that is, a body in which the Commission and, in an advisory capacity, Parliament can intervene."
"But when it comes to the delicate matter of who takes the decisions inside the Council, the facts must be considered: countries cannot be in and out at the same time, as is the case today."
"I would mention that the Ecofin Council was deadlocked for eight hours on this debate, because certain countries had decided - and some of them, like Sweden, without having the right - not to participate in monetary union, but, today, they accuse the others of wanting to carve Europe up because they themselves would not be able to be involved in managing that monetary union."
"This is intolerable and unacceptable."
"It proves that there is indeed a danger in wanting to make countries participate in Europe when they do not share either the objectives or the methods."
"This is an absolutely concrete illustration of these contradictions."
"So I agree with Mr Donnelly in saying that this arrangement cannot be purely informal and intergovernmental, and that is the response to the discussion which has taken place in the Ecofin Council, but furthermore I do not support those who say that everyone should participate in this Ecofin Council when it makes decisions on issues of monetary union."
"As regards relations with the national parliaments, I want to distance myself from what Mr Donnelly has just said."
"Much as I agree with the national parliaments discussing these issues with their governments and ensuring that the proposals the governments accept in the councils of ministers are fully, democratically and transparently debated. There must be no confusion of powers."
"Once an independent European monetary power exists, run by an independent bank, the latter only has to be accountable to European public opinion, and not to the national parliaments."
"It is to this Parliament that the members of the central bank, the governor of the central bank or the members of the board of directors, must come to give account of themselves."
"If it is necessary to ensure that the policies are also accepted in the Member States, these problems must be dealt with at the level of the national parliaments, with their national governments."
"But countries cannot insist, as some do, that the governor of the central bank can and should explain himself before the national parliaments."
"That would force the unfortunate man to tour round 25 capitals when we enlarge to that size, which is ridiculous and impossible."
"For the rest, Madam President, I would like to conclude by saying that, on the general economic guidelines, it is clear that after the Luxembourg summit, general economic policies must, of course, incorporate the unemployment/employment dimension."
"Everyone agrees on that."
"On that point, it is important not to confuse everything again and lump everything together."
"The employment policies must be coordinated with the monetary policies. They are not to be confused with them."
"They must not interfere with or undermine the independence of the central bank."
"Madam President, it is evident that the internal market will take on a new dimension with economic and monetary union and the euro."
"The European Union should finally have a real dimension."
"This new situation, and we are in agreement with the rapporteur, presupposes real democratic control and an important role for this Parliament."
"With regard to economic policy instruments, it is advisable to determine the orientative targets and gradually incorporate the Community economic policies linked to the internal market and take full account, given the extraordinary summit in Luxembourg on employment, of objectives laid down when the guidelines for employment are drawn up."
"Our group also considers that certain questions remain to be solved."
"For example, the difficult question of representation of the economic and monetary union and the euro in the international institutions."
"For example, what should, or should not be, the role of the European Commission with regard to this external representation on monetary affairs."
"I note that this point remained open after the Ecofin Council meeting on December 1."
"Finally, there is the question of what position, official or more flexible, the consultative authority will adopt towards the countries in the first wave - the X-Council, the representatives of 'in' countries."
"The point taken by the Luxembourg Presidency on December 2 in the economic committee has our agreement."
"We must be aware that the eleven 'in' countries can eventually accept, according to terms which remain to be defined, to inform their 'out' partners."
"Mr Waigel recently mentioned one cannot at the same time be 'in' and 'out' , outside the euro zone and inside the X-Council."
"If no agreement achievement can be reached on this aspect, it seems to us that the conclusions of the next Luxembourg summit will take account of the wishes of the eleven to meet informally to discuss the instruments to be mastered to achieve balance given the newly created situation."
"It is clear that the 'out' countries on their own wish cannot stop it and we all have an interest in finding an agreement on this very sensitive point."
"Madam President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party naturally - and this will surprise no-one - supports the report by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm."
"It is an entirely balanced whole demonstrating that the third stage of monetary union, with an independent central bank, there is not necessarily weightlessness of the monetary institution, but necessary dialogue between the monetary power and the political authorities which must exercise economic responsibilities."
"Naturally, as in any key set of problems, the question arises as to the institutional form of this dialogue, with all the difficulties that Mr Herman has raised, especially the issue of how countries which do not participate in a policy can be involved in debating or even deflecting it."
"What has to be recognized, Madam President, is that the countries which are not going to participate in this policy, at least initially, will still suffer the consequences, hence the need for flexible formulae."
"I also think that opinion will take responsibility for dealing with the rather stiff incongruities we are tempted to build in at the start."
"Because if the euro is successful, and nobody doubts, not now in any case, that it will be established, perhaps we should think about accelerating the processes, and particularly, because the material difficulties seem increasingly obvious, about reducing the period 1999-2002, that is, the wait for the euro in everyday life."
"While the big bang scenario was not to be recommended when the euro was still uncertain, once the euro is established it may be necessary, around the year 2000, to try to accelerate the process to reduce the kind of monetary schizophrenia we risk experiencing in everyday life when one party to a contract will be talking euro and the other, national currency."
"Anyway, the success of the euro will certainly have a snowball effect, and contrary to Gresham's law, good money will no doubt drive out bad."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Member States have very different social and economic structures and characteristics; they also have varying levels of economic growth; and they are passing through individual cultural stages as a result of the historical processes that have shaped them."
"This means that since the European Union is in many ways a heterogeneous area, a mosaic of different pieces, and since we have adopted policy dynamics that aggravate inequality, deepen differences and can deal unequal and ever greater blows, what we really need is to coordinate our internal economic policy, but that coordination must be founded on different responses and on appropriate instruments and structures."
"Coordination must be based on co-operation between differing countries, and not on their being forced into a single mould."
"Mr Gasòliba i Böhm's report has some interesting and thought-provoking aspects to it, but it has not freed itself from the strait-jacket of liberal thinking, the all-or-nothing approach of the financier, the monetarist, the theorist."
"And I would remind him that his report has not been approved unanimously, as he has said here."
"After the internal market - or rather the implementation of the aspect of the internal market which relates to the free circulation of capital - the single currency is presented as the logical and inevitable outcome of a chain of decisions."
"It is even said that without a single currency the internal market will not be complete - it will not be 'single' ."
"Although the single currency is an instrument, however, an unequal instrument will not create equality, a retrograde instrument will not aid progress, and an instrument with no real objective capacity for competitiveness will not make anyone competitive."
"And after the internal market, the single currency, the single central bank, our harmonizing intentions confuse the coordination of policies with a single policy, a single form of economic government, a single state or a federal state, or no state at all but a Euro Council ."
"Apart from refusing to accept that this way of thinking, this direction is the only possible one, that the steps along that road can be treated as a foregone conclusion before they become a reality and are accepted by the people, apart from all this we support a different principle, the reverse of the one we have just described. Our concern is not merely to avoid or set aside anything that might be detrimental to the implementation and functioning of monetary union."
"We do support an outlook that stresses the social consequences of adopting policies of dismantling instruments for the sake of the organization."
"Our amendments are intended to make our opinion the subject of another report in this Parliament, and of a resolution of this Parliament. Despite the fact that we do not share the predominant view, we are not intimidated, even when claims of unanimity are made when there are opposing votes and abstentions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome you to this extended sitting of the coordinators of the economic committee and the shadow rapporteurs."
"The future of our national economies is too important to us all for us simply to leave them to the dictates of the financial markets."
"Therefore Mr Gasòliba i Böhm raised several important questions and has also found quite well considered answers with which we can proceed but that is not sufficient."
"If Mr Gasòliba i Böhm says here that we would or could not implement here a theoretically perfect model then he is of course right but the introduction of the euro simply sets conditions and requirements which a model of economic policy must meet and this is not achieved following present discussions on Mr Gasòliba i Böhm's proposals."
"Article 13 determines that the European central bank is committed first and foremost to monetary stability, but supports the European economic policy and the ECU and at the same time pursues the aims of the treaty, These conditions however are meaningless if there is no concrete European economic policy organized on an obligatory basis."
"It is not a question of impairing the independence of the European central bank."
"It is a question of substituting a reembedding for the disembedding which is taking place at the moment."
"I refer here to Michael Polyanis's great book on ""The Great Transformation' ."
"It is not acceptable, that the centre point of our economic policy in the future will be a central bank, located in the institutional, political and cultural nirvana."
"Instead of this we need a synchronization of the most important spheres of economic policy in the widest sense."
"Just at the moment when we are completing the transition to the euro we need to coordinate and synchronize economic, monetary, budgetary, employment and industrial policy."
"Institutionally we need a structured dialogue between the European central bank, the European Parliament and the Commission, like the one which exists for the Federal Bank in the USA, and we also need a structured dialogue between Ecofin, Ecosoc and the European Council."
"Madam President, I am glad I am not talking to an empty house, which is why I welcome the visitors in the public gallery."
"The report by colleague Gasòliba i Böhm clearly reveals bare that the European Union is far from ready for economic and monetary union."
"Meanwhile this fact is blatantly suppressed."
"In this resolution, too, the problematic nature of the choice for EMU is swept aside, but hidden."
"The European Commission boasts about the convergence achievements which have now been achieved."
"A lot is indeed happening."
"But the criteria for the Maastricht Treaty give an indication of nominal convergence."
"What the real economic convergence is, or whether the economic structures of the Member States link up with each other; these questions are ignored."
"It is this attitude which makes finding a solution to the unemployment problem in Europe the more difficult."
"Because monetary union without sufficient employment mobility aggravates this problem."
"According to the draft resolution, the trouble is the lack of coordination in economic policy."
"That is just one side of the matter."
"The other side is that the economic development of the Member States can really only be restructured from diverging to converging with a great deal of difficulty."
"It is not the kind of thing you simply do in three years."
"Such a process takes a long time."
"A third point which is lacking is a vision for the future of Europe."
"How can we allocate the accessing central and eastern European countries a full place in a European Union with EMU."
"The federal administration model is not suited to a Union with more than fifteen Member States."
"Many countries do not fit the EMU corset."
"The EMU and the attendant transfer of power in monetary, budgetary, fiscal and social fields create a structure in which less prosperous states can only be fitted in with a great deal of difficulty."
"It looks as if the western European countries give priority to their own prosperity, thereby maintaining the former ideological division between western and eastern Europe in economic terms."
"Madam President, despite the sparse presence in the Chamber, I think we are dealing with an essential issue with this matter of the coordination of economic policies."
"We are dealing with the question of how to provide ourselves, in the future, with the resources for devising a global economic policy which takes full account of the interdependence of the European economies, not simply as the sum of national situations, because in a European economy, one plus one does not equal two."
"We must allow the Commission to present a systematic analysis of the evolution of the European economy before breaking it down country by country."
"This will be all the more true when we have a central bank president facing twelve, eleven or fifteen economics and finance ministers."
"To succeed in improving the situation, several approaches are needed."
"Certainly, in the spirit of the Luxembourg summit, we must encourage better synchronization of the guideline procedures in terms of economics and employment."
"That is indispensable."
"Secondly, we must suggest that the main guidelines for the economic policy of the Member States and the Community in future become the main guidelines of the economic policy of the Union with contributions from the Member States."
"That is no semantic change."
"Thirdly, the European Union needs to be provided with resources of expertise, analysis, economic institutes - scenarios constructed at Union level, which think European and can then break things down to national level."
"I now come, of course, to the fourth point, which is undoubtedly the essential one, the Euro Council, the Euro X, whatever you like to call it."
"This is a necessary, indeed indispensable, part of the arrangements for the move to the euro."
"It is the only way a monetary policy, the policy of the euro, can be not just a monetary policy but serve growth and employment."
"But we must recognize that we are only at stage one. We must go further."
"The Commission must be present in this institution, all the more so because in the present arrangements it is not invited as such, while the president of the central bank could be."
"There is undoubtedly an unbalance there which saddens us."
"The second stage for this council must also, without a doubt, go beyond the context of economics and finance ministers."
"They have our full confidence but they are not always the best vectors of social transformation."
"Perhaps one day the employment and social affairs ministers should be involved - with equal powers, there lies the difficulty."
"The essential point is to conclude this agreement at Luxembourg II, because that is the deadline before the move to the euro."
"But I know that there we embark on the great challenge which lies ahead of us: democratic control of the genuinely strengthened cooperation which awaits us in the future, the cooperation which will be built around the euro."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am, of course, in agreement with the report by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, because coordination of economic policies represents a crucial issue for monetary union."
"However, a year from the deadline, no-one knows exactly where we are going."
"Certainly, we are beginning to raise the question, notably by introducing certain cabalistic signs like the X, which reminds me of those happy days when I did mathematics."
"But where are the real answers?"
"How will economic policy be managed in the euro zone?"
"How do we approach economic problems in a context where the external aspects of such policies will be reduced in number?"
"How do we deal with the asymmetric shocks which certain countries or certain regions could be exposed to?"
"The answers to questions like this remain very evasive, and indeed, often woolly."
"Nothing is really planned today, except a few speeches which are rather artistic in their vagueness."
"Now, the danger for EMU is certain."
"For example, if shocks occur, which God forbid, will they not lead to strong political pressure on the European central bank and will this not lead to excessively lax monetary policies, which would be very serious for the stability of the euro zone?"
"It is very clear that the ECB must always maintain the objective of medium term price stability, and putting it back under political influence would constitute a dangerous backward step and would do a very bad turn to Europe, to growth and to employment."
"The solution is not there, ladies and gentlemen, and it seems to me it must take other routes."
"First, an intelligent coordination of the budgetary and fiscal policies of the euro zone; secondly, a more flexible labour market and lower labour costs, notably for the least qualified."
"I will dwell on the first route for a moment, since the second is better known and more classic."
"Coordinating budgetary and fiscal policies does not mean a mere chorus of fine words between leaders, or a friendly exchange of information between economics ministers."
"Coordinating budgetary and fiscal policies means putting clear guidelines in place, established together by the members of the euro zone, in terms of national budgetary deficits - and on this I part company from a certain number of colleagues here - and, as much as possible, should also include the countries which would be likely to enter this zone within a reasonable timescale."
"Because if these countries have a virtually fixed rate of exchange with the euro zone, this means that the policies pursued by the euro zone, as well as the policies pursued by these countries will have very strong mutual influences."
"So, they must also participate in economic coordination."
"The political problem is a different problem."
"Better still, and even if I am aware of the political difficulties, from the point of view of good economic principles, the optimal solution would be to carry out that coordination via an enlarged Community budget."
"To what level?"
"Probably something like 3 to 5 % of GDP would be sufficient."
"3 to 5 %, ladies and gentlemen, is not a great deal, when we know that certain countries, including mine, have something like 55 % of public expenditure in relation to GDP and that the European average is situated around 40-50 %."
"Having said that, there must be no misunderstanding."
"It is not a matter of advocating an increase in compulsory contributions throughout Europe."
"Believe me, that is far from my intention."
"That is not my style."
"On the contrary the opposite approach should be followed, but it will be necessary, perhaps sooner than we think, to transfer a part of national public expenditure to Europe's budget, even if this transfer is relatively minimal."
"Well, I know that sort of proposal is not particularly popular with governments today and probably not with this House either, but personally I think that a dynamic will develop which will push us in that direction."
"Well, I think it is better to prepare for that coolly, calmly and intelligently, rather than go through it in time of crisis, with all the risks that involves for our economies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, those seem to me the essential routes, and they will, of course, require movement towards more extended political union, in other words - and let us not be afraid of the words - movement towards a more advanced federalist structure."
"I am not naive, I know that such measures will not be implemented overnight and that the political resistance will be strong."
"But I think this is the direction Europe should take and will take in the future."
"Madam President, this report is both unrealistic and illogical."
"A coordinated economic policy in the Union cannot mean the same economic policy."
"The economies of the countries are very different with different structures."
"In addition, large common markets always bring a tendency towards specialization, based on what are called comparative advantages."
"This continuously reinforces the differences between the countries' economies."
"In the long-term it also makes all projects for a common currency impossible."
"In this respect the euro is in the same predicament as the old gold standard, which was also doomed to collapse."
"A coordinated economic policy must mean joint orientation and shared goals, but with differing national methods."
"This is the only realistic starting point, as is also expressed in Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 of the report."
"Madam President, with a year to go until the planned date for the entry into force of the single currency, we still do not have a very good idea of the extent, the substance, or indeed the reality of the economic coordination likely to accompany it."
"That is the impression given by reading the Gasòliba I Böhm report, as well as the working document of the Commission on the same subject and the current arguments about the Euro Council."
"Of course, the treaty does mention arrangements for coordination: the monitoring of exchange rates, the definition of the broad guidelines for economic policy, the establishment of a procedure for reducing excessive deficits, later amplified by the stability pact."
"The Amsterdam draft adds the definition of employment guidelines."
"But all this is still vague and in any case, it certainly does not constitute the economic governance that some consider indispensable to the success of the euro."
"In their view, as in the Gasòliba I Böhm report, democracy and the coherence of the broad guidelines of economic policy have to be ensured by entrusting them to a more formalized European body, intended to counterbalance the monetary pillar."
"But in Europe's current situation, where there are several countries and not just one, this single body would be threatened with continuous hindrance from internal divergencies, to the detriment of the definition of a healthy macro-economic policy."
"This is an argument invoked by the partisans of complete independence of central banks, which is more effective, according to them."
"Unfortunately, these partisans of complete central bank independence in turn fall into another difficulty which they are unable to escape from."
"For the policy of an independent central bank to be able to deliver convincing results, that bank must be supported by a strong social consensus, which can only result from long positive experience and strong community feeling."
"Now, the future European central bank will have neither of these advantages."
"So, whichever way we turn, there are only these two routes leading to the implosion of the single currency."
"The wise course would be to postpone it."
"Madam President, during the third phase of economic and monetary union, we will have centralized monetary policy."
"Whether this aim is tenable depends entirely on how effectively the economic policy of the Member States is coordinated."
"As far as that is concerned the treaty creates enough opportunities."
"The question is primarily to what extent these opportunities will be exploited and how this will be achieved."
"In order for economic and monetary union genuininely to walk on two legs, economic coordination must not be limited to enabling a policy from the central bank which is directed at stability."
"The coordination must also and explicitly be aimed at promoting growth which creates employment."
"I do not quite understand how such a policy can be developed by a yet to be established economic and financial committee which will be dominated by the central bankers from the national central banks and the European central bank."
"This restrictive monetary approach will dominate even more than was the case with its predecessor, the Monetary Committee."
"It is feared that Ecofin will follow its advice just as slavishly as the Community Committee."
"As long as the central bankers continue to call the shots behind the scenes at Ecofin, it will never be able to become a true economic counterbalance to the European central bank."
"I am fully in favour of European-wide economic coordination, but it has to be genuine economic and not primarily monetary coordination."
"In other to achieve this it will probably be necessary to run the economic and financial committee not with national central bankers, but instead with representatives from the ministries of Social Affairs and Finance."
"To conclude, I think that altering the composition of the preparatory committee of Ecofin will be more important for the contents of European economic policy than the entire discussion on Euro X, on which Ecofin spends so much time."
"Let us therefore try to get this subject onto the political agenda in Europe."
"Madam President, I should first like to thank Commissioner WulfMathies for the speech she has just made on behalf of the Commission. Her views are similar to those expressed by Commissioner de Silguy."
"Before we proceed to the vote, I should like to clarify a couple of points about my Amendment No 5 and Mr Donnelly's Amendment No 4."
"In the second section of paragraph 9 in the English version it says ""the two sides of industry' . My British colleagues have pointed out to me that it is better to say ""the social partners' ."
"It is just a linguistic detail, but I would ask for it to be incorporated into the final version."
"Right."
"We will ask the linguistic services to do what is necessary to check the two versions."
"Madam President, I have a point of order, as I am have the impression that the practice of Friday mornings in Strasbourg to take a vote after each report, is now also being taken over in the Thursday sessions of Parliament here in Brussels."
"We know almost for certain that turnout will be low here."
"May I ask the Bureau to consider voting at set times here in Brussels, so that everyone knows what is happening, and we will not have such a low turnout."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen, I will answer you straight away."
"As you certainly know, this was an exceptional situation."
"It involved the votes on the reports on the enlargement, and that is why they were taken at the beginning of the morning as an exception."
"But I note your comment, which is very germane, and in future we will return to the usual practice."
"The debate is closed."
"We will now move to the vote on the report."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"The report recommends that the European Union should 'adopt an economic policy based on a close coordination of the Member States' economic policies.'"
"It also talks of a coordination of budget policy and finance policy as well as of a currency policy 'pillar' ."
"We have nothing against voluntary coordination in order to combat unemployment, for example."
"However, the coordination being advocated will be voluntary."
"We therefore disassociate ourselves from any idea of, for example, introducing common taxes in the Union, or of making economic policy supranational at all."
"The Member States should also in future have the right to 'tax themselves' and conduct their own policy in this area."
"If Europe's finance ministers then agree to work together to avoid tax dumping, for example, that would be good."
"But that should take place through voluntary work between those who wish to do so, not through a system of rules within the European Union."
"If the euro is to be truly successful it must have the support not only of politicians but of business and consumers."
"The Commission promised to take decisions on four important issues relating to Stage 3 of EMU by the end of the year but have postponed the decisions until May next year."
"The questions concern: whether to retain the 1 January 2002 date for the introduction of euro notes and coins; whether the simultaneous circulation of national currencies and euros should last six months as decided at the Madrid Summit in 1995; the question of dual pricing of goods and whether there would be need for EU legislation in this area and finally the question of conversion charges, both of bank accounts in the period 1999-2002 and notes/ coins in the period following 1 January 2002."
"Does the Commission think that it will be in a position to make decisions on these important practical issues by May 1998?"
"What is the Commission's reaction to Eurocommerce (European Retailers Association) who commissioned a Deloitte & Touche report which said that the average cost of introducing the single currency could be as high as 2.6 % of turnover for Europe's retailers?"
"Such costs would put many SMEs in my own constituency out of business."
"Small retailers will be faced with exorbitant costs updating IT systems, cash registers, retraining of staff and preparing their accounts in euros."
"The start date for the introduction of notes/coins is close to the busiest time of the year - Christmas/after-Christmas sales: it may be too much for small retailers and companies to handle."
"The single currency is certain going to happen, but the EU must now concentrate on these practical issues in order that businesses and consumers will be strong supporters of economic and monetary union."
"Today the Danish Social Democrats voted for Gasòliba i Böhm's report on coordinating economic policy within EMU."
"The report mentions that all the Member States of the EU should be able to participate in the increased coordination of economic policy."
"That means countries which are outside the third stage of EMU, such as Denmark, should also be able to participate in a better coordination of economic policy."
"The Danish Social Democrats fully support this view."
"The Danish Social Democrats reject an informal Euro X in which only countries which are in the third stage of EMU may participate."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree with the rapporteur that a better coordination of overall economic policy will be beneficial to the objective of higher employment in the EU."
"However, the Danish Social Democrats stress that financial policy should still be a sovereign national concern."
"The undersigned voted against the report on the following grounds:"
"1.The report is unrealistic."
"It assumes that the states' economies are the same and that EMU will be carried out throughout the Union.2.The economies are very different, and the differences are reinforced by the trend towards specialization which takes place in large markets, based on comparative costs.3.Common economic policies can therefore only be seen as a common aiming at particular targets."
"The methods must be adapted to the countries' structures and their different sensitivities to economic cycles and external influences."
"Structural measures in Belgium"
"The next item is the report (A4-0321/97) by Mr Decourrière, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on development problems and structural measures in Belgium (C4-0107/97)."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the structural measures in Belgium is another opportunity to highlight the major role of Community measures in favour of economic and social cohesion."
"Belgium is one of the Member States whose GDP per inhabitant is higher than the Community average and can thus be classified as a rich country."
"However, this country has wide disparities in development, ranging from GDP per inhabitant of 77 % for Hainaut to 137 % for Antwerp and 183 % for Brussels."
"During the last few years this phenomenon has worsened and Community action, which has contributed to moderating and correcting these disequilibria, has more than doubled between 1989 and 1999, rising from ECU 863 million to ECU 2 billion."
"The province of Liège, the regions of Aubange, Turnhout and part of Limburg are eligible for objective 2, as industrial areas in decline."
"Certain regions benefit from measures in favour of less-developed rural areas."
"These measures are supplemented by horizontal objectives 3 and 4 and Community initiative programmes."
"Without going into detail, the Community measures have had some success, especially the investment aid for SMEs in Hainaut, which has also involved supplementary credit transfers towards these lines."
"The Community measures have also played a determinant role in terms of socio-professional integration, for example, and in 1996 over 70, 000 people received personalized training."
"The progressive redynamization of certain rural and urban zones is also noteworthy."
"But in this Chamber we are aware that structural measures constitute an indispensable tool and support which needs to be improved."
"Concern for transparency and effectiveness means the imperfections of the existing system must be highlighted."
"First of all, there is a very low rate of use of appropriations, of the order of 17 % for Hainaut in objective 1, 5-20 % for objective 2 areas, and less than 10 % for objective 5b areas, as a result of the inadequate rate, about 12 %, of commitment of the available appropriations."
"There is also underconsumption of the planned appropriations for objective 4."
"But to end on a positive note, we are delighted with the success of objective 3, where the available resources are not sufficient to finance the very large number of projects."
"On the imperfections side, there is also an amount of ECU per job created higher than the sum allocated in other Member States and quite a low job creation target compared with the exceptional budgetary allocation Belgium benefits from."
"Development disparities in areas in difficulty and inadequacies in the use of the budgetary lines for industrial wastelands and the improvement of the environment also subsist."
"As regards desirable approaches, some involve the national authorities, and first and foremost I stress the need to take steps rapidly to remedy the evident budgetary underconsumption of appropriations."
"In particular I draw the attention of the Belgian authorities to the fact that the rate of commitment of the appropriations, as at January 1999, should serve as the reference point for the calculation of the sums allocated as from the year 2000."
"It is also appropriate to reduce the burden of the administrative system, provide the indispensable matching funding for implementing certain projects and ensure a better framework system, by appointing a project coordinator."
"It also seems to me indispensable, and now I am addressing the Community authorities, to monitor the measures more actively, and ensure acceleration of the transfer of Community resources to the final recipients by the Belgian authorities."
"Finally, in the context of the thinking initiated with Agenda 2000, limiting the current excessive number of measures might be envisaged in the context of the miscellaneous programmes, together with a geographic concentration of resources in favour of administrative divisions which are experiencing the greatest disparities in development."
"To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, after the vote this morning on Agenda 2000, to insist again on the need to prolong the cohesion efforts undertaken and to be very careful to organize a substantial transition stage for the Member States which currently make up the European Union and which, like Belgium, will not benefit from objective 1."
"Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues for their involvement in this report, which has given me solid support and encouragement in my work."
"Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating Mr Decourrière wholeheartedly on his excellent report, which ought to become compulsory reading for all the authorities in Belgium."
"As draftsman of the opinion I have concentrated primarily on the expenditure of the European social fund in the various objective regions."
"I would like to take up three points."
"First and foremost, the problems around underspending."
"I share the rapporteur's concern about the exceptionally low expenditure of resources in the objective regions in Belgium."
"What's more, I find it incomprehensible and unacceptable that underspending is in these objective regions even bigger within the social fund, and this of all things whilst the summit in Luxembourg urges for more investment in training and jobs."
"At the moment Belgium is not drawing on a large sum of European money."
"European money which has not been lost yet, but time is moving."
"Of course, all kinds of justified and unjustified arguments can be made for these arrears."
"The programmes were approved too late, the Commission operates too bureaucratically."
"Some regions are in effect too small to be able to handle structural funds, but this also applies to other countries in Europe."
"A few of the reasons are typically Belgian."
"Lack of coordination, the struggle for power between local, regional and federal authorities, both as far as the distribution of resources is concerned and the implementation of projects, the programming documents; I often get the impression that in Belgium more thought is given to power conflicts than to regional development and combating unemployment."
"In Brussels this often leads to surreal situations, and this whilst neglect in some area of the city, and unemployment amongst young migrants is so great, that these days Brussels frequently seems to be living on a time bomb."
"High long term unemployment, the problems in the regions affected by industries closing down cry out for more cooperation between the various relevant authorities in the interests of the people."
"I agree with the rapporteur that, if necessary, the European Commission should lend a hand."
"The conclusions of the summit in Luxembourg are a good argument for this."
"Secondly, good news should also be mentioned. The rapporteur has just done this."
"Outside the objective regions, European resources for training unemployed people are used very effectively."
"So it is extremely regrettable that these projects are kept in a state of suspense regarding financing, that there are still no multiannual plans; so that interesting initiatives, especially from local authorities for instance, are often left standing."
"Both the Commission and the regional authorities should solve these problems in the short term as a matter of urgency."
"But the situation regarding to the training of employees in threatened jobs is pitiful, especially in Flanders where barely 10 % of resources have been allocated, let alone paid out."
"As far as training for employees is concerned, Belgium is still by no means at the top of the class."
"Industry, and especially SMEs must, as a matter of urgency, be urged to invest in their employees."
"Furthermore, we keep insisting for a transfer of a part of the reserves from objective 4 to objective 3, where a lot of creativity is to be found, but little money."
"Finally, I would like to say something about relocation and extra jobs."
"The Liberal group's assertion that the European resources would not have served new jobs, is unjust."
"However, without European money unemployment would have been even higher."
"But Parliament rightly asks for more focus, clearer employment results."
"It would be unheard of if European money was used to snatch jobs from one region to another."
"The Renault experience is still fresh in our memory, and in the regions around Henegouwen there is still a great unrest on that front."
"We emphatically urge the European Commission to see to it that structural funds are not used for unfair competition."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Decourrière, on his report, and I would like to thank him for the analysis which he put forward in his report, and for the proposals which have been included and found great approval in the proper committee."
"I would like to use my intervention to go firstly into the three regionally based objectives, in particular objective 1, 2, and 5b, for which Belgium is entitled to ECU 950 million, which is 39 billion Belgian francs, for the period 1994-1999."
"As of 31 December 1996 approximately 7 billion Belgian francs had been spent under the terms of the regional and structural funds."
"In absolute terms the underspending of structural funds is primarily a Wallonian problem."
"There is a sum of 26 billion left to spend in Wallonia, and 3 billion in Flanders, but in relative terms the underuse is primarily a Flemish problem."
"Flanders has an expenditure of 12 % against 19 % in Wallonia."
"It is well known that by far the most significant part, namely 30 billion Belgian francs, is set aside for the province of Henegouwen as an objective 1 region."
"In fact we are talking about 60 billion if Wallonian cofinancing is honoured."
"Suspicions arise - and I also draw the Commissioner's attention to this - that the Wallonian district is in fact carrying out this cofinancing by improper use of European financial resources."
"I would like to ask, Madam Commissioner, whether the European Commission has investigated how cofinancing is taking place in Henegouwen?"
"On the other hand I have received information about the investigation set up by the Unit for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention (UCLAF) into the expenditure of European money in Henegouwen through Public Utility Boards, amongst other things."
"Can the European Commission corroborate this information, and have any results come out of the UCLAF investigations yet?"
"With regard to the objective 2 areas, Limburg and Turnhout, the situation is markedly better, especially as far as expenditure within the European social fund are concerned."
"I ascertain that in this regions a certain rhythm has been found, but that a transfer of financial resources from objective 4 to objective 5 is needed, as suggested by Mrs Van Lancker."
"The problems regarding the situation in objective 5b region is grave, however."
"Westhoek and Meetjesland in Flanders are entitled to approximately 2 billion Belgian francs towards rural development."
"Yet a considerable part of this has not been taken up."
"Up until today only the resources provided for 1994 have been utilized, whilst in the Netherlands, for example, during a comparable period, the resources for 1998 have already been utilized."
"The fact Flanders does not tap the resources for 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, merely underlines their incapacity."
"In addition to this there are two further problems."
"There is the problem of cofinancing, which is fixed contractually, but not executed for lack of resources provided for in the relevant budget."
"On the other hand the problem of technical support, which in Flanders is already at 4 %, and where it is wished to raise this, whilst the European Commission accepts a maximum of 1.5 %."
"The situation concerning the Community Leader programme is extremely worrying, also in the rural policy sector."
"The two Flemish programmes have still not been approved after four years, despite eight revised versions."
"I am not surprised that the European Commission is asking questions about the capacity to meet the conditions set."
"I believe that these examples point to the fact that both in the Flemish and in the Wallonian regions there is a need for reflection on how we might handle the structural funds, and how we might organize better use of them over the next few years."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Decourrière on his objective and uncompromising report on the use of the structural funds in Belgium."
"May I say that such understanding of the Belgian situation is rare in a Frenchman."
"As regards my region, Wallonia, Mr Decourrière is absolutely right to condemn the slowness of the administrative procedures, the poor targeting of aid on the least backward sub-regions, which is the opposite of what should be happening, the dispersion and multiplication of small projects, the use of a part of the regional funds for initiatives which should have been financed by the budget for the Walloon region."
"It is clear that the Walloon government has not been sufficiently precise about the objectives to be attained, sufficiently firm in the conduct of the projects, sufficiently effective in monitoring the consumption of appropriations, sufficiently convincing on the utility of research and development and targeting aid to support SMEs in the competitive sectors."
"But the Commission should also think again."
"It ought to ensure the seriousness and credibility of the projects, notably considered in terms of lasting jobs."
"It must take measures to avoid relocations from one sub-region to another as a function of financial advantages conferred by the structural funds."
"Finally, it should calculate the impact of the plan it is presenting in Agenda 2000, which will in the end make it more difficult to grant aid and will no doubt have the effect of eliminating structural funds measures for Belgian objective 1 and 2 regions."
"Of course European aid to the regions should not be eternal. But to stop in midstream would be counterproductive."
"We are promised gradual disengagement, but without knowing either the volume or the timescale."
"The conclusions to Mr Decourrière's excellent report present particularly useful channels of thought for the future debate on the revision of the structural funds."
"It is not enough to consume appropriations, maximum effectiveness in their utilization must be sought, which will require an in-depth re-examination of the objectives of the funds, as well as the modalities of project selection, as a function of a strategy decreed by common accord between the Commission and the public authority responsible."
"Mr President, there is evident lack of clarity in the strategy followed by the Belgian regional authorities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not normally like it when empty words of praise are directed at the rapporteur, but in this case it is genuinely deserved, as we are getting an extremely objective picture in which both the weak points of the Belgian regional policy and the issues which can be evaluated positively are mentioned."
"I think Mrs Lancker is 100 % right if she says that this report ought to be read thoroughly by all our regional and other authorities."
"As far its substance is concerned, for us the two most important points are the following."
"Firstly there is the conclusion we have all come to, namely that it is incomprehensible that a country which does not exactly have a surplus of resources, in any case in order not to manage certain problems better, does not manage to draw and use the funds available from Europe more effectively."
"This is an absolute scandal."
"I think a message should go out towards the administrations which are responsible for this."
"But another point which I would like highlight, is the fact that it is not only the regional authorities, but often also the lower echelons who stand opposite each other with drawn knives; local authorities who want to snatch things from each other, topped by what goes on within the Public Utility Boards. Instead of getting a focussed approach which is genuinely aimed at the main problems in a region, his frequently leads to a number of Public Utility Boards organizing fights against each other, and this is ultimately at the expense of an effective deployment of scarce resources which are not even fully used."
"A last point I wanted to raise is what should happen to the structural funds, also in the light of the enlargement we talked about yesterday and today; at least during the votes today."
"We can side wholly with the spirit of the report as it is expressed in paragraph 40, as it says at last: look, we have got an existing situation and we have to organize a transition which takes into the account both the challenges outside the Union, and the greatest needs amongst ourselves."
"The formulation of paragraph 23, on the other hand, can be read as very conservative, in the sense that we should keep everything we have at the moment."
"We do not find that a satisfactory perspective."
"So we give our full support to the direction indicated in paragraph 40, but not to the one indicated in paragraph 34."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I would like to address my sincerest congratulations to my colleague, Mr Decourrière."
"I think it is an excellent report."
"It shows great objectivity and that is indeed extremely valuable."
"He refers rightly to the Community support which has tripled in Belgium."
"But maybe I should add the following."
"The report contains a small error."
"Under point F you say that support for the regions in Wallonia was ECU 750 billion."
"It should be ECU 750 million, of course."
"I would like to ask for this error to be corrected."
"You rightly emphasize a number of flaws."
"Flaws which are actually quite common throughout regional and social support, on account of the European Union."
"It often concerns inadequate tying down of available funds, but we have to stress that country concerned frequently contributes its own input too late, and not to mention the region concerned."
"Red tape and underspending of social monies have also rightly been pointed out."
"In this is I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's criticism."
"You rightly emphasize Henegouwen."
"It is a problem region with traditional industries, steel and textiles, which are subject to restructuring."
"But then we should also emphasize UCLAF's criticism regarding the use of these funds."
"Maybe this did not manifest itself clearly enough in the report."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for having incorporated my amendments."
"The amendments came from the Committee on Regional Development, and emphasize a number of problems in Flanders and the situation in the 5b regions."
"In my view this has not been given sufficient attention in the past, but it has been fully corrected now, and I would like to thank you emphatically for this."
"You also highlight the enormous fragmentation in countless small projects."
"Let us say: it is a situation in which every authority has been given its gift, and that is irresponsible."
"It is a case of relocation in one's own country."
"It is relocation from one region to the other."
"How can one imagine that 20 kilometres down the road money is, as it were, transferred, and jobs are being transferred."
"It is not right."
"It is shift employment."
"The Commission should investigate this as a matter of urgency."
"I do not believe it is acceptable that money is given to one region, to let the results be removed in another."
"I believe this should definitely be a European Commission study."
"I congratulate the rapporteur once again."
"It is a superb report and I want to support it fully."
"Mr President, for me Mr Decourrière's report, which we have before us, simply confirms the collapse of the structural funds programme, particularly as far as Belgium is concerned."
"Since I have only two minutes to speak, I will limit myself to only two fundamental conclusions."
"First, the report shows the umpteenth proof that the structural funds account for additional millions flooding from Flanders to Wallonia."
"In short, the lion's share of the contributions the European Union's budget is paid by Flanders."
"The lion's share of European subsidies, on the other hand, goes to Wallonia."
"Now, this may seem defensible; a richer European populace is perfectly capable of helping a poorer populace, no one is against that, but in this case it is indefensible."
"Wallonia is governed, after all, by a socialist regime closely linked to mafia-like operations, and itself is responsible for the arrears it is falling into."
"The Wallonian politicians make absolutely no serious effort to clean up the situation, and obstruct every fundamental reform of economy and politics."
"The European manna is being used solely to stretch out an untenable regime."
"That may sound hard to those who are unfamiliar with my country, but it does not make it any less true."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasize the objection in paragraph 29 made by the rapporteur himself."
"It is true that the Wallonian province Henegouwen uses European subsidies to tempt businesses away from the Kortwijk region in Western Flanders."
"The European subsidies, together with far-reaching environmental concessions, make up an attractive package for businesses."
"So thanks to Europe, jobs are stolen from Flanders, and are relocated to Wallonia."
"These are not new jobs, and this should not be what is behind European subsidy politics, and for that reason I will obviously not approve the report before us."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the report by Mr Decourrière can, in my view, in any case be characterized as objective."
"It also contains, however, the urgent appeal to Belgium to make better use of structural resources in future."
"After all, we are talking here about more than ECU 2 billion."
"The figures are not, in my opinion at this point in time the most important thing."
"If one reads Mr Decourrière's report it becomes clear that the use of the resources at the moment is relatively slight."
"But we must not forget that there is an important phase before such use, that is, the programming."
"This report makes it clear that the programming phase represents, for those who have to carry it out, a binding programme for the future."
"Of course I consider that an objective 1 area with approximately 50 % cofinancing was bound to present a problem."
"Where the area is already structurally weak the support from the European Union must be more intensive."
"Otherwise they could have made the Hennegau a better objective 2 area."
"As far as cofinancing is concerned, in the initial stages there should be stricter controls on the partnership in the cofinancing."
"It is unacceptable for the programme to be put together by three or four people and then the active forces in an area have to be brought into organize a cofinancing."
"Here I believe that the Commission, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity must intervene more effectively, so that even in the programming phase all the partners sit round a table and all sign up to these programmes."
"On the question of actual implementation: of course there are areas in which the implementation is already at this moment in time relatively good."
"It is not a matter of having spent a great deal of money so far, but that the money has also been well spent."
"In this respect I would like to address two principles."
"The first principle is that if we create jobs we must also be sure that they are permanent jobs."
"If, in certain spheres, and I am thinking of the middle class, subsidies are distributed on a quick, short term basis, I would almost say sprayed from a watering can, then we have to be able to check - and that too is the task of the Commission - that these jobs have also contributed to the subsequent stability of a region."
"We must also create the pre-conditions."
"This is revealed clearly by Mr Decourrière's report, that is, that an area can only become attractive if it first removes the existing ruins."
"It is not my intention to go into the examples already present in Belgium, but the attractiveness of a region and the job creation will also depend on how things look in a region."
"Resources are provided for this and they must be used more intensively."
"I come from a border area and I know what minor relocations mean."
"Madam Commissioner, you must consider that it is a question of the credibility of the structural fund if even today we are financing the destruction of jobs."
"I shall explain this statement."
"In my view it is unacceptable that certain companies leave objective 2 Areas, as happened in the Verviers area in the case of Boston Scientific, wander off into objective 1 areas, making jobs disappear en route and yet still get money for their investment elsewhere in Europe!"
"That is the financing of destruction. It must not be seen on a regional or national level, but on a Europe-wide level."
"For the next structural funds it is therefore not only their credibility which is at risk but also the economic stability of the regions of Europe!"
"Mr President, when reading the excellent report one may indeed question whether the structural funds reach their objectives, or in any case whether the programmes and the funds which have been laid out have actively created new jobs, and whether structural policy contributes in an enduring way to combating unemployment."
"This applies to both Wallonia and Flanders, which is why my group has submitted the amendments it has."
"We have to observe that in the regions Turnhout and Limburg, which fall under objective 2, payments are made out of only 49 % of the credits, and the results regarding unemployment are below the Flemish average."
"In the Flanders region which fall under 5b payments amount to less than 3 %, and in Meetjesland less than 1 %."
"So it is high time that the necessary credits were released at Flemish level, and I fully support what Mrs Aelvoet amongst others said."
"The time is absolutely ripe for red tape and complicated procedures to be tackled with the aim of achieving more flexibility."
"The time has above all come for a global approach by all the authorized institutes."
"No more passing the buck."
"We are all in the same boat."
"Too large a fragmentation is prejudicial."
"But we can only come up with concrete and positive results following a global and constructive approach."
"Let us hope that this will be the case in the future."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree. Mr Decourrière has delivered excellent work."
"He rightly asks the crucial question as to whether the structural policy in its current shape is able to reduce the regional differences."
"The whole of Henegouwen, for example, is an objective 1 region, with the result that a prosperous sub-region like Doornik and Moeskroen is a haven for investments and relocations from the middle and the south of West Flanders."
"This lead to the construction of a buffer zone in the southern part of this province, with the result that the subsidy mill started to turn."
"After all, the Borinage which was most in need of support, is none the better for it."
"In view of the structural funds reforms we should think of a different course for structural policy."
"That is why we should use principles like geographic and thematic concentration with the main emphasis on investment, infrastructure, information technology, the environment and vocational training, with an accent on endogenous development."
"Direct support to companies leads to unfair competition and can only be applied to selective investments."
"For that matter we conclude that the SMIs, which we have been calling job creators since the Delors White Paper, are anything but central to the structural policy."
"This was pointed out by the Court of Auditors in a recent report."
"We also have to bear this shortcoming in mind in the future."
"Mr President, in application of the 1993 decisions linked to the reform of the structural funds, the Commission granted Belgium certain new adaptations to the regulation, including amongst the new measures the recognition of Hainaut in objective 1."
"Its eligibility was justified by the fact that regional development disparities had been observed for several years."
"The DOCUP established by the Walloon executive was approved by the Commission on 14 June 1994."
"Following this implementation stage, the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy was asked to give an opinion on the programming period 1994-1999."
"The rapporteur, Mr Decourrière, has deplored, and I too deplore, the slow implementation of certain programmes, above all in the initial phase concerning the Hainaut objective 1 region which is fortunately now being made up."
"The report points out that this aid primarily favours the sub-regions of Hainaut which are the best adapted to benefit from the funds, that is the regions of d'Ath, Tournai and Mouscron."
"Furthermore, the impact of the structural funds, as currently felt in Hainaut, has not sufficiently taken account of the guidelines for rural regions, whereas there are potential resources to be taken advantage of in these areas."
"I therefore emphasize that the Community initiatives should be taken into better account - and I am thinking in particular of the Leader programme - in terms of their practical implementation on the ground."
"The Commission should be aware that its late decisions on the programming do not allow the projects to be carried out effectively to their completion."
"The decision sometimes falls six months or a year after the start-up of the initial programme."
"For example, for the programming period 1997-1999, the green light was given in mid-July 1997, whereas, for the action to be effective, the decision should have been taken in September-October 1996."
"Investment aid regimes should also have been permitted."
"This would help the regions which benefit from it to cope with their difficulties and more easily attract potential entrepreneurs to Wallonia, notably for the objective 1, 2 and 5b areas involving the Walloon Brabant territorial measures."
"I support Mr Decourrière's opinion, when he advocates the correction of a certain number of inadequacies and the choice of new policy guidelines."
"It is essential to remedy the lack of local structure when this becomes clear."
"For the programmes to function properly, it is indispensable to create local decentralized development agencies, provided with an appropriate framework and which would assure self-supported management and thus promote the relaunch of the rural regions."
"Local development and employment initiatives are the prior condition for any lasting development."
"Active participation, dialogue between citizens and local and regional authorities, will make it possible to mobilize and stimulate the economic, social and cultural life of the regions."
"The priorities of development strategy must also be based on economic diversification, the promotion of research, the diffusion of new technologies, professional training and job creation."
"Thank you, Mr Decourrière, for this good report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only echo the praise of my colleagues in Parliament for the very analytical and clear, as well as critical and realistic report on the development problems and structural interventions in Belgium."
"The Commission shares the concern expressed by Mr Decourrière throughout the report and the proposal about the serious deficiencies in the implementation of the programme and the use of European support resources in Belgium."
"For its part the Commission has informed the Belgian partners not only once but repeatedly about these deficiencies and have warned that remedial measures must be taken."
"The Commission therefore explicitly welcomes your appeals to the Belgian government, but also to the regional and local authorities, which must also contribute to the purposeful coordination and acceleration of the administrative procedures required for cofinancing and must ensure that the support resources of the EU already received by the national and regional offices are then finally conveyed to the ultimate beneficiaries and the resources efficiently utilized."
"The report confirms the worries and concerns which have already been notified to me by the regional and local partners and social partners during my visits to those places and you can be certain that I commented very critically there on the problems which affect us all."
"If one considers the financial development of the programmes at the end of 1997 it certainly appears to be characterized, particularly in the Hennegau, by a slight improvement."
"We have now completed in the Hennegau the payments for 94 and 95 from the 1994/99 regional fund and have paid the first advance of 50 % for 96: in other words things are accelerating."
"But that is not an all-clear signal!"
"It shows that we have made progress, but that we are nowhere near the point where we can say that we have now found the key to how we can proceed smoothly to our conclusion."
"I too would like to deal with the point raised by Mr Chanterie, namely the UCLAF report."
"We are at the moment still carrying out investigations."
"There is still no confirmation of the suspicion expressed that misdemeanours may have been committed, and we are therefore continuing to study the case carefully."
"Let me, however, refer to one thing, which is important: these are problems stemming from the period 1990 to 1993."
"We have in the Hennegau, notwithstanding the question of what might ultimately be proved, been careful to ensure that supervision, control and transparency are improved."
"We have taken particular care to see that the five local authorities in Wallonia also agree on a better system of cooperation."
"When I was last there I stated this very explicitly, without arousing much enthusiasm amongst the people concerned with the very critical situation."
"I am all the more grateful that your extremely extensive report now also confirms what we ourselves have been criticizing all along."
"As for the question of cofinancing I can only report to you what people told us, that in fact officially there is no cofinancing problem."
"We can unfortunately not even try to determine what the national or regional financial situation actually looks like."
"The Commission is following with concern - and this was of course raised by several of you - the so-called subsidy-race with the relocation of companies from regions not eligible for support to regional support areas."
"I would however like to point out that the Commission has allowed the Belgian Government to grant until the end of 1999 aid of up to 15 % of the enterprise investment as equivalent nett subsidy in the Flemish areas bordering on the Hennegau. This would above all provide at least some help for Wervik, Zwevelgem, Wevelgem, Ronse, Kortrijk and Vilvoorde: in other words we responded directly to problems."
"Nevertheless I also consider it to be important - because this discussion really plays a major role - to refer to the basic principle of freedom of settlement in the European Union, which allows any company to settle or to relocate in any location where the economic conditions appear to be most favourable."
"A company's decision on where to locate, as we have checked several times, is influenced by numerous factors such as proximity to the market, qualification of the workforce, flexibility of the relevant administrative authority, and also fiscal measures, so that the prospect of regional aid is frequently only one factor and not even the decisive one."
"Moreover, according to the principle of subsidiarity the regional and national administrations are responsible in the structural programmes for the selection of the relevant projects, and we cannot of course only apply subsidiarity when it suits us, and try to abolish it just when it does not suit us."
"Alarmed, particularly by the Renault-Vilvoorde case and the negative consequences of the subsidy race, the Commission intends to draw up guidelines before the end of the year for the assessment of regional aid of the Member States for 2000-2006, and to propose: firstly, generally to lower the upper limit of aid intensity in order to restrict the regions' scope for outbidding each other; secondly we are considering how we can link regional and more closely to conditions - for example on the minimum duration of the investment activity and the securing of jobs in the area in question."
"This is also an essential point of consideration for the new version of the structural regulation from 2000."
"Also before the end of the year the Commission will present a communication on the necessary concentration and coherence of its regional and aid policy."
"We are in agreement with them that we must combat misuse."
"But I want to make it clear that solidarity also means positive discrimination and that we naturally want to attract more activities to the poorest areas in the Union and into the Member States and that we must try together to perform this balancing act."
"The Commission agrees with the rapporteur when he states that local development and employment initiatives are a precondition for any lasting development."
"The Commission has made the raising of the efficiency of the structural fund subsidies since 1995 its prime function and its number one priority the creation and maintenance of jobs, both for its guidelines for the second phase of the 1997-99 programme for the objective 2 areas and for the intermediate evaluation of the objective 1 programmes."
"This of course also applies to Belgium."
"In addition the Commission is supporting five territorial employment pacts, in Flanders, Tongeren and Vilvoorde and in Wallonia, Hainaut and West Brabant and finally the region of the capital Brussels."
"I agree with all those here who have said that we must support these activities on the spot and that we must also exert pressure to ensure that the resources are used and not just spent, but above all for top quality projects to create jobs and to improve the attractiveness of the region."
"As for your concerns about the reforms of the structural fund after 1999 I would simply refer you to the basic statement of the Commission in Agenda 2000."
"The wish of the Commission is that the high degree of communal solidarity in favour of securing economic and social cohesion despite limited resources should be maintained."
"The Commission therefore provides, even for regions which have made good economic recoveries, wind-down phases which help to secure successful cohesion."
"This applies clearly to the Belgian areas which may be affected by it."
"I hope that your initiative report and today's debate on it will contribute to the improvement of the quality of structural fund interventions in Belgium and I can only underline what Mrs Van Lancker said, that this ought to become compulsory reading for all those involved in the application of structural fund interventions in Belgium."
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now move to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Like the rapporteur, I am delighted with the success and quality of the programmes arising from objective 3 in the context of Community structural measures in French-speaking Belgium."
"But that is indeed the only reason for satisfaction because, with him, I can only be alarmed, on the evidence, first by the dramatically worrying position Wallonia is in, and then by its current incapacity to make full use of the oxygen supply provided by Europe."
"The report first condemns the very low rate of consumption of the appropriations for objectives 1, 2 and 5b, which target the development and structural adjustment of the regions assisted, as well as their conversion."
"Must it be deduced that in certain sub-regions, even while money is made available, the economic numbness is such that there is no longer even the capacity to draw up projects to utilize it?"
"The report then states that the implementation of objective 4 also shows enormous underconsumption of appropriations."
"If the rapporteur is to be believed, the fault essentially lies with the incompetence of the regional and local authorities, whose methods of operating, heavy and slow, prove, on analysis - notably in Hainaut - inadequate and incapable of rivalling, in terms of job creation, other European regions which have less Community aid."
"The report condemns in barely concealed terms the local baronies and power relations which dictate the nature of the projects, and I quote: ""without any concern for synergy or complementarity' , which, to quote again, are ""aimed more at giving satisfaction to local politicians than to providing sustainable development' ."
"Furthermore, in all these cases the financing of the research and development and technological innovation projects record important delays while ""the selection of strategies is unsatisfactory in some cases... (and) there would appear to be too much investment in traditional industries given that the aim is to diversify the region's economy' ."
"That is an extremely critical statement and a warning against the archaic attitudes and the inertia which are hindering the economic recovery of Wallonia, and I can only associate myself with that statement."
"Describing a situation with all the cruelty of the reality is a first step, at once painful and necessary."
"But after the lucid statement must come the project and the strategy."
"That is the task to which I shall henceforth devote myself, with all those who are determined to bring Wallonia out of its sclerosis and its underdevelopment."
"The structural funds measures have certainly had a major impact on Hainaut."
"However, they have still proved inadequate to achieve a genuine reduction of the disparities and unemployment in the regions most affected economically and especially in the rural regions where slow but continuous depopulation is causing deterioration in the demographic structural factors and economic development."
"The rapporteur has emphasized the very low rate of consumption of the appropriations - for both objective 1 and objective 4 - and I am persuaded of the need for those appropriations to be better distributed in the future."
"Mr Decourrière's report draws up a clear and precise table for the utilization of the structural funds, particularly in Hainaut."
"There are positive aspects and there are fears and criticisms, which we must take into account."
"Personally I think point 39 of the resolution is particularly important."
"Management and relations with the Commission are not easy."
"The Commission does not always show flexibility, it must associate itself better with the regions and communities in the establishment and implementation of the programmes."
"That completes Parliament's agenda."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 1.25 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 4 December 1997."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of 4 December 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, last Friday the European Council in Luxembourg approved unanimously a resolution renouncing and condemning the terrorist organization ETA, and the following day the Basque people took to the streets in mass demonstrations, demanding exactly what we are offering to the eastern European countries knocking at our door: peace, liberty and democracy."
"Mr President, I would like you to make a public statement on behalf of this House, to express our support for the aspirations of the Basque people, and our sympathy for the family of José Luis Caso, who was murdered for having been democratically elected to represent Basques like himself."
"Mr President, I support what Mr Galeote has just said. I should like to add that we think murdering José Luis Caso, a simple town councillor in the small Basque town of Rentería, for the way he lived his life and represented his fellow citizens, was an attack against Spain's democracy, the democratic institutions of the Basque Country, and the great European democracy which we are all building."
"We are pleased that the European Council in Luxembourg has made such a clear statement, and we are aware, Mr President, that you have already conveyed Parliament's condolences, and will give all the support you can to the victim's family."
"I believe Parliament is to receive a visit tomorrow from the family of the town councillor Miguel Ángel Blanco, who was murdered in Ermua, and Vice-President Cot is going to lead a meeting to provide information and support for all the victims of terrorism in Spain and Europe."
"It is in that spirit that my group wishes to express its full support, and its commitment to working energetically to ensure that such acts cannot be committed in the future."
"On behalf of the Spanish socialists, I should like to say that the murder of Councillor Caso is an attack against democratic principles, and against the Spanish people's attempt to construct a stable and lasting democracy. It is yet another manifestation of the totalitarianism which sometimes lurks in some of our European societies."
"I should like to thank you, Mr President, for having sent our condolences. I am very pleased with the declaration made at the European Council in Luxembourg, and I hope this Parliament and our other institutions continue to support the efforts of the Spanish people to live in peace and democracy."
"Thank you, Mr Medina."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think the three speakers have expressed the feelings of the whole House."
"I share the same view, as I made clear at the time of the European Council declaration."
"I should also like to remind you that tomorrow, at 6 p.m., as Mr Puerta has mentioned, we will be holding a meeting which will be open to all Members of this House, to express our support for all the victims of terrorism - in Spain and in Europe as a whole - and this House's strong will and commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms wherever it occurs."
"Mr President, on Wednesday, the day after tomorrow, we will all witness the extremely significant moment when the Sakharov prize is awarded."
"It is of exceptional significance this year, its tenth year, since it is the fiftieth anniversary of human rights."
"In 1995 our Kurdish colleague in the Turkish parliament, Leyla Zana, was honoured with the Sakharov prize for her unrelenting struggles, on account of which she was mercilessly persecuted and incarcerated by the Turkish government."
"Mr President, we recall Mrs Zana's speech to this House on the 12 January 1996, which was read to us by her husband because she could not be present, and which ended with the plea, ""I ask for the help of the European Parliament in putting an end to the tragedy which is afflicting my people.'"
"Today, two years later, Leyla Zana is still in a Turkish prison, despite the fact that she has gained a reputation worldwide as a symbol of the peaceful struggle for a solution to the problem and for the survival of her people."
"Mr President, since the issue of the rapprochement of Turkey with the European Union is somewhat topical, I think that today the European Council, in keeping with its principles, should request and demand from the Turkish government the immediate release of our colleague, Mrs Zana, whom we in this House honoured with the Sakharov prize."
"Thank you, Mr Papakyriazis."
"In any case, I should like to remind Members of this House that the best way to show support for the way Parliament awards the Sakharov prize is to show a good attendance at the partsession to be held on Wednesday at 12 noon, when this year's prize will be presented to Salima Ghezali, in recognition of work which is similar to Leyla Zana's."
"Mr President, on a point of order: as you may know, the United States has apparently imposed a ban on the import of European beef into the United States."
"This has not yet been officially confirmed but I believe it to be the case."
"That, coupled with the other rumours circulating about both beef and lamb, suggests to me that it would be important for the Commission to make a statement to this House, particularly after the Council meeting today."
"I wonder whether you could put that request to it at some stage this week."
"It has been discussed by the Conference of Presidents."
"As these are rumours rather than facts it was decided that it would be better to make a statement in January when we have all the facts and a statement by the Commission."
"Mr President, without wanting to get into the substance of the debate, which would mean my getting slightly bitter, please allow me to point out that I heard this afternoon from Mrs Bonino that she is assuming she will issue a statement tomorrow evening after the Commission has met."
"I gathered from the agenda that this statement will take place tomorrow evening at 9.00 p.m., here in this House, followed by a debate on the issue."
"I was proceeding from this assumption until two minutes ago, and Mrs Bonino is proceeding from this assumption too."
"For this to be the case, the Rules of Procedure state that there has to be a change to the agenda, which obviously has not happened at the moment."
"Oh, I beg your pardon. I made a mistake."
"In fact, the agenda states that at 9 p.m. there will be a Commission statement on beef and veal products posing a potential health risk, followed by a debate."
"Allow me to correct myself."
"You are right, Mrs Roth-Behrendt; it is on the agenda and will be debated tomorrow."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I was going to make the same point."
"It is right that we should have that debate at 9 o'clock on Tuesday night, as agreed."
"Mr President, rather than get into a long debate about this, could we not simply agree that the item that is scheduled for tomorrow night at 9 p.m. could cover all the aspects concerned, including lamb as well as veal and beef?"
"I assume that is what the Conference of Presidents intended when they put this on the agenda."
"It will depend on the Commissioner and his statement, of course."
"Mr President, a statement will indeed be made tomorrow at 9 p.m. by the Commission, on beef and veal posing a potential health risk."
"But what appals me, Mr President, is that this declaration will be followed by a debate, but not by the Parliament taking a position."
"There will be no resolution or vote."
"And there will be no resolution or vote taken on the labelling of genetically modified organisms, a matter to be debated on Friday morning."
"I believe that the items contained in the statement from the Commission will be very much in earnest."
"Doubtless a prohibition of imports from the United States, doubtless a modification on the prohibition on use of specified risk material, which should in theory come into force on 1 January next."
"In short, matters which are of extreme importance, and it is inconceivable that the European Parliament should not take a clear position in a timely fashion, in other words, right now, and not in one or two months, when the European Parliament will be able to do no more than deplore what has already happened."
"Mr Berthu, you were present at the Conference of Presidents which decided not to make any resolutions, just as I was."
"The conference indeed considered that a debate was necessary, but that there would not, in all likelihood, be enough substance to justify a resolution without the appropriate committees expressing an opinion on the matter."
"This was the explanation proffered to the Conference of Presidents."
"You were there as I was."
"I was keen to make this information available to this House."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to agree with what you said about the position on this date with America, but perhaps I could help you a little bit with regard to Mr Hallam making a cheap political point."
"He should know that British beef has been banned from America for a number of years and that it is his government that is causing a problem for the beef industry by refusing to revalue the 'green pound' ."
"Mr Sturdy, this is not the place to discuss the internal problems of any Member State."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we have a very full agenda."
"Please let us not waste time now in mutual recriminations."
"Mr President, I do not intend to get involved in the debate."
"I would just like to say something about procedure and congratulate the Conference of Presidents on its wisdom."
"Last month, in November, we adopted a far-reaching resolution with very few omissions in it."
"To do so again this month would not be sensible in my view."
"I would ask those colleagues who deem this necessary to consider the fact that in February we will be debating the next Commission report - the first of the half-yearly reports - and will have to come to a decision on that."
"That is to say, in the space of just three months, we will have more BSE resolutions to adopt."
"I think that will be fun enough, so we can afford ourselves the luxury tomorrow of having a discussion that will provide us with the necessary information."
"This way we can save ourselves having to detail a resolution considering the Commission's report in February."
"Mr President, I just want to say to Mr Hallam that had the government of his country observed..."
"No, Mr Gallagher, there will be no further debate on that matter."
"Mr President, I indicated my desire to speak at the start."
"Forgive me if I do not comment on the question of British beef."
"I do not want to join Mrs Roth-Behrendt in congratulating the Conference of Presidents; on the contrary!"
"Tomorrow the Committee on External Economic Relations will meet, chaired by Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan."
"Given the subject under discussion, it should be a matter of urgency this week."
"We are now obliged to make this an informal meeting without the involvement of interpreters."
"I merely wanted to protest that, while each working party and intergroup can meet here under sensible conditions, a committee discussing the sort of important matters that need to be dealt with this week, cannot!"
"I would ask that this way of organizing things cease."
"Mr Posselt, this decision was made by the Conference of Presidents."
"The decision to hold committee meetings in Brussels has been explained to the committee chairmen and to each and every one of the committees."
"If you think it ought to be changed, you should approach the Conference of Presidents, but now is neither the time nor the place to make such alterations."
"Mr President, I would like to ask a question on the basis of article 22, section 5. Can the Bureau as soon as possible provide the necessary resources for employees in the post room, who are not able to do their work satisfactorily, and can the chauffeurs who have to sit in that terribly cold corner of the entrance hall in Brussels be given better accommodation?"
"We are now well set up to do our work properly; I think our valued colleagues should be in the same position."
"Mr President, you often come in for a lot of flak on these occasions and I think it is only right that on some occasions you should receive some compliments as well."
"I would ask you to pass on our thanks to all the services involved in moving us into our new offices in Brussels for the way this was carried out."
"There were some small difficulties but, on the whole, this massive undertaking was carried out with exceptional efficiency."
"Please pass this on to all concerned."
"Thank you, Mr Provan."
"I can say to Mrs van Bladel that the Secretary-General is looking for a better place for the chauffeurs in the new building."
"Thank you for your remarks: we had a team that worked very well and we must congratulate the Secretary-General on providing the team for that very successful operation."
"Mr President, it was to raise a point about the minutes that I asked for the floor, just when you introduced the first point on the agenda."
"I would like to make a comment about page five of the minutes of the meeting of 4 December, and more particularly on the response to my point raised under Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure."
"In my speech, I reminded the House that on 19 November, I had submitted a written declaration formally registering my concern regarding the regularity and transparency of procedures governing our operating and investment expenditure."
"I wished all members to be in a position to give their opinion on all the questions and all the rumours which surround these matters."
"You replied, Mr President, that you had referred the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"And indeed, in a letter dated 3 December, you wrote that you were actually referring the matter to the Rules Committee that very day."
"Mr President, the Rules Committee met on 8 and 9 December."
"It had still not received this letter."
"As of today, 15 December, no submission has yet been received from you on the subject."
"I would like to ask you why things have taken so long."
"I would like to know why your entourage, why your services, why your staff are so unwilling to push this procedural matter forward, on a question of whose importance for the image of our Parliament you are well aware."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I signed the referral to place the matter in the hands of the Rules Committee as soon as I was able to do so, given that I was travelling in Great Britain."
"The document has been sent today, after going through the registration procedures - you know that there are formalities with regard to internal mail."
"So I have signed it."
"You know that there are formalities which we are trying to reduce, but which are still somewhat slowmoving."
"Bear with me, the official document has gone to the Rules Committee, which will receive it today."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Order of business"
"With the agreement of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mrs Redondo Jiménez requests that her report on the control of Pseudomonas solanacearum (Smith) Smith should be taken without debate."
"Mr Colino Salamanca, the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, has the floor."
"Mr President, the amendments to that report were approved unanimously in committee."
"There is no problem."
"The request can therefore be granted."
"I put Mrs Redondo Jiménez's request to the House."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"The vote on this report will therefore be taken on Tuesday, at 12 noon."
"I have received a request signed by Mr Ford and 28 other people, asking that a Commission statement on UEFA's decision not to allow the winners of the Coca Cola cup to take part in the European Cup competitions should be added to the agenda."
"Because this part-session's agenda is so full, if it is decided to include such a statement, the only place it could be added is at the end of the Friday session."
"Mr Ford has the floor to present this request for amendment."
"Mr President, that will be perfectly acceptable at the end of business on Friday morning if the House is so agreeable."
"Does anybody wish to speak in support of the request?"
"Anybody against?"
"No?"
"Then we shall proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"The order of business has been adopted thus amended."
"Green Paper on a partnership for a new organization of work"
"The next item is the report (A4-0313/97) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission Green Paper ""Partnership for a new organization of work' ."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for an excellent Green Paper."
"I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my fellow Committee members for excellent collaboration within the Committee in drawing up this report."
"As far as changes in the organization of work are concerned, we can state that we are lagging behind the USA and Japan."
"That is a fact and not an estimation."
"I believe, you see, that if we are to change the organization of work in Europe, we should choose our own model, based among other things on the social model, and not plagiarize models from the USA and Japan."
"I would also like to say a few words about the word flexibility."
"This is a word which is steeped in taboos."
"For me flexibility is about a connection with security."
"The fact is that you can never create a flexible organization of work unless you also have a well-developed labour law, an active labour market policy and a right to in-house training for employees, etcetera."
"It is not a case of one model if we want to create new organizations of work in Europe, but many."
"Things are different for different sectors and different for different companies."
"What they have in common and what is important is that the parties in the labour market are involved at both industry and company level."
"However, turning to the Group of the European People's Party and Amendment 4, we should not interfere in the way the parties in the labour market organize themselves."
"It is important for small and medium-sized enterprises to be included. However, it is not we, but the employers themselves who should decide how small and medium-sized enterprises should be represented in employer organizations."
"Changes in the organization of work affect a multitude of policy areas, including taxation."
"The Committee now recommends, as before, a reduction in taxation which involves reduced tax on work and increased tax on energy, the environment and capital."
"We therefore also oppose the amendment from the UPE Group which concerns a general reduction in taxation."
"We want tax changes, not a general suppression of taxes."
"The other policy area which is affected by the issue is labour law."
"On a previous occasion an agreement on parttime work was approved in this House."
"However, that is not enough. It is just as important for us to have changes and security where atypical forms of work are concerned."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commission when it intends to return to regulation and security in the question of atypical forms of work."
"We also have proposals on minimum standards with regard to information, consultation and participation."
"What is the Commission's position on binding minimum standards in these important areas?"
"The third policy area which I shall touch on is working hours."
"This is largely a question for the parties in the labour market, but society should give the basic standards and create incentives to shorten working hours."
"We previously put forward proposals about this in the Rocard report."
"We now return to the subject. When is the Commission going to produce its own proposals on shorter working hours?"
"When are we going to get the intervention which has been promised so many times with regard to the situation in Europe on the question of shortening working hours?"
"In the fourth place, training is important where changing the organization of work is concerned."
"However, in this respect the situation is gloomy."
"We know that only one in three employees has access to training."
"In small and medium-sized enterprises the situation is even worse."
"There it is only one in ten employees."
"We have to support the small and medium-sized enterprises, but we cannot, as the Green Group proposes, go into supporting certain forms of ownership."
"I am a warm supporter of worker-owned companies, but we cannot go into supporting certain forms of ownership."
"However, we should support small and medium-sized enterprises."
"A change in the organization of work is a long-term measure."
"It is also important to involved the employees."
"On the question of health risks, a lot can be done to improve health and safety."
"However, there is also a danger."
"There are also examples of organizational changes which have made things worse, and it is reasonable for employers to have more responsibility for the costs of the working environment."
"We are therefore opposed to the proposal from the UPE Group which weakens the position which the Committee has taken."
"I would also like to address the area of equal opportunities."
"What the Commission says is positive."
"What the Committee on Women's Rights has said is also positive, and I also support the amendment from the Group of the European People's Party concerning the equal opportunity aspects and responsibility for the family both for men and women."
"Finally I would like to thank the Commission for a good Green Paper, and I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for a constructive collaboration, both within the Committee and hopefully also now that we are considering the matter in this part-session."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Jan Andersson on his excellent report and the Commission because the Green Paper itself picked up on all of the most important themes in the future organization of work."
"I would like to make just three brief points."
"The first is that, as the rapporteur himself says, we now need to convert this comprehensive analysis into practical action in the framework of the next social action programme."
"For example, we need to seek urgently, either a framework agreement on necessary instruments on working time management, or action on forms of atypical work contracts other than part-time contracts."
"The second point is that these actions are going to require the use of both the negotiating track and the legislative track under the new Social Chapter."
"We need therefore to have a clear interinstitutional agreement setting out the mechanisms and timetables which will operate to make sure that we do act expeditiously."
"You yourself, President, have raised this issue in the Trialogue."
"I hope that when it is reached on the agenda of the Trialogue, the Commission will take it very seriously and that we will manage to achieve some progress under the British presidency."
"My third and final point is that we need a new understanding with the Member States and Council that there are very important social matters outstanding which can only and must be addressed at European level: for example the mobility of labour, another important aspect in this Green Paper."
"We must end the logjam of the last two or three years in the social sphere and get things moving once again."
"Otherwise I have a genuine fear that the internal market that all capitals see as being of crucial importance will be subject to increasing and massive disruption."
"We must get the balance right."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those who are following either from close by or from a distance the diversification of employment contracts, employment statutes, mobility of labour and flexibility of working hours, will observe that the existing employment system needs to be adjusted."
"The employment regulations in force must be adapted because of fundamental changes in both the economic sphere, and in the social sphere."
"Those who do not take this into account, will be overtaken by these changes."
"Europe's responsibility in this entire area is not easily defined, however."
"Who takes part in the negotiations?"
"Who takes part in the partnership?"
"Does it involve informal exchanges of ideas, or negotiations aimed at agreement?"
"What does organization of work mean?"
"We are talking about health and safety at work and working hours in particular."
"We are talking about salary conditions, employment conditions in general, insurance against industrial accidents and occupational illness, education, vocational training, labour market policy, target group policy; these are all elements which form part of this, and which are discussed in the Green Paper, but it is not always clear what Europe's role in this is."
"We believe that Europe must be able to apply a certain legislative authority which can modulate the big inequalities which also exist today between the different Member States; and to try and achieve a certain harmony."
"In that sense I would like to agree with the proposals made by the rapporteur and Mr Hughes just now for the next social action programme."
"In all this, we must not overlook some basic principles, and in this respect we also agree with the rapporteur, that both the opportunities for economic growth and its promotion must be taken into account, but on the other hand that the opportunities for employees to retain their jobs, and also to preserve social security must be borne in mind."
"It is this balance which we call the European social model, and we would like to preserve, improve and adapt this European social model where necessary in this new organization of work."
"It should be clear that it should not involve something whereby the gain of one thing is at the expense of something else."
"On behalf of my group I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for his report, and for agreeing with most of our amendments."
"I have just heard that the rapporteur also agrees with an amendment which we are submitting once again, in connection in particular with the effect of the organization of work on the family. We believe there is no point in increasing growth, strengthening competitiveness, employment and employment security, if this is to bring about a deterioration in family life."
"I would like to draw the attention of the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, once more to the role of SMEs and the negotiation on the level of the social partners, in which the specific representation of SMEs must also become possible."
"In that sense we are also prepared to support the report tomorrow."
"Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Andersson on his report despite the misgiving that I have with regard to some parts of it."
"The biggest changes that are taking place in the workplace and with regard to work are the changes in technology."
"We need to consider how best we can adapt and retrain our employees to ensure that they can get the maximum benefit and the maximum advantage to gain new types of work."
"To that extent there are some very welcome initiatives coming from the Andersson report and from the Commission's Green Paper."
"However, there are also some anomalies within the report that we should be highlighting, for example, this proposal for a tax on capital."
"If you are not going to invest capital in new machinery, in training, in new plant, in new equipment and so on, how do you expect to employ more people?"
"If you are not going to bring in flexibility with regard to the types of work that people want to reconcile the family and working life then you will be denying people, particularly women, the opportunity to work."
"Therefore, I would ask the Commission, when it gets this report back from the Parliament, to study very carefully the effect in every single country."
"Mr President, colleagues, I would also like to thank Mr Andersson for his excellent report."
"I think we have a report before us which is keeping pace with the times."
"In relation to the globalization of the economy, the information society and demographic developments, we are facing enormous reforms of our system as regards working methods."
"To permit these reforms, policy measures will have to be supportive, and in this context I would like to point to our social security systems, in particular pension schemes."
"The way they are organized at the moment means that there is still a problem in many countries with regard to the portability of the value of a pension, or to put it another way, in many countries people interrupt their pensions. In Germany, for example, there are long qualifying periods."
"In addition I would like to highlight training systems."
"The rapporteur says quite rightly that we will have to learn and train throughout our lives."
"He does say, however, with regard to the Christian-Democrat amendments, that we should not interfere in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Those looking at the figures relating to this point will notice that small and medium-sized firms have great difficulty in investing in the expenses associated with life-long learning, and I think it is extremely important to include small and medium-sized firms in the reforms of the organization of work; on that point, my group will therefore support the amendment of the Christian-Democratic Group."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to mention atypical work."
"We will have to move towards a system in which people can choose the hours they work, whether to work part-time or not, whether to work as an employee or freelance, and our social security system should be adapted to suit this. I hope that the Commission will take this into account when developing the proposals further."
"Mr President, first I would like to congratulate Jan Andersson, the rapporteur, on his success in being able to include in the report the criticisms the Standing Committee on Employment and Social Welfare posed in respect of the Commission's Green Paper."
"The conclusion the Commission's Green Paper draws, that the reorganization of work casts doubt on the whole basis of labour legislation and labour market relationships, is, in my opinion, pretty peculiar, to say the least."
"Labour legislation, at least as far as we are concerned in Finland, does not impose restrictions on development and development policy, which the Green Paper refers to."
"There are plenty of examples of this."
"It is perfectly possible to come up with new and flexible solutions for work organization within the framework of present legislation."
"Flexibility with security, as Mr Andersson said, is incredibly important."
"It is extremely unwise to get into a situation where new developments come in at the expense of legislation and normal negotiation procedure."
"The reorganization of work cannot come about by tampering with this legislation; the result would be mayhem."
"In the ever-changing work scenario we need legislation to ensure the security of individuals."
"Without security and guarantees, workers will find it hard to adapt to new developments in work."
"That is why it is crucial that the principle of employee protection must be given far more weight than it is now in any further discussion or movement on the reorganization of work."
"I, along with the Committee on Women's Rights, am deeply concerned about how the position of women will be affected in the changing work scenario."
"There is a great risk that a two-tier system is being created: there are those who are in permanent employment, and those who do atypical work."
"I fear that women are mainly of the latter type."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Andersson on what I think has become a good and important report in many different respects."
"According to the Commission's Green Paper, new forms of organization of work are needed in order to be able to increase the competitiveness of the Union's companies."
"This then requires us to have more flexible workers."
"At the same time it is said that this flexibility of labour should be combined with security for workers."
"I do not think we can emphasize this enough , and Mr Andersson has also tried to convey this in the report."
"Productivity and flexibility should not therefore be overriding goals. Instead they must go hand in hand with social security, a guarantee of employees' rights and the aim of creating more jobs."
"In that context I do think that Mr Andersson could have been a bit clearer with regard to the shortening of working hours, since it is only said that people should continue to examine whether shortening working hours might be a way."
"I think we have already done that quite sufficiently."
"The only thing remaining is the demand for a comprehensive shortening of working hours."
"As far as our Amendment No 6 is concerned, the Green Paper also says that influence and participation are important matters for a new organization of work."
"I therefore think it is important that we support employee-owned companies and make things easier for them."
"Of course it is a political decision and a policy measure, but we are not going in and creating companies. Instead we are making things easier for companies and supporting them."
"I think we should do that if we want a development with participation and transparency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join in expressing my gratitude for the good report, which is important, but also very complex."
"I would also like to thank the Commission because, in this report, it has once again grasped and accentuated the consensus view of this House, by attaching the same importance to flexibility and social security as to boosting competition and employment."
"It is important for us because we want to defend and extend this European social model, which is built on solidarity and consensus."
"I also find it interesting that the Commission has presented us here with a variety of models and proposals."
"What I miss, though, is an action plan."
"And I am not on my own in this, for this action plan has been requested by all speakers in this House."
"There is, however, a huge gap between insight and the action needed."
"I would like to stress a few points here."
"Firstly - as has been stated - there is the question of further and continued education."
"We want to assist the SMEs in assuring and improving quality because we know they are not always in the position to create the necessary conditions either technically or in terms of human resources."
"I would also like to mention - which has partly been forgotten - that further education is needed for our management too."
"My second point concerns equal opportunities for women."
"The Commission's Green Paper overlooks one or two things here."
"We have been used to better things from you in the past, and I would ask you to study the statement from the Committee on Women's Rights, which is attached to this report and which we all support."
"My third point concerns the modernization of job organization."
"This involves greater worker participation, more cooperation and codetermination and not less."
"Finally it should be noted that the Green Paper has taken up many of the suggestions from the European Parliament in the last few years."
"We are now ready and willing to turn them into reality together with the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, I am sorry but I cannot say that I agree with this document as it stands, or with the contents of the Green Paper."
"Both documents start from shared and acceptable assumptions such as workers' safety, social protection, equal opportunities for women and the disabled, space for immigrants, worker profitsharing and introduction of new technologies, but then they go on to say that a reduction in hours may ensure greater competitiveness, better working conditions and a rise in employment without affecting production: everything, and the opposite of everything."
"The report does not take account in the slightest of the cries of alarm from businessmen, for whom a 35-hour week would mean greater costs, lower productivity, a freeze on investments, a threat to the survival of weaker companies and, ultimately, the danger of job losses."
"Don't you think so?"
"We need only look at the experience of Germany where, after the introduction of the 35-hour week, they are now quickly taking a step backwards."
"Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party may I again welcome the Commission's Green Paper and congratulate Mr Andersson on his factual and well-balanced report."
"The object is to improve the competitiveness of the European economy and, with it, the employment situation."
"There are new aspects to be found in the present Green Paper and the report: with regard to the site discussion, for instance, it says that we should not just conduct a cost debate on this issue."
"Europe cannot compete in the world in terms of wages, but ultimately only on productivity."
"This presupposes an increase in motivation, and associated with that new forms of remuneration, changes to job organization, improvement in qualifications and life-long study."
"I was very pleased that Mr Andersson refers in clause 19 to promoting worker profit-sharing."
"I would like to go a step further and make a connection with greater mobility in pay policy."
"Finally, I want to go into a much discussed issue."
"Of course, management decides on the introduction of new forms of organization."
"However, I agree with the report from the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment when it calls for worker participation in decision-making. There are three reasons for this."
"Firstly, group work that goes against the will of the workers cannot function well."
"Secondly, new technologies and organizational forms should not be introduced all at once, but only after the workers have been properly informed and consulted."
"Thirdly, if workers' experiences from their present working environment are drawn on, then this will improve company productivity."
"That is why, for me, the title of the Green Paper is also the programme: a new organization in the spirit of partnership."
"Our companies need better forms of job organization, in the interest of increased employment too, and these need to be created in partnership."
"In this sense we endorse Mr Andersson's report."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding report."
"There are some major questions on the European agenda in the coming years."
"Expansion is the most important, but achieving full employment is one of the major ones."
"We will do this in our own, European way, as the rapporteur writes, and this means amongst other things that viability, equality and equal opportunities are centre stage."
"Viability means that we must shift taxation from labour to taxation on pollution and resources."
"Without such a shift, we will merely be leaving an unholy legacy for our descendants to clear up."
"Equality means amongst other things that there must be equality for men and women, including in the next generation, that is, our children."
"And, here, men as managers and staff and fathers must exercise more understanding and commitment in practice than is the case today."
"Not only for women's sake, but also for the sake of the children, who feel happy if their fathers are really there for them."
"And finally, equal opportunities, and here I am thinking in particular of the disabled, to whom we must give real opportunities for getting involved in work."
"If we can combine these three concepts, we will have the basis for creating our own path in Europe."
"Mr President, the Commission Green Paper does not offer anything new."
"As in the case of all Union policies, the policy concerning the organization of labour gives way to capital interests and demands."
"There is great unease since the pace of labour market reform in Europe is lagging behind that of the United States and Japan, and this can be interpreted as a demand for the widespread acceptance in essence of part-time work and the quashing of workers' basic rights and achievements."
"Unfortunately the report of Mr Andersson, apart from certain important ideas contained in it, is tending in the same general direction."
"Mr President, workers are not worried about the pace of the reforms but about their direction."
"They are demanding and fighting for a general reduction in working hours without a reduction in pay. The first essential step is the 35-hour, 7-hour a day, five-day working week, with pay, work and social security protection for those who are forced to work with part-time or atypical work contracts."
"Only if the organization of labour moves in such a direction, will it be in tune with workers' demands and aspirations."
"Mr President, this report is a really good piece of work."
"Organizing the future labour market is a large task, but this report does a good job of covering not only the opportunities but also the risks involved in the new organization of work."
"A more flexible labour market may benefit both employers and employees."
"To employees, it means more varied and exciting work and slightly more fringe benefits."
"To employers, it means more flexible staff who are willing to 'do that bit extra' for the business."
"As Europeans, we get competitive businesses which can hold their own against the USA and Japan... there is not a dry eye!"
"And how!"
"We must make sure that the weakest employees, such as women, do not become the losers on the future labour market."
"Because there is reason to fear that, while the strong and most flexible will manage to exploit the new challenges and opportunities, those in weaker positions, such as the poorly-educated, will find it even harder to keep up."
"I think the rapporteur hits the nail on the head when he warns that there will be two classes in future: an underclass of untrained, vulnerable and mainly female workers, who will typically be homeworkers; and, on the other hand, a highly educated overclass enjoying all the benefits of the new technology."
"Nor does the Commission's Green Paper focus on the effects of equal opportunities now that employees have to be more flexible when it comes to working hours."
"Most households have set themselves up in such a way that women are flexible in relation to the family, by working part-time for example, while men are flexible in relation to their jobs by working overtime, etcetera. This model must be used if women are also to have the chance to benefit from the new opportunities existing on the labour market."
"Mr President, the labour market is changing rapidly today because of globalization and new technology."
"Our efforts should therefore be directed away from collectivism and things done on a large scale in favour of individual agreements and easily adaptable organizations."
"Mr Andersson's well-written report concludes that Europe is lagging behind competitors like the USA and Japan."
"I believe that rigid sets of rules create hierarchies and centralism and that the rate of modernization lags behind."
"I believe the change we see today must be taken heed of and accepted."
"Our debates here must be based on the labour market of tomorrow."
"In my opinion attempts at EU level or at national level to intervene in the organization of companies or in another way to limit their freedom of action will be counterproductive, that is, they will not help to create new jobs and increase employment."
"Modernizing the organization of work in companies is a question of competitiveness and survival, and it obviously requires participation and willingness to change."
"To support this I believe our conclusion should be that we need fewer, not more rules in Europe's labour markets."
"I am afraid that the approach of the Green Paper and of the Andersson report do not facilitate modernization and enterprise."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the report."
"I agree with you, Mr Andersson, on most things, but I would like to help widen the perspective a little."
"When we talk about a new organization of work, we must not link it only to existing activities. We also have to think of new forms of work."
"Traditional activities, such as the production of goods and today's public sector, are declining."
"Naturally, we must concentrate more on services, on knowledge and information and on creating experiences, that is, on areas which are both socially and environmentally positive for people and for the world around us."
"In that respect I am very pleased that Mr Andersson raised the question of tax changes, that we should reduce tax on work."
"It is absurd to have, as we do in Europe, the highest taxation on the resource which we most wish to use."
"Instead we could increase taxes on the environment."
"However, I believe it would be beneficial, and on this point we may have different opinions, if we could reduce taxes a little more than we increase them."
"Otherwise we will probably never compete with the USA and Japan."
"Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Andersson on an excellent report on the Green Paper on a new organization of work."
"The principal aim of the Green Paper was to promote a debate on how we can improve employment and competitiveness through a better organization of work, and a high level of competence and quality, and at the same time guarantee social security."
"The response to the Commission's Green Paper has been very positive."
"The Commission also welcomes the support which this House is giving the Green Paper and we shall take account of the proposals and opinions which Parliament presents in its report."
"The Commission is going to follow up the Green Paper over the next year."
"Our intention is to create a European network in which Member States can exchange experiences in this area."
"Only today there is a meeting of the employment and social ministers."
"Last month a summit on employment was held in Luxembourg."
"We expect the Council of Ministers today to approve formally the guidelines for employment policy which the Commission presented at the summit."
"The guidelines we have presented are based on four main pillars: employability, enterprise, adaptability and equality between women and men."
"These guidelines are also reflected in the Green Paper, not least with regard to adaptability."
"At this point I would like to remind you that last month the European Council invited the parties in the labour market to negotiate agreements on modernizing the organization of work."
"Such negotiations should take place at all suitable levels, i.e. local, regional and national levels, and also at company level and across industries."
"This also applies, of course, to the question of working hours which was raised by the rapporteur."
"I assume that we agree that the emphasis here should lie on the parties in the labour market, or, in other words, on partnership."
"That is the recurring theme if you want to modernize working life."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation"
"The next item is the report (A4-0372/97) by Mrs Waddington, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation (COM(96)0567 - C4-0638/96)."
"Mr President, trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation is an increasing global trade which involves women from poorer countries being forced into sexual slavery in the EU and elsewhere."
"Two examples were reported last month."
"Firstly, the case of a hundred Brazilian women, aged between 18 and 25, who were persuaded to come to London to work as nannies, maids and dancers."
"Once in the UK, they were forced to work as prostitutes, working six to seven days a week, twelve hours a day."
"Their passports and all their earnings were confiscated by the traffickers."
"Secondly, research published last month revealed that tens of thousands of women from Russia, Ukraine, Latvia and Belarus are being duped with lucrative offers to work as au pairs and waitresses in the European Union, only to find themselves trapped in prostitution."
"The former Soviet bloc has become the main source of women and children trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation."
"This report by the Committee on Women's Rights recommends a number of measures to protect women and combat trafficking."
"It proposes information campaigns in the countries of origin which warn women of the dangers of falling into the hands of the mafia-type organizations responsible for trafficking."
"It calls upon Member States to provide more protection and support for the victims, since victims and their families are at extreme risk of violence and intimidation."
"It underlines the importance of taking effective sanctions against those organizations and individuals involved in trafficking."
"It suggests that a range of Community programmes, including STOP and DAPHNE, could be developed and used more effectively to combat trafficking in women, support the victims and enable them to rebuild their lives."
"It proposes that non-governmental organizations, which are close to the victims, should be given maximum access to Community programmes so that they can help the potential victims and survivors of sexual exploitation and enforced prostitution."
"It urges that gender equality and the need to combat trafficking in the countries of origin are featured in the EU development programmes and EU negotiations on enlargement, since this trade is primarily fuelled by women's poverty and their lack of power and opportunity in these countries."
"This Parliament should congratulate Commissioner Gradin on the work she has done in this field, persuading Member States to begin to work together to combat this trade in women."
"By supporting this report, we will be providing further encouragement for action against the exploitation of vulnerable women whose human rights are being violated, and we will enable more measures to be taken to support the victims of sexual slavery in rebuilding their lives."
"I hope that this report will be adopted unanimously by this Parliament, as it was in the Committee on Women's Rights, because then the work of Commissioner Gradin can gather momentum and force, and we will truly be able to say that this European Union is taking every possible step to avoid the victimization of women and violation of their human rights."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Susan Waddington and Maria Colombo Svevo most sincerely for their excellent report, but I would also like to thank Commissioner Gradin for her passionate dedication to the fight against trafficking in women."
"Since the previous report, the United Nations and more especially the European Union have made a great deal of effort to tackle the problem of trafficking in women."
"But despite all European agreements, the Member States have not managed to enter into the fight against trafficking in women effectively."
"I believe there are two reasons for this."
"First and foremost the enormous complexity of the problem, but secondly the fact that the wrong approach was used to tackle the problem."
"Maria Colombo Svevo made a reference to the latter just now."
"Countries would rather battle against trafficking in women, against illegal immigration, than against the most brutal violation of human rights."
"Even though it is worthy of consideration, even though it is good that in some countries there are some forms of temporary protection against women, concern for victims is still very selective."
"It only applies to women who have lodged a complaint, who have started legal proceedings which may develop into successful prosecutions against dealers."
"We demand that all victims are protected, and that all victims are given a chance to start a new life."
"Secondly, the complexity."
"Trafficking in women for sexual exploitation concerns prostitution by force, and au pair, marriage and employment agencies."
"It has links with drug dealing, and the black market circuit."
"As long as countries do not tackle trafficking in women in similar ways, do not penalize it in similar ways, do not employ the similar penalties, prison sentences and impoundage of goods, as long as there is inefficient international policing and judicial cooperation, we will not be able to tackle trafficking in women effectively."
"Finally, Madam President, I would like to say that you have done a lot of work concerning trafficking in women within the European Union."
"The Parliament supports you very emphatically in this."
"The problem is however, that the agreements with the Council of Ministers are not legally binding, not enforceable."
"We hope that this statement which the Commission has given us, and Parliament's report, will lead us to a European Convention on human trafficking following the review in 1999; not until then can human trafficking be tackled truly efficiently."
"Mr President, I would like to join colleagues in expressing my admiration to Commissioner Gradin and to Mrs Waddington for this excellent report."
"I should also like to be a little bit nationalistic and say that I am extremely happy that it was during the Irish presidency that the importance of the issue that we are discussing today finally impacted on the political agenda under President Norah Owen, who was the President-in-Office at the time."
"The fact that 500, 000 women are estimated to be being trafficked in the European Community is an appalling figure."
"When Commissioner Gradin raised this issue and made it one of the priorities for her term of office, there was probably quite a lot of amusement and scepticism about the extent of the problem."
"So it is a very good day for all of us that we are today debating Mrs Waddington's excellent and very comprehensive report."
"The European fight against trafficking is a major crime issue but it is also a fundamental matter of women's rights."
"To focus on trafficking only as crime means sidelining the support and services needed by the victims of trafficking."
"Many of the asylum procedures in all our countries, particularly my own at the moment, seem to be taking a particularly long time."
"We are in real danger of adding an extra layer of victimization for many of these women who are being brought into the trafficking net by being offered work opportunities in the EU as au pairs, domestic workers or as waitresses."
"Many others are offered introductions with a view to marriage."
"While some women may know they are to work as prostitutes, many do not."
"They arrive in a new country often illegally, without papers and are then trapped."
"Their earnings are taken by traffickers, they are unable to speak the language and they are oppressed by the fear and the secrecy that surrounds this issue."
"Mr President, all measures to combat trafficking in women will be a waste of time and effort unless an intensive policy is pursued which will improve the position of women in their countries of origin."
"This must be achieved by supporting more women's projects in European and national development policies; it must be achieved by strict implementation of the human rights clause in agreement with third countries; and it must be achieved by putting more emphasis on the equal opportunities policy in negotiations with candidate countries in central and eastern Europe."
"Otherwise it is not worth a penny."
"Women's rights are human rights."
"The root of evil in the trafficking of women originates, after all, in the unequal balance in power and wealth between men and women."
"Having said this, Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal Deomcrat and Reform Party thinks Mrs Waddington's report a good one. To the Liberal Group, the emphasis is on the following issues: firstly, implementation of articles K.1 and K.3 through joint European action by police and judiciary, and by financial liberalization of the Stop and Daphne programmes, for both children and women."
"Secondly, much more emphasis on the role of the non-governmental organizations in the information, prevention, protection and later reintegration of women in their countries."
"And thirdly, in those third countries, support for the policy and judiciary for the training of personnel, and for the acquisition of equipment; the existing European programmes can easily be utilised for this."
"Coordination and cooperation on a European level is necessary, when protecting victims, when prosecuting and punishing perpetrators, when informing and educating people through, for example, EU embassies in third countries, in strengthening the role of NGOs and through support of women's organizations in the countries involved."
"Trafficking in women is degrading."
"It is slavery, and it forms - this has been said before - an important part of organized crime."
"The Dutch presidency organized an excellent conference on the prevention trafficking in women, and thoroughgoing agreements were made during this."
"Please let us all, EU and Member States, show the political will to implement these measures efficiently and generously."
"It will not be for lack of trying on the part of the European Parliament and Commissioner Gradin."
"Mr President, in a typically Swedish way I am not usually very exuberant when it comes to saying thank you for a report."
"In doing so now, and thanking both Mrs Waddington and Commissioner Gradin for their very solid piece of work, I am showing that it really comes from the whole of my heart."
"Thank you very much."
"I think it is quite right to do as Mrs Waddington has done and compare this trafficking in women with the slave trade of the past."
"People were able to participate in the slave trade of the past as long as they did not think that the people being shipped from African countries to countries around the world had any humanity."
"I therefore think that, although this is a solid document, there is something missing from the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mrs Waddington, namely, the ""demand side' ."
"In September, when I raised the possibility of criminalizing the clients of prostitutes, large sections of this House roared with laughter."
"But I still think that we must appeal to all the responsible men who do not buy minors and who do not buy people forced into prostitution, or even willing prostitutes."
"We must have their support."
"I think, as I have said, that we should inform men and have them on our side in this fight against the new slavery."
"Mr President, we should not only congratulate Madam Gradin, although such congratulation is called for, but also indeed, the many others who have in the end made sure that trafficking in women is on the agenda of the European Union; and Commissioner Gradin's statement has certainly made an important contribution to this, including a number of chairmanships from the recent past."
"It is in this way that the wish not only of this Parliament, but also of society, to opt for an international approach to trafficking in women, has been complied with."
"It is obvious that this is not easy, because the Treaty which is in force at the moment offers very few leads, and this new Treaty, too, the Treaty of Amsterdam, is insufficiently equipped to ensure that an integrated European approach becomes possible."
"This integrated approach is indeed necessary; not only cooperation between police and law services, but in particular the protection of victims is needed in order to be able to prosecute perpetrators."
"The role of the NGO's, as has already been said here, is crucial in this, since they are much better able to win the trust of the women who have ended up in totally alien societies."
"The DAPHNE and STOP programmes are in fact a response to the need for an integrated approach, and we should be pleased with this, although we cannot be pleased with the fact that the European Parliament has been so frugal in allocating funds for both programmes for the coming year."
"But more should be done, and in the Member States it should be mentioned that as far as the protection of victims is concerned, more effective action should be taken, because a temporary residence permit is often not enough to win true trust."
"We should latch onto this violation of human rights to treat the residential status of victims of trafficking more generously."
"Mr President, I would like first to congratulate our rapporteur, and the Commissioner, for the quality of the work she has carried out on so delicate a subject."
"The question required special attention, and substantial measures are required if this problem, which is nothing short of a plague, is to be put right."
"I have nothing to add, either in form or substance."
"I would rather emphasize the necessity of attacking the root of the evil, which affects the most disadvantaged women."
"The root of the evil, as our rapporteur has reminded us, is the situation of disproportionate inequality between the economies of the rich and poor countries, and the inequality of economic resources devoted to men and women."
"Poverty and unemployment are the reasons for the growth in this trafficking, which holds out to the women who are victimised by it the illusory hope of a better future."
"This is the field where we need to concentrate our action a little more."
"I would also like to mention the situation in the central and eastern european countries, where the whole of this problem has taken on considerable proportions."
"Let us simply express the hope that the opening of the European Union to these countries will enhance our ability to control this problem, especially as women from the central and eastern european countries who are involved in this trafficking are young and educated, and therefore should have better chances of entering the employment market."
"On the other hand, women from the developing countries are older, less well educated and have poorer prospects for the future."
"The problem is most acute in the African and Latin American countries."
"Women from these countries use subterfuge to obtain long-stay residence permits in the Union."
"In conclusion, I would say that while I express no doubt as to the effectiveness of the measures proposed, I believe, quite simply, that we should step up our efforts at improving the economies of these poorer countries."
"This is the only way to put an end to this unscrupulous exploitation of human wretchedness."
"Mr President, we support Mrs Waddington's report on trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation."
"However, there are shortfalls in the analysis of the phenomenon, and in its observable causes."
"First, given the current extension of homosexuality, trade in women is no different from trade in men or in transsexuals - it is all done for the same reason, so to speak - and, worse still, it is no different from the even more horrible, more monstrous trade in children, as revealed by the unspeakable actions of Dutroux and his accomplices in Belgium."
"Such trade shames our Europe, a Europe which, increasingly less Christian, is increasingly less respectful of human dignity."
"However, we should not forget that the institutionalized practice of Islam, if not of the harem, at least of polygamy, and the possession of many concubines, as propounded by the prophet Mohammed in the Koran, continues to be a decisive factor in the real and ongoing practice of slavery in many African and Asian countries."
"We cannot but observe also - at a time when the thought police are everywhere hunting down rather than refuting books, by the Marxist professor Garaudy, for example - that there are thousands of tonnes of literature sold in newspaper kiosks and in bookshops, magazines, books and newspapers which exult, advocate and describe all forms of sexual perversion and sadism, and incite people to them."
"How can this be denied, when we see that in France, for example, the number of child murders accompanied by the tortures of sexual sadism has increased twenty-fold since the 1970s, and where decadence and horrors have been allowed to flourish in unfettered freedom?"
"How could you in this House - where you believe the influence of certain historical theses to pose a threat to freedom - deny that the freedom permitted to sadistic pornography does not exert its own influence?"
"Is it not time to put things straight?"
"We need a spirit of freedom and challenge in the search for the truth, in the fields of science, history and philosophy. But on the other hand, for those who advocate more sadism, two centuries after the death of the Marquis de Sade, we need the prohibition and repression of their hideous industry."
"But how on earth can we lay any legitimate claim to defend children, when so often we cut their lives short, so soon after their conception, by the crime of abortion?"
"Mr President, I too would like to heartily congratulate Mrs Waddington and Commissioner Gradin, who have had the courage to put their finger at the crux of one of the thorniest problems of our time, the trade in the souls and bodies of mainly women and children. This is a problem which, with the help of technology, is developing into a modern day scourge."
"The five hundred thousand women trafficked in the European Union and the millions in Asia bear tragic witness to the fact that the pursuit of easy gains has been tolerated as of the highest merit, while the ideology of the market place and the law of supply and demand have transformed human beings into merchandise."
"Here I would like to stress something which is not mentioned in the official reports. Trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation could not take place if the demand for such services did not exist, if the respectable client consumers did not exist, if, finally, the patriarchal values and structures which apportion rights, resources and power unequally between the two sexes, did not unfortunately still determine our socio-economic system."
"We must not forget this when we talk about the reasons for the phenomenon: poverty, marginalization, immigration and asylum problems etcetera, but chiefly we must not forget this when we look for the means to combat it effectively."
"We need to take direct, proactive, deterrent and suppressive action."
"We need political will and the economic aid provided by the funds that have already been made available for the financing of actions aimed at international cooperation, at supporting the services of Europol. We need measures for the protection and social reintegration of the victims."
"But above all we need to strengthen the policy of equal opportunities."
"We still need to remind Member States to implement the joint action which was approved on 24 February 1997 and to carry out the commitments that they made at the Hague Conference on 24 April 1997, with specific actions to involve both the competent authorities and women's organizations in effectively tackling the phenomenon."
"Mr President, women are being lured to the EU by the promise of easy money."
"They are being recruited for so-called ""pleasure centres' that are anything but pleasure."
"They are enticed into dubious employment and sham marriages."
"Women from Asia, Africa, South America and the central and eastern european states."
"Better and better organized gangs of pimps make women submissive by threatening or dispensing violence, exploiting them, forcing them into prostitution, holding them prisoner."
"That is the everyday existence of more than 500, 000 women annually."
"Mrs Gradin, the Commission is proposing a pan-European approach to the fight against the trade in women for the sole purpose of sexual exploitation, and we fully support this in the European Parliament."
"However, it needs to be made more concrete and include the NRO."
"In her committed and excellently researched report, Sue Waddington demanded that the issue be regarded from the victims' angle."
"I go along with that."
"First of all, we need an awareness-raising campaign to provide us with background information on, and thereby thwart, the aims of so-called recruitment agencies, the structure of their systems and their wheelings and dealings."
"The victims need help in finding the courage to come forward and name the offenders."
"They need a safe refuge and, at least, a limited right of abode in a women's hostel before returning home, having been properly prepared for asserting themselves there in the face of poverty and discrimination."
"It might be cynical of me to say this, but it is true: trafficking in human beings is one of the growth markets in Europe."
"Not limited by borders, it can be carried on without serious risk."
"This international crime must be sapped of its strength by closing the localities known to traffic in people, confiscating the profits made from criminal acts, imposing maximum custodial sentences, and depriving the perpetrators of their civil rights."
"The Member States must take united action and stop this slave trade through the terms of treaties concluded with non-member countries, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of suffering women."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report."
"The trafficking of human beings is also a part of organized crime, and is widespread and mainly found in the Eastern bloc countries."
"There is also plenty of fresh evidence of this in Finland."
"What is particularly worrying is the trafficking of younger people, even children, who are targets because it is their only means of survival."
"This is nothing other than a lack of basic protection for human beings and a total disregard for the protection of children."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the problem must be tackled from the viewpoint of the victims."
"This is a violation of the basic rights of women and children, which we just cannot permit or tolerate."
"The European Union is to start talks on membership with the eastern european countries in the Spring."
"The slave trade in women and children should feature in those talks, which should also spell out what is meant by the rights of women and children and sexual equality."
"Neither can we ignore the responsibility our women have to ourselves and our children."
"We cannot tolerate women being used as merchandise, because everyone should have the right to earn enough to survive through their own labour or enterprise."
"Mr President, at the end of this debate, the Group of the Party of European Socialists is able to join in applauding Commissioner Gradin and Mrs Waddington."
"We have heard how the victims of human trafficking are invariably women."
"Non-government organizations estimate that some 500, 000 women annually are either lured or carried to the countries of the European Union with false contracts of employment, where they are forced into marriage or prostitution."
"Most of them come from central and eastern Europe, especially Russia, Poland and the Baltic States."
"Here, economic need is particularly great, and women have no other way of feeding their families and so become the puppets of dubious sponsors who promise them an income and prosperity in western Europe."
"The figures supplied by the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation in Germany, the BKA, which last year registered 10, 000 female victims, are shocking."
"The BKA ascertained that this represented an increase in one year of 43 %, and I am certain that the number of unreported cases is substantially higher."
"With the report on the trafficking of persons, we in the Committee on Women's Rights have embarked on a course to take us out of the taboo zone."
"Commissioner Gradin's statement on the trade in women and the Stop and Daphne programmes are a further important development."
"In regard to the seriousness and urgency of the growth of this modern form of slavery, however, this is but a drop in the ocean, and the ministers for home affairs and justice need to act quickly at national level."
"They need to develop effective strategies together with Europol, the Commission and the non-government organizations."
"Specifically, on the basis of Mrs Waddington's report, we call for effective action in the area of victim support, collaboration on the part of the Member States and information."
"I also consider it vital that we grant the victims a limited right of abode to give them at least a legal status until criminal proceedings against the perpetrators have been concluded."
"Otherwise, lack of victim support will be the best protection of the criminal."
"This resolution allows us to put a stop to the contemporary slave trade."
"Mr Commissioner, let me begin by congratulating Mrs Waddington on a good and balanced report."
"Thank you also for all the friendly words towards me."
"The trafficking in young women which is taking place in Europe today is a shame for our continent."
"It is a tragedy for all the young women who come to grief."
"Unfortunately, it is very lucrative for organized crime."
"As Mrs Waddington stresses, we need to take action in many different areas if we are to succeed in fighting the trafficking."
"That is also why, in my draft plan of action, I stress both the need to focus on human rights and on care for the victims and the need to act in a multi-disciplined way."
"Since the big conference in Vienna in the summer of 1996 and the plan of action which was adopted by the Commission in November last year, the question has really been put on the political agenda."
"Last spring the Dutch Presidency held a large Conference of Ministers in the Hague."
"The Conference adopted guidelines which were aimed directly at the Member States."
"In that way it was a concrete follow-up of the Commission's plan of action."
"The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs have also acted swiftly and followed up both the plan of action on trafficking in women and the Stockholm Conference on the sexual exploitation of children."
"Several of the measures are common to both areas."
"Last autumn the Council of Ministers decided to change the mandate of the European Drug Unit so that the EDU now also deals with the problem of trafficking in people."
"The Council of Ministers has also decided that trafficking in people shall be regarded as a crime and that the perpetrators will be punished."
"However, that will not come into force until the Member States have changed their legislation in this direction."
"As things appear today, it is very profitable to smuggle drugs, but it is also risky."
"If you are caught, the sentence is often 10-12 years."
"The smuggling of young women is also highly profitable, but the risks are small."
"If you get caught the sentence is no more than one or two years."
"My question to the House is this: is that sensible?"
"The Council of Ministers also made a decision on the Stop programme, which stands for Sexual Trafficking of Persons ."
"This is a multiannual programme providing training, information and an exchange of experience for police, judges, prosecutors, customs and immigration officers, as well as others who come into contact with the victims of trafficking."
"Over the years we have had intensive activity under the Stop programme."
"Courses have been started on supporting victims, on developing preventative measures, on statistics and studies."
"The policewomen's network in Europe has drawn up a code of conduct for the police with regard to women who have been battered or raped."
"The network of female judges recently arranged a conference in Rome, also with the support of the Stop programme."
"Within the framework of the Stop programme, the Luxembourg Presidency arranged a Seminar of Experts in November."
"That is the start of a joint project between the USA and the EU on the trafficking of women."
"Next year we are going to carry out a joint project with preventative measures in Ukraine and Poland."
"The USA is going to cooperate with the IOM, the International Organization for Migration , and we in the EU with the voluntary organization La Strada."
"When we are ready the idea is that we should jointly evaluate methods and results."
"It is interesting to note that interest is now growing outside the European Union."
"The US President and his First Lady are deeply involved in the issue."
"So is US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who has instructed the American State Department to give the fight against trafficking the same priority as the drugs trade."
"This autumn the first conference was also held in Russia, where representatives of authorities and voluntary organizations gathered in Moscow to discuss trafficking in young women."
"Mr President, the Daphne programme started this year thanks to the initiative of the European Parliament."
"It is aimed at voluntary organizations working with children, young people and women who have been victims of violence."
"In the Commission's plan of action, I emphasize the contributions made by voluntary organizations for women who have been victims of violence of various kinds."
"My experience tells me that women who are victims of violence prefer to turn to a women's organization in the first place rather than an authority."
"It also appears that the DAPHNE initiative has been met by very great interest."
"Many good applications have been received, but we have still not been able to give support to more than 40-50 projects."
"ECU 3 million is good, but it does not go very far."
"The great interest clearly shows that there is a need for contributions from voluntary organizations in this area."
"Let me give some concrete examples of Daphne projects."
"We have one which aims to increase awareness among the police about how to deal with women who have been raped."
"We have another project which deals with victims of trafficking in Austria, mainly from Latin America and Eastern Europe."
"The project involves organizations and authorities in Italy, Poland and the Dominican Republic among other places."
"One aim of the project is to inform women about what rights and choices they have and to set up a network to support these women at the regional, European and international level."
"A third project concerns the sexual exploitation of immigrant women."
"Italy, Spain and Great Britain are cooperating on this."
"All the Member States of the Union are involved in one or more projects."
"We have succeeded in distributing funds so that around half of the project funding goes to women's projects and half to children."
"We hope, of course, that we shall have the opportunity to continue the DAPHNE programme next year too."
"Let me take this opportunity also to say a few words about other multiannual programmes we have which touch on this area."
"We have the Sherlock programme which concerns training and exchanging experiences in the area of immigration, not least where the seizure of forged documents is concerned."
"The Grotius programme concerns information and exchange in the judicial area, and the Oisin programme concerns increased cooperation in policing."
"In her report Mrs Waddington asks about a follow-up report on the part of the Commission."
"We have also heard demands for a convention."
"I can inform the House that the Commission already plans a follow-up which I hope to be able to give an account of here in a year's time."
"We must therefore do what we can to keep this issue on the agenda."
"Through today's debate the European Parliament has made an important contribution for which I thank you."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Gas emissions from internal combustion engines"
"The next item is the report (A4-0413/97) by Mr K. Collins, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery (C4-0627/97-95/0209(COD))"
"Mr President, I must say that sometimes there are subjects we must discuss in this Chamber which are so riveting that Members come from miles around to take part in the debate."
"As you can see, it is only very rarely that the Chamber is as crowded as it is at present."
"I think the interpreters outnumber the Members at this present moment!"
"Even the public gallery is emptying."
"They are all going away!"
"This is the conclusion of the conciliation on, not just non-road mobile machinery, but as you pointed out yourself, President, the elimination of gaseous pollutants from these vehicles."
"This complements the auto-oil package which is currently going through its second reading and which takes a combined approach to engine design and fuel technology in order to cut emissions from cars and so on. This is not about cars, this in fact is about non-road mobile machinery, and a lot of people really do not know what that is."
"It is in fact tractors and combine harvesters and diggers and bulldozers and so on, and the point is that these contribute a very significant amount to this kind of pollution and without this directive these emissions would remain unregulated."
"The existence of this directive will also enable European Union countries to take a lead in the manufacture and marketing of new engines which have been designed for this purpose in order to reduce gaseous emissions."
"It will therefore give European industry a tremendous advantage on the world market - on the assumption, of course, that European industry grasps this opportunity."
"But it is important and it is therefore welcome."
"The directive was the subject of conciliation between ourselves and the Council."
"The original Commission proposal was approved by this House without amendment."
"That is not very common, and I have to say that it was not just because it was enormously technical."
"It did genuinely meet with our approval."
"But then it went to the Council, which made substantial changes in its common position."
"It changed the type of procedure to be used by the Commission for implementing measures."
"I will speak, President, if I may, to the gallery at this point, because in this House we spend a lot of time discussing something called comitology."
"To anybody outside this Chamber, and I have to say to quite a good number of people inside this Chamber, it does not mean a great deal."
"Comitology concerns the way in which technical decisions arising from directives are made, and we have a choice: either these decisions can be made publicly, so that members of the public can see what these decisions are and can understand them; or we can make these decisions behind closed doors so that you, the public, do not hear what is being said and so that you, the public, do not understand what decisions are being made and the whole thing is kept under wraps."
"So we went to conciliation on this, and during conciliation we managed to change the Council common position in this regard; and I think that we have therefore advanced the democratic case that we wanted to advance."
"We also secured a reference to the modus vivendi."
"The modus vivendi is about bringing us and the Commission together so far as these decisions are concerned, and we do not think that the modus vivendi in its present form works very well."
"We wanted to see it improved and I am very glad that the Commission has now made a statement which will be published in the Official Journal stating that it will keep the European Parliament fully informed about implementing measures arising from directives."
"We also have an undertaking from the Commission that a new form of the modus vivendi will be proposed some time in the middle of 1998."
"In other words the multitudes of people who have gathered here tonight to listen to this riveting debate on gaseous pollutants emitted by non-road mobile machinery can be satisfied."
"Everyone in this House, everybody who is occupying these benches over there, can be very happy that we have concluded this, that it is good news for the environment, that it is good news for transparency, and that it is good news for democracy."
"Mr President, let me begin by expressing the Commission's satisfaction over the result of the conciliation procedure where this very important question of legislation is concerned."
"I would like to remind the House that this draft directive concerns a sector which has never before been regulated."
"In the past, emissions from engines on mobile machinery intended for use outside the road network have been underestimated."
"In fact their share of emissions from transport is substantially higher than was previously thought."
"The use of less polluting engines in such machinery will therefore play an important role in reducing air pollution in our cities, and at a reasonable cost."
"The European Parliament's first reading was done without a report, while the amendments in the second reading all concerned the question of comitology and the implementation of the modus vivendi which we have just talked about."
"I am conscious that the question of comitology has raised a problem for Parliament."
"The Commission has undertaken to present a proposal to revise the 1987 decision on comitology."
"The Commission has also, at the direct request of Parliament, undertaken to do so at the beginning of June 1998."
"This undertaking appears in a letter of 11 November 1997 from the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, to the President of the European Parliament, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado."
"This means it has been possible to remove obstacles as far as the conciliation procedure is concerned on this question."
"I can also inform you on behalf of the Commission that we are going to start informal contacts with the other institutions concerned at the beginning of next year in order to prepare the ground for a new proposal."
"Let me finally convey the Commission's appreciation of the fact that Parliament and the Council of Ministers have reached a constructive agreement with regard to the draft directive."
"As soon as this directive has come into force it will mean an important step forward for the improvement of the environment, both in terms of air quality and public health."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Consumer protection and price indication"
"The next item is the report (A4-0414/97) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers (C40643/97-95/0148(COD))."
"Mr President, this rapporteur is extremely satisfied with the result achieved in the conciliation procedure."
"The negotiations with the Council went very well, and I think we owe particular thanks to the Luxembourg Minister Mrs Jacobs, who cut the knot at a rather crucial moment, and who brought about the readiness in others to agree at least on the last amendments of this Parliament."
"I think we have been able to conclude this case within a very reasonable period."
"Mr President, looking back briefly, the directive we are discussing today has a very long history."
"For years, from as far back as 1979, various governments have tried through different regulations to bring about something concerning indication of the prices of products."
"All manner of things have been tried using extremely complicated regulations."
"There was a system of obligations, a system of voluntary series."
"It could be done at European level, or at national level."
"But it created such a labyrinth of price indications for producers, that consumers did not know which way to turn, and suppliers were lost too, whilst the objective should be, both for consumer and seller, unambiguity in the indication of prices so that comparisons are easy to make."
"In December 1994, when the Commission requested a further transitional period for the confusing regulations then in existence, the members of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection quickly realised that things could not continue in this vein, and that something new should be introduced, namely, a new proposal for a simple and transparent system which consumers could use to make proper price comparisons on which to base their choices."
"In 1995, the Commission followed Parliament's recommendations in a new proposal."
"The proposal comprised, in addition to the compulsory indication of the sale price, the indication, where relevant, of price per standard unit - per kilo, or per litre."
"I would like to add to this that, if, because of the purpose of the product, the price indication per standard unit turns out to be meaningless or offers no relevant information to the consumer, an exception to the general rule was made."
"On a national level, exceptions were also made for certain products such as, for example, the 75cl bottle of wine, for which it is not necessary to display the equivalent litre price."
"Some sectors can be excluded entirely from compulsory indication of price."
"We agreed in the conciliation with the Council that Member States themselves can determine which specific sectors this applies to, but on condition that they use the criteria which have been set."
"Catering establishments, hospitals, vending machines, etcetera, come to mind."
"In fact, in the negotiations the Council adopted most of the amendments submitted by Parliament."
"A number of technical or linguistic amendments were adopted instantly."
"Obviously there were a few sticking points as well."
"The general exception which, right at the end, the Council wanted to make was for small businesses."
"We do not favour this."
"We would like to see a transitional period for small businesses, and for that we had set aside a considerable period."
"This point continued to cause friction and in the end we made a compromise in which, after three years, the Commission will draft a report on the state of affairs regarding small businesses, and we, after having received the report, will then be able to examine whether they - and this includes small shopkeepers - will have to meet those obligations, or whether we might decide to prolong the general exception for such tiny businesses as corner shops."
"We, in the Parliament, have stuck tightly to the principle at stake, namely that there will be an extremely simple, but at the same time transparent, system with as little room for exceptions as possible."
"We have therefore removed a great deal of dead wood which was in the text."
"I now believe that the text which was eventually decided is clear."
"Furthermore, we have included an extra provision for the euro. This is something the Council and the Commission had not provided for."
"As yet there are still no clear provisions for this and the Commission has still not come up with a proposal."
"I think it is good that this Parliament will be able to find something about it in the text."
"Mr President, a satisfactory result, I believe; a solid piece of consumer legislation."
"Mr President, we often discuss how far Parliament succeeds in terms of the extension of codecision."
"It would sometimes be more important to discuss what we do with co-decision when we have it."
"I should like to salute the three Graces of this report: Mrs Fontaine, the Minister - Mrs Jacobs - and the rapporteur."
"Their negotiations representing the three elements of the European Union have led to an exemplary performance of the co-decision role."
"We now have a simple and clear way of moving from dual pricing to unit pricing."
"We can prepare the way for the euro and when and how it is introduced in the various Member States."
"We have met the anxieties both of those who felt that traditional measurements might be eliminated - and plainly they will not - in the various Member States and of those small shopkeepers who felt that they would be forced into a system for which they were not prepared."
"At the moment we have a situation where they will have a five-year period in which to prepare themselves."
"That is right and proper and I am very glad that we have reached this stage."
"Mr President, a comparison between the joint draft and the original proposal yields at least three points of difference which are vital in order for the result of the compromise procedure to be called a quality product, and which prompt me to congratulate my colleague Mrs Oomen-Ruijten sincerely on her persistent efforts and on the result."
"First, the sale price and the unit price have been better defined and it is clear that VAT and other taxes have been included in the prices."
"Secondly, it provides an acceptable solution for the transitional period of the euro, which we will be right in the middle of when the directive becomes operational."
"Even though we did not succeed in having the maximum of three prices which must be indicated statutorily accepted, nevertheless we did create space for Member States to limit the maximum number of prices which must be indicated statutorily themselves."
"It is now up to the Member States on whose common sense we rely, to avoid extremely unproductive situations in which possibly 4 to 8 prices are displayed per product."
"Thirdly, Mr President, there are all the small shopkeepers to whom we have to continue to give every assistance."
"The Member States can issue an exemption to small businesses to whom implementation of the mandatory indication of unit price for other than loosely sold products will mean an excessive administrative burden."
"I hope that the Member States will deal positively with this policy area; it is an implicit recognition, after all, of a small imperfection in the directive, but we hope that it will be dealt with positively in the expectation that we will get an adapted directive in six years' time, or who knows, that the problem will have solved itself literally automatically as a result of evolution in technological developments."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her excellent work and assistance in this job of conciliation."
"This is a matter of consumer information at its most fundamental."
"For example, the consumer should be able to make a true comparison between prices in shops."
"I believe that we have achieved a good result, in that under article 10 of this directive Member States can go in for even better labelling than is required by this directive."
"With that in mind, no country will feel the need to back out when this regulation eventually comes into force."
"It is quite proper that certain exceptions and allowances have also been made."
"It would surely be pretty odd if these price-labelling regulations were to apply to auctions, for example. I warmly approve the acceptance of the outcome of this conciliation."
"Mr President, at the previous reading of the draft relating to the indication of the prices oproducts offered to consumers, the European Parliament adopted twenty-two amendments, and insisted on the need to provide for a longer period of adaptation in the introduction of these arrangements, for smaller retail outlets."
"The Council accepted seven amendments, as part of the work of the Conciliation Committee."
"At the relevant meeting, five other amendments were agreed."
"Overall, the result is fairly satisfactory, as now, contrary to the initial proposal, separate display of unit price is no longer a requirement, if identical to the item's selling price."
"In the case, for example, of quality wines sold by France, in a 0.75 l bottles, the fact that wine is typically sold in this unit size made it clear that the compulsory display of the price per litre was unnecessary."
"This constraint would only have added to the cost, which would have been of no positive advantage to consumers."
"It was also essential that small retail traders be released, for a transitional period, from the obligation to display product unit price in addition to the actual product selling price."
"I would like to remind you of the exorbitant cost which will already be borne by retailers generally, and more particularly by smaller retailers, as a result of the compulsory double display of prices in national currency and the euro."
"The considerable extra cost which will be caused by the move to the single currency will already force some traders to defer necessary business investments to meet this obligation."
"For some traders, the cost of dual price display will be disproportionately high in relation to their profit margins and may threaten their continuing viability."
"This is no way to encourage the development of new jobs."
"We must therefore be scrupulously attentive to ensuring that there are no additional constraints to burden our shop-keepers."
"The present directive will force traders to display the real selling price of the product, as well as the unit price, for all products except those sold loose."
"It is fortunate that the transitional period has been extended to 24 months, and the Commission will have to present a report and make a proposal covering the special case of small traders."
"In conclusion, Mr President, our group will vote in favour of the legislation arising from this directive, but wishes to draw attention to the difficult situation which small traders are likely to face as a result of the two-fold obligation under the present directive at the end of the transitional period, and the requirement to implement dual price display in the countries affected by the single currency."
"It is only when it is of real extra service to consumers that such constraints are justifiable."
"Mr President, the introduction of the single European currency into the European Union is now only a matter of twelve months away."
"The practical ramifications and consequences of EMU for the consumer must be closely analysed and monitored."
"The euro notes and coins will not physically be in consumers' pockets until the year 2002."
"However, the Commissioner for Consumer Affairs, Mrs Bonino, together with national governments must put in place comprehensive information campaigns relating specifically to the pricing of products in the euro and the national currency of the host Member State in the run up to EMU."
"In essence, dual pricing campaigns across Europe in all key supermarkets and shopping outlets must now begin."
"Prices on products should be displayed in the euro denomination and also in the host national currency."
"This should have the desired and immediate effect of appraising the consumer of the price of the product in the euro denomination so that, when it is up and running as a currency, consumers will be able to adapt to the new monetary regime with understanding and confidence."
"Mr President, first I would like to express the Commission's appreciation of the fact that we have reached a compromise on the directive on consumer protection with regard to the indication of prices of goods."
"I would like to congratulate Parliament and the Council for their efforts to find a compromise."
"The directives on the indication of prices which were adopted in 1979, 1988 and 1995 have entailed advances with regard to price information for consumers."
"However, the system did not ensure adequate price information and was also very complicated to apply."
"It is therefore important that consumers get proper and transparent information through this proposal."
"By showing comparative prices and the sales prices, consumers will be able to compare different products."
"That makes it possible to make a well-founded decision on the basis of a simple price comparison."
"The compromise which has been reached does not mean a definitive solution for small retailers."
"For some of them the requirement to indicate comparative prices entails a great burden."
"Here Member States have the opportunity during a transitional period to disregard the requirement to indicate comparative prices."
"For its part the Commission shall, after the expiry of the implementation period, deliver a report on the application of this directive to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"The report shall in particular propose provisions with respect to small retailers."
"On the basis of the report, the European Parliament and the Council shall consider and reach a decision within three years."
"During this time, until the implementation period has expired, this directive will in all certainty give European consumers the chance to get complete price information from most retailers."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Postal Services"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"B4-0911/97 - O-0144/97, by Mr Ferber, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party on further development of postal services in the EU; -B4-0914/97 - O-0155/97, by Mr Wijsenbeek, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on the reimbursement of terminal dues between postal services; -B4-1004/97 - O-0165/97, by Mrs Schmidbauer and Mr Simpson, on behalf of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, on the future of postal services; -B4-1005/97 - O-0169/97, by Mr Donnay, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on postal services; -B4-1007/97 - O-0171/97, by Mr Scarbonchi, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance on postal services and terminal dues; -B4-1008/97 - O-0173/97, by Mrs Moreau, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left on the future of postal services in the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not so long ago that we discussed here in Strasbourg a second reading of the directive on the development of postal services."
"At the time I tabled two amendments on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, which dealt with the problem of terminal dues."
"Sadly, the House - unwisely, I have to say - did not take up our proposals."
"It must be our aim - and I am surely in agreement with the Commissioner here - to allow competition into the European Union, that is to say to let the rules of competition apply here too."
"This is not possible, however, if a worldwide agreement, namely the Universal Postal Agreement, is employed to deal with the issue of terminal dues."
"It is the basis of this agreement that incoming and outgoing mail cancel each other out and thereby create a national balance."
"We do not have this situation within the European Union any longer."
"The single market also means - and we have found this with other deregulations - that the costs of using the services must be recovered, be it with the single electricity market and transmission rights or in the area of telecommunications and the interconnector problem."
"Only where postal services are concerned are competition and the single market to carry on being ignored by a nonsensical provision."
"That is why the Group of the European People's Party is asking the Commission to tell us whether it will be addressing this problem, for example, in the notice to apply the rules of competition to the postal services?"
"Will it also be addressing these concerns in the next postal directive, which will affect internet access, when we will be in the thick of the issue?"
"Is it actually aware what it means to have to provide services that exceed each costing, while at the same time being locked in trade with competitors who do not have these liabilities?"
"Europe's postal services just cannot function in this way."
"Mr Commissioner, if you do not succeed in solving this problem, you will not only put countless jobs at risk, but you will also compromise the postal provision we have agreed on in this House."
"Mr President, despite the fact that in October, Parliament agreed a common position on postal services with the Council, the issue of post seems to refuse to go away and is yet again at the forefront of Parliament's deliberations."
"If my first reading of the Commission's draft notice is anything to go by, then the issue of postal services may well dominate 1998 also."
"Although today's debate is about a specific issue, namely terminal dues, I would like to take the opportunity to warn the Commission that article 8(3) of the notice goes against not only the views of this Parliament but the common position adopted through the directive, and should be dropped."
"During discussions on the directive, the issue of terminal dues caused a great deal of concern."
"Indeed it had been my wish, as Mr Ferber has said, to ensure as rapporteur that this problem was tackled within the directive."
"However, disagreements emerged within the Council, and in order to get an agreed position on the directive as a whole, it was decided by Parliament to drop the amendments on this particular issue."
"Of course this does not solve the problem being experienced by some Member States, particularly Germany, who are not recovering the cost of delivering mail from outside."
"This, we would argue, is liable to jeopardize the proper functioning of the single market and brings into question the economic viability of some national postal authorities."
"It also brings into question the stated objective of the Commission itself in its communication of June 1993 which states that postal operators should be paid according to the cost."
"This terminal dues problem has to be faced."
"In the absence of a multi-party agreement on the issue, then the responsibility of action has to fall on the Commission."
"Therefore we are calling upon the Commission to introduce a proposal as soon as possible that would acknowledge that Member States may allow their universal service providers to determine terminal dues in accordance with their own cost."
"I appreciate that this is a technical and difficult subject to address but a do-nothing solution would not be in the best interests of Europe's postal services."
"With the implementation of the directive, now is the time to act on this issue."
"Mr President, I am not Jacques Donnay, as you can see, but I think there has been some problem with transport, and if you will allow me, I shall speak in his place."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, at the time of the recent adoption of the directive on postal services, we agreed on the principle according to which terminal dues should be based on the real costs borne by the postal services at the distribution end."
"However, the various postal operators in Europe are constantly confronted with the practice of reposting, which can be compared with poaching or piracy, or even daylight robbery, at the expense of those postal services which do not seek to circumvent international agreements and regulations."
"We cannot ignore the fact that some countries process an abnormally high volume of mail for cross-border destinations, compared to their domestic mail."
"The proportion of international mail as compared to domestic mail is only 5 % for France, 6 % for Germany and 7 % in Italy, but rises to 12 % for Great Britain and 25 % for the Netherlands."
"These figures clearly show that some postal services attract the national mail of other countries, and thus organize unacceptable and unlawful redirections of traffic, the cause of which is the depositing of mail outside national borders prior to its posting."
"The only way to deal with the threat that reposting represents to the balanced arrangements of the very recent European directive on postal services is to lay down a requirement for the remuneration of the services provided, at their correct price. Hence as a matter of urgency terminal dues should be fixed on the basis of the costs borne by postal services at the distribution end."
"In this case, reposting would be devoid of financial interest."
"So I put my question to the Commission, Mr Commissioner."
"Does the Commission believe that it is compatible with the rules on competition set out in the treaty that the postal service of a destination Member State should bill the postal service of the Member State which has sent the mail for the mail that it has despatched, at a price which covers the distribution costs, under the overall control of a national regulatory authority?"
"Mr President, the resolution that I have tabled jointly with my colleague Michel Dary, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, provides a corrective to the wrongful practices of some member countries of the European Union."
"Indeed, some postal services, advantaged by particularly competitive tariffs, practice unfair competition by giving incentives to mail reposting, and so poach from the national mail services business which they handle as international mail services, since the mail is deposited or sorted with them outside national boundaries."
"The main beneficiary mail service is the Netherlands, whose KPN postal services made profits of around 1 billion dollars in 1996, thanks to reposting acitivites."
"This practice complies with neither the spirit nor the letter of the directive adopted on 1 December 1997, strict respect of whose common rules will allow the harmonious development of postal services and of the quality of those services."
"For these reasons, our resolution invites the Commission to conduct an inquiry into these unfair practices and to sanction those pursuing them."
"We ask the Commission to subordinate the provision of aid to third countries, under the Phare and Tacis programmes, for the purpose of reorganizing their postal services, to the adoption by these countries of a system of terminal dues which is in accordance with the provisions of the directive."
"Finally, failing agreement between operators on terminal dues, it would be appropriate for Member States to authorise their universal postal companies forthwith to invoice their postal processing and distribution services for incoming cross-border mail on the basis of the real costs incurred."
"Mr Donnay and I have put forward four amendments to the resolution of Mr Simpson on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socailists, the Group of the European People's Party and the Green Group in particular."
"If these amendments are adopted by unanimous vote, we believe that we will be in a position of greater strength finally to solve this problem."
"Mr President, first, thank you for the questions."
"You provide me and the Commission with the opportunity to present our position again, which is undoubtedly necessary to avoid any misunderstanding."
"I was particularly pleased by Mr Ferber's question, which I want to highlight here because he congratulated me on my birthday."
"The other questioners did not do that."
"(Heckling from Mrs Moreau) Yes, maybe next year, but thanks all the same!"
"The difficulties we are having with terminal dues are familiar everywhere - at least among those involved in deliberations here."
"The tariffs are internationally the same and in the majority of industrial countries do not cover the costs of delivery."
"That is the problem in a nutshell."
"This results in considerable tension, also in regard to the quality of the services, for these international rates are not linked with quality of service."
"They are wholly independent of this key aspect."
"The actual costs incurred are not covered by the existing terminal dues, which are based on the CEPT system in force since 1989. Not by a long chalk!"
"The current rate for a standard letter at the lowest weight is on average around 45 % of the domestic tariff, which would suggest that the actual costs of delivering a letter in this category are some 80 % of the domestic tariff."
"It is indisputable - and of course is not being disputed by the Commission - that we are faced with a difficult problem."
"The problem consists legally in the fact - I asked people to appreciate this during our last debate on the issue, which has led to Parliament not accepting several amendments - that the present terminal dues system, which is based on international agreements, is not in harmony with the Treaty's rules of competition because the terminal dues tariffs are not cost-related."
"This has become a vicious circle because if they were cost-related they would be in harmony with the rules of competition."
"Yet if they were to become cost-related, then the international rules would have to be changed."
"We therefore find ourselves in a conflict and this, I should like to point out, is also a consequence of Parliament's resolutions in favour of a universal service and the reserved services."
"According to the decisions made by Parliament and Council, the Member States enjoy clear authority in these areas, and not primarily the Commission."
"The Member States and their independent regulatory bodies need to see to it that these things are sorted out."
"However, we have not stood still on the issue."
"One thing is clear: in a situation like this you cannot sit back and say that others should attend to it."
"That is why we have asked the postal services concerned to submit to us an agreement on improved terminal dues, obviously within the Union, not as part of the international rules."
"This socalled Reims agreement, which has nothing to do with the city of Reims, but is one of these nice acronyms for the activities of the Union, was the first of these agreements, and it was unsatisfactory."
"We are currently reviewing the second one, which has been modified in line with the ideas we expressed there."
"How this review will turn out we cannot say as yet, but it is possible we will find an appropriate relationship between quality of service provision and costs, on the one hand, and terminal dues, on the other."
"This is what we are working on at present."
"Naturally, we also want to achieve cost control and a reduction of the currently very high costs of some postal operators."
"If we fail to achieve this, and I reiterate most forcefully - Mrs Moreau has pointed out that I was very clear on this question; still, I need to be so all the time, to warn against making mistakes - if we cannot bring the high costs down, but instead simply add them to the terminal dues, the postal services will cease to be competitive because nobody will be able to afford them any more."
"In other words: what is necessary, as well as an agreement that is in harmony with the rules of competition, is an improvement in postal services in terms of both cost and quality."
"However, there are some members of this House who are interested in the post, but who are, sadly, always hard of hearing."
"Yes, I have to say this, even if my friend Florus Wijsenbeek, who is too keen of hearing, is not present, but some people are very hard of hearing."
"Mrs Moreau, if the postal services do not succeed in operating a sensible policy by cutting their costs and improving their quality, especially in the reserved services too, then the service will be of no use whatsoever!"
"It is an empty shell that cannot be filled because there is no client demand for it."
"That is the point exactly."
"Hence, I welcome the questions."
"We are now trying to sort things out with Reims II. If this does not succeed, we must find a new approach."
"We want to help in finding a solution - we, the Commission, and, I am sure, Parliament too - but then we will need to exert this useful pressure together on the postal operators."
"Unfortunately, we have not managed as yet to subject them to the useful pressure of competition, at least not as far as I imagined."
"Whatever, we must now try to do so by the present means."
"That is what I wanted to say about the questions."
"Now to Mrs Moreau."
"Yes, I will come to you as well!"
"That does not matter today because the questions refer to the terminal dues problem and not to the draft notice."
"The notice will probably be ratified tomorrow in the Commission."
"The text has been agreed between the various services, and you can assume that there will be a majority in favour of it tomorrow."
"I would just like to say a few words about this, not about the details of the substance, but about the role that this notice will play in general."
"First, the notice would, of course, be completely pointless if it contained anything other than this directive we have agreed upon."
"This is not the case."
"This notice was adapted to the last parliamentary resolution so that there is no conflict between the directive and the draft notice."
"Secondly, this notice is useful for those concerned since it actually sets out what the principles are by which the Commission will apply the rules of competition, especially to the reserved services, because there should not be any confusion about this."
"What is more, there are court rulings on the issue."
"Of course, the rules of competition also apply to the mail, and do so precisely at the point where it enjoys a monopoly or acts as the provider of a reserved service."
"However, so that postal services themselves will know how the Commission will apply these rules, we are informing them in a draft notice of the rules we intend to apply."
"So, we are actually doing more than we have to."
"We could also make our decisions based on the rules of competition quite out of the blue."
"Clearly, this would cause a furore every time and invite the justifiable question: just what are your general principles?"
"How do you want to handle things generally?"
"Or is there no consistency to the way you make your decisions?"
"This is why, Mrs Moreau, I admire the interest which you are showing in the question, and the force of your commitment."
"It would be better if you were to think first, before launching attacks which should not be directed against me, but against my colleague Mr van Miert."
"I am the eternal scapegoat."
"Having said that, I completely agree with Mr van Miert."
"The document from Mr van Miert will be presented with my agreement."
"It offers the postal services guarantees that the Commission is not doing something unacceptable or unexpected."
"This is the reason why these are no grounds to justify your request."
"In terms of form, you cannot constrain the Commission not to do anything which falls within its remit."
"You may oblige the Commission to do something which is a necessary part of its remit, but you cannot oblige the Commission not to act within its remit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is an old German nursery rhyme which loosely translates as: ' I ride with the mail, I ride with the post."
"I ride with the snail mail, there's no cost.' As for the speed at which legislation for the postal services has proceeded, I am very much reminded of the 'snail mail' ."
"Things have really only progressed at a snail's pace."
"All this would be acceptable if the directive had been drawn up on the principle of 'all good things are worth waiting for' ."
"Yet things have not turned out so well and considerable problems still remain."
"On the one hand, the Council's decision is so weakly formulated that each Member State can read from it what they will."
"Then there is the Commission's notice left ominously unresolved."
"As far as I know, the notice planned makes the principles of the directive obsolete, and to that extent I consider it redundant."
"The question of terminal dues for cross-border mail has not been resolved in the postal services directive."
"So far it has always been claimed that the operators could be left to negotiate and solve the problem themselves without the need for legislation."
"That is the way things stand, but nothing has been settled."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is therefore calling for a legal ruling from the Commission."
"It cannot be in the spirit of fair competition if letters can be sent from one country which on account of its good infrastructure and situation can offer cheap postal rates, while another country with a labour-intensive postal delivery service is encumbered with the greater expenditure - and you said yourself, Mr Bangemann, that only 80 % of the costs are covered - without appropriate compensation being made."
"This tempts mail service users to send their letters into the country with cheap postage, while the actual country of origin is left with the costs."
"Such remailing is an extremely unfair trade practice and it must be stopped."
"It is not enough to invoke the Universal Postal Agreement."
"There is a section on this in article 13 of the postal services directive, but here the Member States are only advised to ensure that in their agreements on the terminal dues involved in cross-border intra-Community post the following principles are observed."
"Then the principles are described."
"The single market cannot run purely on advice tendered in regard to a possible agreement."
"Even if Reims II is to happen, this still is not enough."
"We need clarity and legal certainty for all concerned, and it is the duty of the Commission to provide an efficient single market."
"That is why we are looking for a directive proposal and do not want to have to wait so long for it."
"What the Commission must not do when preparing the directive, however, is gear its speed to that of the snail mail."
"Mr President, the problems surrounding terminal dues for international postal services and our recent decision about the EU Member States' postal services and the Universal Postal Union as an institution are based on a view of postal distribution as a state monopoly, a view which is on the way to becoming increasingly out-of-date."
"Private distributors, electronic mail and faxes are increasingly replacing the old, overworked post offices."
"Like Mr Ferber I would like to please Commissioner Bangemann and praise his insight into the problems and underline the need for a continued fight for a more deregulated and competitively neutral postal market."
"My fellow Group member Mr Ferber has asked a particularly important and interesting question about terminal dues, so I will not repeat that angle."
"The complementary question which I would like to ask concerns the situation of private postal companies in connection with forthcoming European legislation, something which I think we have debated far too little in the European Parliament."
"Against this background let me ask Commissioner Bangemann the following: do you think that the current system of terminal dues in any way distorts competition for private companies which want to conduct international postal services?"
"In your opinion, what is the situation of the private postal companies and their ability to operate in the European market following our, that is, the EU's, recent decision?"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reposting is surely an aspect of the practice of dumping."
"It is accepted wisdom that you do not get rid of dumping by having the parties concerned sit round the table to conclude a gentlemen's agreement, because this does not work."
"What you need is a regulation to eradicate dumping."
"To achieve fair competition you need binding rules, and these rules need to go further in the single market than the situation we have with the old type of international postal agreement, so to speak."
"Hence there is the need for a directive."
"There is the need for control, Mr Bangemann, and it comforts me to hear you say that your notice is only intended to make the directive tangible and capable of being implemented. Yet why is the directive not taken as the basis for clarifying how the rules of competition should be interpreted in this area?"
"This is not clear to me in your reply."
"Mr President, recently Council and Parliament took the unwise decision to postpone the liberalization of cross-border postal services until the year 2003 at least."
"Now that the postal services have been relieved of the requirement to be market-oriented and to work efficiently, legislation should direct itself at protecting the consumer against abuse of power by the postal services."
"Most postal services in the Union take a different view on that."
"Under pressure from, in particular, the German and the French postal services, the original directive for cross-border post, the so-called Reims I agreement, was laid on the table, and a new agreement, Reims II, was negotiated."
"Contrary to the first Reims agreement, tariffs for cross-border post will rise without there being a commensurate improvement in the provision of services."
"Moreover, as the tariffs which are charged are based on the national tariffs, Reims II operates to the advantage of the postal services with the highest national tariffs."
"This makes the agreement unacceptable to me."
"My sympathy is not with the five postal services which do not wish to sign Reims II."
"Nonetheless, in this House too, there is more sympathy for the position of the monopolistic postal services than for the consumer."
"Thus the draft resolution of the PPE Group, the PSE Group, the Liberal Group and the Green Group proposes that, now that Reims II has not been signed by all participants, the postal services will be allowed to set the tariffs in line with their costs."
"In the text I do not find any minimum requirements for the provision of service."
"The fact that some postal services do not even know their own costs, let alone how to set the proper tariffs, is also overlooked."
"I would like to ask the Commission not to accept Reims II."
"Until the liberalization of cross-border post, tariffs should be set according to the first Reims agreement, since in this the increase in tariffs is related to an improvement of service provision."
"In addition, firms in other Member States, including postal services, should be given the same treatment as tenderers of large consignments of post within one Member State."
"Excuse me, Mr Commissioner, for being unable to address you in your own language."
"I am unable to do so."
"You will not be surprised that I do not share your militant views in favour of the constant reduction of costs, which in my view has dramatic consequences for employment and lifestyle, and does not really benefit consumers."
"I would simply ask you, Mr Commissioner, kindly to bear in mind that, even if one does not share your opinion, one is nevertheless able to think."
"I have received three motions for resolutions on this issue pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure ."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Water, energy, transport and telecommunications markets"
"The next item is the report (A4-0398/97) by Mr Langen, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 93/38/EEC coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors (C4-0619/97-95/0080(COD))."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are not many of you left."
"All good things are worth waiting for, however."
"We have been deliberating for two-and-a-half years now about adapting the European directives on public procurement to the last WTO agreement, and we have now reached a concerted agreement at the end of the conciliation process."
"I would like to thank everyone involved, especially my colleague Mr Tappin, who assisted and advised in this process in a most constructive manner."
"Hence, this evening I would like to mention only the esssentials."
"We could have had everything a lot quicker, Mr Commissioner, if the Commission, or part of the Commission, had been somewhat more flexible, for Parliament was of the opinion from the start that adapting the directives to the world trade agreement should only proceed as far as is absolutely necessary."
"We want a key-stage review as to why the first draft - which is probably quite unique in the history of Parliament - was rejected in full with only one vote against, since the Commission wanted to regulate things which are not contained in the world trade agreement."
"This was the reason for the delay, for the long consultation period, and in the end the Commission had to submit a new proposal."
"This might not have been completely new, but was revised with respect to the crucial elements, just as Parliament had suggested."
"So, by and large, we can chalk up a success today."
"We agreed on a course, and there is common agreement on the most important aspects, which remained controversial until the end."
"I mention here in particular the provisions for the technical dialogue, an issue which has preoccupied us right from the start."
"The Commission has ultimately admitted - and the Council in the conciliation process likewise - that we should agree on a sensible arrangement regarding the technical dialogue, that the technical dialogue, that is to say the consultation prior to awarding the contract, will always remain a possibility, if competition is not expressly ruled out."
"This solution makes technologically sophisticated and forward-looking general tenders possible, which perhaps only individual firms, say in the transport or energy sector, could provide, and so we can be satisfied about things by and large."
"The Commission has taken this demand into account in the final analysis."
"Ultimately we only had one argument between Parliament, Commission and Council, and that was the question of how far the demands of the so-called sector directive for both private and public contractors apply."
"Now the issue has been the subject of lengthy controversial debates at all levels of European decision-making, and in the end Parliament has given its approval with the result that we will be able to reach an agreement in conciliation on two additional statements, which Commissioner Bangemann will no doubt explain to us in a moment."
"Of the five recommendations made by Parliament, two have been accepted: one, the amendment affecting small and medium-sized enterprises, a project of Mr Tappin's, with regard to training and information material, and the other, the amendment providing the technological dialogue if competition is not ruled out."
"In the case of Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5, seeking to make a distinction between public and private awarding entities, a compromise wording was agreed for article 1 of this proposed directive and for two statements published in the Official Journal."
"The latter state that the obligation to communicate the advantages of the tender selected as well as the name of the successful tenderer must not harm firms' commercial interests."
"The confidentiality of technical information should be guaranteed, in other words."
"The second point is the question of how far statistical requirements can be reduced to a minimum."
"The Commission has approved this, too."
"In conclusion I would like to thank all those who have given their constructive and critical attention to the consultation process, and I think we can now safely say - I assume my colleague Mr Tappin will concur with this - that the conciliation team has found a sensible compromise with its proposal - even if it has taken some time to produce - which has been helped along by both sides."
"We can live very well with that and it fully satisfies our requirements under the world trade agreement government purchases annex."
"It will allow a new market with a volume of ECU 350 billion to be used by ourselves and others."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate my colleague, Mr Langen, for having led the conciliation team to such a successful conclusion."
"I have always thought that public procurement is a bit of a bodice-ripper, and I can see by the attendance here that other people think very much the same."
"The whole of the debate on public procurement has been fundamentally changed by the progress we have made since the Commission first put its proposals before Parliament."
"At that time, the gap between Parliament's position and that of the Council was fundamental."
"I am proud that the agreements obtained by the Conciliation Committee reflect the principles that Parliament put forward in the first reading and I welcome the willingness of the Commission to listen."
"Our desire was primarily to establish good public procurement policy for the benefit of the people we represent."
"Although, as with all compromise, the final result may not be exactly what we, as individuals, or we, as a committee, may have wished for, it is fair to say no one will regret the result."
"In this report we have addressed the issues at the very heart of procurement policy: firstly, the distinction between public and private sectors; secondly, questions of technical dialogue, to which Mr Langen has referred; thirdly, the provision of information; and, finally and fourthly, the matter of confidentiality."
"These issues will be coming up before us again in the near future."
"Firstly, when the Utilities Directive 93/38 comes up for review next year but also when we receive the Commission's response to the Green Paper when that comes before Parliament early in 1998."
"I hope that we in Parliament will continue to work together as effectively as we have done in the case of the Langen report and that we will be successful in getting as good a conclusion."
"I hope too that the Commission and the Council will continue to take Parliament's feelings on procurement very seriously, especially when we are not there to make the case ourselves."
"In this case I refer especially to negotiations at the GPA and WTO levels."
"One of the dominant themes underlying this report has been the question of reciprocity, of getting and keeping the playing field level."
"Even though the Langen report dealt with procurement inside the European Union, it became quite obvious, even to those who were less inclined to listen, that the global environment is as important to business in the EU as the internal regulation."
"You cannot separate the effect one has on the competitiveness of the other."
"This is not the time to pursue this argument but I am sure I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that we look forward to the next round of debates, most importantly to establishing transparency and accountability - two key words from Parliament when it comes to procurement."
"If we can do that, we shall have gone a long way towards a system of procurement regulations which is in line with the wishes expressed at every stage of this report and will enable the user to exercise the skills of business without being hampered by the overburdening of bureaucracy and restrictive legislation."
"This has been our objective."
"If we achieve all that we would be even more proud."
"In the meantime, my thanks and congratulations, in particular to Mr Langen, and to other colleagues who have been so active in this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in June 1996 this Parliament, by a very large majority rejected the draft directive liberalizing the code of public sector contracts, proposed by the Commission, in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors, as this code was deemed to be too liberal and to open up the doors of Europe to American industry without receiving anything in return."
"To all appearances, this draft was overbeneficial to companies on the other side of the Atlantic, and had it been adopted unamended, I remind this house that it would have been directly and immediately applicable, and outside parliamentary control in most of our Member States, as it fell into the regulatory field."
"At the time, this draft was pushing the boat out just a little too far, and in particular, sought to demolish the existing public licensing arrangements in many local authorities, in many countries of the Union."
"We remind you that this draft directive laid down that an industrial group or one of its subsidiaries asked to carry out studies for a facility would not subsequently be able to bid for its construction."
"At the opportune moment, Mr Langen, and here we wish to congratulate him, took the draft directive apart point-bypoint, as it delivered up the European market to foreign companies, without any reciprocal arrangements."
"Since then, much water has passed under the bridge, and we are now in a position to give an opinion on the report of the delegation to the Conciliation Committee."
"(The President asked the speaker to wind up) I have one more minute, Mr President. I thought I had two minutes."
"I do not? I will conclude then."
"The amended wording of the two statements to be published in the Official Journal, has allayed our fears, Mr President, and our group will fully support Mr Langen's excellent report."
"I am extremely disappointed that you did not let me have another minute, because we had recovered two minutes from Mr Porto, who will not be here tomorrow, and I thought you might have used this opportunity to show a little consideration."
"Mr President, I think I can make this brief."
"You have all heard how Mr Langen has been rightly praised."
"Sometimes he is wrongly praised, but in this instance it is absolutely true that he has helped to produce a very sensible compromise."
"If the Commission has ultimately done the same, this clearly shows that we are willing to achieve a result in a procedure of this kind."
"If things sometimes look different from the start, then that is because many other services within the Commission are trying to achieve an ideal position for the Commission for all sorts of reasons."
"That this is sometimes unworkable is something else we know."
"May I thank you again, Mr Langen, and wish Parliament equal success in future with conciliation!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I rise concerning comments made by my colleague Mr Hallam yesterday."
"I think he missed the point and the question he meant to ask was: In the light of recent reports in the press, can Parliament write to the Commission and ask if there is any truth in the fact that American companies are lobbying it heavily to relax legislation with regard to genetically modified organisms and genetically engineered food?"
"Could we find out from the Commission if this is the case?"
"Mr Thomas, we are on approval of the Minutes."
"We are not going to return to yesterday's debate."
"Let things be perfectly clear."
"If anything said has not been correctly reported in the Minutes that will of course be changed."
"I did not see my name in yesterday's Minutes from yesterday, but I was here."
"I would therefore like it added to the Minutes that I was present here yesterday, but that I was not included in yesterday's Minutes."
"Very well, Mr Lindqvist, we shall do just that."
"(The Minutes were approved) ."
"Madam President, it is slowly becoming embarrassing and particularly irksome for me to have to remind this House every four weeks that I have been waiting for more than a year now for a reply from the Chair as to how it could be possible for the Council presidency to say in Zimbabwe that it had no idea about any resolution adopted by Parliament in the topical and urgent debate."
"I have been making constant enquiries since September as to how such a thing can happen."
"What happens to our resolutions, and how could the Council presidency say it had no idea although the resolution was known?"
"And now I would like to request again that I finally be given a reply so that I do not have to repeat my entreaty, like a prayer wheel, at the start of every sitting!"
"We take note of your statement and your wishes."
"Are there any other comments?"
"Madam President, I will speak to you in French, to make it easy for you, as you spoke on this question."
"On 22 October I wrote a letter pursuant to Rule 28, paragraph 2, asking the Presidency of the Bureau why a car had been made available to the past President, Mr Hänsch, and why he continued to enjoy the same privileges as when he was President."
"I have only asked for a reply regarding existing precedents and the cost of these things. Also, we are currently living in a concentration camp atmosphere, where people wish to control our least movements."
"I would not want the Bureau to become a politburo which would be unaccountable to this House."
"There we have it, Madam President."
"I would like a reply!"
"Mr Fernandes, I understood the question you put to me in my own language."
"I would also have been able to understand it if it had been put in your own language."
"Having said that, the Bureau has indeed looked at the way in which we might, with a maximum of dignity, deal with our past Presidents, those of them, of course, who continue to be serving Members of this House."
"You can well imagine that, after two and a half years as President, these colleagues are very much in demand, are invited to make many visits, and to respond to many requests. We have adopted an approach which is very measured, perfectly reasonable, which I would ask you to look at with considerable care."
"That is why the Bureau has adopted these procedures, which affect a number of our colleagues, and which of course have no reason to continue once those colleagues have left Parliament."
"But I can assure you there is nothing excessive."
"I am not sure that you are aware of the precise details of these questions, because here too, many stories have done the rounds."
"It is just like that well-known story about the media, the television and the photographers."
"Things have been reported inaccurately, and I would invite you to look at what has actually been decided."
"That is quite simply what I wanted to say."
"I am personally committed to the decision that was taken."
"Madam President, I would like to believe you, and I do believe you."
"So I would like to know which of Mr Hänsch's predecessors made the same request for the same privilege."
"I do not understand. Why is Mr Hänsch the problem?"
"Mr Barón Crespo, Lord Plumb and Mr Dankert are also former Presidents of this Parliament, are they not?"
"If these measures have not been properly applied, you may indeed place the matter before the Bureau."
"I really do not understand."
"There are measures and arrangements which have been adopted and affect all past Presidents."
"I shall give the floor to Mr Hänsch, as this is a matter of personal concern."
"I think that is the least I can do."
"Madam President, thank you first of all for what you have said by way of an explanation."
"Secondly, I would like to state for the benefit of the ladies and gentlemen who have put these questions with the House's approval that there is a host of subsequent duties incumbent on a former President, a great number of requests and appeals, which have to do with how the presidency has been publicly received in the past."
"For occasions such as these I had an official car placed at my disposal."
"Every one of you who has ever seen me here in Strasbourg and in Brussels knows that I do not have an official car available, rather I queue along with those waiting for a normal car in the evening, as any other honourable Member would do."
"That as an MEP I have a car at my disposal is not true, and anyone maintaining that is lying!"
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I was not commenting on Mr Hänsch's case."
"I made a clear-cut enquiry, and you failed to understand it."
"I asked you to tell me which of Mr Hänsch's predecessors made the same suggestion to the Bureau, of having an official car placed at their disposal for several months or years, no more and no less!"
"I asked whether it was Mr Barón Crespo, or whether it was Lord Plumb, or whoever."
"I did not enquire at all about Mr Hänsch."
"I would like to know who, apart from Mr Hänsch, made the request of the Bureau."
"I would like an answer on this."
"Mrs Pack, I did understand that you were talking about Mr Hänsch, but I am not even aware if the request originated from Mr Hänsch himself."
"The Bureau considered a proposal from the Secretary General, without us knowing whether..."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please."
"The Bureau of 5 November 1997 adopted the following points. Offices equivalent to those of the chairmen of committees or delegations, secretarial assistance for two and a half years, availability of an official vehicle with driver for the first three months, followed by priority access to drivers to allow past Presidents on termination of office to honour their commitments outside their normal place of work for the following nine months."
"These were the limitations set on the Bureau's decision."
"I think it is important to be specific about this, as I am tempted into believing that many colleagues, and this is quite normal, had no exact knowledge of these matters."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that this proposal was not identified as originating from any particular person."
"It was proposed by the Secretary General of the European Parliament as applicable to all past presidents, and the President of the European Parliament was considerate enough to say he would prefer Mrs Fontaine to take the chair for that part of the Bureau meeting, as it would affect him as well, once he was no longer President This request was not put forward by any particular person."
"It was put forward in its own right, and it was adopted subject to those restrictions."
"We did not get into a debate on the subject, but in my view, my colleagues should be fully informed of the context in which this decision was taken."
"Madam President, the decision taken by the Bureau will apply in the future."
"This means that, in future, every President of this House will be able to make use of this facility for a period of three months after the end of his mandate."
"That seems reasonable to me; it also seems to me in the interest of this entire House."
"And may I add, Madam President, that it is my firm belief that Mr Hänsch was one of the best Presidents this Parliament ever had, and that I am proud that, three months after his mandate has come to end, he will still be able to function in such a way."
"Madam President, first of all, the Presidency Minutes are sent to every Member."
"That is why every Member with eyes and ears has been able to read what the Presidency resolved in this matter."
"There is, therefore, nothing surprising about what we are dealing with here."
"Secondly, this is a general resolution affecting all Presidents of this House."
"Thirdly, as regards unusual, Mrs Pack, what is being practised here is no different from what all presidents or speakers of the 15 national parliaments are entitled to."
"Fourthly, this Parliament should not diminish itself."
"It should be proud that Presidents of this Parliament can appear and deliver speeches in other Member States, that they represent the interests of this House and not the interests of a political group."
"That is why, fifthly, I find it shameful that a debate is being conducted here about the President who has represented this House in a way that not many other Presidents have managed to do!"
"Thank you, Mr Samland, I think that you have very appropriately conveyed the feelings of the Bureau when it took this decision."
"Madam President, I have another point of order."
"I submitted two questions about the building work in Brussels and Strasbourg, one to the Commission and one to the Council of Ministers."
"I have asked questions before, but I have never got a letter back saying that questions cannot be asked."
"However, now I have received such a letter in which my questions are answered by saying that they are not permitted under Rule 41.1."
"I now have a question for you as President."
"Since my questions were sent to the President of the Parliament, I would like to know who it is who decides whether questions may be asked in Parliament or not."
"Is it yourself, some presiding committee or Parliament's members who decide?"
"I do not see my questions here on the question form, neither the question to the Commission, nor the one to the Council."
"I consider questions about the building work in Brussels and Strasbourg to be questions which greatly concern us and our voters who ask questions."
"It must be possible to ask this kind of question."
"I demand an answer as to who decides whether my questions may be asked or not."
"The reply is very clear. The President of the European Parliament has the power to decide on the admissibility of questions."
"In reality, your questions are directed to the Council and to the Commission, and they should have been raised pursuant to Rule 28, but it is perfectly possible for you to restate those questions under the appropriate Rule, and at that point, quite clearly, you will receive a reply."
"Madam President, I too asked the President about the cost of the computer system in Brussels."
"I trust that I will not receive a reply to the effect that I cannot receive a reply on the basis of Rule 41.1 which Mr Lindqvist has referred to."
"When Members put a question to the President, they are entitled to an answer and Rules should not be used to obviate that answer."
"We must have an answer as to why we have a computer system in Brussels which cannot take CD-roms and on which the main contractor has a three-year warranty, which prevents us using the computers for user-friendly purposes."
"Answers to these questions must be given."
"Our constituents demand it."
"Mr Falconer, it appears that your question has been restated in accordance with Rule 28, and you will be receiving a reply."
"Madam President, I will not go back to the matter I raised here."
"If the Quaestors give evidence in this House we shall know what really happened. We shall know the truth."
"I would just like to mention that I submitted an urgent written question to the Commission on 20 October."
"That question raised the matter of the disastrous agricultural policy to which the structural funds were applied in my country."
"I know it has still not arrived, and the Secretary General of this Parliament told me it should have been here by 19 November."
"I have always spoken against the conspiracy of silence between the Commission and member countries."
"They cover up for each other."
"That is why I have not had a reply."
"I am entitled to that reply and so are the people of Portugal."
"The number of the question is 3479/97 and it was submitted on 20 October."
"I know Commissioner Deus Pinheiro - that is, the voice of the authorities - has tried to prevent the reply from being sent out."
"If that is an acceptable procedure in a democracy, Madam President, then I would rather live in a totalitarian state."
"I have already lived under a dictatorship, and it certainly did not use procedures like the ones that are often used here."
"Mr Rosado Fernandes, I did not hear the end of your speech."
"I shall confine myself to the first part, and say that we will check and ensure that you receive a reply to the question you have raised."
"Madam President, it seems to me that Mr Rosado's final statement was an insult to democracies."
"I have had the misfortune to live under a dictatorship, and the procedures used in a dictator state are very different from those which this Parliament has adopted."
"I would ask Mr Rosado Fernandes to rephrase his statement, in order to show support for democratic institutions and this Parliament."
"Mr Medina Ortega, that was the reason I preferred not to have heard."
"Draft budget for 1998"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A4-0390/97) by Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Communities for the financial year 1998, as modified by the Council (Sections I to VI) (C4-0600/97) and on amending letter 1/98 to the 1998 preliminary draft budget, Section III - Commission (C4-0645/97)-(A4-0409/97) by Mr Giansily, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft ECSC operating budget for 1998 (SEC(97)0933 - C4-0270/97)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the second reading of the budget by the Council and the second reading last week in the Committee on Budgets, there is now a proposal on the table which has to be voted on this Thursday."
"In view of the fact that so many members have left the House, I assume that we have a good proposal here since there hardly seems to be any need to debate it."
"But how does it look in concrete terms?"
"As a European Parliament we have signalled from the start that we are ready and willing to respect the Edinburgh decisions, especially with regard to the structural funds."
"We decided from the start that we could not declare ourselves in agreement with the Economics and Finance Council's position of aiming for zero growth as the Edinburgh decisions did not consider that realistic."
"The European Parliament was open to a moderate growth, in line with European reality and reflecting the efforts of the Member States in their national budgets."
"However, our condition here was that there should be an equal burden on all areas of budget expenditure, and of course we also staked a claim to implement and fulfil our political priorities."
"I would like to reiterate those priorities we decided on in March."
"They were combatting unemployment, tapping the potential of small and medium-sized businesses, preparing the groundwork for enlargement to the central and eastern European countries, and promoting youth, education and culture programmes."
"On the question of initiating preparations for enlargement, we decided, where the Commission is concerned, on a reserve of 20 ""A' posts as a political sign that entry negotiations should start in 1998."
"This reserve -I would like to suggest to this House - cannot be sustained in principle any longer since the Council gave the Commission a clear job last weekend of setting about the spadework for the entry negotiations."
"I think this satisfies our political intentions linked to this reserve."
"One thing that was not open to discussion from the start was a repetition of what we found last year with the Council, namely cuts in structural funds payments."
"We gave that the thumbs-down from the word go."
"To that extent we remained true to our remit."
"I would particularly like to mention the success we had with the 1998 budget in the area of agriculture."
"It is not just that the relationship between ""budgeteers' and ""agrarians' in this House has basically improved and become constructive. No, we have now developed a budget procedure with which it is essential we continue."
"We are now in a position, courtesy of the latest data, to adapt the Commission's preliminary draft for agricultural spending to the real conditions found in the year and so not only create a sensible budgetary policy, but also allow the Member States to make savings."
"The allocations for those involved, to wit the farmers, still remain unaffected by this; only the overly high estimates in the agricultural budget we normally have every year have been reduced to a minimum with the 1998 budget."
"Incidentally, we have had other successes in the area of agriculture."
"For the first time we have achieved the right to be consulted along with the Council in this area, with amendments from the Committee on Agriculture being taken into account at the Council's second reading."
"This is a success of our negotiations."
"We achieved a new nomenclature in a certain area of agricultural spending."
"We also have a reserve of ECU 200 million, where we are not only able to have a say, but are required to have a say."
"The procedure provides for this."
"It means we also have the right to be consulted in the area of obligatory expenditure."
"And we also said, right from the start, that if the Commission tabled an amending letter, then there should be no corrections through across-the-board cuts!"
"The Commission followed the advice, and both Council and Parliament supported this approach."
"In June and July of this year - something that has almost been forgotten -we submitted a recommendation to the employment summit in Luxembourg."
"This concerned creating jobs in small and medium-sized businesses and giving them the incentive to create additional vacancies."
"We know the outcome."
"Now it is a matter of starting to implement the political decisions of Luxembourg as quickly as possible and of getting the Commission to come up with a suitable proposal for a legal basis as early as possible in the New Year, because we can only help small and medium-sized businesses if a legal basis is created for such expenditure."
"I would like to remind you that this is the first time the European Parliament has succeeded in launching its own initiative before the Council, and that the European Parliament in contrast to the Council - and I do not mean the current presidency, but the Council on the Yugoslavia question, say, or Meda - has not just formulated one proposal, but has also said that we will find the money, and not just at the expense of other policy areas."
"We have achieved our priorities in the area of culture and education."
"We have - I am pleased to report - secured for Socrates, in concerted action with the Council, a deal involving additional monies being made available to students and young people from 1998 onwards, including ECU 35 million in 1998 and ECU 35 million in 1999."
"This is also a unique achievement: arriving at a figure during conciliation which is higher than the budget estimate put forward by the Commission."
"This has never happened before in the course of the conciliation procedure."
"In addition - and I refer to my statement just now about Meda and Yugoslavia - we have restored the balance in foreign policy, specifically in favour of the priorities of the developing countries and Latin America."
"And, last but not least, we are tabling a proposal which leaves a margin of ECU 800 million, money which has not been spent, although this might have been possible."
"Together with the cuts in payments, that is an operating result each MEP can be proud about at home."
"This 1998 budget is more realistic than ever before and puts an end to the myth that money in Europe is only ever wasted."
"I know there are colleagues, albeit only a few, in this House who do not share this view."
"Yet their argument alone, that we have not achieved anything else this year other than putting the interinstitutional agreement into practice for the first time, is a remarkable achievement from an institutional point of view."
"Mr President-in-Office, I told you before the first reading that you had not got the budget in the bag yet."
"And I reminded you that it was precisely during the last Luxembourg Presidency that the budget procedure did not have a successful outcome."
"This time round, I have to confess, you were a fair partner."
"This budget is not least a personal success on your part, on the part of the Council."
"You have set a high standard for the future, and I hope future presidencies will continue to pass on this baton that you hand down to your successor."
"Despite all the general satisfaction, there are still a few items on the request list which I would have liked to see ticked off."
"We have not made any significant progress with the legal bases."
"Though all the signs are there in principle."
"In my opinion, the approach to this year's budget has provided a firm basis for us to progress in the next round of talks on the question of legal bases."
"Nor have we made the breakthrough - and I am personally sorry about this - in fisheries."
"We were close to making a final agreement with the Netherlands."
"But here the Commission, which also has something to say on the issue, was not really involved. So we are not 100 % satisfied where fisheries are concerned."
"Yet I believe that the budget for 1998, which will be put to the vote on Thursday, is a good proposal."
"I hope that the British and Austrians next year will take up this proposal in this spirit."
"For my part, as rapporteur for this House, I would now like to hand over the baton for the 1999 budget to my successor, Barbara Dührkop Dührkop."
"I wish to thank everyone most sincerely - the President, the Commission and my colleagues in Parliament who were involved in preparing this budget for 1998."
"Madam President, my task is relatively simple by comparison with that of Mr Tillich, because this year, for the first time, all the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, with a minor exception, have been adopted by the Council."
"That is unique and it shows that we have been showing the same level of financial prudence as that which the Council has sought to apply to other areas of the budget."
"I mention that because it is an object lesson."
"The recognition of our financial prudence is something that could be learned by some of our colleagues who have been complaining volubly about waste and yet do not participate in any of our discussions about controlling it."
"In terms of the other institutions, including our own, there have been no amendments by the Council to our budget."
"The twenty per cent ceiling of category 5 appropriations has been respected, as we always said it would be, despite the cost of the new buildings, which everybody in this House knows were not necessarily our choice but were forced upon us by decisions taken by the Heads of State and of Government meeting in Edinburgh and, subsequently, Amsterdam."
"We have done all that and, at the same time, in category 5, maintained a margin of ECU 187 million."
"That is a very satisfactory outcome."
"There is, however, a relatively minor problem concerning the revenue amendments referred to in paragraphs 24 and 25 of our report."
"I said to the Council during the conciliation that I really did not think any of the members of the Council would understand the detail of what we were doing, and that proved to be the case."
"What we were doing was quite simply entering into the budget remarks in accordance with article 20.2 of the Financial Regulation."
"These are remarks on the revenue side of the budget, designed for the maximum clarity and transparency."
"They are already incorporated by the Court of Auditors in the remarks on its budget, and we sought to get an interinstitutional standard of equal regard for article 20.2."
"For some theological reason which I, and I suspect the majority of members of the Council, do not fully understand, there was a reluctance to accept our amendments."
"We have nevertheless reincorporated them."
"We hope that the Council will see the wisdom of this, accept it and will even go further than that by deciding that during the forthcoming year, instead of leaving a lot of our discussions to the very last minute, it will enter into a sensible dialogue with Parliament on the revenue side of the budget."
"This year we have had major constraint of expenditure - sometimes damaging constraint of expenditure - without any sensible dialogue about the wastes that occur by not getting the full rights of own resources and other revenues entered into the budget."
"Each extra ECU coming into the budget is worth as much as an ECU saved on the expenditure side."
"Yet when we look at the wastes on the own-resources side, from the collection of traditional own resources, the fraud in preferential trade agreements, the failure to ensure proper collection of excise duty and VAT, and the whole question of transit fraud on which this Parliament had a committee of inquiry, we can see massive losses of potential income to the European budget which could be had without increasing the own-resources rates."
"So we hope that the Council will start a process of sensible dialogue with us on revenue and that, instead of having this conciliation at the last minute, we can perhaps in the earlier part of next year have a sensible dialogue with the British presidency together with the Luxembourg presidency and the Austrians, so that we can take all these questions fully into consideration."
"The other paragraph in the report I would just like to draw to Parliament's attention is paragraph 26."
"Some Members of this House were concerned that following the decision of the Court of Justice we had not got the appropriations for the twelfth part-session on the line; they were fully in reserve."
"Paragraph 26 clearly invites the administration to bring forward the appropriate transfer for the twelfth part-session in Strasbourg, and it points out that there are suitable and easy methods of financing that."
"With those few words, I, like Mr Tillich, thank all the staff, the administration of Parliament, the Committee on Budgets and also the Commission and the Council for their cooperation on the budget."
"I hope that this cooperation continues with their acceptance of our minor revenue-side amendments and then a sensible discussion on the revenue side later next year."
"Madam President, with the ECSC budget we are dealing with a traditional report which is now of no great interest and regarded as something of a hangover from a far-off and long distant past, and which in the last few weeks has caused an astonishing rumpus, because of the position of the Committee on Budgets."
"Before I deal with that, I would like, as an exception, to refer to a text which dates back a bit but which I think has something to recommend it."
"It goes something like this. A common interest creates solidarity."
"It makes new solutions possible, which were not possible in national forms."
"The financial expression of this solidarity is the levy on all the coal and steel production of our six countries, made under the treaty and handed over to the High Authority."
"This levy protects the labour force against the risks to which it was previously exposed and which stood in the way of the necessary progress."
"This levy makes it possible to finance a conversion fund, so that workers who change jobs receive compensation which will contribute in large measure to removing their anxiety about the future."
"The same person also said that the enlarged market, where the producer may be subject to competition from a wider range of companies, and in where the consumer knows he can rely on a greater number of suppliers, changes the attitudes of people through changes in the economic situation."
"These few sentences were spoken here, in Strasbourg itself, on 20 May 1954."
"You will not be surprised when I tell you they were spoken by Jean Monnet, at a time when the construction of Europe was a thing of the future, and had not yet been buried under the deadweight of technostructure."
"The Commission's report on the 1998 ECSC budget proposes burying this levy, unnoticed and unmourned, five years before the 2002 deadline, the pretext being that the ECSC has not made any loans since 23 July last."
"A fine thing!"
"That decision is inappropriate."
"It does not respect the spirit of the founding fathers, as the levy had not been intended to be made in consideration of anything whatsoever, but to be a system of financial compensation to promote employment."
"That is why we are asking for the levy to be kept, and for the relevant funds be devoted to employment in the coal and steel sectors, to research and innovation, for the benefit for young entrepreneurs and dynamic researchers, who do not believe their sector is in terminal decline."
"These funds should be handled by the EIB, which should allocate preferential interest rate loans to small and medium-sized companies creating new jobs."
"In 1998, the sector is set to lose 28, 000 jobs."
"When Members of the European Parliament are confronted in their own countries with the tragedy of families hard-hit by unemployment, they cannot be expected to cheerfully accept the disappearance, not only of 28, 000 jobs, but also of a source of finance which would make it possible to create at least a few alternative jobs."
"It is possible, Mr Liikanen, that DG XIX has become an island managing prosperity which is now rare indeed in Europe, the ECSC treasury, which I remind you, amounts to ECU 1.2 billion."
"The report on the use of these funds will provide an opportunity for interesting discussion, which will doubtless be an extension of your report for 1998, and we hope you will today be looking at the proposals of the Committee on Budgets, in the full awareness that, in addition to the financial considerations, we are faced with a full-scale problem of political philosophy, which is the reason why the majority of the Committee on Budgets opposes your proposal to eliminate the levy."
"I am aware, of course, that you have the last word, but I believe you would be wrong to underestimate this issue."
"Naturally, my group supports the report I have had the honour of presenting on behalf of the Committee on Budgets."
"By agreement with the session services, I take advantage of this opportunity to move straight on to our group's position on the report by our colleagues, Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson."
"While we largely endorse the conclusions of the trialogue, in particular as regards structural funds, reduction of which was not acceptable to the Committee on Budgets in 1998, the penultimate year for the financial perspectives under the Edinburgh agreement, we cannot, on the other hand, accept a reduction of ECU 550 million in obligatory expenditure, nor, in particular, the targeted reduction of ECU 250 million: ECU 100 million for the agri-monetary regime, ECU 100 million for the beef sector support measures, and ECU 50 million for swine fever."
"Indeed, I believe that the European Parliament, by agreeing to enter into a process of incipient codecision, as our colleague Mr Tillich demonstrated just a moment ago, is going down the wrong road."
"There is obligatory expenditure, where the Council has the last word, and there is non-obligatory expenditure where Parliament has the last word."
"To enter into commitments for expenditure over which we do not have the final say, in a codecision procedure which ends up costing us ECU 500 million, is unacceptable as far as our group is concerned, and that is the reason why we will abstain in the vote on agricultural expenditure."
"For the rest, and in particular as regards the reductions affecting European Union internal policy and external actions, we are fully aware that concessions had to be made, so to speak, and sacrificial victims offered up on the altar of monetary union, in spite of the effort already made by our Parliament in 1996 for 1997."
"Even so, I repeat that we are fairly satisfied with the agreement on the structural funds, as we have an agreement on the Peace programme for Northern Ireland - my Irish colleague, who will be speaking about this later, is far more competent that I am on the issue - and we are also delighted - I repeat - that measures have been taken in favour of employment, even if the initiative we proposed for the ECSC has not been agreed, and that there is still ECU 150 million for the three financial years, ECU 450 million in total, which will provide us with the finance for the decisions that were taken in Luxembourg."
"I would like to conclude, Madam President, by thanking the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council, as I believe that this year, we had far better dialogue than in the previous years with other presidencies, and all these discussions were extremely fruitful, with everything put straight on the table."
"I would also like to offer my sincere thanks to our colleague, Mr Tillich, for the kindness he has shown to all members of the Committee on Budgets, as well as to the chairman, Mr Samland et Mr Tomlinson, for their work in the Committee on Budgets."
"Madam President, all the speeches I have made this year on the 1998 Budget have started with my saying that I enjoy excellent cooperation with the Committee on Budgets."
"I am glad to say that still applies."
"I would like to thank Mr Tillich and Mr Samland, in their respective positions, for this."
"I would also like to include the Presidency of the Council, the Netherlands at the beginning of this year, and subsequently Luxembourg."
"The agriculture budget this year is unique, because if we are to believe the latest estimates of the Commission, we are setting a budget which is certain to be too low."
"The Committee on Agriculture nevertheless adopted it and accepted it because it is also aware of all the cuts which have to be implemented throughout Europe in connection with the introduction of the euro."
"We therefore agreed to it, but on one clear condition."
"That condition is more input from this Parliament into the agriculture budget, and for this we would like an extra supplementary Budget and figures from the Commission, if necessary in March or April next year; a positive attitude from the Council and Parliament will be needed."
"We welcome the solidarity which has been demonstrated in this Parliament in wanting to reduce the agriculture budget by the same amount as headings 3 and 4."
"Two things were at the forefront of the discussions this year."
"First, no reduction on arable farming supplements."
"We considered this essential."
"The rules should not be changed halfway through the game, and we are grateful to Parliament for following us in that."
"The second point is on the amendments from the Agriculture Committee which have been taken up to a large extent by Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"One thing became clear."
"The agriculture budget - and many people may have thought this - is not safe in the sole care of the Council of Ministers."
"That is why it is essential for there to be a trialogue in years to come, and the procedure followed this year should not be a nine days' wonder, but one we will continue in the years ahead."
"It is necessary that we maintain agricultural spending at a satisfactory level."
"Madam President, the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment has frequently had to deal with the question of how the phasing-in of the ECSC policies is to be combined with the phasing-out of the ECSC."
"It is important for us that parallelism really exists, that whole areas of social policy are not destroyed with the abolition of the ECSC, that the positive responsibilities anchored in the ECSC Treaty do not simply disappear and - I might add -that the ECSC reserves do not disappear in the process because, for example, the Commission is of the opinion that a lot of money needs to be spent closing down the Polish mines or similar large enterprises, for which the Commission might have appropriate plans tucked away somewhere."
"I would like to stress again in context that the ECSC reserves ought to be investigated more closely, because the ECSC pursued a very far-sighted and intelligent banking policy in the past and used the system of authorizations and payments to build up a whole series of reserves, which is hard to comprehend."
"Mr Giansily has suggested that something might yet be done for employment in this area via the levy."
"I find this meaningful insofar as it strengthens the EIB programme."
"It makes no sense simply wishing to curb structural change, instead the money must actually be used for innovative projects."
"Clearly it is not very much."
"Moreover, we are not all in agreement in my group whether this is a sensible strategic emphasis or rather a less sensible ad hoc venture, but the strategic emphasis could take the direction of doing something to alleviate the specific distress, particularly in the coal regions - the steel regions are less affected."
"This seems sensible and no doubt also conforms to the Social Committee's line in fighting to see that the available monies are mobilized for those affected and for the wage and salary earners."
"It is in this spirit that I might support Mr Giansily's initiative."
"We still need to debate this, however."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets on this occasion for the great work that they have achieved in securing ECU 70 million over two years for the Socrates programme."
"This, as Mr Tillich pointed out, is an unprecedented situation, where the amount eventually agreed by the Council is above the amount requested by the Commission."
"I know that this is a result of heavy pressure and brinkmanship by our Parliament representatives during the conciliation process which I understand lasted for about six hours."
"The amounts granted at the end recognize the role of education in enhancing job creation."
"Thousands of students and teachers will be jubilant at the additional funding."
"Of course the figure, as far as the Culture Committee is concerned, will always be too low, but this is a huge step in the right direction."
"I would, however, like to point out an anomaly in the system that we have developed as a Parliament in terms of the conciliation process: the Culture Committee was all geared up to start conciliation on the budgetary aspects of Socrates."
"The deal that was made by the Budgets Committee is something that all members of my committee would recognize as being extremely difficult to achieve in a straight conciliation process by the Culture Committee."
"But the process made a nonsense of conciliation by the Culture Committee later."
"In future, therefore, if individual committees are entering into conciliation of budgetary aspects, agreements will have to be made with the Budgets Committee before conciliation is tied up so that the amount agreed will be respected by the Budgets Committee in the subsequent annual budget."
"We found that the system has worked against us in Raphael in the past, but in this case has worked to our advantage."
"We are, however, delighted by the results of Socrates in particular, and recognize the hard work done on our behalf by the Budgets Committee."
"Madam President, first of all, there is a mistake in the paperwork given to us."
"The same amendments appear both as having been passed by the Committee on Budgets and not having been passed by the Committee on Budgets."
"I hope that can be rectified."
"I would like to thank very much my colleagues on the Budgets Committee for their cooperation throughout this year."
"As far as the budget for energy and research is concerned, we need to look at what it can allow us to do, particularly in terms of the agreement reached at Kyoto which, although disappointing, nevertheless requires action from us."
"There are three things you can do to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuels."
"You can use nuclear energy, and the Euratom Treaty allows large amounts of money for the safe use of nuclear energy."
"You can be more efficient with energy: the programme which concerns us there is the Save II programme where the Council has been disappointingly unambitious in the amount of money it has allotted."
"I am pleased that Parliament is increasing the money a little and is insisting that some of the money is spent locally by networks covering the regions, islands and cities."
"The third thing you can do is use renewable energy and I am disappointed that so far there is no legal base for Altener II."
"When there is, I appreciate the fact that the Budgets Committee says they may be able to put more money into that programme."
"As far as research is concerned, all of us were extremely disappointed, including yourself I know, Madam President, at the results of the conciliation process where the ECU 700 million we had expected to be added to the Fourth Framework Programme ended up as a mere ECU 115 million."
"Nevertheless, I would like to thank the Budgets Committee for their help and cooperation, which enabled us to put some pressure on the Council."
"So far as the question of fusion and the Jet staff are concerned, alI I can say is this should be a lesson to us in future: in big projects you can end up with big trouble if you are not very careful about the details."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, three months ago, to the very day, I had the opportunity and the honour of setting out before you the main lines of the first reading of the draft budget by the Council."
"On this basis, Parliament proceeded to the first reading of the budget in its October part-session."
"The Council, for its part, as you know, adopted the draft budget at its second reading, on 27 November."
"Between the two readings, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, procedural events of crucial importance have occurred."
"Here, I have in mind the trialogue of 17 November, and in particular the ad hoc concertation of 27 November on agricultural expenditure provided for in the Commission's letter of amendment."
"In a general manner, I would like here to mention the discussions which have regularly taken place during the budget adoption procedures, for example, the meeting of the Parliamentary delegation with the ministers of finance, with the Member States budget ministers, and Commissioner Liikanen, before the Council's final adoption of the budget at its second reading."
"As regards the decisions taken by the Council at its budget meeting, on 27 November, these bear the mark of the discussions that I have just alluded to, and which gave rise to important agreements. On the one hand, these provided for compliance with the principles of rigour and budgetary discipline fixed from the very start by the Council, and on the other hand, they took into account of the results of the European Council on employment."
"Essentially, these decisions are as follows."
"In the field of agricultural expenditure, the forecast amount is as agreed at the concertation meeting of 27 November, taking into account the revised forecast requirements communicated by the Commission, as well as a supplementary abatement of some ECU 550 million, which is the counterpart to a reduction of the same amount in non-obligatory expenditures under headings 3 and 4."
"In this respect, Madam President, I wish to say that the presidency and the Council have at the very least as much reason as your Parliament itself to be satisfied with the way these discussions took place."
"Indeed, your Parliament, from the outset, told us that it was ready to shoulder its burden of responsibility with regard to expenditure under headings 3 and 4, insofar as the Council was ready to shoulder its responsibilities with regard to expenditure under heading 1, that is, agricultural expenditure."
"On this point, I think that everybody has finally kept to their commitments."
"With regard to heading 2, the Council agreed to keep to the amounts set by Parliament at its first reading."
"The Council considers that in so doing, Madam President, it has very seriously contributed to better collaboration with the other branch of the budget authority."
"While in the Council's view the identified expenditure of funds advanced made possible a degree of budgetary rigour in this field, it has given up the cuts in payment appropriations decided at first reading, and has followed, respected, and accepted the position of the European Parliament, whereas we, the Parliament and the Council, know perfectly well that the Edinburgh objectives related only to commitments, and not to payments."
"This decision was basically made in the light of our concern for a better understanding with the other branch of the budget authority, that is, with yourselves, Madam President."
"It is true that this must be compensated for by real rigour in other sectors of non-obligatory expenditure."
"That is what your Committee on Budgets is proposing."
"Furthermore, the Council has accepted Parliament's proposals regarding Peace in the light of the Commissioner's suggestions."
"Headings 3 and 4, taken together, are expressions of the same budgetary rigour as applies to expenditure under heading 1."
"Having said that, the Council - and, I believe, your Parliament as well - is convinced that these austerity measures are in no way prejudicial to the implementation of the Union's internal and external policies."
"With regard to the other important points I want to raise, Madam President, I would first like to emphasize the increase of some ECU 70 million in the funding for the Socrates programme for the years 1998 and 1999."
"This programme is rightly regarded as of first importance in this House, because it aims at better training for our students."
"Following on from the European Council of 21 November, the Council, as agreed, set aside ECU 150 million in commitments for the employment initiative promoted by the European Parliament."
"The Council has kept its word and thanks Parliament for this initiative, which will give the decisions taken by the European Council on employment much more convincing legitimacy."
"In the research field, the Council has implemented parliamentary and Council codecisions on the adaptation of the fourth framework programme."
"Furthermore, in accordance with our agreement of 27 November, the Council transferred ECU 25 million from Tacis to the Chernobyl expenditure line."
"The Tacis commentary specifies that it is possible to provide for identical reinforced funding for Chernobyl insofar as, in accordance with the legitimate concerns of the Parliament, other donor countries are also ready to abide by their commitments."
"That, Madam President, is what I wanted to say on the essential features of this second reading of the draft budget for 1998."
"Basing myself on the preparatory work, and after hearing the two rapporteurs, Stanislaw Tillich and John Tomlinson, I have high hopes that the Committee on Budgets will submit a budget for the forthcoming financial year to the vote of your plenary session which will, in its major lines and overall policies, reflect a consensus between the two branches of the budgetary authority at the highest level, so far unequalled in the budgetary history of the European Communities."
"This 1998 budget, Madam President, is a balanced budget which in practice should give satisfaction and be acceptable to both branches of the budget authority."
"From this I infer that the 1998 budget is a good budget."
"It is the result of an effort of mutual comprehension and substantial reciprocal concessions."
"It is above all the result of close cooperation, essentially based on the principle of mutual trust between the two branches of the budget authority."
"In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to say one word more, to express special and very sincere thanks to your Parliament, your Committee on Budgets, the chairman of your Committee on Budgets, Mr Detlev Samland, the two rapporteurs, Mr Stanislaw Tillich and Mr John Tomlinson, and all the others for their competence, their commitment, their loyalty, and also their dependability."
"I say this because, in the final analysis, Madam President, I have the feeling that if there is an agreement, then the praise for reaching that agreement must essentially go to this Parliament."
"Finally, I would like to direct some words of gratitude and appreciation to Commissioner Erkki Liikanen, to Mr Mingasson and to all the others who have shouldered their burden of responsibility in the service of the Commission, and who have made a definite and a decisive contribution to today's overall agreement."
"We offer them our warmest thanks."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-office of the Council."
"In turn, on behalf of Parliament, I would like to thank you warmly for your words."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, as you have said, this has been quite a remarkable budget procedure."
"The general budget for 1998 is a rigorous one which respects the obligations of the Union and reinforces the focus on employment creation and expenditure."
"The 1998 budget is a rigorous one."
"Its growth rates of 2.4 % in commitments and 1.4 % in payments are below the growth in national public expenditure."
"Its margin of some ECU 7 billion below the own resources ceiling facilitates the consolidation efforts of Member States."
"Furthermore, it is a sizeable reserve for future responsibilities of the Union, first and foremost to prepare for enlargement."
"The decision on negotiations was taken last week in Luxembourg."
"The 1998 budget reserves significant margins in headings 3, 4 and 5 and, for the first time since the system of financial perspectives has been created, these margins in commitment appropriations are real savings."
"They should put to rest the notion in some capitals that the Community 'spends it all' ."
"I heartily agree with the rapporteur, Mr Tillich"
"But the 1998 budget will be more than just a budget of savings."
"As the result of an impressive cooperation between the institutions, in particular between the European Parliament and the Council presidency, this budget also concentrates expenditure on programmes which can have a real impact on employment in the Community."
"The Commission will adopt its proposal for a single legal base early in January."
"Due to the endorsements from the special European Council of 28 November 1997 it should be adopted quickly."
"I understand that there is also a proposal regarding the budget of the European Coal and Steel Community to contribute to these efforts."
"Such a contribution can be conceived."
"Taking into account the sectoral objectives of the budget it could most effectively be linked to the Community initiatives Resider and Rechar."
"The unanimous agreement of the Council would still be needed."
"It is a different matter whether such a contribution would require the levy to be maintained."
"It would appear that it could be comfortably financed from other resources without calling into question the long-term proposals which the Commission put forward on 8 October 1997."
"The Commission will have an orientation debate on the operational budget for the ECSC this afternoon."
"It will decide after the opinion of Parliament has been adopted."
"Coming back to the general budget, it is also remarkable for the procedural developments which made this result possible."
"Interinstitutional cooperation has been of unprecedented quality moving from what was sometimes perceived as a dialogue of the deaf, as Terry Wynn very often said, to substantive and serious discussions of priorities, procedures and expenditure in all parts of the budget."
"With regard to compulsory expenditure, full agreement was found between both branches of the budgetary authority."
"The agreement to have a rectifying letter late in the budgetary procedure has been a successful innovation."
"It should become a permanent arrangement."
"On non-compulsory expenditure, the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on the commitment appropriations for important Community activities such as the Socrates programme and the Chernobyl Shelter Fund."
"And they have agreed on the overall volume of payments appropriations."
"It should not be forgotten that the spirit of cooperation has facilitated rapid agreement on the new procedure for the funding of CFSP actions."
"Is it possible to characterize the state of the budget procedure today as interinstitutional cooperation on a partnership basis?"
"If the answer is yes, then the interinstitutional agreement of 1993 has borne one of its most difficult fruits, not by means of a change of the treaty but by pragmatic acceptance of what is best for the Community."
"I conclude by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Samland, for their extraordinary work on the 1998 general budget."
"Last, but not least, I should include in these congratulations the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Fischbach, who has skilfully built on the foundations left by the Dutch presidency and has demonstrated what a Council presidency can achieve in cooperative dialogue between institutions."
"Madam President, I will continue with this back-scratching exercise that is going on."
"It is usual to begin by thanking the rapporteurs - in this case, Mr Tillich, Mr Tomlinson and Mr Giansily."
"I have no hesitation in doing just that."
"There are other thanks which need to be given because of the nature of this budget."
"As has been said by previous speakers, we find ourselves in a position of consensus rather than the normal position of animosity between the institutions."
"So, thanks to the Commission; thanks to Mr Liikanen and his team for facilitating the process; thanks to the Luxembourg presidency which, I hope, as others have said, has set a precedent for the future in working with Parliament; thanks to the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets for the extremely hard work they have done for Members; and thanks to that 'devil' of Parliament - which many people seem to think he is - Mr Samland, for the skill that he showed during the conciliation process and along with that, to the members of the Budgets Committee who were with him in getting that agreement with the Council."
"The budget has not been easy."
"It sounds great at this stage, but let us not forget that this has not been an easy process for Parliament."
"It could be argued that we have actually given the Council more than we really should have done."
"I hope that the Council - and not just the Luxembourg presidency, because I am sure you do understand it - appreciates how far Parliament has moved on this budget, not just in the sacrifices it has made, but also in the margins that exist."
"We have been prudent and we have tried to play our part."
"But that must not be forgotten."
"We all seem to be quite smug about this and seem to be wanting to sit back and say what a good job we have done, but we must not be too complacent."
"There are warning signs if we do become complacent."
"The fact that in 1997 and 1998 we cut payment appropriations can only be a one-off exercise for the headings concerned."
"It cannot become the norm."
"If we try to make it the norm, all we do is create a burden for the future in solving short-term problems."
"We need to see Parliament and the Council working closer together."
"The process that took place this year with the ad hoc procedure for agriculture must be continued into next year for fisheries and the CFSP."
"That can only benefit everybody."
"The Luxembourg Presidency, the United Kingdom Presidency and the future Austrian Presidency need to get together as a troika with Parliament early in the New Year as is planned, to make sure that we can continue in this spirit of cooperation because there are a lot of gaps between Parliament and the Council that still need to be bridged, especially on things like legal bases, on classification, the fisheries sector, and revenue."
"All those things we still need to thrash out."
"I said during the first reading that the integrity of the Council rested on its ability to deliver the employment chapter."
"It has done it, and I say to the President-in-Office in a colloquial term, ' you have played a blinder' in doing that."
"Of course the next test is that, when the supplementary and amending budget comes along - if and when it is needed - those payments have to be found, not just for Category 1, but for headings 3 and 4."
"Then both we and the Council will look to the Commission to bring forward that proposal."
"If we can do that then the spirit of cooperation will indeed be evident for all to see."
"I should like to give one other word of thanks before I finish, to Mr Waidelich, for the work that he did on the Jet project."
"His working document, which was the basis of our report, is to be commended."
"He should have the commendation of this Chamber."
"In relation to that, there will be an amendment moved by Mr Tillich, the rapporteur, agreed by Mr Waidelich, which our group will be supporting."
"Madam President, I must admit I find it unusual at this stage in the budgetary procedure not to be fighting for something."
"We are in the process already of congratulation, and rightly so, because this has been an historic budgetary process for 1998."
"Like Terry Wynn, I wish to thank those who have been involved - that is normal process - but in particular Stan Tillich and John Tomlinson, as the two rapporteurs on the major reports for this year."
"This year is characterized by three particular features which come clearly to mind."
"The first, to which the Commissioner has referred, is the way in which we have moved from a process of confrontation in the budgetary procedure to one more like codecision, as if, by magic, we are finding a way of blurring the distinction between obligatory and non-obligatory expenditure without having to go through a treaty revision to do so."
"I welcome this because it shows the way to the future in our budgetary debates."
"Secondly, there is budgetary rigour."
"Our speakers have referred, and will no doubt refer, to this during our debate this morning."
"It is indeed remarkable that we have a Parliament today which has kept over ECU 700 million under those areas of its own responsibility in headings 3 and 4 without proposals for expenditure."
"I am sure it is not a lack of imagination but it is an expression of real responsibility."
"The last is Parliament's role."
"We have shown that, given more responsibility, we are capable of being more mature."
"Mr President, you referred to that."
"I welcome that as a statement but, of course, you, as a long-standing Member of this House, know how we function, and we greatly appreciate what you have done on our behalf in the budgetary procedure."
"Let me now turn to what I would describe as the hallmarks of Parliament's position."
"To me it has always been a question of value for money, because we are trying to see how scarce resources can be utilized."
"Parliament has tried to focus attention by the use of the reserve."
"This year we have 23 lines in the annex to the resolution."
"I draw attention to the fact that there is not a large volume of credits in the reserve - it is only 0.3 % of the budget - and that this is more a matter of management and resolution of particular problems."
"I would cite four which come to mind."
"The first is the Jet problem, to which Terry Wynn referred."
"I welcome the work which has been done by Mr Waidelich on this."
"I hope for a rapid resolution of the UK staff problem there."
"That is for specific resolution of a problem."
"Secondly, we come to improved management in issues like Bosnia or Meda, where we see that monies are not being efficiently utilized."
"Thirdly, in terms of improved management, but where we wish to put a new structure in place - the European information system - that seems to us to be a really important aspect."
"Fourthly and not least, is where we have one or two new initiatives."
"Even in this year of budgetary rigour under the new transatlantic agenda, we in Parliament want to ensure that those monies will be effectively utilized and therefore parts of the credits are in reserve."
"Lastly, we come to what I would call future horizons."
"First, we need to ensure that where we have new initiatives they are well costed."
"We will need to have our own means of calculating the financing for own-initiative reports."
"We do not have that yet; we will need to do that."
"Secondly, I welcome the idea that the British presidency should bring us all together early in 1998 to see what the guidelines should be for the 1999 budget."
"More cooperation seems to be very logical."
"Lastly, we have huge challenges ahead now, with enlargement on its way, in the shaping of new financial perspectives and the structural funds in the future."
"All this underlines the need to continue the excellent cooperation we have developed this year for the years ahead."
"Madam President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteurs Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson for preparing their report on the draft budget for the Union and I would like to congratulate Mr Giansily for the 1998 ECSC draft operating budget."
"And I would also like to thank the ""devil' Mr Samland, as I have heard him called, for the way he is handling the work of the Committee on Budgets."
"In our work, Madam President, the rigour with which the report has been drawn up can be appreciated, also in view of the need of the countries committed to the effort to converge."
"The idea of reducing the payment allocations below the level of the first reading was therefore rightly accepted."
"The originality of this budget should be pointed out for, despite this, resources for employment were found and I believe that the excellent work carried out by the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Tillich, should be acknowledged."
"With regard to the problem of employment, which is the most important and pressing problem, I think we should understand that it is closely connected with the competitive capacity of the system."
"It is obvious to many that this competitiveness is connected with the businessmen's flexibility and ability to adapt to the ever faster changing worldwide situations."
"The solution therefore consists in allocating resources to training, research, the reconversion of industrial activities and, in particular, to small and medium-sized businesses creating stable and permanent jobs."
"For this reason, I think the courageous proposal made by Mr Giansily to find resources in a specific sector, that is, the coal and steel sector, is in line with what the European Council of Luxembourg is saying."
"I heard what Commissioner Liikanen had to say, namely that other resources may be found, but this Parliament and Mr Giansily have done well to raise the problem."
"Not everything is consistent and not everything inspires hope, because we still have serious difficulties in maintaining the allocations to the cohesion policy, we have inadequate resources dedicated to the Mediterranean and we have to grant reductions to the agricultural sector; then we should not forget the existing inadequacies as regards the legal basis of many proposals."
"Finally, I think we should quickly remember the enlargement."
"This is a political subject we will have to face in the near future, because the approach and the choices so far made are not satisfactory."
"Madam President, knowing how difficult it is to prepare a budget I would like to congratulate my colleagues, Mr Tillich, Mr Tomlinson and Mr Giansily."
"This year I think they have been successful."
"The approach has been pragmatic and exemplary."
"At the risk of sounding like a member of a self-admiration society, I think this bodes well for the future."
"I would like also to address the President of the Council."
"On previous occasions I have always been somewhat bitter and critical but this presidency has shown that it understands the trend for the future which lies in cooperation and in doing away with outdated concepts."
"It has been said before but let me repeat that no-one should say that this is a spending Parliament."
"It is thanks to this presidency that there is this recognition."
"I hope that the British and the Austrians will understand that message."
"Secondly, I believe this Parliament has grown up because it understands that only with a vision of the future can you make progress."
"The employment initiative has been one example."
"And let me just say something about agriculture."
"Agriculture has been always a special area and the point which Mr Mulder made needs repeating."
"It needs to be linked to the overall budget for the benefit of the farmers but also for the benefit of the overall community."
"I hope that, before we actually get to a new intergovernmental conference on changing the treaty, more unity is achieved between agricultural spending and other parts of the budget so that in the next three or four years we can finally say that the artificial gulf between the two has been bridged."
"Democracy is something which we all want for the future and it can only be achieved if it can be shown that there is also an element of solidarity."
"For that reason this Parliament has made cuts both in its budget and in agriculture which was not easy."
"I repeat once more the point made by Mr Mulder: farmers can be grateful to Parliament that it is not the Council because with Parliament they are in good hands."
"One final thing about Mr Giansily."
"I do hope that the Commission will follow his courageous stand."
"I speak for the majority of my group, although there will be one person speaking against."
"I think it is very logical and coherent that we should not stop the levy five years before the end of the treaty especially since it is used for useful purposes."
"It is not spent in vain; it is spent for specific innovation; it is spent for small and medium-sized businesses; it is spent for the coal and steel industry and against that background it is important that we support Mr Giansily."
"Mr President, on the agenda for discussion is next year's European Parliament budget, which will do little to ease the unemployment problem in Europe."
"Furthermore, the achievements of the Employment Summit are very modest in this area."
"We do not have the resources, the financial wherewithal, to tackle unemployment as one unit, and that is why what the individual Member States do is crucial."
"Our group considers a reduction in working hours, and hence structural reform, vital."
"In this connection we have watched with interest the examples of France and Italy, where they have shortened working hours without reducing pay."
"The solutions contained in the European Parliament's budget, or those which came out of the summit last week, are unsatisfactory, dealing, as they do, with part-time work and other unadventurous schemes, which will only serve to create an unemployed, poverty-stricken underclass."
"This budget is a foretaste of what will be seen as a general thinning of funding."
"There are certain resources the Community has at its disposal, and they cannot be rationed anymore, and so it is important that they be used to help the Nordic regions more than they have been hitherto."
"We think that the equal flow of resources to all parts of the Community and Union is vital."
"We are in favour of the development of the south, but the northern dimension is also important."
"For that reason the European Parliament must include the question of the northern dimension in its next budget proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with this year's budget we have tied up a package that, without exaggeration, can be regarded as a model, which owes its existence both to the first-rate combination of people involved, in the form of the rapporteur Mr Tillich and the Luxembourg Presidency, and to the willingness of all institutions to reach beyond their shadows, as it were, especially in the area of agriculture and the employment initiative."
"The most important aspect, however, is that this budget will have an effect beyond its particular year, since it involves institutional changes which will continue into subsequent years."
"Hence, in time, Parliament will have more influence over compulsory expenditure and enjoy greater transparency and fairness with the subsidies."
"Yet shadows are not just outreached, but also cast, and extremely long shadows at that, cast over a chapter that is turning out to be a most sad one in the area of foreign affairs."
"I am talking now about former Yugoslavia."
"Winter is upon us, reconstruction is sluggish in many areas, and the Commission has nothing better to do than fail to spend a sum of over ECU 100 million this year in Bosnia."
"The word of Mr van den Broek no longer counts for anything, it seems."
"Even before the first reading he promised me personally that improvements and greater momentum would be jointly sought in a working party."
"We are still all waiting in vain here in this House for the invitation."
"So, with a heavy heart, the reserve remains in the budget, and until such a time as we recognize that the situation is improving."
"We will listen to what Mr Westendorp has to say in the Committee on Budgetary Control on 21 January and get an idea of things again."
"Then we will decide."
"Mr Giansily -he is not here unfortunately, I do not see him - however much I might agree with him on Bosnia, my view alters when I look at the proposal for the ECSC budget."
"We all know that unemployment is structural."
"That is why any employment initiative worthy of the name should not serve the sectors that are subject to structural change but, on the contrary, be deployed where, structurally, new job opportunities can be created long term."
"Incidentally, both Resider and Rechar are available for this area, neither of which were fully utilized either last year or this, a fact which makes the urgent provision of additional funds questionable anyway."
"To this extent the initiative is arch-conservative, in the truest sense of the word, not reform-oriented."
"I would find it most regrettable if it was to be put into practice at the end of the day."
"Mr President, our Committee on Budgets, with the laudable exception of my colleague, Mr Dell'Alba, is proposing - without saying so, naturally - that we reduce our spending, but we have not gone far enough."
"At the first reading, a majority of this house raised the draft Council budget by 0.7 to 2.7 %, without in any way taking into account the efforts required of the Member States in the field of control of public expenditure."
"It took the wisdom of the Council, which proposed making considerable efforts, with a reduction of ECU 600 million in agricultural expenditure, in response to a reduction of ECU 550 million under headings 3 and 4, accompanied by an effort of symbolic importance in reducing structural action expenditure by ECU 300 million, to ensure that the drive to budget rigour should not be made in the direction of agricultural expenditure only."
"Unfortunately, this latter proposal was dropped."
"The two branches of the budget authority have finally come to a compromise arrangement, which is a reduction of ECU 550 million in agricultural expenditure, and an equal reduction in the funding for internal policies and external actions."
"Whereas the Council, unlike the European Parliament, has accounts to render, particularly to the agricultural sector, and has resigned itself to cuts out of concern for budget rigour, and to the acceptance of a new, heavy slice off agricultural funding, our Parliament has only sacrificed funding which is remarkable only by its very absence."
"Nevertheless, the Council has reduced the expenditure under its control."
"On the other hand, it has demanded and obtained a reduction in payments under headings 3 and 4, which are under the budgetary authority of this House."
"Having said that, the 1998 budget will not be scaled back to zero growth, contrary to what has been said."
"The draft budget allows for an increase in national contributions, less indeed than the increase in expenditure, but leaving growth still positive. Hence there is an increase in contributions from Member States."
"With regard to the ECSC draft budget for 1998, the rapporteur is, curiously, proposing today that we re-establish a levy we had agreed to eliminate."
"I heard the quotes from Jean Monnet, but I would have preferred quotes from that great European, General de Gaulle."
"We cannot vote for this proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, however attached we may be to harmony between nations, we do not underrate the common European good."
"But I am speaking here as a defender of the interests of my own country, France."
"Contrary to what is affirmed here and there, Europe costs my country a great deal, a very great deal."
"France will pay 91 billion francs in 1998. This is the fifth largest slice of the nation's budget, after the national education system, national defence, social affairs, and infrastructure."
"From this sum, my fellow citizens know that they receive a benefit in return of around 70 billion francs, 85 % of which is under the EAGGF Guarantee."
"However, as these funds are set to decrease - due to the enlargement of the union to include the central and eastern European countries, the beneficiary being the structural funds - French agriculture will bear the brunt of the penalty."
"But beyond all that, our criticism of the European budget is directed at the following points."
"This is a budget which serves the reigning political utopia, the Europe of the regions, a step towards the planetary organization which sets the nations at nought."
"The proof is that only the funds under heading 2, that is, the structural funds, have not been affected by the flat budget, which we have had to accept at present, under the Maastricht criteria."
"However, we know the extent to which these funds, some of whose concrete objectives are of course acceptable, are poorly used, or even not used at all."
"Secondly, this is a budget which misappropriates taxpayers' money."
"Hundreds of millions of ECUs, and billions of francs are allocated to the Commission to allow it to develop its systems of clientele associations, NGOs, think tanks, clubs, organizations of employers and trade unions, and its totalitarian propaganda operations."
"My colleague, Jean-Yves Le Gallou, last year gave an impressive but incomplete list of the Euro-Global Propaganda Stafel which you are yourselves incapable of presenting to us in full."
"I am not even going to mention the scandalous expenditure on the new Brussels building."
"This is a European Union which, the world over, finances humanitarian aid to all and sundry, and draws no political benefit from it."
"For example, as the leading donor organization to Palestine, we were not even invited to the Dayton conference. All we are good for is giving them money, despised as we are by two proud peoples, who are sure of themselves and dominating, as General de Gaulle used to say."
"Nobody can make sense of the complications of our cross-budget lines, the misleading headings and the dissimulating appropriations."
"As for large-scale organized fraud, the annual report from the Court of Accounts stands quite simply as an admission of its own impotence."
"Now, as always, 12 % of the budget goes into the hands of the Mafiosi; as Borsellino, the judge who was assassinated said: ' Europe is a stroke of luck for the Mafia' ."
"Because of course, the Mafia hates nothing quite so much as national borders."
"The budget is unacceptable in terms of its end aims and objects, its funds are too often misappropriated, and it is ineffectual to boot, as a means of dealing with the real challenges of our day."
"It makes no contribution whatsoever to improving employment."
"The ECU 150 million - 1 billion francs - accepted by the Council as spending on the European pact for employment, is not going to solve the unemployment crisis. This border-free Europe, with its unbridled competition, and unlimited immigration, is the first cause of unemployment, which hits the farming populations dispossessed of their land, and the uprooted young people who wander around in a hallucinatory world of their own, haggard-faced under their baseball caps."
"Mr President, you can only answer Mr Antony by saying that, instead of treating us to ideological prattle here in this House, he should have perhaps joined in the 170 hours' work of the Budgets Committee, then he might have been able to apply his ideology there and then he would have noticed how far he met with approval."
"Furthermore, Mr Antony, you would do well to recall the speech from Mr Juncker, who put the same question to you as to the whole house: What is the price of an hour's peace if you draw up the net balance for France?"
"What did we expect from this budget?"
"We expected a partial response to the question of unemployment, this response has been given."
"We made our contribution to this: ECU 450 million and ECU 60 million for the ECSC budget, that is, ECU 510 million."
"This does not remove unemployment, but it is a stab in the right direction, for unemployment can only be fought if small and medium-sized businesses develop from scratch, if they are supported and if their problem of being undercapitalized is addressed by government response, guarantees and risk capital funding."
"Every new business: three new jobs in the European Union."
"To support this is prudent, and we have provided the inducement."
"Secondly, we expected a realistic picture of agricultural policy."
"This has also been achieved because for the first time we have received a rectifying letter from the Commission after the first reading of the European Parliament budget."
"This too is a significant advance and an invitation to the Austrian Presidency to proceed in just the same way during its time in office."
"Thirdly, we wished to save, but save rationally, and we wished to be efficient."
"We have shown this, for instance, by providing the Socrates programme, one of the most efficient programmes for the citizens of the European Union, with ECU 70 million."
"I would like to thank the Council especially for going beyond the Commission proposal to provide ECU 50 million for two years with its own decision."
"This is the first time in the history of negotiations under article 189b that the Council has been closer to the wishes of Parliament than the Commission."
"Fourthly, we wanted to aim for a restrictive budget where personnel is concerned."
"We achieved this as well."
"We ensured, despite the enlargement resolution, that savings would be made on the administration costs side."
"Above all, I would like to thank the Commission for this, for being able to work with us on this in tandem."
"Fifthly, we have left margins that are greater than all the margins in headings 3 and 4 over the last ten years put together."
"The Council should be aware: this is the result of budget discussions here in this House, where there was a willingness to adhere to the decision or objective from the start of the year."
"On this point, I wish to tie in a sentence that I have taken from a letter from your predecessor, Mr President-in-Office, namely the Finance Minister, Mr Salm."
"Mr Salm says in his letter, and I quote: ""therefore I hope that on budgetary matters in the future the cooperation between Council and Parliament will be characterized by this spirit of equal like-mindedness' ."
"These are institutional elements."
"We have conducted seven efficient trialogues with each other."
"This efficiency has never been seen in previous years, and this applies to both presidencies, the Dutch Presidency and the Luxembourg Presidency."
"In conclusion, I should like to make it perfectly clear: we have budgetary growth rates of 2.1 % in commitments and 1.4 % in payments, and if the ministers declare in Council that Europe should be making savings then people should be aware that the average growth in the budgets of the Community Member States for the financial year 1998 is 3.2 %."
"And those crying the loudest, namely the Germans, have 2.3 %, the French 3.6 %, the Spaniards 4.1 %, the Belgians 3.5 %, the Danes 5.5 %."
"I could go on. The only ones with payments below that are Finland and Sweden."
"Everyone else is above it."
"So they should look at their own figures before they criticize the expenditure for Europe, because it should not be forgotten that the growth rate of 1.4 % simultaneously includes growth in heading 2 on the scale of 6.7 % for the structural funds."
"If things were otherwise, we would all have a completely different result."
"This decision was not made by the European Parliament, but by all those who brazenly point out what percentages we should actually be adhering to."
"Mr President, I thank the Council for its close cooperation."
"However, in the interest of the whole House, I just want to say one more thing: we already said goodbye to Mr Lenz, who is with us on behalf of the Council, when we worked together with the Council."
"I want to thank Mr Lenz most sincerely for his close cooperation."
"If I am the devil of Parliament, then certainly he provided the pitchfork for these discussions."
"Mr President, the budget we are now debating has two main features."
"The first of course is the one all the others have mentioned, the fact that it has been debated in a spirit of general consensus, and all those who have managed to bring it this far deserve to be congratulated."
"However, there is another aspect, Mr President, which is somewhat strange and I will explain why: it is embodied in a logic according to which it calls for the support of efforts of the Member States to achieve certain objectives not by means of an increase but by means of a reduction in expenditure or, to be more exact, by means of a reduction in the contributions made by the Member States to the budget."
"This time of course it is justified by the need to fulfil the convergence criteria for EMU."
"The next time it will be justified by the need to ensure the permanence of convergence within the framework of a stability pact and so forth. And when, after some years, this policy has allowed for some significant margins - which, it is hoped, will be below the ceiling of 1.27 % - then we believe that we will be able to proceed, without any great difficulty, to enlargement."
"It is my impression, Mr President, that we are in for some surprises, since I fear that, if we carry on with this policy over a long period, enlargement will take place much later than is politically desirable, and we, as the European Parliament, must bear this in mind."
"In other words, what appears to be changing is the philosophy of the common budget, and this is where the unease that I expressed previously resides."
"I am not talking about the issues of the control of fraud or of the speed of fund absorption, the responsibility for which lies with the governments of the Member States, which will be called upon to accept their responsibilities not only towards the European Union but, for the most part, towards the people of their own nation, since, in principle, it is to them that they are responsible."
"I am talking more about the fact that we are proceeding towards a greater degree of integration, starting with monetary union, in which case one would logically expect the community budget to play a larger role, either in the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity, or within the framework of an increased operational redistribution."
"However we can see that the opposite is happening."
"And unfortunately the European Parliament is also getting into this way of thinking. This tendency is being aided and abetted by the inherent weakness of the common budget, which is guaranteed by the manner in which it is financed."
"So, as long as the common budget is deprived of funds, in the real sense of the word, the problem will persist and, with time, it will get worse."
"On more specific issues, Mr President, I think that we were right to set out again all the amendments to the first reading and especially those which referred to better fund management, such as the preservation of the reserves at Meda, and other such amendments."
"Mr President, I would like to say a couple of things concerning the matter of legal bases."
"Mr Samland said that certain very fruitful trialogues had taken place."
"The trialogues on the issue of the legal bases were a complete failure, Mr President, and I would like to hope that the positions of the European Parliament were beginning to be accepted as logical and admissible."
"I hope that in the next trialogue - and I address myself both to the Council and to the Commission - we will be able to obtain a logical solution so as to remove the inconsistencies from the budget on the issue of legal bases."
"Mr President, I am not at all in agreement with the budget philosophy."
"However this will not prevent me from congratulating the President, Mr Samland, and the rapporteurs, Mr Tillich, Mr Tomlinson, and Mr Giansily, on their effort and on the spirit of cooperation which they showed to many members of the Commission when this budget was being prepared."
"I believe that the picture painted by the budget is a little paradoxical, since we have been obliged to accept to be blackmailed by the Council in respect of the structural funds."
"My question is: is the Edinburgh agreement on the structural funds in force or not?"
"Because, if this agreement, which was a summit agreement, is in force, then why did the Council tell us that to prevent the structural funds being affected we must accept a reduction in agricultural expenditure of around ECU 550 million' ?"
"I would also like to ask the Commission: when, at the beginning of each year, it presents its expenditure on agriculture, is it telling the truth or not?"
"Because, if it is telling the truth, then why did the Commission accept the reduction of ECU 550 million which, unfortunately, was also voted through by Parliament?"
"Finally, with regard to the cancer of unemployment, instead of going ahead with drastic therapy, this budget has prescribed aspirins; ECU 150 million for 20 million unemployed."
"In other words ECU 7 for each unemployed person."
"Do you know what ECU 7 is? It is what an unemployed person would spend on a pizza and a beer, and that is what we have given him, for being unemployed!"
"Almost nothing on social welfare, on health, on education, on culture, the things which constitute a United Europe, not just ECU and figures, when we forget that behind the ECU and the figures there are people."
"Mr President, I first wish to thank the Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson of the Budget Committee for their splendid work and their lucid report."
"And thanks also goes to Mr Samland for his excellent work as chairman of the committee, and to Mr Liikanen for his cooperation as member of the Commission."
"The 1998 budget has been undertaken with great presence of mind."
"Growth is slight, and outgoings and income are clearly below the limits of members' costs."
"This has been achieved through tight budgeting and, in the latter stages, extra cuts, with costs reduced by ECU 1.1 billion."
"The reduction for agriculture is ECU 550 million; in other words, agriculture is to get ECU 368 million less than this year."
"This is a hefty reduction."
"It is vital that these cuts do not endanger agriculture or bring about a reduction in income for the farmer, as has been the intention previously."
"The Committee on Budgets bore that in mind in its resolution when it promised to approve a supplementary budget if the budgeted funds proved insufficient."
"With these remarks I am happy to give my approval to the budget."
"Mr President, could I first of all add my congratulations to the rapporteurs for this excellent budget and offer my congratulations on the work of the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr Samland summed it all up when he told us how many hours were involved."
"I welcome the fact that the peace and reconciliation package for my region of Northern Ireland has been approved, that the disagreement in principle over where the actual money comes from has been resolved, and that the Budgets Committee were able to deliver what they promised when they came to Northern Ireland."
"That is a very important message to my region at this moment of time."
"It is always very easy to criticize and more difficult to be constructive."
"We all recognize this but this is a constructive budget and I trust it will be the forerunner to even greater cooperation in the future."
"I believe we have to try to support the educational process through Socrates and other programmes."
"I would also like to make the same point concerning overseas visits because that is a very constructive part of the budget and something we should not run away from."
"It is very important for this Parliament to be able to send the message and encourage people to come here to see the work we are doing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, each budget is a visiting card for the political will behind it."
"The desire for rigour and prudence behind this budget cannot be denied, even though the need to accommodate the financial prudence demanded by the national governments in order to meet the convergence criteria has been cited as the motivation for it."
"Perhaps this rather banal reason is responsible for the fact that cuts are still tending to be made too much across the board and too little with a specific target in mind."
"The priorities set by the budget are generally unsatisfactory, it seems to me."
"Courageous attempts to tackle effectively the major problems Europe is struggling with are modest at best."
"I would like to address the research and technological development sector because it continues to remain extremely under-resourced."
"Comparing research and development on the one hand with the cultivation of olives, sugar and tobacco on the other may sound polemical perhaps, but it is symbolic of the priorities which, rather than promote the competitiveness of the European economy, target the interests of particular groups."
"The total spending on R&D is rated at ECU 3.49 billion, of which only ECU 487 million are apportioned to information technology."
"The total spending on olives, sugar and tobacco, in contrast, amounts to some ECU 4.5 billion altogether."
"There is a succession of technological areas where European industry, particularly the small and medium-sized enterprises, increasingly lacks the competitive edge over its American rivals."
"The danger is that shares of the global market will be lost and the problem of unemployment made worse."
"Since both the Americans and the Japanese invest enormous sums in research, every additional ECU the Community spends in this area in future will have been usefully employed in the fight against unemployment."
"Mr President, first of all I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Tillich, for having successfully steered the 1998 budget to its conclusion."
"I also want to thank him personally, in my capacity as future budgetary rapporteur, because the standards he has set with this budget can make my work easier next year."
"I should like briefly to draw attention to some of the high and low points of this year's budgetary procedure. I think it has been a very constructive process because it has initiated a new, more friendly relationship between the two branches of the budgetary authority, as a result of some very open and direct trilateral discussions."
"As other speakers have already mentioned, this has enabled progress to be made with the ad hoc procedure for heading 1, allowing the treatment to be more rational, and updating the budgetary forecasts as late as possible."
"In this way, I believe Council and Parliament, through common agreement, have got round the difficulty of the treaty's inflexibility, for the sake of greater realism and stringency in agricultural spending."
"Furthermore, in November's employment summit, the Council was finally receptive to an initiative which has the European Parliament's keen support: the creation of new financial instruments and the promise of a legal basis for employment."
"I think Parliament's attitude should also be stressed."
"Parliament has amply heeded Member States' demands for budgetary stringency, maintaining higher margins in headings 3 and 4 than in every year since 1988."
"Similarly, in the first reading, Parliament made available the resources for the jobs initiative."
"However, the will to collaborate has not been able to prevent last minute problems, because during the conciliation for the second reading, Parliament was confronted by Council requests for even greater efforts, demanding cuts in appropriations in those very headings 3 and 4, in exchange for an equivalent reduction in heading 1 appropriations."
"It should be stressed that this is not a technical problem, but a political problem, since this Council request compromises Parliament's budgetary authority, by attempting to fix non-compulsory expenditure."
"That is a worrying precedent for the future."
"It is true that Parliament has managed to gain an extra ECU 70 million for two years for one of its priorities - the Socrates programme - but it must be emphasized that this boost for Socrates is due to Parliament's ""intransigence' , since despite what the Council said in Amsterdam about giving priority to education, its proposed financial backing for the Socrates programme in 1998 and 1999 was way below what Parliament had requested."
"However Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since it is now nearly Christmas (as Mr dell'Alba has already mentioned) and since Father Christmas or the Three Wise Men will be coming soon, I should like to send them my Christmas list, in my capacity as general rapporteur for the budget next year."
"The first thing I should like for Christmas is to be able to witness a continuation of the constructive process of cooperation and dialogue started during this year's procedure."
"My second wish is that the meeting of the troika in the New Year can help to promote an open mind for designing realistic objectives for 1999."
"Thirdly, I should like the Council to be willing to take account of Parliament's declared priorities, given that Parliament has always been willing to negotiate on Council decisions, which often have financial implications."
"And to conclude I would just like to say, as we do in my country when giving a Christmas list to the Three Wise Men: let us hope they come across!"
"Mr President, I wish to support this budget and to say that we seem to have achieved the ideal in being able to reduce administrative costs and, at the same time, provide for the vital major areas of regional and agricultural policies."
"In regional affairs, we have increased the budget in line with our commitment to double the structural funds, thereby fulfilling our generous commitment to the poorer regions of the Union."
"In agriculture, we should point out that we are maintaining global spending, with enough money to provide for the price guarantees and our full commitments in relation to the compensations agreed under the last reform package, in spite of the fact that the number of farmers is being reduced by 5 % per year."
"So we are giving the same amount of money to fewer farmers - the global figures do not show this - providing an average of ECU 6, 000 for every farming family in the Community, even though many of them have other, off-farm income."
"In budgetary terms, we should point out that, even though the farmers of the UK - this matter was raised yesterday evening - are having a difficult time at the moment, their problems arise out of their failure to join the monetary system rather than the failure of European policies."
"While the average payment to farmers throughout the entire Community is ECU 6, 000, to the United Kingdom farmers it is ECU 15, 000, whereas for the Spanish and French it is only ECU 3, 000 and ECU 13, 000 respectively."
"If you add the cost of BSE to that, UK farmers are each getting something like ECU 17, 000 or 18, 000 per annum."
"It is above the average industrial wage and is extremely generous."
"My point is that there are three pillars in the CAP: free trade, financial solidarity, and Community preference."
"If we, or any group of farmers in any state of the Community, seek to undermine the pillar of free trade, then they are attacking a policy which maintains rural Europe and gives very generous aid to all farmers, particularly to UK farmers."
"Mr President, I too would like to start by giving my thanks for the cooperation on the Budget committee and with my colleagues, not least when they give a positive reception to amendments proposed by the Liberal group."
"I would like to start by looking at the Giansily report on the ECSC budget, and I would like to note straight away that I am totally against the report's proposal to impose a tax of 0.11 % in 1998."
"It would be totally unreasonable to punish an industry with such a tax in this way when the parties involved have agreed to abolish the tax otherwise."
"The proposal is pure redistribution in the best Socialist style, and I fail to understand what logic moved the rapporteur to put forward this proposal."
"It is said after all that enough money has been accumulated for different measures."
"As the report shows, not only will the ECSC be able to live off its own accumulated income, there will also be significant capital available when the treaty runs out."
"So if further activities are to be got under way, the money is there, and so I fail to understand why businesses in this industry should be pubished by continuing to charge a tax."
"I also think it is damaging to Parliament's credibility and the positive attitude we find towards the budget otherwise, because it comes as a great surprise that this question was even raised."
"Otherwise, there is agreement that we will now implement a three-year employment initiative which can produce some positive results."
"Let me also say that I am pleased at the responsible attitude which Parliament is taking towards the budget."
"I am pleased that we have managed to set up some tight budget targets and even go on and meet those targets."
"It is absolutely vital that Parliament as an institution and we as directly elected politicians show that we want to use taxpayers' money effectively, responsibily and transparently."
"And I believe it is important that in the next three years we use our strength precisely to ensure that we in Parliament itself do away with greed and overconsumption and pursue a tight budget line."
"Mr President, stringency, stringency, stringency: so many crimes have been committed in the name of stringency!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour today to express a minority view in this House."
"It is as unusual as the heavy snowfall early this morning in my city, Barcelona."
"But to show you the extent of this minority view, I can tell you that at the decisive moment in the Committee on Budgets, it was 15 to 13."
"I fundamentally disagree with the proposal put forward by the Committee on Budgets. I think it is a backward step in institutional terms; a backward step shielded behind a totally unfounded appeal for stringency."
"In my opinion, this year's procedure has helped to make the budgetary procedure meaningless. I am not sure if we can still talk about the two branches of the budgetary authority: it is more a question of one branch - and a twig!"
"It has been said that for the first time we have managed to play a part in the decision on compulsory expenditure, and strictly speaking that is true."
"But what has really happened is that for the first time in four years the Council has fulfilled the obligations it committed itself to in the 1993 interinstitutional agreement, in exchange for making Parliament pay the price of an unprompted reduction in payment authorizations in non-compulsory expenditure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that Thursday's vote will confirm the budget which the Council wanted right from the outset."
"Parliament's role has been reduced to that of stooge, carrying out the dirty work which the Council itself did not want to do, in cutting sections of headings 3 and 4."
"The Council said in July that the thousand million paid to agriculture and other structural funds had to be reduced, but now it is showing that it does not care if cuts are made in external policy headings."
"I shall end there, Mr President."
"However, I should just like to say that the Council is not very well qualified to demand stringency, when it was responsible this year for spending more than three thousand million in unwarranted overcompensation in the cereals sector."
"Mr President, that is a very bad omen for the interinstitutional agreement we must negotiate between now and the end of 1999."
"Mr President, I want to talk exclusively about our colleague Mr Giansily's report. In our opinion, the only unacceptable aspect is the idea of maintaining the European Coal and Steel Community levy for the 1998 budget."
"The draft operating budget presented by the Commission shows that there are now sufficient resources to maintain activities, both for conversion aid and social measures, and for research aid. These three areas are covered until the year 2000 and beyond, so there is enough of a financial margin to be able to abolish the levy."
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur proposes that at this precise moment, just when the Community coal and steel industry has managed to regain its competitiveness against production outside the Community, at this very moment, he proposes to maintain a finalist tax which will be used to create jobs outside the sector in which it is to be collected - assuming that a tax can create jobs, which is mere hypothesis."
"It is impossible in the first place, because the legal opinion which was expressly sought for this purpose states that the funds collected through this levy cannot be transferred to the European Investment Bank."
"That would contravene Community legislation."
"Furthermore, abolishing this levy as our amendment proposes would increase the productivity of the ECSC sector, thereby safeguarding employment levels."
"Mr Giansily must understand that this is not even a question of ideology, but a question of economic logic."
"Maintaining the levy, as the rapporteur proposes, is not going to create jobs in other industrial sectors."
"But it is certainly not going to help conserve jobs in coal and steel."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the decision is yours."
"Mr President, after hearing the congratulations given to the rapporteurs, as this morning a great Christmas spirit of cooperation and happiness is felt on account of the agreements reached, I would like to emphasize the role played by Parliament, and Parliament in particular, in this budget."
"On the first reading, with a sense of rigour and above all responsibility and a full knowledge of the challenges that lie ahead (the single currency but, above all, the dramatic problem of employment), Parliament has found solutions for this budget to actually give a meaning to employment, a specific role and resources available."
"And this has enabled Council, at its extraordinary Luxembourg summit, to take on specific responsibilities with regard to employment which, had Parliament not taken this initiative, would have proved very difficult to assume."
"Council obviously accepted Parliament's proposal on a second reading. However, I think it would have been very difficult for Council not to have done, as we have shown a great sense of responsibility."
"We have emphasized the priorities that have always been defined - the role of the small and medium-sized businesses, the role of training, the role of the parties in providing opportunities in employment policies - and that correspond exactly with the guidelines by which the individual Member States have undertaken to draw up their plans on employment."
"Recalling this Christmas spirit, Council is responsible for making these choices happen."
"The legal basis, to which many of you have referred, is an important fact."
"The Commission has undertaken to submit its proposals, and I think Council can only show a sense of responsibility by approving the legal basis."
"If Council fails to show this responsibility, then Parliament has taken a measure that remains incomplete, so to speak."
"Mr President, if the 1997 budget was known as the budget of austerity, then the 1998 budget, while still austere, could be termed the budget of consensus."
"And I am not talking about the consensus we reach so often in this Parliament."
"I am talking about the consensus reached on this occasion by Parliament and the Council which, in the case of the Socrates programme, has actually surpassed the Commission's proposals."
"We can also congratulate ourselves on the way the jobs initiative has taken shape in the budget: ECU 150 million is not bad as a first step, since directly or indirectly it will help to create jobs, while simultaneously financing the internal policies related to job creation."
"I am hopeful that tourism may be included among such policies, by means of an amendment."
"Talking about amendments, Mr President, I am still worried about the fate of the 20 % placed in reserve for general information activities, and the reserve for the Prince programme, and even the Meda programme, which although justified initially, is worse off today than the Phare programme."
"Similarly, I am hopeful that the appropriations for cooperation with the countries of Latin America voted for in the first reading will be reinstated."
"Mr President, I started off by talking about consensus, and I do not want to finish without returning to the subject."
"I am well aware of the magnificent work carried out by the rapporteurs, Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson, and the steadfastness shown by Mr Samland during conciliation. However, accepting budgetary cuts after the first reading (especially when those cuts affect Community policies) is going to require us to be especially responsible, and our information policy to be especially effective, to help the European public understand that the cuts are necessary because we need austerity to attain the Maastricht targets, and are not because we lack confidence in the exciting idea of Europe."
"Mr President, I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Giansily for the excellent work that he has done on his report."
"The future of the ECSC operating budget is not without controversy or complications."
"We have seen that in the opposition from some Members today."
"But I feel the rapporteur has steered a clear and constant course through the whole proceedings."
"He is to be commended."
"The theme of this year's budget has been job creation."
"Parliament, the Council and the Commission have put together a package for job creation."
"Yet we know that this year we will have lost 17, 000 jobs in the steel sector."
"I wish that I could imagine that these are the last 17, 000 jobs we will lose in that sector."
"I wish too that the jobs we are going to lose in the coal sector - 8, 700 jobs - were the last that we will lose in the restructuring of the coal industry."
"Be we know, sadly, that these 25, 0-26, 000 jobs will not be the last that will have been lost."
"We know also that time is running out, but that is not a reason to stop the ECSC clock ahead of schedule."
"The last few years remaining of the ECSC operating budget will be among the most important, perhaps not for the size of the operations carried out under its aegis, but because they are the last chances to do something."
"The unemployed this year and those who lose their jobs in the last years of the ECSC have a right to support, no less than those we have supported in this budget in the past."
"In the same way, the right to offer new opportunities to replace those ended in coal and steel still remains a need of the Community."
"We should not be looking to end existing schemes earlier or reduce the amounts available for social redeployment or research."
"We should be looking to maximize the chances that remain."
"For this reason I totally support, on behalf of our group, Mr Giansily's resolution calling for the reinstatement of the 11 % levy."
"To conclude, the ECSC is at the heart of the European Union, but it is not through sentiment that we should be taking these measures now."
"It is because we have a duty to create employment in those steel communities."
"How can we not continue the support of this levy and the job creation schemes in the ECSC report when we are supporting a job creation package elsewhere in our budget?"
"Mr President, in an amendment tabled by 34 Members and accepted by the Committee on Budgets, tourist businesses were specifically included in the scope of Community policy in support of small and medium-sized businesses for which the allocations from the 1998 budget were to be made."
"A vote for those amendments in the House next Thursday will open the way to the implementation of the Philoxenia programme, at least in so far as small and medium-sized tourist enterprises are concerned."
"I would like to remind you that this programme, which is a European Commission programme, following significant improvements approved by the Council, remains inoperative due to lack of funds."
"An important and productive sector of the European economy, tourism has been treated unfavourably by the Council of Ministers."
"May I remind you that the Member States did not include European Parliament proposal for a reference to tourism as an economic sector in the Treaty of Rotterdam."
"I am optimistic that, by approving the few things accorded to tourism with the amendment we have tabled, Parliament will give hope to the 10 million people employed in the tourist industry and, of course, give a kind of signal."
"How is it possible for a programme that is now three years old and which has been approved by all the Member States, not to be implemented due to lack of funds - and we are talking about ECU 5 or 6 million?"
"What tourism will get from the appropriation for small and medium-sized enterprises is even less than ECU 5 or 6 million."
"So Parliament must vote for the amendment this time to allow this programme to be put into effect."
"By so doing we will be responding to thousands of millions of people working in this sector."
"Mr President, a budget without fresh borrowing is something really special in Europe and the world."
"Not only is fresh borrowing not required, but a reserve has been built up too."
"I think this is something we should constantly remind the listeners in the gallery of when we talk about the European Community's budget, that such careful planning is made that there is a little left over each year."
"We hope the national governments will follow the example we have set."
"We draw up financial plans too, of course, multiannual ones, currently from 1997 to 2002, which have tremendous advantages for planning, increasing clarity and accuracy alike."
"Take the ECSC for instance, where there is now a schedule of assets, from which you can tell at a glance which monies are required in future and which are not."
"We have increased the research grants, we have increased the funds for education, and we are trying to support those that are efficient to create new jobs."
"We know we cannot create new jobs through spending alone."
"The state cannot do it."
"We need to create incentives to make employers prepared to do more in this area."
"I think that retaining the 11 % levy for the ECSC is not wise."
"What we are actively doing is in fact legally suspect, and I think the steel levy in particular would definitely come up against problems in this respect under article 50."
"In addition, companies which work well are under enormous pressure from non-EU steel imports, which are made easier by this."
"Our companies are losing their competitiveness, while substitutes for steel and coal are becoming more competitive."
"That is why I think that retaining the levy would damage our healthy industries."
"Mr President, first and foremost I want to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Tomlinson, Mr Giansily and especially Mr Tillich, the rapporteur for the European Union's general budget, for having achieved a conciliation agreement with this budget, in what has been a difficult process. Both Mr Tillich and Mr Samland, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, have managed to defend Parliament's budgetary priorities by means of an agreement with the Council."
"It is an austere budget under difficult conditions in which, nevertheless, commitments are increased by 2.1 %."
"Therefore, it makes a positive contribution to the future development of the European budget."
"However, this budget also supports solidarity."
"In an austere year, in which budgetary commitments only grow by 2.1 %, policies directed towards solidarity grow by 6 %."
"That is a positive sign, and good news for those of us who believe that Europe should be more than just a market or a free-trade zone, and want to build a truly federal political project for the people of Europe, in which solidarity with the less well-off is one of the main aspects of European policy."
"The increase in structural policies has been achieved through the actions of this Parliament, which some people say is ineffective. This increase is an important step in the construction of this common space of solidarity."
"I only hope that after the year 2000, with the enlargement of the European Union, we will be able to maintain internal cohesion for the Fifteen at current levels, over and above the short-term electoral interests of certain Member States."
"This budget also supports employment."
"Some might say that support does not go far enough, but it is the beginning of a greater role for Community policies to combat unemployment."
"I also hope that in future the structural funds are used more in those regions of Europe with high unemployment rates, and in concrete actions to create jobs, mainly in those sectors where the demand has still not been consolidated, but which constitute future sources of employment."
"I beg support for the Rübig and Barton amendments in favour of abolishing the levy, which is an added tax on sectors such as coal and steel which are beginning to be competitive - the steel sector by its own efforts. We cannot punish these sectors with additional burdens, because it is essential to encourage their competitiveness."
"Mr President, this budget is no cause for enthusiasm, but it is reasonable."
"It appears to me that our institutions have collectively - and this is good news for everyone, and particularly those who have doubts about the Parliament - reached the age of reason."
"For this, our respects are owed to the rapporteur in particular, as to all others involved."
"Indeed, we have accepted moderation, achieved a balance, reaffirmed our prerogatives, and expressed our priorities."
"We have accepted moderation, and we were right to do so."
"However, we should not exaggerate."
"As Mr Christodoulou reminded us just a moment ago, it is fine to accept austerity if you are a nation state. But it would, on the other hand, be much more serious if we forgot that the European Union budget has a geographical logic, and that its responsibilities are different, as the European Union is extending and constantly increasing those responsibilities."
"We have managed a balanced budget."
"There was an intention to focus most of the effort on the structural funds, and we rejected that."
"The sacrifices have been balanced out between the obligatory and non-obligatory expenditure."
"Each side has made its own contribution to compromise."
"That is a good thing, even though it was no fun for anyone to have to do so."
"We have affirmed our prerogatives."
"Thanks to the rectificatory letter and to the somewhat complex procedure, which is so deliciously a Community one, we have taken a modest but resolute step forward in the field of obligatory expenditure."
"I have heard some people raise concerns about this."
"Mr Giansily, my friend Mr Giansily, in particular. I am tempted to tell him it is later than he thinks."
"We will not really defend the interests of agriculture by rejecting calm and balanced conciliation procedures between the two institutions, and by hanging onto an absurd system in which authorities at loggerheads try to establish compromises each to its own advantage, that is, make up two halfbudgets drafted along different lines."
"We have expressed our priorities."
"There are plenty of them, and the main one being the employment initiative."
"It is not to insult the European Council to say that, without the concertation which took place between the presidency and Parliament, the European Council of Luxembourg on employment would have been rather empty, and limited to a few solemn declarations."
"We brought the only truly concrete item to that summit."
"I think we should be pleased about all that."
"The institutional triangle has, if I may dare say so, worked as a magic square."
"And if so, this is due to many people."
"Many complimentary things have been said."
"For my part, I have only one compliment to make, and that is a personal one, to Mr Jean-Jacques Kasel, an indefatigable, discreet, and effective hero in the Luxembourg presidency."
"To him, exclusively, I pay this personal tribute, but of course my thoughts clearly go to everyone else."
"My colleagues have been so prodigal in their compliments that I cannot possibly add to them."
"A word on the ECSC."
"We have heard the rapporteur, Mr Giansily, giving us the benefit of an interesting experience. He went down the road to Damascus twice."
"This friend of Mr Madelin has discovered the virtues of compulsory levies, and this disciple of General de Gaulle has discovered the virtues of Jean Monnet."
"I am delighted about the second point, because I believe that there will only be progress in the European concept in my own country if we reconcile the traditions of both Jean Monnet and Général de Gaulle."
"For the rest, I have concerns, because I believe that Mr Giansily has forgotten Jean Monnet's essential virtue, which was his pragmatism."
"He has proposed us a levy which is unjustified."
"Why strike down one business enterprise, rather than another, with such a burden?"
"He has proposed us a levy which is useless, as in all truth, one cannot see why there should be any need to make a levy at a time when the Commissioner explained to us that he had set aside the necessary funds in reserves to finance this operation."
"Finally, he is proposing somewhat unrealistic expenditures."
"I heard preferential interest rate loans mentioned."
"That worries me."
"I am no friend of loans at preferential interest rates."
"I prefer securities on loans. I prefer venture capital."
"I believe it is possible to spend the amount that Mr Giansily wants to see spent without making extra levies and providing for extra input into the Resider and Rechar initiatives."
"In this respect, the Commission has made an opening, and I would like the Parliament to seize this opportunity."
"In that way, ladies and gentlemen, we will turn that fundamentally fanciful notion of politicians - the ability to increase expenditure without increasing the tax burden - into reality."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 9: 30."
"Progress in the areas of justice and home affairs"
"The next item is the oral questions by Mr Nassauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, to Council (B4-0915/97 - O-0108/97) and to the Commission (B4-0916/97 - O-0109/97), on the annual debate on progress made in the implementation of the areas of justice and home affairs - Article K.6, third paragraph of the EU Treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking this oral question as the basis to discuss the progress made on cooperation in the areas of justice and home affairs during this past six months."
"We can now report to our total satisfaction that the Luxembourg Presidency has made progress."
"This applies not only to the formal cooperation with Parliament but to the subject matter also."
"Mr President-in-Office, we are pleased to point out that you made it a general rule, virtually anticipating the rules of the Amsterdam Treaty, to listen to Parliament on action in the area of the third pillar."
"That is a good procedure."
"You are not obliged to do so by treaty or for any other reason."
"I think we have achieved some positive results from working together."
"We want to make a point of stressing and applauding that."
"Our request would be that you impart your convictions to your successor, of whom we now have similar expectations."
"No doubt there are still demands in this area."
"It would be better, for instance, if we conducted this debate on the basis of a report from the Council."
"Maybe this could be passed on as a suggestion also."
"Each time we study the catalogue describing such work, we find a wealth of topics where you never know exactly by the end of the half-year which direction they have progressed in or why they might not have progressed at all."
"This would be a fine opportunity for any Council presidency to describe its projects and their realization, while at the same time disclosing the obstacles that stood in the way of them."
"Work in this area has become very complex."
"It covers issues such as the fight against trafficking in human beings, the fight against organized crime, protection of the Community's financial interests, the treatment of non-Community minors not in the company of adults, risk assessment and control of synthetic drugs, the fight against corruption, passport control at the external borders, and an issue extremely important in practice, namely agreement on the issuing of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters."
"Behind this very legal-sounding formulation hides a central problem of intergovernmental cooperation under the third pillar, that is cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs."
"The great task facing us here is the construction of a European judicial network, that is to say an area of European jurisdiction."
"We have become accustomed to trade operating without borders where economic activity is concerned, under the single market, but the legal instruments protecting trade stop at the national frontiers."
"That is bad for Europe's citizens and bad for the consumers."
"Moreover, it is hard to understand why a ruling of the Local Court in Kassel cannot be issued directly to a French citizen by this court, with the result that the judgement is able to be executed immediately."
"We need this, and it is feasible within this framework."
"This will be the task in the coming period, even if you bear in mind that work in this field is likely to change permanently with the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"While initially the same procedural rules will apply, the Council will decide unanimously and Parliament will be consulted."
"Yet, following ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, there will be a common legal base in the areas of asylum, immigration and police collaboration, and the process of inter-state cooperation we are experimenting with now will not apply any longer."
"There will be questions to deal with here as well, Mr President-in-Office."
"I will just mention one."
"Currently the national parliaments act in controlling their governments."
"Once there is a common authority, the relevant areas like asylum and immigration will pass from national control without arriving under the full control of this Parliament, since we will only be consulted and not enjoy codecision."
"This is going to give some constitutional experts a real headache. That is why we are advising in no uncertain terms, Mr President-in-Office, that the earliest possible use be made of the opportunities for introducing majority voting and codecision to this Parliament."
"There are many individual aspects that we would like to see encouraged."
"We need to prepare for the incorporation of Schengen."
"We need to legislate for a common right of asylum."
"And we want to continue to develop Europol into an effective unit, regardless of particular differences, which is subordinate to the control of a European Commissioner, the legal control of the Court of Justice and the parliamentary control of this Parliament."
"At the same time we would prevail upon you to assist us, Mr President-in-Office, in view of our excellent understanding with you hitherto!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have, in the shape of article K.6 of the treaty, a fine tradition, under which every year we draw up a balance sheet, as part of the third pillar, of our actions and achievements in the field of justice and home affairs."
"I shall first say, Mr President, that I appreciated the intervention of Mr Nassauer, one of the specialists in this field in this Parliament, and who indicated a number of paths which we should take rather seriously over the forthcoming months or years, as these are paths which are perfectly realistic, and which should take us towards more tighter and more loyal cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament."
"I would also, Mr President, like to say that I am here drawing up a balance sheet of 1997."
"This is not a balance sheet of the Luxembourg Presidency, as this balance sheet also includes the Dutch Presidency."
"The Dutch Presidency was concerned with the drawing up of the draft Treaty of Amsterdam, and I believe that their work was well done."
"It was then the job of the Luxembourg Presidency to implement and anticipate on a number of provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I welcome the fact that your Parliament has followed in our wake."
"I had asked all my colleagues to act as if the logic of Amsterdam already applied, and everyone has done so."
"I can say, Mr President, directing my remarks to Mr Nassauer, to Mr Schulz and to all the other speakers, that finally, the British Presidency, set to follow on from ours, and the Austrian Presidency, which will follow on after, are both going down the same tracks, and adopting the same modus vivendi that we had agreed on in the course of these last six months."
"All were most keen to do so. Your Parliament lost no time in reacting positively to our offer, by giving us its timely opinion on a number of projects and common actions, which the presidency has put before you, the results finally being very encouraging."
"The Luxembourg and Netherlands Presidencies focused on a number of special areas."
"The first of these was the fight against organized crime."
"Boosted by the Amsterdam timetable, thirty-three points were ascribed well defined and precise deadlines for completion."
"We, too, naturally had to comply with this timetable."
"I believe we have done so, and found political agreement on joint action setting up a European legal network."
"We have done so by putting the finishing touches to the joint action under which international instruments will be evaluated other than on a national basis."
"It is not enough to adopt a convention, we still need to know whether everyone is ready to apply it out in the field, as the law lays down."
"We have done everything, and I repeat, everything to finalise the action which makes it possible to bring those involved in organized crime to justice."
"We were not successful."
"I must admit that I am extremely disappointed, because our Parliament is right to insist, and constantly and always insist, on the need for a common definition of organized crime."
"How can we combat organized crime in the European Union, if we cannot, between Member States, agree on the same language and the same wording, the same definition of organized crime?"
"We were all ready to do so, Mr President, but one Member State, one only, prevented us from going ahead and agreeing."
"I shall also say, Mr President, that we have made considerable progress in the field of police cooperation, by which I mean Europol."
"Five Member States, at this time, have already ratified the Europol convention."
"There are ten remaining Member States who should do so in the months to come, and no later than February, for Europol to be operational in July."
"We have introduced most of the regulations which will be the basis of the new institution of Europol, and we have good hopes of seeing the convention finalised and ratified by the Member States between now and the beginning of next year."
"We consider, and I personally consider, the adoption of the Naples II convention as the jewel in the crown of the Luxembourg presidency, and I shall say why."
"This convention involves cooperation between customs administrations, which should give the customs authorities the necessary and sufficient instruments to effectively combat illegal traffic in alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, psychotropic substances, weapons, munitions, and nuclear material."
"This is an instrument which should provide a qualitative leap forward in the cross-border fight against organized crime."
"But this is not enough."
"We shall also be moving on to the adoption, to the political agreement of the Brussels II convention."
"This is the first time that in the area of judicial cooperation in the civil field, we have gone beyond the field of patrimonial rights and extended our competencies to the matrimonial domain."
"This is an extremely important development for our fellow citizens, as here we are dealing with divorce, separation, annulment of marriage, custody of children, and decisions which require recognition and performance in all Member States."
"Here, too, we finally approved a convention which is of vital importance for the community of law which we aspire to."
"I could cite still further examples."
"I must draw your attention, in the drugs field, to a number of achievements, and more particularly, and this is a first, to the results of the first informal meeting between ministers of justice and ministers with responsibility for the drugs dossier, who have discussed the adoption of a more consistent and pragmatic approach in the field of combating drugs trafficking."
"I cannot say that this meeting was a tremendous success, but it had the merit of enabling discussion, in a fully serene and objective atmosphere, of the problems which are the joint responsibility of the ministries of justice and the ministries of health, although viewpoints, when judging these matters may differ."
"It is clear that ministers of justice tend to place a greater emphasis on the aspect of repression, whereas the ministers of health are clearly above all concerned with prevention."
"Even so, we successfully reach a minimum consensus around the table."
"I can tell you why I believe this discussion was extremely useful."
"It should, incidentally, become a guideline for the ministries of justice and of health over the next few months and years."
"The ministers agreed on the fact that a person with a drugs dependency problem was basically a sick person. These are men and women who require assistance, who ask for help, and not for punishment."
"We agreed in saying that, in the final analysis, it is important to put as much emphasis on the preventative aspects in the fight against drugs, as on the repressive aspects."
"Here, Mr President, is a very brief balance sheet for this year. Brief as it is, it shows that this was a year which stands out from previous years, as honourable members will understand."
"This year was, in my opinion, an extremely useful one in the field of justice and home affairs."
"We made considerable progress in a number of fields, such as the fight against organized crime, police cooperation, judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and judicial cooperation in civil matters."
"We also enriched and intensified our dialogue with the eastern and central European countries and with Cyprus, and laid special emphasis on the evaluation of legal instruments, in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria. However, you will see, Mr President, that negotiations with the central and eastern European countries will certainly be extremely difficult in terms both of the third pillar, and of the evaluation of the instruments that I have just referred to."
"Mr President, I believe that we have worked honestly."
"Clearly, we have not done everything hoped for, but at all events, the achievements of a presidency are measured by the success of the subsequent presidencies."
"Here too, and once again, I would like to thank you for giving me the floor."
"I would above all wish to thank the Parliament and the honourable Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Institutional Affairs, and the Committee on Budgetary Control, as we have also accomplished a great deal in the field of the protection of the financial interests of the Community, and in the field of corruption. And I would like to thank all for their commitment and their availability, when serving a cause of common interest to the Council and to Parliament."
"Here, I am talking about our determined fight against organized crime."
"Security, Mr President, and immigration, are subjects of the greatest concern to our fellow citizens."
"We therefore have to meet their expectations and their interests, as these interests are legitimate, and should also be a cause of concern to us, for the credibility of the work we undertake depends upon it."
"Madam President, questions under the third pillar have moved increasingly into the centre of the European debate, and rightly so."
"It is a matter of increased security and safety for citizens."
"If we are to be able to bring about free movement of people, we also have to be able to cope with the problems which go with fugitives, with organized crime, with the drugs trade, with fraud, corruption and trafficking in women and children."
"We must create a more efficient cooperation between our countries."
"This year has been characterized by work on the Amsterdam Treaty and on the enlargement of the Union."
"The European Union is facing a task of historic proportions."
"The new democracies in central and eastern europe and in the Baltic which have thrown off Communism are applying to join the Union."
"For them, as for the EU's current Member States, the crux of the matter is to build a cooperation in order to ensure peace, stability and democracy."
"The challenges in the area of the third pillar are large within the existing EU."
"They are also very large in the applicant countries."
"These questions are very much in focus."
"We have different experiences in the EU and in the applicant countries, but the problems we face are fundamentally the same."
"Organized crime affects us all."
"Let me give an example: Trafficking in women and children is an important political question in the EU."
"It is now also beginning to be recognized as an important question in the applicant countries too. It is their young women who are affected."
"Another example is that drugs smugglers use applicant countries and transit countries in their business."
"The applicant countries now recognize that this also leads to a domestic market for drugs."
"We do not only have common interests, but also a shared responsibility."
"For our part this involves living up to the pre-accession strategy."
"For applicant countries it involves introducing the acquis communautaire in the field of justice and home affairs."
"We have put a lot of time into drawing up the Commission's opinion for all the applicant countries."
"At an early stage we pointed out that questions of justice and home affairs would require a lot of time and effort in the preparations for enlargement."
"This may appear obvious."
"If organized crime is allowed to spread, it will make inroads into democracy."
"If the democratic institutions fail to implement and monitor laws, people will lose confidence."
"That will affect the countries' economies."
"People who invest want to be able to rely on the judicial system."
"It is fundamental for membership negotiations that the applicant countries adopt the Union's ""acquis communautaire' , which requires stable judicial institutions."
"During the spring we spent a lot of time arguing for our points of view in the government negotiations before the Amsterdam meeting."
"As far as the third pillar is concerned, the Amsterdam Treaty represents a large step forward, although we would, of course, have liked it to have been even larger."
"During the year, apart from the work in these two key areas, we have also taken a number of special initiatives."
"We presented a proposal on temporary protection, which we debated in this House in October."
"Our starting point was that people with temporary residence permits should have the same kind of protection regardless of the Member State which they were in."
"We have also put forward a draft convention on rules for admission."
"The background was quite simply that we had a number of resolutions which we wished to combine in a single instrument with similar rules with regard to labour, sole-traders, students, post-graduate students, family members and immigrants who are permanently resident in the Union."
"During the year I also presented a communication on the carrying out and recognition of civil judgments which to a certain degree corresponds to the problem about which Mr Nassauer is asking, i.e. that it currently takes too long and costs too much to have a judgment carried out in another Member State."
"As Mr Fischbach said, synthetic drugs are spreading like wildfire among young people around Europe."
"The drugs are designed to avoid legislative bans, and the authorities are sometimes forced to hand back confiscated drugs quite simply because we have not had time to put them on a list of banned substances."
"It currently takes around two years to get a new drug onto the UN's lists of banned substances."
"That is of course not acceptable."
"When I saw the extent of this problem, I gave my departments the task of carrying out a proper analysis of the situation."
"We finished the analysis in January and then drew up a communication to Parliament in May."
"As you know, we have proposed a system for the exchange of information which would make it possible for us to quickly warn each other when new substances come onto the market and to share experiences and analyses."
"We must also develop methods to ban new chemical drugs more quickly."
"The Council of Ministers gave its support to this in June."
"As far as the fight against drugs is concerned, we have a cooperation which works well with both the European Parliament and the presidency."
"The Commission has also become deeply involved in anti-drug activities outside Europe's borders."
"This applies to North Africa as well as South East Asia and Latin America."
"I can mention that as recently as last week we took part in a meeting in the Dominican Republic on the implementation of the plan of action to combat drugs in the Caribbean which was adopted in Barbados in May 1996."
"Madam President, trafficking in women was the subject of a special debate in the plenary session here yesterday when the Waddington report was on the agenda."
"As I said then, we are already in the process of seeing how we can follow up the plan of action."
"As far as the sexual exploitation of children is concerned, we are in the process of drawing up a communication which takes an overall view and which will propose, among other things, a joint European register of missing children."
"During the year we started the Daphne programme which is aimed at voluntary organizations which work with women and children who are victims of violence and sexual exploitation."
"We have encountered a lot of interest, but have only been able to support a fraction of the projects which have been submitted to us."
"We now hope that through the individual projects we shall gain experience and knowledge which can also be of benefit to others."
"All the Member States of the EU are now involved in projects in one way or another."
"We have also worked hard to implement four multiannual programmes, Sherlock, Grotius, Stop and Oisin."
"Quite recently the Commission presented two more multiannual programmes, Falcone and Odysseus."
"Odysseus is aimed at strengthening the practical cooperation between those who work on false documents, border controls and asylum and immigration questions."
"Madam President, when the question is asked, on what area should the European Union concentrate, a majority of those questioned answer that it is fighting organized crime, drugs and violence."
"That is what concerns people today."
"They expect us to make real efforts to protect their personal freedom, safety and security."
"The Commission is playing an active role in the work on the Union's plan of action for the fight against organized crime."
"The Commission did so before the summit in Dublin and continued to do so both before and after the summit in Amsterdam."
"It is gratifying that the Council of Ministers has supported the fact that the Member States and the Union's institutions are together putting power behind the promise to make the fight against organized crime effective."
"However, reality speaks for itself."
"In the EU we have 15 different legal systems, different definitions of fraud and major differences in rules for banks and finance."
"Organized crime exploits this situation."
"That should make greater demands on increased cooperation and greater effectiveness in the Union's fight against crime."
"To increase the opportunities for effective cooperation, I have put forward a proposal for a joint measure, the socalled Falcone programme, which is aimed at increased cooperation between those who work in the field with policing and legal questions in this area."
"It is obvious that the fight against organized crime and corruption is an important element in the forthcoming membership negotiations with the countries of central and eastern europe."
"The plan of action proposes that a special cooperation pact against organized crime should be entered into between the applicant countries and the Member States of the EU."
"Together with the Presidency, the Commission is now in the process of studying what shape such a pact should take."
"Several times I have complained, as the rapporteur does, that many conventions in the area of the third pillar have still not entered into force."
"These include Europol, the Convention on extradition and the Convention on the protection of the Community's financial interests."
"I would be grateful if the Members of the House also helped us, as the President said, to at least get Europol in place for 1 July next year."
"As I mentioned initially, the Amsterdam Treaty means that cooperation on justice and home affairs is being raised to a new level."
"It contains a five-year working programme on how border controls, immigration and asylum issues and civil rights shall be integrated into the first pillar."
"That also includes the matters currently covered by the Schengen Agreement."
"Cooperation in the area which remains within the third pillar, that is, the police, customs and criminal law, will be developed through framework decisions, among other things."
"We are going to continue to work with the instruments we have through the Maastricht Treaty."
"At the same time we are of course preparing ourselves for the day when the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force."
"I think we need a proper overview of the consequences of the new treaty with regard to questions of justice and home affairs."
"I have therefore set in motion an analytical study which I intend to present to Parliament and the Council of Ministers in the form of a broad communication."
"I hope that, in the same way as a White Paper, it will serve as an important basis for a thorough debate on how we shall realize a free, safe and just Europe."
"With that I would like to thank the Committees here in Parliament, with which we in the Commission work intensively, for a good cooperation during the year."
"I would also like to thank the Presidency for the successful achievements we have succeeded in bringing about, in spite of everything, during 1997."
"Thank you, Commissioner Gradin."
"The debate is adjourned to 3 p.m."
"Welcome"
"Before we move to the vote, I would like to make an official welcome."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are honoured to have with us today in the official visitors' gallery the family of Miguel Angel Blanco, the young town councillor from Ermua in Spain's Basque region who was kidnapped and murdered by ETA terrorists in July of this year."
"(Prolonged applause) As you will no doubt recall, the death of Miguel Angel Blanco sent enormous shock waves not only through Spain but through the rest of the European Union."
"The European Parliament was not immune to this feeling, which applies to all other victims of terrorism, and sent a delegation to Ermua as an unequivocal show of solidarity."
"The Mayor of Ermua and the leaders of the parties represented on the town council are accompanying the family."
"I would like to welcome you all most sincerely, as should be clear from the applause you have received in this House."
"Thank you very much for coming!"
"Votes"
"The obligation to display the price of an article per unit of measurement is, of course, a commendable one, and can only contribute to better consumer information."
"In the light of the ever more extensive range of products offered for sale, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report goes in the right direction, which is toward educating Europeans in the practice of comparative consumerism."
"However, given the principle that too much information is harmful to information itself, we must remain vigilant with regard to any excesses potentially arising from such measures."
"At the time when this report was examined by the Parliamentary Committee on the environment, I had occasion to draw my colleagues' attention to the problems raised by prices on a per litre basis, with regard to wines and spirits."
"What possible interest can there be for a consumer to know that champagne or whisky costs so much per litre, when the bottles in which they are offered for sale contain 75 cl or 70 cl?"
"Price comparison can be read directly from the price label on the article itself."
"I think it is quite unnecessary to overload a label with extra information which is of no greater value than the unit price of the article itself."
"I would therefore ask for the unrestricted application of the provisions of article 10, ' maintenance of the most favourable provisions.'"
"With this single reserve, I approve the report of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"A simpler and more flexible directive is essential both for the consumer and for the retailer."
"I welcome the conciliation agreement with the Council concerning arrangements for the dual pricing of goods during the transitional period for the introduction of a single currency."
"The decision will result in the price of goods being displayed in both the national currency and the euro, including the price per unit, per kilo or per litre as appropriate."
"The exemption of small shopkeepers also displays common sense."
"Small shops will be given six years to comply with the directive."
"Obviously, as these small shops sell everything, it would have been an unacceptable burden to have asked them to put the unit price on products also."
"These measures are practical and will help consumers better understand the operation of the single currency."
"Raw tobacco (A4-414/97)"
"The Swedish Social Democrat Group has abstained from voting on the amendment of this regulation because we do not think that any agricultural aid should be given to tobacco growing at all."
"The introduction of the single market and ensuing liberalisation have considerably increased the degree to which some fields of our economy are exposed to international competition."
"Tobacco production is in its own right fully part of the European agricultural economy."
"As part of this framework, it requires all our attention."
"Likewise, it must be treated independently of the dossiers dealing with combating tobacco dependency, which will be dealt with tomorrow by our Assembly."
"As a medical practitioner, with responsibility for an ear, nose, and throat hospital department, I daily deplore the ravages occasioned by immoderate consumption of tobacco."
"Even so, the European farmers cropping tobacco should not be those on whom the financial burden of decisions fall, especially as compared to their American or Asian colleagues."
"This has not been the case until now, as this business has continued to be protected."
"This is why I approve the one-year extension of the regime in force, pending an overall reform of the common organization of the tobacco market."
"I am also in favour of applying an emergency procedure in the allocation of quotas for the 1998 harvest."
"The single premium regime, as it exists today, is welcomed by the majority of producers, who are a not inconsiderable haven of employment opportunities in these difficult times."
"Consequently, we should ensure the guarantee thresholds first, before subsequently envisaging a new basis of operation more consistent with world market prospects, and efforts to reduce the unwanted consequences of tobacco dependency."
"I will therefore vote in favour of the proposal as now put forward by the Commission to the European Parliament."
"I have voted against this proposal to extend the regulation concerning the common organization of the market for raw tobacco."
"The reason is mainly that I consider aid for tobacco growers to be absurd, since at the same time the EU has a programme to prevent the harmful effects of smoking."
"We know that thousands upon thousands of people die every year because of tobacco smoking and that the healthcare costs to take care of the people who are ill because of smoking are astronomical."
"The EU's support for tobacco growing should therefore end entirely."
"Aid should instead be provided so that those who grow tobacco can convert to other farming."
"The alarm bells which we in Parliament have heard, including the latest annual report from the Court of Auditors, show quite clearly that the EU's policy in this area works very badly."
"Among other things, the internal control systems do not work."
"Fraud is also commonplace."
"I do not therefore think it is sensible to continue with this policy."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted against the Community arrangements for untreated tobacco being extended to cover the automun of 1998."
"We do not believe that the tobacco which is cured within the EU should be subsidised for the following reasons: first, it is immoral for it to be exported, as it fails to meet the EU's own standards, and secondly, we believe that it is hypocritical for us to spend ECU 11.2 a year on fighting cancer while at the same time supporting tobacco curing through market arrangements."
"Instead, we are in favour of shifting production in these areas to other crops and in this way protecting the people who are dependent on this crop at presence, and for whom it is their basis for existence."
"Andersson report (A4-313/97)"
"The main thrust of the report on the future organization of work is good."
"Issues should, as far as possible, be sorted out in a decentralized way by agreements between the parties in the labour market, so-called partnership by agreement, which means that the parties themselves decide at what level the agreement is concluded."
"There is no reason, however, to draw the European Commission into the partnership as suggested in the report."
"Nonetheless, I voted for the report."
"I am voting against the Andersson report."
"The clear agreement between the views in this report and the Commission's Green Paper merely confirms my view that the majority of the European Parliament fully share the Commission's views on how the future European labour market is to be organized."
"Although the report contains much which is good, the only parameters for success in the Andersson report are quantitative growth and increased profits."
"So the report simply glosses over the negative effects which the proposals in the Commission's Green Paper would have, such as the adverse effects which introducing an annual working hours standard would have for employees' family life and their social life as a whole."
"I think it is unacceptable that the Andersson report should demand that the Commission get involved in an Eu-wide regulation of national labour markets (point 1)."
"It does not make it any more acceptable that the report refers to the importance of the European partners on the labour market in this respect."
"In fact, this would mean that the national trades unions and employers' associations would be bypassed when it comes to their members' interests, and that large parts of the labour market would come under EU legislation."
"My aim is to support those circles in the Danish labour movement who want to hold onto the principles of retaining the right to negotiate freely amongst the parties on the labour market at national level and who want to work against any kind of EU involvement in agreements."
"The same circles in the labour movement fully support broad international labour cooperation, which is a view which I also share."
"In view of this, I am abstaining from the report."
"I warmly welcome this Green Paper and the rapporteur's work on it."
"I hope that from discussions around this document, concrete actions will emerge."
"Having experienced frustration last year when the previous British Government opposed a flexible EU policy on working time, I am glad to say that our new government is playing a leading part in such debates."
"British Labour Members like myself are glad to see the rapporteur stressing lifelong learning as a policy to support at EU level as our government does at home."
"He is right to emphasize the need to tailor policies to suit different people - in Britain for example our Chancellor has announced a massive increase in childcare, helping parents move from welfare into work."
"We can all learn from best practice in other countries."
"Where both management and staff dare to be flexible, to manage change rather than be its victims, the more secure all our economic futures will be."
"I hope colleagues will back this report and move the debate on, to generate new ideas and share best current practice on the organization of work."
"This can be a useful spur to national governments preparing their employment action plans for the Cardiff Summit next year."
"The question of creating new forms of job organization given the current ongoing social restructuring touches three basic dimensions:"
"the dimension of a new division of labour in view of steady rises in productivity and efficiency, that is to say not only between paid labour and other forms of socially necessary work, and between men and women along with that, but also between the employed and the jobless; -the dimension of the new opportunities for dismantling hierarchies and extending individual or collective areas of responsibility in employment as an essential element of working life, which new technologies and management strategies make possible today; -the dimension of a more flexible and product-wise arrangement of immediate working processes in all areas of production and service.Mr Andersson's report is primarily concerned with the third dimension, which largely addresses the interests of the wage and salary earners."
"This is entirely positive, but does not really go far enough."
"In view of the urgent problem of mass unemployment, it is necessary to tackle also the reorganization of work in the first two dimensions referred to."
"We hope that the debate will continue and be extended - especially via the EU Commission, which might discover new ways to overcome certain obstacles still affecting the whole question of a European employment and labour policy."
"Waddington report (A4-372/97)"
"Madam President, I welcome the Waddington report as a thorough, coherent response to the Commission communication on trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation."
"It is very difficult to believe that such slavery still exists in this day and age, yet we read that trafficking in women is actually on the increase according to the International Organization for Migration."
"This makes it all the more important for the European Union to have a coordinated strategy to combat it."
"The Commission has estimated that half a million women a year are being trafficked although the true extent of the problem is unknown because of the secretive nature of the trade."
"The high profits and the low risks generated from trafficking encourage the perpetrators to supply more and more women for sexual exploitation in the European Union."
"Many of these desperate women are poor and vulnerable, marginalized from their own societies, who believe that life in another country will be rosier - an escape, a new start."
"It is therefore essential that there be a multi-disciplinary, transnational European approach to this problem."
"It is very encouraging that Member States have recognized that trafficking is a violation of human rights and they have a common interest in fighting it."
"It is also encouraging that the programmes Stop and Daphne are in place."
"However, there is a strong need for increased funding for these initiatives and I call for 1999 to be announced as the European Year against Violence against Women for this will be a further encouragement to increase those budget lines."
"Finally it is important that women's status in society today is included in the European Union's enlargement negotiations, especially as the central and eastern European countries have quickly become the new breeding ground and easy access areas for trafficking in women and for women being brought into the European Union."
"The huge increase in the trafficking of women is resulting in many thousands of women from the poorer regions of the world being subjected to sexual slavery."
"These unfortunate victims come from Latin America, the Philippines and the countries of central and eastern europe."
"They are often illiterate and uneducated and are directly recruited from small towns and villages with the promise of a lavish or well-paid job in Europe."
"Once they arrive in Europe they are at the mercy of traffickers who confiscate their passports and force them into prostitution."
"I welcome the fact that this issue has come within the remit of the Europol drugs unit."
"However much more needs to be done."
"There must be better coordination of police information and laws and sentencing policy need to be harmonized across the EU."
"Those that ply this evil trade must be severely punished."
"Once caught they should serve long sentences on a par with those convicted of major drug-trafficking offences."
"The penalty must fit the crime."
"We have today voted in favour of Waddington's outstanding report on the trade in women."
"We have done so even though it demands ratification of the Europol convention and extend the scope of the coming European information system (EIS)."
"Europol is one of the many stages which have been taken towards a United States of Europe."
"Trans-border police cooperation is always essential, but there is absolutely no reason to make it international."
"The same applies to the EIS and all the Schengen work."
"We accept the need to act in respect of the trade in women, but we believe this should be done at intergovernmental level."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of efforts to assist women who are victims of the trade in human beings."
"This is a kind of slavery in which women from non-Member States are transported to the EU to be exploited, either by being forced into prostitution or through forced marriages or other work situations involving sexual exploitation."
"These women are often in a highly unfortunate and vulnerable position."
"It is therefore important that efforts be made both to help the victims and to combat the trade in human beings."
"This is an international problem, and so it is important that the Commission should take the initiative."
"Member States should cooperate on research and education, exchange information and experience etc. We must combat the trade in human beings, and the most effective way of doing this is to act together."
"The report illustrates some of the more dramatic dimensions of the problem."
"However, it does not succeed in the end in getting to the root of the basic causes that have given rise to this scourge of society and have helped it to burgeon. Nor does it put its finger on who is really to blame for this present day slave trafficking."
"For this reason, although it makes some interesting recommendations, it fails to put forward any recommendations which would lead to a fundamental and complete eradication of the problem."
"It is perhaps more painful for ""civilized' countries to acknowledge their massive responsibilities for the economic and social collapse of entire countries, in the service of enormous European and multinational economic interests, leading to the degradation of an entire people."
"The same law of the marketplace which acts against the dignity of citizens and workers in our own countries, has transformed other countries, in Europe and the Third World alike, into booty and merchandise."
"It has created a ""paradise' of laws of the jungle enabling all-powerful international organized crime to act with impunity, trading in the dignity and in the very lives of human beings."
"The way to tackle the problem is not through the imposition of severe punishments and through suppression with the assistance of Europol, which in the end only impact on the victims themselves and do not strike at the allpowerful and flexible circles of organized crime."
"At the same time the Schengen Agreement is closing in around the immigrants, the victims, depriving them of basic rights and leaving them exposed to the mercy of lawlessness and the crime which turns this into profit."
"The way to tackle the problem is through securing and safeguarding the rights of immigrants, through the provision of reception services and basic living conditions."
"Even more so, it is through the development of relationships of mutual, equal and profitable cooperation with third countries."
"It is through the growth of their economic base, which has been destroyed by the predatory exploitation of developed countries, enabling their citizens to work and to live with dignity in their homelands."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Progress in the areas of justice and home affairs (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuationof the debate on the oral questions from the Committee on Civil Liberties on the annual debate relating to progress in the area of justice and home affairs."
"Mr President, please forgive me for commenting on the order of business at the start of this debate."
"Yet I cannot avoid making two critical observations on the procedure for today's debate, and I address my remarks to you, Mr President, together with a request."
"For the third time in succession now we are experiencing how the debate on the success of cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs has been placed on the agenda in such a way that what occurs is what happened this afternoon, namely that we had to interrupt the discussion to make way for our important votes."
"That is not good for the debate."
"I would ask you to find another place on the agenda for such a central issue, which allows us to discuss this in context."
"I have a second request to make, Mr President, together with another critical observation: I am very grateful to the Commissioner, Mrs Gradin, for concluding her speech this afternoon."
"I would not have brought my speech to a close in her position, for the way in which this House thinks it can treat a Commissioner is unacceptable!"
"I say this particularly for our benefit, ladies and gentlemen, and would ask every one of us present here today to ensure in the groups that we do not ruin our reputation."
"You cannot treat a Member of the Commission in this way with such an important debate!"
"I urgently request that we refrain from doing so in future."
"If discussion is taking place at lunchtime - on this occasion Mrs Gradin was the victim; normally it is other people, either speakers or representatives from the Council or Commission -this is intolerable."
"No-one ever listens."
"That is disgraceful for the Parliament of Europe!"
"I would therefore entreat you, Mr President, to make this a matter for discussion in the Conference of Presidents."
"Thank you!"
"I should like to respond briefly to your two comments, which amounted, in fact, to a lengthy critical speech, and I shall certainly take note of, and transmit to the Conference of Presidents, your comments on the fact that the debates on this subject have been interrupted for the third time by the midday break. But I would also reflect back the criticism to you, particularly regarding the failure of speakers to keep to allocated speaking times, which has led to our being unable to keep to the planned timetables."
"Furthermore, I apologize profusely to the Commissioner for the rumpus a moment or two ago, but we do not really know how to control the House when it is coming into session."
"This is a recurrent problem, and I shall certainly inform the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, just one sentence."
"To give more weight Mr Schulz's remarks, I would like to say that the PPE strongly supports every word he has just said."
"Thank you, Mrs Reding."
"All these comments will be transmitted to the relevant authorities."
"I would ask you to keep to the allocated speaking times, which will avoid putting ourselves in a difficult situation."
"Mr President, I also back up the colleagues who have just spoken."
"I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur who has accepted a great majority of the amendments that I proposed in the Commission on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"Consequently, the motion before us, with the exception of one paragraph, has our complete approval."
"I consider that there are two ways to deal with the annual report."
"The first approach would be to match the advances achieved to the expectations of the citizens whom we represent."
"From that point of view - and I shall return to this - there is a yawning gulf between these expectations and reality."
"But we can also measure changes compared to the previous year. This is more realistic, and less discouraging."
"This is what we did when we noted that the Parliament was now better informed and more often consulted, in accordance with article K6."
"The over-restrictive application of this rule was the first of our earlier criticisms. We appreciated the fact that the Luxembourg presidency undertook to implement article K, paragraph 11, of the Treaty of Amsterdam early, for it lays down the obligations of the Council and of the Commission unambiguously with regard to the Parliament."
"Mr Nassauer emphasized this, this morning, and the President of the Council returned to it, and I thank him."
"We also note progress in the choice of decision-making approaches, which are closer to the treaty, particularly in the area of joint action."
"Our satisfaction in this respect is not total, however, as the list of the decisions of the Council also includes far too many resolutions which are not subject to our oversight."
"Here, I mean, for example, the resolution on marriages of convenience, which was drafted in a totally opaque manner by the 'migrations' group, without any information to the Parliament at any time, and therefore still less any consultation."
"Here, however, was a document with substantial consequences, involving the right to live in a family situation."
"There is cause for surprise at the adoption of a restrictive document on a subject which was not shown on the Council's programme, at a time when the convention on the harmonization of rules in the immigration field, announced by Mme Gradin last year, has not seen the light of day."
"Furthermore, as a general rule, we believe that the Council and the Commission do not give the necessary attention to the fields of asylum and immigration."
"While we rejoice in the Commissioner's initiative relating to temporary protection, we regret that the draft of the harmonization of procedures for granting refugee status and subsidiary protection - although in the Council's programme for a considerable time past - has not even begun to be implemented."
"In short, we note a number of areas of progress, but remain extremely critical on the slow pace of such progress, which does give European citizens the impression that, in these sensitive areas, no progress is being made at all."
"This is true - and I am simplifying to the point of caricature - for the free circulation of persons, which is a subject of endless, serpentine complications."
"This is also the case for the European legal space."
"This was already the major priority of the Spanish Presidency in 1995."
"Even so, it is turning out difficult to give shape to this legal space."
"Of course there are advances in our thinking."
"Concrete proposals exist. There is no doubt about that."
"The recent reports from our colleagues, Mrs Cederschiöld, Mr Orlando and Mr Bontempi prove that."
"But progress is so timid, and the deadlines for implementation so long, that a wide avenue is open to the demagogues always on the look-out for whatever affects European credibility."
"In this respect, I admit I was shocked by a defamatory advertisement published by the Europe of Nations Group in the French press, under the heading: Leave the big international criminals alone - Europe does not want to do anything about them, anyway."
"It is interesting to note that those who are so ready to denounce the powerlessness of Europe are also those who are the most determined to deny Europe the resources it needs to be effective, by rejecting any new powers transferred to European institutions, and digging in their heels on unanimous voting, which we know is a powerful weapon of paralysis of decision-making - as the President of the Council has just emphasized in his morning speech."
"And all this, of course, in the name of a narrow and restricted national sovereignty, which goes right against the principles that it is claimed to defend."
"The two hundred magistrates meeting in Brussels last week, in the wake of the Geneva appeal, were right to point out the slow and sluggish pace of change in setting up a single Europe for legal affairs, which is completely at loggerheads with the festering sores of an archaic concept of national sovereignty."
"Unfortunately, there are few chances of any real changes prior to the coming into force of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam relating to the new procedures, and this promises many further years of rather uninspiring annual assessments!"
"Mr President, the Luxembourg presidency has innovated."
"In order to reinforce parliamentary control in the field of combating crime, political asylum, free movement and so on, it decided to introduce the new rules for the Treaty of Amsterdam early and to consult the European Parliament, well before the ratification of the treaty made such consultation compulsory."
"In doing this, the Luxembourg Presidency has really served the cause of transparency and democracy in Europe."
"And it deserves our gratitude!"
"The Luxembourg Presidency also wished to innovate in other fields."
"It wanted to take important decisions so that Europe should be better able to combat international crime, trafficking in men, women, and children, illegal immigration, the plague of paedophilia, and much more besides."
"The presidency wanted to give substance to the wishes of the citizens in terms of concrete and effective measures, so that free circulation benefits the honest, and not criminals of all kinds. Alas, all this great effort and positive work has in so many cases been reduced to nothing by certain member countries, who have taken advantage of the compulsory unanimous vote required in the third pillar, to stand in the way of important dossiers."
"This should be said loud and clear."
"If essential measures to combat terrorism and organized crime cannot be successfully completed, the blame lies with certain member countries, who take the common interest hostage in the satisfaction of obscure national interests."
"This is a pure and simple abuse, and it is high time, Mr President, that this should stop, as the only people to profit from such manoeuvrings are those working in the Mafia and other criminals."
"In spite of that, the Luxembourg Presidency has successfully moved ahead on important dossiers, and my colleagues have already mentioned this."
"The Luxembourg presidency would have had more to record on the assets side of the account, and if it has been unable to do so, it is certainly not the fault of Marc Fischbach, the excellent president in office, but rather more the rule of unanimous voting, which has once again demonstrated its harmful effects."
"Mr President, Mr President of Council, ladies and gentlemen, we too are highly satisfied with the work carried out by Mr Nassauer and we note with satisfaction that Parliament is starting to be informed and consulted to an increasing extent, and this is very important to us."
"Although we still have a long way to go in this sector, we think that Parliamentary control over such delicate issues, involving the heart of national sovereignty, so to speak, is of vital importance, particularly with regard to Europol, with regard to the Court of Justice, which we have to bring into operation as soon as possible, and, in general, obviously with regard to personal data on citizens."
"It is on these two words - freedom and safety - that the future of Europe depends: the freedom of the citizens, freedom of movement, which obviously cannot be called into question by the very important and increasingly difficult fight against Mafia gangs and crimes of all kinds."
"The future of our continent depends on this!"
"Mr President, progress has been made in the European judicial policy during the past year."
"It has been mentioned that the Dutch Presidency has partly put into effect the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"During the Dutch Presidency the action plan against major crime was developed."
"Luxembourg has decided to consult us on all motions for a resolution, and the European Commission, Commissioner Gradin, submitted an initiative in this House for joint action with regard to the temporary protection of displaced persons."
"Good things, therefore, during the past year."
"But the liberals do not think this makes us well-off."
"Because the shortcomings in the justice policy are still there in abundance."
"Hardly any treaty agreement, and it says so in the papers, has been ratified by the Member States; this includes the anti-fraud agreements, the Europol agreement, etc. May I put it this way to Commissioner Gradin: the European Commission is economical with its right legislative initiative."
"Yes, the Commission, Commissioner Gradin, says informally, we do not have enough staff."
"No, the President says, that is no excuse."
"Because too few staff in this sector of the European Commission shows that evidently too little priority is given to this policy area."
"So it is all going too slowly."
"What might happen and what should happen in the future?"
"In the future there should be a strong coalition between the European Parliament and the European Commission, and in the future we should put pressure on both the European Council of Ministers of Justice and of Internal Affairs together."
"This is necessary."
"There is enough to do."
"Mr President, I conclude by calling on the forthcoming British Presidency to show that Labour can pursue a better European justice policy than the Conservatives."
"Mr President, cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs is certainly a delicate subject, as it affects an essential component of the sovereignty of Member States."
"In this field of competency, the action of the Union can only and should only be subsidiary, and relate only to criminal actions or public order offences which are really transnational in nature."
"This is a requirement for efficiency."
"But rather than dream on about a common European legal area, which is in fact an extraordinary conception of an overbearing centralized European state, we would be closer to combatting organized crime, or illegal immigration, if we were to set up interstate cooperation, and make the court decisions taken in each one of the Member States immediately enforceable on a reciprocal basis, and to conceive of transnational procedures that would be based on the proposals of the judges in the Geneva appeal."
"Instead of the vain attempt always to seek legal uniformization, which is inappropriate and contrary to the traditions and the legal philosophies of the Member States, the European Union's efforts should focus, on the contrary, on really trans-national aspects, questions of law and public order."
"On the admission of the rapporteur himself, the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam in the field of law and public order raise difficulties in terms of constitutional guarantees, as communitarization leads to the disappearance of democratic control by the national parliaments."
"This state of affairs should itself suffice to condemn the treaty."
"The European Parliament, which is so keen on safeguarding human rights and constitutional guarantees, should consider the consequences and draw the attention of public opinion to the dangers resident in the Treaty of Amsterdam, with regard to democratic control over European construction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mr Fischbach for his work."
"Mr Fischbach, on behalf of my group may I say again: the manner in which you have presided over the Council is, in our view, exemplary."
"You can only operate within the framework of the existing law, yet the skill you have revealed in anticipating the outcome of Amsterdam shows that there can be a fruitful and constructive dialogue between Parliament and Council, which helps to break down mutual mistrust and also stabilize the democratic legitimization of Council action."
"If the Council works with Parliament in the area of justice and home affairs, then this is one of the greatest advances -in contrast to Mr Buffetaut's fear about the advent of a European superstate - because the constitutional reality, the basis of the Treaty, is of course the fact that there should be intergovernmental cooperation in these areas, and Amsterdam has reaffirmed this."
"However, the danger we are frequently moaning about then arises: the national parliaments are unable to sufficiently exercise their control function any longer because trade has become Europeanized while both the control function and the legislative function have failed to devolve to the European Parliament."
"This democratic deficit, this hole in democracy, can be remedied by working constructively and diligently with Parliament -and above all by making use of the facilities for the immediate instruction of Parliament through the Council - as you have done, Mr Fischbach."
"I want to make a point of mentioning this here: the fact that last week Mr Schleder in his capacity as Chairman of the K4 Committee attended the Committee and gave us as up-to-date a progress report as never before on developments in the Justice and Home Affairs Council is clearly attributable to your initiative!"
"The advances that have been made can be added to -I agree with Mr Wiebenga, Madam Commissioner - by us working more closely together, Parliament and Commission, and by you making greater use of your right to initiate legislation."
"I want to make one thing clear, as Mr Wiebenga has already intimated: if there is not enough staff in this area, then that is not the fault of Mrs Gradin, because she is fighting for more staff."
"My final remark: It says under item 10 of the resolution that the European Union should turn its attention to combatting marriages of convenience."
"I am not familiar with this term."
"I always thought that marriage and convenience are mutually exclusive!"
"What it should say is combatting sham marriages!"
"Mr President, something new has happened in the area of justice this year."
"In this area the President-in-Office of the Council has made use of the European Parliament's ability to play a constructive role."
"Through that, Mr Fischbach, you have contributed to taking the European cooperation another step forward, for which we thank you."
"When the European Parliament is shown respect, it also grows with the task."
"Jobs are taken seriously and deadlines are met. That has been demonstrated during the autumn."
"The plan of action against organized crime and the accompanying pieces of legislation were just right for the new relationship between the Council and Parliament."
"The UK has privately communicated that this behaviour will be maintained and not deteriorate."
"In this respect the Amsterdam Treaty is therefore being applied in practice before it has been ratified."
"However, consultation also involves exchange."
"In a civil relationship you are normally allowed to know the reason why someone rejects or welcomes a proposal."
"Parliament should not of course be treated any less properly than is usual in civil life."
"It is now time for the Council to start to say why it accepts certain things and why others are not accepted."
"Such an exchange is necessary if Parliament is to be able to fulfil its important role as problem-solver in the European process."
"Parliament must know the reason in order to be able to present new solutions and work out the difficult questions."
"Our report must be discussed by the Council's working group before a decision is taken by the Council so that there is a point of view, a reaction, from there and so people know the reason."
"You need to have respect for the people with whom you have an exchange. If the Council does not explain its points of view, the debate can come to a standstill, just as the IGC process showed before the decision on the Amsterdam Treaty."
"It is important for the European balance of power that we now have an interinstitutional agreement which sets out concrete forms for this process."
"Mr President, it is pleasing and encouraging that under the Luxembourg presidency we have seen some serious attention given to progress in the area of judicial and home affairs."
"I congratulate the Luxembourg presidency on having brought Parliament into the consultative process at an early stage."
"This is absolutely essential and we all welcome it."
"I am quite confident that the steady progress in this area will continue under the forthcoming British presidency."
"As more and more people in the European Union live, work, study and spend part of their lives in countries other than the one in which they were born or of which they are nominally citizens, this is going to become more and more necessary."
"I want to refer to three points."
"Firstly, while people must be punished if they have committed a crime, it is essential that while they are awaiting trial in another Member State accused persons should not find themselves in a more difficult situation than if they were in their own country."
"The bureaucratic delays caused by translation difficulties or differences in legal systems should not mean that they are held for indefinite periods before they come to trial."
"This is an area where it is important that we make progress, as is the question of the various penalties which courts can impose."
"Many of the penalties which courts impose on their own citizens are not easy to apply to citizens of other countries."
"I am thinking of things like community service, probation and so on. We need to look closely at this area."
"Finally, there is the role of Europol."
"If we are to tackle the growth in international crime seriously and effectively, Europol is essential."
"We cannot be at a disadvantage compared with the criminals in dealing with these matters."
"At the same time, if we are going to create an operational role for Europol, we must ensure there are proper mechanisms in place for democratic accountability and for people to make justified complaints where they feel there has been unfairness."
"We must have genuine democratic safeguards for Europol."
"Mr President, I shall be brief, and I would wish simply to say to you that, indeed, the honourable Members who have spoken in this debate have effectively enriched it by their suggestions, by their proposals, and their criticisms which were, in the final analysis, constructive."
"People always, or rather, often, say that the Parliament is not on the same side as the Council."
"I must say to you that my experience is quite otherwise."
"I say that, if the Council makes every effort to do its work properly, and if the Council makes the progress which is expected of it, and rightly so, by your Parliament, the Council will in this House find recognition and support."
"Here, I would like above all to thank the honourable members and in particular, the members of the Committee of Public Freedom and Home Affairs, who have, Mr President, always supported me in my work."
"I would like above all to thank your Parliament for having so rapidly and expeditiously responded, at the behest of the Council, to a number of requests for its opinion."
"If indeed the Parliament had not reacted so rapidly and so directly, the Council would certainly not have been able to make the progress that we have recorded today in the field of the third pillar."
"Having said that, I obviously share Mrs Lindeperg's criticisms, insofar as we are making progress in an area, or in fields which are covered, as we all know, by the requirement for unanimous voting, and in particular in domains relating to fields which are most closely tied up with national sovereignty, and hence with national traditions, and dealing with prejudices and a degree of reticence on the part of one or another Member State."
"This is the reason why I believe we should not despair."
"We have proven that we could indeed make notable progress in this extremely sensitive field."
"We shall continue to go on making progress, and I must say, Mr President, that I willingly accept that Mrs Lindeperg should complain that the Parliament has not been consulted on the draft resolution relating to marriages of convenience, the ""Scheinehen' ."
"I nevertheless prefer to be on the receiving end of this objection, rather than to have levelled against us a criticism of another kind, namely that the Council was reproached with not acting with enough speed and efficiency."
"If indeed my conscience pricks me at all on this point, the reason is that, in the final analysis, for once, the proposal from the Presidency was accepted with such keenness by the Council, that I believed that it was preferable to have the matter dealt with here and now, rather than wait for the opinion of the Parliament between now and the beginning of next year."
"Having said that, Mr President, please accept my wholehearted thanks for your support."
"Mr President, I would also like to say thank you for a very interesting and rewarding debate on the third pillar and what has taken place during the past year."
"In addition, I would like to say that I think the cooperation between the Commission and the various committees works excellently and we have had many rewarding meetings and exchanges during the year."
"But just as Mr Fischbach says, it is clear that both you in this House and we in the Commission and the Council can complain about the inertia which working with intergovernmental cooperation entails."
"That is the reason why several of the conventions which are on the tables of all the parliaments have not been ratified and why we have not got started with police cooperation etc."
"Later I would like to give an answer to Mrs Lindeperg, among others, on the question of asylum."
"The question of asylum and a report on asylum are now a priority, since we first gave priority to the question of temporary residence permits and admission."
"A word about resources: When I arrived three years ago there were a handful of people in the task force which had to do all the immense work which has been done."
"This working group is now in the process of becoming a reasonably sensible organization, but it is far from complete."
"I would therefore appreciate it if both the Council and Parliament had a little more generous attitude so that many more initiatives could be taken."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11: 30 a.m."
"Fifth R & D framework programme"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A4-0396/97), by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision on the fifth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (1998-2002) (COM(97)0142 - C4-0186/97) - + COM(97)0439 - C4-0410/97-97/0119(COD))-(A4-0395/97) by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy on the proposal for a Council Decision on the fifth framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for research and teaching activities (1998-2002) (COM(97)0142 - C4-0234/97 & COM(97)439-97/0120(CNS))I would like to specify from the outset that, in order to avoid an interruption of the vote tomorrow, as there are 171 amendments to Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl's report on the fifth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities, and as we also have the formal solemn session tomorrow at midday, the vote on this report will take place on Thursday, on the understanding that the deadline for notification of requests for separate votes and for split votes is fixed for this evening at 9 p.m., to enable a proper preparation for this vote, which is a complex one."
"On the other hand, the second report from Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on the fifth framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community for training activities, will be put to the vote tomorrow, Wednesday."
"So we should all be in agreement on the procedure for voting."
"I want to state this clearly from the outset so that there can be no confusion: the vote on the first report on Thursday; the vote on the second report, Wednesday, the reason being, I remind you, the interruption that will be caused to tomorrow's votes by the formal session at midday."
"Mr President, the amendments to the main report - not the Euratom report - are not yet available."
"This makes it rather difficult for us to do our work on separate votes and split votes in time."
"Could you do what you can to ensure those amendments are made available in the different languages this afternoon."
"Otherwise, we cannot meet the deadline."
"Mrs McNally, as I stated, we have 171 amendments, which is a substantial workload for our services, and in particular for the translators."
"We are very conscious of the difficulties this causes for all of our parliamentary colleagues, but it is precisely for that reason that we are proposing to postpone the vote to Thursday, which will enable us, between now and then, or at least we hope so, to have all of the amendments in all languages, and hence to enable you to take the decisions which are your responsibilities as a political group."
"I remind you that the deadline for tabling amendments is set for this evening at 9 p.m."
"Under normal circumstances, you should have the necessary documents enabling you to present your requests for separate votes and split votes in good time."
"So the timetable is agreed."
"I shall now open the debate and naturally give the floor to our rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, for ten minutes."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for running through the timetable again so clearly."
"It is obviously important for us to have the vote take place as quickly and efficently as possible."
"We will try to make it all go smoothly."
"Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are on the threshold of concluding the first reading of the fifth R&D framework programme which sets the course for sensible research funding for the years 1999 to 2004."
"The Commission has set out its ideas in several preliminary papers and in the final proposal."
"How happy or unhappy individual Members are with this proposal, certainly how intensely Parliament has been working on it, is indicated by the 750 or so amendments originally made, which my colleagues and I have prepared, submitted and debated."
"Were there very great differences of opinion?"
"Which aspects have been especially significant to us as a Parliament?"
"Firstly, we do not want as a Parliament to quit research policy for five years after the second reading of the framework programme."
"That is why we are calling for transparent management of the later individual programmes, with a corresponding report-back obligation on the part of the Commission and a reassessment of the research focus halfway through the framework programme."
"The content and priorities laid down by us correspond to a large extent to those of the Commission."
"However, there are some, I believe, important additions and, above all, a differentiated and, in our view, clear arrangement of the thematically distinct programmes."
"The much-vaunted practice of focusing does not mean continuing to produce the same contents under fewer headings."
"Clarity and strategic organization are preferable to a purely logistical reduction in the number of topics."
"Secondly, the third line of action -innovation and inclusion of SMEs -has been appreciably extended since the EU has obvious deficiencies in the area of innovation and product development vis-à-vis its international rivals."
"Since it is often the small and medium-sized businesses who operate in a very innovative way and thereby create new jobs, it seemed important to us to offer a special type of support where the actual development does not quite fit exactly into one of the programmes."
"Thirdly, the Joint Research Centre occupies a distinguished position on the European research landscape."
"But as you know, Madam Commissioner, noblesse oblige."
"Hence we have described the responsibilities of the Research Centre and its special role as an independent body more clearly and more elaborately."
"We are giving it the chance to compete with other research establishments, to prove its worth and thereby attract additional funds."
"Clearly, we would like to use the JRC as a contractor for the European Parliament."
"The Members too need support with the scientific research behind their political work."
"Obviously, the Joint Research Centre's independence should not be overlooked here."
"Fourthly, a central idea of European research promotion is the encouragement of so-called 'European added value' ."
"We have discussed often enough what this term actually means."
"In my view it goes beyond the mere promotion of opportunities, contacts and international researcher exchange, and we have talked enough about this too."
"However, I must honestly admit that we have not succeeded either in coming up with a definition of what European added value might be, as you will see from the report."
"Hence, special attention must be paid to this question when approving the specific programmes and selecting the actual individual projects."
"Under the principle of subsidiarity there is a constant need to reassess and determine whether it is meaningful to promote from Brussels or whether more local alternatives might not be better."
"Fifthly, the various legal bases for the framework programme and the Euratom programme do not allow us to devise a coherent and self-contained research programme for the European Union."
"That is why we have tried with our amendments to coordinate both parts as far as possible and institutionally dovetail them with each other."
"The cooperation of both programme committees should obviate frictional loss, encourage coordination and the joint use of findings, and thereby result in joint planning."
"The desire to establish a system of joint funding, which my colleague Mr Linkohr sought with the fourth framework programme, I could not achieve either, unfortunately."
"Point six: a few words on the question of funding."
"The Commission appropriation of ECU 16.3 billion for the duration of the framework programme means in absolute terms a marked increase on the fourth framework programme; in relative terms, however, it means a standstill."
"This cannot be gratifying to us."
"As elected representatives of the people, we do, however, witness the difficult budgetary situation everywhere in Europe."
"This should not be kept secret from anyone."
"That is why we have only distanced ourselves a little from the Commission's proposal."
"Even if the ECU 16.7 billion still subject to the financial perspective really is a lot of money, it only represents some 4 % of the total amount of government research spending in the EU."
"To spend it to the best advantage presupposes efficient coordination with national or multinational programmes."
"At the same time, the Commission should manage the individual programmes as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible."
"The annual split allocation of sums for research and the costs of administration should provide the incentive for this."
"There is transparency in everything here, too."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you all for your assistance, your constant suggestions, the controversial discussions with the other side of the House, and the support and encouragement for my work generally."
"I have tried -I can tell you quite frankly - to put forward compromise solutions wherever fair, which may not represent the orthodoxy of my group, or indeed my own orthodoxy, but are intended to build bridges with other parts of this House."
"We are united in one point: only research and innovation, as the basis for the development of quality products, can guarantee jobs on our continent."
"We can no longer be the cheapest -those days are gone -nor do we want to be in this global economy of ours, but let us be the best!"
"In a further answer to Mrs McNally, I have been told that amendments should be ready at 5 p.m., which will give you time to prepare your requests."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all congratulations to the rapporteur on her global view of this very important aspect of policy for the European Union."
"With the fifth research framework programme, which is to run from 1998 to 2002, the Commission wants to create a new concept for joint research policy."
"It is to be tailored to people's current problems and expectations, while at the same time supporting fundamental developments and trends."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has expressly stated in one of its guidelines that the Community's energy requirement should be catered for with the least possible pollution, that is to say by reducing C02 emissions."
"The Commission has come out in favour of new and renewable energy sources."
"Moreover, it has proved its positive attitude in the recent presentation of its White Paper on a policy for renewable energies."
"The Commission is endeavouring here to increase the share of renewable energy sources from 6 to 12 % by the year 2010."
"A rethink on the part of the Commission towards alternative energies is plain to see and will positively affect the Union's future development."
"In keeping with the significance of renewable energy sources and biomass for the Union's future energy policy, greater space should be devoted to biomass in the fifth framework programme."
"From agriculture and the countryside's point of view, biomass has even greater significance."
"Besides the ecological aspects, it represents a chance for farmers and the rural population to tap new sources of income."
"In this way, areas that are not required for food production can be used profitably."
"The net output remains in the producing regions, and biomass contributes, as an inexhaustible source of energy, to the security, maintenance and independence of third countries."
"It also helps to attain the stability targets set by the Kyoto Climate Conference."
"In view of the importance of renewable energies, and biomass especially, for the future of European agriculture, the Commission should increase its budgetary commitment to ECU 1, 141 million, to a level corresponding to the amount budgeted for research into nuclear fusion and nuclear fission."
"And particularly in view of enlargement eastwards, biomass programmes for the countries of central and eastern europe, and the relevant know-how, should support these new technologies in these countries."
"In addition, the Commission should also promote the use of biomass and other renewable energy sources through a minimum and Community-wide standard rate of tax."
"The development of innovative technologies in the area of biological processes is equally important for agriculture."
"I think we really should have a rethink here, and this should be encouraged through the structural funds too."
"I hope that Parliament can also approve the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which was carried unanimously there."
"Mr President, before going into the merits of the extremely financial aspects, I would like to make two general considerations: in introducing its proposal, to which I believe it rightly attributes the utmost importance, the Commission expresses an opinion I share: the fifth framework programme should assist European society in entering the Twenty-first Century under the best conditions."
"It seemed important to me to make this introduction, just as it seems important to make another introduction on the procedure."
"Like the Commission, we hope we can achieve a majority vote on Council, because this is important."
"Coming now to the extremely financial aspects, I believe that the Commission's proposal, which provides for a 3.8 % increase compared with the previous programme, is important, even if we all know that far more is required in terms of the need to develop investments and research: the budget makes us take reality into account."
"What we want to emphasize, however, is that, because the future financial prospects are uncertain, we also need to review the overall financing in the light of the new financial prospects; not only, but, in particular, when the new member countries join, the overall maximum amount will have to be reviewed, because we think this proposal is only adequate for the 15 member countries."
"Mr President, I would like to stress what an atypical situation we are actually in, because it would in fact be right for the Council to follow this discussion from now on, as it is a subject that requires a joint decision."
"It is true that the Commission will make a proposal after our debate, but it is also true that Council should follow subjects as important as those given by a strategic programme such as the fifth framework programme for research and development."
"Whilst pointing out this failure, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we have all exaggerated somewhat."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has voted 30 amendments and has certainly made a substantial contribution in quantity."
"The part-session, however, will agree we concentrate on the essential, otherwise the individual governments will be in a good position to set the various opinions expressed in Parliament against each other."
"We need to concentrate on the essential issues, as it will be easier to reach a joint decision on the matter and then we can reach a reconciliation."
"If we get lost in a maze, Parliament can be sure of failure."
"The time at which this presentation is made will be unique."
"There is a sense of timing, in fact, on the eve of expansion with the new framework programme."
"However, there is one aspect which the Committee on Economic Affairs has pointed out, which is the need to link this Fifth Framework Programme with the new situation which, from the geopolitical point of view, will be established within a few years with the expansion to the East and with the application of the Barcelona Agreement."
"We should therefore think of a far broader scenario that is not just based on the added value for the Fifteen."
"This approach emphasizes a need pointed out by the Committee on Economic Affairs that we should no longer plan for five years but for the next ten, twenty and thirty years, because it is only in this context that major investments can be made in research that will be of use to the entire Community."
"Mr President, fundamentally the 4 % or so of the total EU spending on civil research is relatively little."
"Nevertheless, I would like to hail the fifth framework programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities a comparatively successful instrument of programming."
"Although I have to say the goal aspired to is in a bit of a cleft stick, which could do with some attention."
"The European Parliament is of the opinion, like the Regional Committee, that R&D policy should make a positive contribution to cohesion."
"At the same time, the needs of disadvantaged regions have frequently been neglected until now in the prioritizing of research projects."
"Such approaches touch on the question of how far R&D policy, based on the principle of first-rate scientific and technological quality, can serve the objective of economic and social cohesion in the EU without watering down or even abandoning their own objectives."
"Complementarity between cohesion policy, on the one hand, and R&D policy, on the other, seems hard to achieve as a solution."
"Under article 130f of the treaty, the aim of R&D policy is to strengthen the scientific and technological foundations of industry in the Community and thereby promote the development of its international competitiveness."
"The policy therefore supports companies, research centres and universities in their efforts to undertake research and technology development of a high quality."
"The priority is still to improve international competitiveness by promoting top-quality research and development."
"This intelligent conception of Community R&D policy, however, has the effect of limiting in many areas the opportunities for this policy to increase its contribution to cohesion."
"What must be aimed for is improved complementarity between R&D and structural policy."
"The European Parliament has called for serious integration of the structural funds and the framework programme with its resolution of 28 November 1996 on the perspectives for a European science and technology policy."
"This concept is based on the development of an integrated approach, which makes use of existing synergies between both policies, while respecting the logic of each."
"Structural policy should, according to this concept, help make it easier for disadvantaged regions to participate more thoroughly in the framework programme, by building up and promoting R&D capacities in these regions."
"The joint R&D policy, in contrast, should assist in reducing the disparities that exist between the regions in the area of R&D, especially by the third measure -dissemination and use of findings -and the fourth measure - education and mobility of scientists."
"My amendments serve this aim."
"I hope they will be taken into consideration."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism of the European Parliament has spent considerable time poring over the fifth framework programme, especially since sector-specific research was integrated into the field of transport in the past."
"We had very positive experiences with this in the past, too, I would say."
"There is noother area of research that is so politically motivated, by which I mean that transport research is also an instrument for implementing European policy."
"We have already been able to use initial results as a basis for translating transport objectives into practice."
"Hence it is natural that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has called for the introduction of a transport and mobility campaign to lend the necessary weight to this sector."
"I think the approach seen in the Research Committee, that is to designate a specific area to transport, mobility and production, gives this request from the Committee on Transport and Tourism the necessary scope, and I can say on behalf of the Transport Committee that we find this approach acceptable."
"It is precisely in the area of transport that problems need solving."
"This will affect other key actions - I am thinking, for example, of the 'city of tomorrow' ."
"There is a transport problem to be solved here. I am thinking of the whole question of intermodality."
"How do we combine various modes of transport in order to solve the transport problem we have in Europe?"
"Satellite-supported information systems are a very important sector too."
"How can we make the information available to develop intelligent transport concepts?"
"All these are things that need to be brought together and accounted for in this campaign."
"On behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to thank the rapporteur, who was very receptive to the concerns of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"While she was not able to accommodate us 100 % in her committee, I think, if this House approves the transport, mobility and production campaign and it is taken up by the Council, we will have reached an important milestone in uniting both research and the political intentions of this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Culture Committee I have mixed feelings on the report before us today, and I hope that this will turn to satisfaction after the vote."
"On the one hand, I welcome the fact that our attempt to improve the situation of young researchers has found expression at two points in the report."
"However, on the question of the information society, the majority of the Committee has, in my view, retreated to positions which, it is constantly being claimed in this House, do not form part of the European understanding of the information society."
"While the Commission wanted to gear research towards a user-friendly information society, which did not go far enough for us in the Culture Committee -we wanted to broaden it through the criterion of 'substantive diversity' -now there is only talk of information and communication technologies."
"This is not a slip semantically."
"Consequently, the Culture Committee's proposals, which aimed for an improvement in education and cultural opportunities, especially in regard to the digitalization and virtualization of libraries and museums, as well as the creation of new interactive modes of access, have not been approved."
"Matters of this nature or social-economic research was apparently considered an uncalled-for luxury by the Committee majority."
"I think the two days we still have before the vote should be put to good use correcting certain biasses found in the present draft resolution in the sense I have indicated."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, has had to contend with a huge number of amendments, far greater than we have ever had on previous occasions when dealing with the framework programme."
"I think it reflects two things: the success of the framework programme, and the very great interest that the scientific community has taken in it."
"But I also think that it reflects a concern about the resources that are available."
"We have had reports from the Commission that national resources are tending to decline."
"We know that, as a result of energy liberalization in the UK, for instance, the amount of gas research has declined."
"We also know that Japan and the United States are increasing their expenditure."
"So if we are trying to deal with problems of competitiveness, the total resources that we give are important."
"Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has certainly shown her willingness to compromise on this issue."
"I hope that agreement will be maintained during the vote tomorrow when we seek to increase the amount over that proposed by the Commission."
"All of us will have different views as to what is important."
"For me, it is how we can make the research programme create jobs."
"It is really how we use the research."
"The innovative processes have got to be increased."
"In particular, we need to make sure that science, technology and society are in harmony."
"We need to pay more attention to that."
"I should like to echo a point that Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl made, which is also referred to in a number of amendments."
"Small companies have a difficulty."
"In my own region I find that companies with fewer than about 50 employees do not always find it easy to get involved."
"They have not got the resources."
"They are not able to go out and find out what is going on."
"We need to find a method of taking the information to them more effectively than we have been able to in the past."
"I speak too for the Committee on Fisheries."
"In my own area the fishermen are very small companies; very often they are just one-boat families."
"It is not easy for them to get involved."
"The programme is not written in a way that makes it easy to put in what we need to do in the fisheries sector."
"So in the opinion from the Fisheries Committee I have laid down some parameters which I hope the Commission will take note of when it produces the research action programme."
"That is the only way I could handle the matter, given the way the framework proposals came forward."
"I am sure the Commission will take note."
"Mr President, Mrs QuisthoudtRowhol has been a very hardworking rapporteur."
"She has had animated conversations and I think she will have had one or two more by the end of this week."
"I would like to thank her and the staff who have been extremely helpful throughout our deliberations."
"I am speaking principally for the Women's Rights Committee but also for the Party of European Socialists."
"The concept of mainstreaming was adopted by the European Commission; mainstreaming means the incorporation of equal opportunities for women and men into all the Community's policies and activities."
"The fifth framework programme is one of the most important policies and activities."
"It lays down criteria for research and development for four years, it has a huge budget - we hope - and it is highly regarded by the scientific community throughout the EU."
"For reasons of oversight there was no mention of mainstreaming or of equal opportunities or the gender perspective in the original document."
"I know that the Commissioner herself is committed to those issues and I am sure she will be able to accept the amendments put in by the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Indeed the Amsterdam Treaty, if ratified, makes it clear in article 3 that the European Community in all its activities has to have the aim of eliminating inequalities."
"You may say, well it is not excluded; but that is not good enough, colleagues."
"It has to be spelled out and explicit and that is what our amendments have done."
"We do not want to risk the fifth framework programme looking like a 'toys-for-the-boys' programme."
"It is meant for all citizens, men and women in the European Union."
"Some amendments have been resubmitted after consultation with members of the Women's Rights Committee so that we can see how far Parliament wants to be explicit about the need to promote equal opportunities."
"Speaking for the Party of European Socialists I would like to say that the sum which is being put forward, although it is above that proposed by the Commission, is actually the minimum we think necessary to do justice to the needs of research and development in Europe."
"We agree that four programmes are far more logical than the three originally suggested by the Commission."
"You still have the concentration which was wanted by the Commissioner but you have something that is a little bit clearer to the scientific community."
"As far as the financial breakdown is concerned, we have slight differences of opinion with the Commission and we would weight the programme slightly differently."
"I hope that by Thursday when we vote it can be a massive majority from this Parliament so that we go into the Council negotiations not naked but fully clothed with a very strong position from this Parliament for a very important issue."
"Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs emphasises the importance of the social and financial study in its opinion of the fifth R & D framework programme."
"This view has been given scanty consideration in the research committee's report under discussion."
"The framework programme should lay much greater emphasis on the issues of social exclusion, poverty, ageing, unemployment and the status of women."
"The framework programme should also investigate changes in working life developments in the working community."
"Good working conditions and a developing working community have an important influence on increased production in industry and, in turn, positive progress in the economy and employment."
"For this reason, a study should also be planned for the issues of job protection and health and safety at work."
"And technical studies do not exist as entities separate from society."
"Studies and their results always have an influence on society, and this influence has to be respected."
"EU research must itself promote employment and social cohesion in Europe."
"It is vital that the national viewpoint be taken into account when planning and implementing research programmes."
"When we consult the users of a study we should be listening to the real users - individuals and consumers."
"For example, the users in a study on health are not only the health care organizations or the pharmaceutical industry, but, above all, the patients and their representative organizations."
"Women have up till now been almost entirely absent from EU research planning and evaluation."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs propose that a fair balance of women and men be invited onto boards of experts in the planning and execution of the framework programme."
"This will not automatically mean that competence and skills will dwindle."
"There are qualified women around - you only have to look."
"Mr President, allow me first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt Rowohl, for the excellent work carried out and for her availability to find compromise solutions able to include the various requests, the various sensitivities."
"I think we are submitting a good text to Parliament's vote and we hope that the Commission and Council can take it into account."
"I also hope that this Chamber will wish to correct any defects and approve the necessary inclusions, and here I am referring in particular to the aspect of social and economic research."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, unanimously approving the report I presented, had confirmed the choice of the Executive Committee which had limited the thematic programmes to three and paid special attention to the environment in the first and third."
"This was not the choice of the Committee on Research which, raising the number of thematic programmes to four, still gave the environment a key sub-action, also leaving considerable room for research connected with environmental protection in the other key sub-action reserved for energy."
"The Committee on the Environment had also approved the motion to reserve for the Joint Research Centre higher financing than that provided by the Commission, also asking the JRC to work for Parliament as well."
"The Committee on Research has not accepted the increase but, in view of the amendments seeking to reduce the financing, has defended and confirmed that laid down by the Commission, in view of the important role played by the JRC as the means of implementing the fifth framework programme and as a neutral and independent scientific body."
"We hope, Madam Commissioner, that, after this initial stage, a good dialogue will continue between Parliament and the Commission, with cooperation and transparency, so that together we can finally provide the European Union with an efficient and effective framework research programme that can begin to catch up on the serious European delay compared with the United States which, with their federal organization, have for some time been able to amass substantial financial resources and huge human resources."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a declared aim of European policy is to make up for the dangerous, and by now almost permanent, way in which Europe is lagging behind the USA and Japan in terms of innovation."
"Yet research comes before all technological innovation and, sadly, there is a lot of truth in the saying that the Europeans are good at making knowledge out of ECUs, but bad at making ECUs out of knowledge."
"The Commission wants to change this through an increase in funds, concentration and greater flexibility."
"This is apparent in its proposal for the fifth framework programme."
"Where it is consistent, we support it."
"Where it fails to keep its promises, we criticize it."
"It is right to drastically reduce the number of subject-based programmes, and it is wrong to want to minister to virtually every particular interest."
"Of course we cannot compensate for the decline in research sponsorship in the Member States through our budgetary allocations, but we can create considerable incentives for effective cooperation within the European scientific community and in collaboration with third countries."
"This is of general political significance, too, for this European Union and its enlargement."
"What we as socialists definitely do not want to see is a reduction in the amount of cooperation and coordination achieved in the area of European research and technological development."
"Renationalization is the wrong response to the global challenges in research policy too."
"My group is prepared to give the clear signals required, and in the budget for this programme if need be."
"We have made compromises with the conservative side of this House."
"The position reached on the budget is for us the minimum consensus."
"It is very close to our pain threshold."
"However, you do not need the gift of prophecy to predict that, without a strong parliamentary majority, we will be at a disadvantage vis-à-vis the Council, and that is why we will be voting in favour."
"We find ourselves in a time of global changes affecting all areas of life."
"In particular, the stormy developments taking place in information technology and biotechnology are going to radically alter our lives."
"Hence associated social research is of major importance."
"My group does not want to write this into the framework programme with just so many empty words, but rather give it a concrete shape and fund it properly."
"Our proposals for this were rejected in the Research Committee by a slight majority."
"Even after conservative colleagues had come out in favour of a socioeconomic campaign, especially on the subject of the information society, they could not resist the temptation to use their fortuitous majority on the day to reject this sensible amendment."
"This was a mistake."
"Let us put it right through, among other things, visibly improved funding for the programme's fourth line of action, namely so-called human resources."
"Let me say a few words on the Euratom programme, even if Parliament is still being consulted on it."
"The Euratom treaty was successful."
"It brought the Community considerable autonomy in energy provision, and this autonomy can be enjoyed today in the medium term using other forms of energy in an economical and environmentally compatible manner, and a lot less dangerously too."
"For this reason, the majority of socialists are in favour of switching over."
"There are only three areas that can be sensibly and profitably pursued, specifically research into the safety of existing reactors, research into the substitution of C02 -neutral energy sources and research into the safe disposal of radioactive waste."
"The budget should be arranged accordingly."
"Let me conclude by extending my personal thanks to the rapporteur."
"She has worked hard."
"She has quite literally worked out a lot of important compromises."
"For this, much thanks."
"I think her achievement should be acknowledged through the adoption of our few, but sound and necessary, amendments."
"Then we can adopt the report as a whole by an impressive majority."
"Mr President, the fifth framework programme represents a clear step forward in relation the fourth programme."
"It centres on the priorities and in defining them it takes the interaction between science and society into account."
"By proposing an increased budget for the next five years, it acknowledges the central role of research in contributing to public well-being, economic development and European competitiveness."
"I would emphasize, however, that so far as the distribution of the funds between the actions is concerned, the degree of over-concentration on the first action is frightening countries like Portugal."
"For my country, actions to further international cooperation and better results are still of fundamental importance."
"It is natural for viewpoints to differ from one Member State to another."
"The difficulty the last 'Research Council' had in reaching an agreement proves this point."
"But the widest gaps exist between those countries which favour research and want it concentrated on products for development, and those others, like Portugal, for whom the development and transfer of technology has to be their major preoccupation, together with mobility of research grants; because that is the only way they can be sure of getting their share of the improvement in the efficiency of European research policy."
"I would like to draw attention to two aspects which I tried to get included in the draft report on the framework programme, one of which was taken up by the Research Committee and the other rejected."
"The first, which is reflected in the report, is the importance of including socio-economic research in the first action under the Fifth Programme."
"In the face of Europe's problems, which keep on getting more complicated, such as racism, xenophobia, unemployment, sustainable development, bio-ethics and public health, the development of the social dimension of research must take priority in our policy."
"The second is the urgent need to develop a fully integrated marine science and technology policy, which will open the way to a genuine European policy on the oceans."
"Unfortunately I was unable to get that proposal included."
"I will conclude, Mr President, while on the subject of my proposals concerning the ocean, by reminding the House that with the Union signing the United Nations Convention on the oceans, the work of the Independent Commission on the Oceans, and Expo 98 in Lisbon, I am sure that a climate is being created in which a full-blown European Oceans Agency will fall into our laps one of these days."
"Mr President, everyone is aware that the fifth framework programme is the foundation of the research policy of the Union for years to come."
"The strategic structure devised by the Commission, in thematic programmes and in horizontal programmes, certainly directs community action to a greater extent than the four previous programmes, ensuring a better coordination of activities and avoiding overlaps and duplicates."
"Moreover, the administrative simplification of the procedure will certainly provide the flexibility that was lacking at times of crisis, such as the case of BSE, and which is certainly necessary to ensure access to the programmes for thousands of small and medium-sized companies, that come up against legal, administrative and financial obstacles that prevent them from conducting research and from using the results of the research."
"The Research Committee and the European Parliament can only confirm the importance of research as an answer to the growing social needs of the population with regard to health, safety, quality of life, employment and environment."
"The decision to promote research in particular sectors, such as ageing and rare diseases, answers these needs."
"The same can be said of research for the safeguard and protection of movable and immovable cultural assets, through the use of the new technologies applied to a sector, that represents our cultural wealth and our historic memory."
"Moreover, Mr President, the international cooperation with third countries is certainly a winning policy, both for the applicant countries, for which joint research may act as a catalyst in the integration process, and for the third countries of the neighbouring Mediterranean, for which this research will mean employment, development, peace and political relations."
"As chairman of the Committee on Research as well, I will conclude with great satisfaction by saying that the European Parliament has shown considerable support for the fifth framework programme through the commitment of all our colleagues and our rapporteur in particular, who has been really fantastic in his efforts and I think we are all truly very grateful to him."
"Finally, I hope that a final effort of convergence will be made now to fortify our position even further."
"To conclude, Mr President, we all certainly hope that the Council will play its part because research is the launching base for the economy and the basis to solve the serious employment problem."
"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, on behalf of the liberal group I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the spade work she has done."
"Despite over 500 amendments, all noses in the Commission were made to point in the same direction as far as structure and substance is concerned."
"Unfortunately the financial outline is still missing."
"But before us is a clear, substantive proposal."
"At the moment this is essential, colleagues."
"After all, the Council has still not come up with a communal position."
"This means that Parliament might perhaps be able to play a steering role and that is why, colleagues, it is of crucial importance that we set the budget tomorrow with a large majority."
"My group has therefore submitted a proposal for the budget which I would like to explain."
"The sectors in which most employment will be generated in the future, are information communication technology, ICT, as well as biotechnology."
"We therefore have to invest in these sectors."
"Research and technological development in the sphere of ICT must therefore be given a high priority in the fifth framework programme."
"Europe after all is losing a market share in the global market for ICT, and this means loss of employment."
"In this context we must make sure that soft and hardware development will not be considered too much as separate entities in the fifth framework programme."
"The framework programme must promote innovation, and not obstruct it."
"Industry must therefore also to a large extent be involved."
"My second point, Mr President, concerns small and medium-sized enterprise within the framework programme, the generator of jobs."
"The majority of SMEs does not invest in research and development."
"We must stop creating false expectations for this group, but for a number of sectors in SME, such as the high-tech sector, and the transport sector, for instance, with its logistical system, there are excellent opportunities for projects with a European added value."
"For these small companies in particular simplification of procedures is important."
"We could also think of projects aimed at a specific branch within SME."
"My last point, Mr President, concerns Euratom."
"As long as the nuclear fusion programme does not offer any concrete perspective for delivering even one kilowatt power, not even within the next 50 years now more than ever, we should turn our minds to the development of new energy technologies."
"My group will therefore be happy to support the proposal of the rapporteur for a reduction of ECU 100 million in the Euratom programme to ECU 1, 300 million."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, we value the efforts made both by the Commission, in its proposal, and by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl."
"Nevertheless, we can see a few problems which I would like to mention briefly."
"The Commission's proposal, by reducing and concentrating the research effort, although well-intentioned, in practice can result in this effort ending up in those countries and regions with the greatest resources, the most technology and the best research infrastructure, thereby depriving the rest of the European Community of these resources. Given the current state of Europe, that is worrying."
"Another problem which worries us is the fact that inequality is on the increase in Europe, as are unemployment and problems of social exclusion. Yet the proposal fails to attach enough importance to this social aspect."
"We are also a little surprised that the procedure for choosing the four themes is not clear. It seems to be dictated by the multinationals, which needs to be put right in future versions."
"Therefore our group's vote will depend on the final proposal."
"I should also like to say that we are pleased with the proposal to establish a science infrastructure aimed at providing a network for scientific awareness (which is important in Europe) and to enable us to compete. We are also pleased with the sensitivity shown in the proposal towards mental illness."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work."
"Firstly, with regard to the Euratom framework programme, the promotion of nuclear energy has always characterized this programme and we are long overdue a change of vision, especially with regard to fusion."
"Fusion is a complete white elephant, on which billions of ECUs have been wasted."
"The fusion programme has not yet produced any energy."
"It will need to deal with the waste if we are to end this extravagance."
"The Greens have tabled a series of amendments with a view to converting the money spent on fusion to promoting sustainable and renewable energies."
"I must insist that nuclear energy is not sustainable and produces CO2 ."
"If the rapporteur's proposals are accepted, however, I would still emphasize the need for detailed examination of the programme and monitoring of the expenditure."
"With regard to the effects of radiation on human beings, here we have an important breakthrough due to the work of Dr Mothersill in Ireland and the UK Medical Research Council team of Dr Eric Wright on genomic instability."
"Mistrust of radiation and the nuclear industry has always characterized the population, and now radiation biologists are concluding that the public may well have been right all along."
"They have found a previously unknown pathway by which radiation can subvert living cells."
"Radiation, they say, may cause a much wider range of diseases than epidemiological studies predict."
"Even low levels of exposure to radiation could be poisoning the human gene pool, wreaking damage on future generations."
"The instability research from around the world has shown that the effects on the gene pool of this low-level radiation are quite horrifying."
"The Sellafield complex in Cumbria has been the largest emitter of radiation in the UK, discharging radioactive gas and liquid into the Irish Sea."
"The critical groups here have included fishermen working in the sea and people who eat seaweed."
"These people could be exposed to levels of radiation that could harm them, and the numbers of people who have died or suffered from radiation released from Sellafield, nuclear weapons testing, the Chernobyl accident and from medical X-rays and radon in buildings could be much greater than anyone has dared to admit."
"I have tabled an amendment which I would ask Parliament to accept."
"It is absolutely scandalous that radiation protection is not a key action."
"With regard to the allocation for biotechnology, this has been vastly increased."
"While we accept the possibilities of biotechnology, the ethical issues must be widely addressed."
"We do not accept the one-dimensional concentration on genetic engineering."
"Here we have an accident waiting to happen which could affect us as badly as the nuclear industry."
"Mr President, I join in the congratulations to the rapporteur."
"This is a convention in this House but she certainly deserves them because she has put a lot of work into this report."
"I like the phrase she used in her introductory speech 'europäisches Mehrwert ' , the concept of European added value."
"We should allow this - and I commend it to the Commission and, for that matter, the Council - to inform the whole approach towards R&D in the future."
"We have to look at ways in which Europe can add value to research which otherwise might be going on or, for that matter, to initiate research which is not likely to take off."
"There are some obvious lessons to be drawn from applying that principle."
"One is that if you reduce the amount of research put into the nuclear industry and transfer it to the sustainable energy field, then clearly you are going to add value both in terms of the effectiveness of the research programme and of the generation of employment."
"Likewise, I wish to echo the points made about the value of supporting the small and medium-sized enterprises - a point made by Mr Schiedermeier about the impact on the outer regions of Europe and also by Mr Adam."
"We talk a lot about innovation in the whole question of research and here you have a very innovative sector."
"For example, in my own area in north-east Scotland the oil industry is very important to Europe and to the world."
"But who are making the breakthroughs in technology?"
"Often it is very small firms, which are literally at the cutting edge of development."
"Certainly they are pushing forward new ideas for undersea technology."
"This is going to be invaluable for giving Europe an advantage vis-à-vis the United States and Japan in the future."
"I commend therefore this idea of European added value, especially for those who are at the leading edge but often need the support of the Commission."
"My last point in this connection is to ask when people get research grants that they be paid on time, because sometimes these small industries cannot accept and sustain the losses involved by the failure to keep up the cash flow."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I would like from the outset to make my own contribution, of course, to the concert of congratulations directed at Mrs Quisthoudt, and I do so the more willingly as what I am preparing to say will not always make very agreeable listening."
"I therefore would like to say that I do congratulate her on her excellent work."
"We are at present faced with a report which presents a number of difficulties in the field of research and development."
"Even today, I cannot, through the amendments voted in the energy and research committee and through the hundreds of amendments registered here, in the plenary session, make out exactly what is the scientific orientation of the European Parliament - and that is a euphemism."
"We did, however, get off to a good start, as some few months ago, when we voted in unanimously a resolution on the orientations of the scientific policy of the 21st Century."
"But the fifth framework programme exercise doubtless has this peculiarity that it has brought everyone here with his or her own ideas, not to mention the ideas of the industrial, environmental, and other lobbies, to such an extent that the whole debate has been polluted by a mass of concepts which have actually confused the whole of the outline."
"I therefore believe that you have the merit, Madam Rapporteur, of having set out a very clear, very precise orientation from the start, which was certainly not the one that we had voted in a few months earlier. But is it not true, as the saying goes, that only fools never change their minds?"
"Consequently, it appears that you consulted your conscience, and believed that we were all wrong when we voted in the resolution on research for the 21st century."
"However, it cannot be said either - and this exonerates you - that the debate in the research committee and the many amendments submitted have made your own thinking richer or have improved it."
"I readily admit that you have much merit insofar as you have fought your way through this mass of amendments to clear a number of avenues for compromise, and I am delighted that you are here, today, slowly and carefully finding the way forward to the necessary compromise, with assistance from the coordinators from the major groups."
"Doubtless congratulations are even more in order, after all these goings on, as regards the quality of the proposal by the Commission. For while we may not always have properly reread what we voted, the Commission, for its part, has learned a great deal."
"To a degree, I am delighted at this, and we may be able to say now, with a little exaggeration only, that if the Council were to be committed to the proposals of the Commission, this would be the best solution for the Parliament."
"However that may be, Madam Commissioner, I would like to ask you in a while to state your view on an important point for the voting tomorrow, i.e. the structure of the programme, and more precisely, the move from three thematic programmes to four."
"Clearly, the Commission must be in agreement on this point, otherwise a number of problems will rear their heads."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, congratulations to our rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt."
"She has worked very hard and has produced an extremely consistent report, for which I would like to thank her very much."
"During the fourth framework programme it became clear that it was necessary to increase thematic orientation and to ensure that there would more market orientation, using the results of Cost and the Eureka project."
"On that point the intention behind the fifth framework programme is satisfactory."
"I therefore think that what this Parliament has proposed is in agreement with this, and so I hope that this structure will be taken over by the Council."
"When we discuss finances, the United States and Japan are often mentioned."
"So they should be, but let us look above all at what the Member States are doing."
"When I hear Mr Tannert speak about the conservatives in this House, then I think he might be talking about the Confederal Group of the European United Left, but certainly not about my group."
"Because as a ChristianDemocrat, I would like to say to Mr Tannert that I hope he is prepared to come to a compromise on that point too, when it concerns further subdivision; that he would be prepared to readjust his position."
"The issue here is the objectives of our research, and this first and foremost strengthens and improves our competitive position in Europe."
"Information communication technology plays an extremely important part in this."
"I also think that the sum we have now, ECU 3, 900 million, is a minimum which must not be touched."
"I also think it is extremely important that SMEs, where possible, are involved, through, amongst other things, grouping with larger companies; branch organizations could also play a part."
"I think it is important that communal research centres are brought more up to date."
"The procedure must be altered, to include more periodical evaluation, seeing to it that more resources from third parties are obtained, and in particular ensuring that researchers can work on a temporary basis."
"This would stimulate their procedures considerably."
"Mr President, our rapporteur has made a considerable effort to bring about coherence, thanks to the concertation carried out with such talent in this House."
"Even so, I would support four amendments."
"We have on a number of occasions emphasized that research infrastructures should provide for the networking of poles of excellence, and also for networking between platforms of experimentation and modular demonstrators used when testing and validating new technologies."
"I propose therefore to merge Amendment Nos 61 and 81 into a single, transversal amendment, Amendment No 109."
"Our Committee also emphasized the need to ensure that research served enterprise competitiveness and employment."
"For this to occur, the exploitation of results for economic purposes must be promoted, by means of the appropriate protection of intellectual property, which ensures a distinction is made between public and private research organizations."
"This is the aim of my Amendment No 110, which will also promote the exchange of results between the various research laboratories in the European Union, and innovation in small and medium-sized companies."
"It is also essential to prepare for the means of transportation and interconnection which will promote a truly European space."
"My Amendment No 107 goes in the direction of more integration and harmonization between the various transportation systems."
"Finally, scientific and technical cooperation with third party industrial countries, and with the newly emerging countries, should not create a Trojan Horse for our competitors, but should above all lead to balanced cooperation in the interests of the Union itself."
"The text of the Commission does not give us enough guarantees in this respect."
"My Amendment No 108 proposes placing cooperation with these countries in a framework which takes account of the interests of the Union and rules of reciprocity."
"With regard to the Euratom programme, its aim is essentially to further improve nuclear security and prepare for the reactors of the future, in particular by reducing nuclear waste and increasing energy yields."
"With regard to the remainder, the Group Union for Europe supports virtually all the amendments of the rapporteur, and in particular, the breakdown proposed by the rapporteur of the budget of the fifth framework programme for research."
"The Union for Europe nevertheless will support amendments whose purpose it is to recognize the role of women in European research policy."
"As a result of this exercise, this House will ensure a sustainable and viable future for European research, its interoperability, and its excellence, while reinforcing Union cohesion."
"The purpose of these proposals is to confirm the place of research in Europe, by relying on European added value, but also reinforcing the competitiveness of Europe within a world context which is increasingly competitive, on both the scientific and technological levels."
"Mr President, I think there has been an interesting and concerted effort on the part of the rapporteur and the Committee on Research covering a wide spectrum of activities and initiatives."
"My own basic observation is this: I fear that both the Commission proposal and the stance of the European Parliament are driven absolutely and unilaterally by the logic of competitiveness."
"Of course European society takes an interest in the competitiveness of its products in the face of other world powers. However, a big problem that has arisen concerning modern technology is the tremendous distance between it and a society which is confused and incapable of facing up to this technology and which still has deep moral problems in its regard."
"Witness the issues raised over cloning, witness the issues over BSE, witness the issues of genetic engineering in various agricultural products."
"In this sense I think that the comments made by the Committee on Social Affairs hit the nail on the head when they talk about a lack of intervention in issues such as the workplace, working conditions etc., or by the Committee on Culture, which are correct in pointing out that we are promoting information technology without promoting an information society."
"I think that this gulf should be bridged."
"A gulf has also appeared in the issues relating to who exploits this programme of research and technology, in other words the potential of the huge conglomerates and institutions on the one hand, and the huge vacuum and difficulties faced by small and medium-sized businesses on the other."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report."
"Admittedly, we in the Green Group do not agree with you on all questions, but we think you have done a very good job to be able to keep track of all the 700 amendments which there were on the Committee."
"You are to be commended for that."
"I would also like to commend the Commission, since I think that the Commission's original proposals were very good in many respects."
"Now on the part of the Committee we have improved it further, but unfortunately there are also a number of things which I must say have been made worse."
"This has a lot to do with money, but it also has a lot to do with details, which Mr Desama talked about earlier."
"Some of the improvements we have made include introducing a lot on sustainable development, that it should be environmentally friendly and ecologically correct etc."
"But I am a little afraid that this is only cosmetic."
"If you look a bit more closely at Amendment No 78, the Committee's proposal on the objective with regard to future energy reads as follows: The objective of this thematic programme is therefore research and the sustainable use of existing sources of energy."
"The existing source of energy in my own country of Sweden, for example, is in fact nuclear power."
"Nuclear power cannot be a sustainable source of energy."
"People therefore have doubts about much of the wording found here."
"Sustainable energy use is, of course, the renewable sources of energy."
"That is the area where we must invest more money, not in keeping old nuclear power, which Sweden, for example, is now finally beginning to phase out."
"Instead we need a new drive from the EU which can show us how to replace nuclear power with renewable energy sources."
"These are therefore the wrong signals to the Member States."
"Many of the improvements which have been made in the Committee's proposal require some clarification."
"There are many fine words about sustainable development, but we also need to show by example."
"In Amendment No 154, for example, we have said that we do not want cloning of people, but we also need to say that we do not want cloning of either people or animals."
"That is just as important because otherwise the research will continue and that will bring us closer and closer to what is ethically wrong."
"In Amendment No 45 we have set up economic frameworks and want to have more money for things to do with energy and the environment."
"With regard to Amendment No 160 we have added a proposal which is basically that we want to clarify that 60 per cent of what goes to energy for the future should be for renewable sources of energy and 75 % for demonstration."
"There are no other changes in Amendment No 160."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to convey my thanks and respect to the rapporteur."
"To reconcile so many different opinions in this House requires not only considerable skill, but great self-denial also."
"I know a lot of hard work has gone into this."
"Let me start with an example from history."
"Thousands of years ago the Chinese built the first ocean-going ships."
"They already had the compass before the Europeans left the Mediterranean."
"Nevertheless, the Europeans went on to conquer the globe and not the Chinese."
"Why?"
"The Chinese did not want to."
"They did not want to use their technology for this purpose whereas the Europeans did."
"We are faced with a similar problem in regard to research."
"We can only make things available, funds, ideas; whether the Europeans, Europe's researchers, make use of them, however, is up to them."
"This brings me to something I am actually sorry about, namely that we are relatively guarded about the proposal where the funds are concerned."
"I am aware of the financial constraints, and I am no illusionist either."
"All the same, it is not enough for Europe to catch up on the USA or Japan, or to relegate the newly industrialized countries of Southeast Asia to second or third place."
"Efforts need to be made in the Member States and in the companies."
"Investment in research must retain or regain a high, even moral, standing in Europe."
"That is what it is all about."
"Perhaps a signal for such vitality will come from this debate and the discussions on the fourth framework programme."
"At least I would like to think so."
"Just let me say a few words, as time is short, on the Euratom section since I am very satisfied with most of the other aspects."
"It is no secret that I regret cuts having been made in the Euratom programme."
"I can barely understand this since we need the funds."
"Unlike some of my colleagues, I am of the opinion that we need them for fusion."
"We need the funds for nuclear safety, especially when central and eastern European states join us. As you know, these all have Soviet reactors, if they have reactors at all."
"We must increase safety."
"Hence we do not need less money, but more."
"Even if it is not nice to say as much, I say it here."
"Finally, I hope that the Commission will have as much leeway as possible in research policy."
"The Commission has the responsibility and it should also have the opportunity to transfer funds from one side to another on its own responsibility."
"You cannot plan research; instead you have to expect surprises, and respond to them accordingly."
"I wish the Commission a happy hand in this."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, during the course of the intensive work that preceded the Commission's document, the European Parliament pointed out important and original aspects such as attention to small and medium-sized businesses with an international calling, districts with a high technological density, that are included in a dedicated action, and to technologies on the conservation of cultural assets, included in the context of the city of the future."
"In the structure of the thematic programmes, our Committee, guided brilliantly by Mr Quisthoudt-Rowohl, tried to maintain the focussing effort, which has been the guiding factor in the work on the fifth framework programme."
"And yet we have amended the action on sustainable development by adding two key actions on energy and extended the action on marine technologies to include surface transport."
"The main idea is that we are developing towards a single system of mobility, including all means of transport."
"I should point out that this amendment should be understood to be an addition; we did not intend to dilute the resources on marine technologies, but to increase the budget for a global transport action."
"To find this additional allocation, we are asking both for something to be taken from the biological sciences and for the total budget to be increased slightly."
"I am delighted that the space applications have been included in the relevant thematic projects. I also maintain the need for research into microgravity to be conducted at the international space station, an extremely new scientific opportunity for which the United States are preparing far more systematically than us Europeans and for which the action of the European Union should be supplementary to that of the ESA."
"To conclude, a word of praise for our rapporteur and in favour of a political commitment to research as a fundamental means of building our future."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, Madam Rapporteur, I come from the North Sea coast, and it is very important where I live to make sure before setting sail anywhere that the cargo is evenly distributed, otherwise the vessel will start to roll and list."
"It is my opinion that the Research Committee's resolution conceals the same danger."
"What has happened?"
"In spring this House unanimously adopted a report from our colleague Claude Desama, in which it was clearly stated that research should contribute to the European welfare-state model, not just to industrial competitiveness."
"Then the latter-day freebooters, the lobbyists, came along and stood up for particular interests."
"Hence, the ship is now starting to list, I feel, and this second pillar - the question of how things stand with risk assessment, sustainability and deliberation, and who has the opportunities in our society under what conditions -has been washed overboard."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is also an important site factor for Europe and for our society."
"Not just technology, but how we treat each other, how we live, these are the key elements for our future development, for the interests of Europe's citizens."
"We said quite clearly at the time: it is a matter of finding a socio-economic model of sustainable growth."
"We said: we want risk assessment, we want to clarify the question of participation and the role of the social partners in our society."
"All this has vanished."
"That is why I would like to urgently request again that we get things back on an even keel."
"It is a question of research efforts and, of course, finding money for these research efforts in this socioeconomic area."
"Obviously, this is a new baby."
"We did not introduce it until the fourth framework programme."
"There were problems."
"Things improved with the new leader in Mitsos."
"But that is no reason to say we have reached the end of the road."
"What is it all about?"
"It concerns, for example, the question of information and communication technologies, who has access and under what circumstances."
"The gender issue, the change in employment due to teleworking and, of course, the question of worker participation and the change in job organization are also significant."
"All this needs to be fully reflected if we intend to explore and continue to introduce certain technologies."
"For this reason, I am making an urgent plea that Amendment No 117 and, of course, Amendment No 123 be adopted so that our ship, the research vessel for the future, can stay on an even keel and steer the proper course."
"Mr President, we have now reached a determining moment in the process leading to the adoption and implementation of the fifth framework programme for research."
"Above all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, for the remarkable manner in which she has carried through the complex task of preparing this paper."
"I would like also to thank very sincerely all those who, in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, contributed through their work with the political groups and by taking preparatory initiatives, to advancing our thinking on the fifth framework programme."
"Here, I have in mind the members of the research committee in general, and the rapporteurs, and members of the ten other associated committees."
"The Commission welcomes the draft opinion of Parliament on the fifth framework programme with real satisfaction."
"Parliament has been able to seize this occasion to make its imprint."
"I note that its amendments go in the direction of the Commission's proposal, and that we are very close to one another on nearly all fundamental points."
"The fifth framework programme has been conceived as a break with the past."
"Its novelty is manifest in its three major features."
"First, a resolute orientation towards the major political, social, and economic objectives of the European Union, beginning with the improvement of the employment situation and the reinforcement of European competitiveness."
"Subsequently, concentration of resources on a limited number of themes and objectives, in order to raise the impact of actions envisaged to maximum."
"Finally, the introduction of new themes and the definition of new modes of action, the first of which are the key actions."
"On all these points, the draft opinion of Parliament supports the proposal of the Commission."
"In certain cases, it even reinforces the innovative aspects."
"The Commission therefore intends, in a revised version of its proposal, to accept a number of essential amendments, in both their spirit and content, although may be not in the precise manner in which they are now formulated."
"I shall not go into detailed comment on each amendment, and I shall concentrate on the three points around which the debate of the research committee has been structured: structure, content, and financial aspects."
"First, structure."
"The Commission agrees with the formulation proposed for the organization of the fifth framework programme into four thematic programmes."
"This ensures that we remain very close to our own proposal, and keep the determination to concentrate our effort and integrate into it a pluridisciplinary approach towards problems."
"This is the message that the college of commissioners has asked me to send to the Parliament."
"The setting up of a new programme on the combined themes of the environment and energy is justified."
"As has been shown by the discussions on climate change that have just been completed in Kyoto, the problems raised in these two fields need to be dealt with in a highly integrated fashion."
"In order to respond to the challenge before us, we need to be bold."
"To divide the new programme into two sub-programmes would be an over-timid approach."
"The Commission will therefore propose a formula which is better adapted to this configuration."
"The adoption of this new structure will, of course, lead to a reallocation of key actions."
"This will entail an adjustment of the financial equilibria."
"A number of approaches could all be said to have equal justification."
"I note that the choices made so far by the Parliament and the Commission, although they do not totally coincide, do in fact have much in common."
"Overall, I am delighted to see that the Parliament and the Commission can agree on the idea that we need a limited number of programmes."
"This consensus will be extremely useful as a means to respond to all those who were looking forward to an increasing number of programmes."
"Now, content."
"First, further to the breaking down of the energy key action into two key actions focusing on the one hand on sustainable energy use, and on the other hand on the development of cleaner and more competitive supply-side solutions, the two major new features introduced by the amendments are the key actions devoted to the problems of population ageing and climate change, respectively."
"In the Commission's proposal, these two themes had already appeared under the category of generic research activities."
"To make them key actions would make it possible, at the political level, to highlight the importance of these questions for the future of the European Union."
"The Commission emphasizes that it agrees with the spirit of the amendments proposed on these various points."
"On the other hand, it does not agree on a number of amendments introducing modifications in the content or in the allocation of key actions, which would lead to moving away from the integrated and multi-disciplinary problemsolving approach."
"A sectorial, discipline-based approach is on occasion a tempting one."
"It has all the force of tradition, but often leads to a partial grasp on problems, and to the dispersion of resources."
"A further comment on the socio-economic aspects."
"The Parliament has emphasized the need to take socioeconomic aspects into account to a very high degree, and the Commission shares this point of view."
"The Commission is indeed keen to ensure that the socio-economic aspects have a substantial position in the fifth framework programme."
"We nevertheless believe that the best manner to deal with these questions is to do so, on the one hand, within the key actions context, as regards aspects relating to the field of the major thematic programmes, and on the other hand in the framework of the special activity of the 'improvement in human potential' programme, in respect of general aspects, or other aspects not dealt with in other programmes."
"The Commission is resolved to give socio-economic questions an important role in the fifth framework programme."
"It nevertheless believes that it is still preferable to do so by using the formula it has proposed, rather than to do so through special key actions in the various programmes."
"I shall conclude with financial aspects."
"Here, I believe congratulations are in order, concerning the remarkable convergence between the proposals of the Parliament and those of the Commission, and the very strong signal which has thus been sent to the Member States and to the Council."
"The draft opinion proposes a fifth framework programme with an ECU 16.7 billion spending allocation, some ECU 400 million more than proposed by the Commission."
"In a context of budget restrictions and compressed public research expenditure, when facing up to our competitors from North America and Japan, who are not letting up on their research efforts, the European Union cannot allow itself to cut back or to allow a levelling off of the resources allocated to research at the European level."
"In accordance with the provisions of Agenda 2000, the amount proposed by the Commission has been calculated on the basis of the principle of an increase in the resources allocated to research slightly outstripping the rate of growth in GNP in the European Union."
"To fix the level of proposed financial allocation to research, the Commission has had to take into account many external constraints."
"The Commission notes with satisfaction the message contained in the draft opinion of the Parliament."
"It nevertheless maintains its proposal, for reasons that the Parliament will easily understand, which are related to the role that the Commission will be called on to play in seeking out a compromise."
"The Commission furthermore accepts the very useful amendment of the Committee on Budgets, adopted by the research committee, which translates into operational terms the interdependency between the decision to adopt the fifth framework programme and its financial allocation, and negotiation on the future financial prospects of the European Union."
"The details of the Commission's position on the various amendments will be set down in the minutes of this plenary session."
"More particularly, I would like to accept the amendments from Mrs McNally, on the need to keep monitoring and on ensuring a better balance between men and women in the 'Improvement of human potential' programme, and to introduce the question of equality of opportunity under this theme, as regards socioeconomic research."
"Furthermore, the Commission will in the Spring of 1998 organize a conference on women and the sciences."
"For my part, I wish to conclude my general comments with two further remarks."
"First, I wish to underscore the quality of the proposals arising from the work of the research committee and other committees involved."
"This testifies to the growing interest that an increasingly large number of members of Parliament are giving to the research policy which is essential if the European Union is to pursue its objectives."
"Within the perspectives defined by Agenda 2000, research is indeed at the heart of the political action of the European Union, alongside other policies dealing with learning and knowledge in the field of education, and innovation."
"I therefore wish, for my part, to see increased dialogue between ourselves during the implementation phase of our programmes."
"My second remark is operational in nature. We have not reached the end of the road, and we have still a long way to go."
"The Council must now give its opinion."
"Our hope is that it can adopt a common position at the Research Council of 12 February, and this is not guaranteed."
"To date, the positions of the Member States are on occasion quite far from one another."
"In parallel to this, discussion will get underway on the specific programmes, based on the working document presented by the Commission in November."
"The objective is the formal adoption of the framework programme in 1998 for effective implementation of specific programmes in 1999."
"The months to come will therefore still be extremely dense in terms of thinking and in debates."
"I know I can count on the European Parliament to play its role during this process."
"I would like to express my thanks in anticipation of the efforts that the Parliament will deploy in assisting us to achieve our final aim, which is to place European research at the service of European citizens."
"The European Parliament represents the citizens."
"It is the expression of their interests."
"The Parliament's active involvement in the process of decision-making contributes to ensuring that the major scientific and technological choices at the European level are made on a democratic basis."
"In the light of the urgency and the extent of the problems which Europeans need to face up to, and of the contribution that research is able to make to solving those problems, I am certain that your Assembly will do everything within its power to ensure that this new framework programme is launched as soon as possible."
"The debate is closed."
"The votes will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. and on Thursday at 9.30 a.m."
"Energy policy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0308/97) by Mr Scapagnini's, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy on the Commission communication: ""An overall view of energy policy and actions' (COM(97)0167 - C4-0205/97)."
"As Commissioner Papoutsis cannot be present this evening and as our debate will have to be interrupted at 5.30 for Commission Question Time, with the consent of the House I now invite Commissioner Papoutsis to speak."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity first and foremost to apologise to the Members of this House as I will not be able to be present at this evening's sitting."
"I have to say that I have been waiting since 11.30 this morning for us to debate the Scapagnini report, but unfortunately there has been a great deal of delay, and I can understand why, over the important issue of the budget."
"However, this does not allow me to stay here until this evening, given the fact that tomorrow morning the Energy Charter meeting is being held in Brussels and we have high hopes that tomorrow the 30 sanctions of the Energy Charter will be tabled with a view to putting it into effect."
"As you can understand, by your leave and with the backing of Parliament, the European Commission must be present at this great event for the inception of the Energy Charter."
"Returning to the issue at hand, Mr President, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Scapagnini, for his clear and constructive report."
"The Commission agrees in principle with the proposed resolution which adopts many of the findings of the Commission communication."
"The energy situation which prevails today both in the European Union and in the rest of the world demands well supported and coordinated actions."
"For this reason it is important that we fully understand the challenges that confront us."
"The chief aim of the Commission Communication is to describe the enormous challenges facing the energy sector and the actions that have been taken at a European level."
"Our objective is simple and unequivocal - to improve transparency."
"Moreover, the Commission Communication was the first stage in the setting up of a framework programme for energy policy, a framework programme for respective actions at a European level."
"In his report Mr Scapagnini demonstrated that the European Parliament is fully aware of the situation and is ready to support the Commission in this regard."
"On behalf of the European Commission I would therefore like to thank you for your positive stance and for your support."
"In this communication the Commission underlines three important issues faced by the energy sector:"
"The first is the issue of the security of supply."
"All kinds of analyses, all forecasts lead to the certain conclusion that energy dependency on external supply will increase significantly."
"The Community must consider this fact and, in consequence, must take the necessary action."
"Secondly, the energy sector plays a leading role in efforts to improve the competitiveness of Europe."
"Efficient and profitable energy systems can make a major contribution to the improvement of competitiveness by ensuring appropriate production and transportation structures, while at the same time ensuring the free circulation of energy products."
"Finally, the energy sector is of vital importance with respect to the protection of the environment."
"In all energy policies, in all energy actions, the objective of continuous evolution must be observed."
"Today, following the Kyoto Summit, the issue of greenhouse gases is of particular importance."
"There are a number of environmental objectives which must be reflected fully in our energy policy."
"The resolution that we are proposing demonstrates that the European Parliament concurs with these views."
"Mr President, please allow me to comment specifically on certain important points raised in the resolution:"
"The European Commission shares the view that it is desirable that a chapter on energy be included in the treaty."
"Unfortunately, however, at the recent Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam it was not possible to reach an agreement on such a chapter."
"It appears that at that time this issue was not yet ripe enough to form the subject of an agreement of the Member States."
"Notwithstanding, the Commission will continue to introduce recommendations aimed at making the European Union energy policy more cohesive, through the use, as and when indicated, of the legal bases in force today."
"With regard to regenerative energy sources, the Commission is fully aware of the support for actions in this area."
"As you know, we recently introduced the White Paper on a community strategy and a plan of action for regenerative energy sources."
"Now I await your reactions, your thoughts on the White Paper and subsequently we will have the opportunity to debate this issue extensively in the near future."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Parliament for its support concerning the institution of a framework programme for European Union energy policy."
"As you are aware, this programme was approved by the Commission on 18 November, just one month ago."
"The framework programme comprises all the actions that have been taken so far in the context of the separate programmes, such as Save II, concerning energy output, Altener, concerning regenerative energy sources, and also Synergy, on cooperation with third countries."
"It also provides for specific actions at the level of energy analyses and forecasts in the energy sector concerning nuclear safety and the clean use of coal. All these actions have been coordinated and integrated under the roof of the basic resolution for the framework programme itself."
"The proposal for the framework programme is also aimed at the formation of longterm stable conditions for the incorporation of all kinds of actions at the energy level."
"The framework programme is also necessary for the creation of a clear legal basis for all of these actions."
"It is the view of the Commission that the framework programme will not only create better conditions for coordinating the special actions of the energy policy, but will also provide for a better establishing of targets for actions at the energy level, that is, for those actions which are run on the basis of other community policies such as the structural funds and the programmes of external technical assistance."
"The proposal for the framework programme will be one of the basic priorities of the British Presidency."
"The initial reactions of the Member States have been positive, and I especially count on your support, so that we can come to a timely decision on the framework programme."
"I hope that you will continue to support the serious measures for the implementation of the energy policy, based on the unified philosophy of the present new programme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission concurs to a very great extent with the proposed resolution in the Scapagnini report on the general picture of the energy policy and appropriate actions."
"I would like to finish by once again thanking the rapporteur, Mr Scapagnini, for his excellent report."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Commission (B4-1002/97)."
"However, before we start, Mr Smith has asked for the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, my Question No 76 is on transport of nuclear fuels."
"I, in my innocence, assumed that this question would be answered by the Commissioner responsible for transport but I find it is in 'Other questions' ."
"Can you register my concern at this, Mr President, and can you endeavour to find an explanation as to why this question was not included in the section to be dealt with by the Commissioner responsible for transport?"
"Mr Smith, I will make a note of your concern, but as you know, it is up to the Commission to decide which of the Commissioners respond to the questions which have been raised."
"It is not our responsibility."
"In any case, your comment will be noted not only by me, but will also appear in the verbatim report of proceedings. Your opinions are always valued."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer, which I thought was detailed and good."
"I would also like to say that I appreciate the reports the Commission has made against various countries for breaching the procurement regulation, including the report directed at my own country of Sweden."
"Let me just take up one more question."
"Companies should obviously, as far as possible, report when they do not get their rights according to the procurement regulation."
"We also know that they have difficulty doing that because they can get on the wrong side of prospective clients, important clients."
"Therefore there is an idea that we should set up some kind of procurement ombudsman, i.e. someone who could receive these reports and make a case against the local and government authorities who do not follow the rules."
"Is the Commissioner aware of this?"
"I know that work is being done on this in Eurochambers."
"What is the Commissioner's basic position on this?"
"Thank you for that supplementary question."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that the Commission has actually brought a considerable number of infringement actions against the Member States."
"I would also like to say that many infringement actions derive from notifications given by companies and point out that, within the scope of the broader consultation opened up by the Green Paper on public contracts, that gave rise to a further 300 contributions, one aspect much taken into consideration is that which seems to make the notification of things going wrong more effective."
"Finally, I would remind the author of the question that the company, or the person making the request, can now remain anonymous, if it wishes to do so."
"Mr Monti's replies indeed show that what he and questioner Cars state is and remains a problem."
"There is too much opportunity for escape."
"Public institutions, local authorities, and other authorities putting out to tender - and this also happens frequently in transport - may not take the cheapest option, but then they offer the excuse that the firm chosen was the best."
"Then it turns out, Mr Monti, that it is always national firms who are given preference."
"That is why not only the representative, but in my opinion also the Commissioner, should keep a closer eye on things, so that it is not the national firms only who are awarded contracts, but that instead contracts are spread over the entire Community."
"A report from you on this issue would be very welcome."
"Mr President, this is one of the most important topics for the actual completion of the single market, and it is precisely for that reason that we are giving it the greatest attention, as Parliament will see as soon as the Commission presents the communication on consultation resulting from the Green Paper at the beginning of 1998."
"Mr Wijsenbeek reminds us that, at times, the contracting authorities have the same difficulties."
"From this point of view, the simplification aspects, that are taken into account in the Green Paper as one of the essential factors, have their own significance and I cannot fail to agree with the author of the question when he says that, from the point of view of the single market, it is to be hoped that tender proceedings will result in contracts being awarded to nonnational companies to an ever greater extent."
"This is taking place more and more, although not at the rate we would like, and a whole series of actions, provided for in the Green Paper, on the information, training plan and so on, seek to integrate to an ever greater extent this as yet not completely single public contracts market."
"Mr Commissioner, are you aware that architects experience particular difficulties when it comes to public procurement."
"The architects find it hard to sort out real conditions exactly and that sometimes, even with minor projects, there 400 to 500 enquiries for public tenders, which can lead to problems."
"This is a particular and important aspect of a broader problem and, when it does not relate to large companies or to companies in general, but to professionals or to professional offices, the aspect of comprehensive information is even more important."
"With this objective in mind in the next actions relating to contracts, those which, I repeat once again, appropriately consult the Green Paper, the aspect of electronic information will be taken into consideration and emphasized in particular."
"Just last week we held a very large conference in Brussels with participants from all the Member States on Electronic Procurement, which is a means of providing a better explanation of the information aspects of the substantial contracts market."
"As the author is not present, Question No 26 falls."
"Question No 27 by Veronica Hardstaff (H-0906/97)"
"Subject: The use of E111 forms in Member States"
"Is the Commission aware that EU citizens are experiencing difficulties in some Member States in obtaining medical treatment using the E111 form?"
"Is it permissible for doctors in some countries to refuse to accept a valid E111, claiming it should be renewed every year, when this is no longer the case, and then make a considerable charge for the consultation and medicines?"
"Regulation 1408/71 on the coordination of social security schemes for migrant workers guarantees that a person staying temporarily in a Member State of the European Union or the EEA other than the one where he or she is insured will be entitled to all immediate necessary benefits in kind, that is, to all urgent medical treatment which is necessary with regard to his or her state of health."
"These benefits are provided under the same conditions as for nationals of that state."
"In such a case of temporary stay, the person should obtain an E111 form before departure."
"This form indicates that the person is affiliated to a social security scheme of a Member State, and has to be presented to the sickness insurance institution in the country of stay."
"This institution is reimbursed by the institution of the competent state."
"The E111 form may be valid for a limited period only, or it may have no limitation as regards the period of validity."
"This is a matter for the competent institution in each Member State to determine, according to the objective of the Community rules on social security for migrant workers, which aims to coordinate, not to harmonize, the national rules of social security systems."
"However, it is clear that a valid E111 form cannot be refused by a doctor or an institution of the place of stay; and whenever the Commission has had to deal with cases where European Union citizens experience difficulties in obtaining medical treatment using the form, we have strongly intervened to have the rules respected."
"However it should be emphasized that the E111 form is satisfactorily used by millions of tourists every year."
"Moreover, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there is also a possibility for persons who have had difficulties in using the E111 form to be reimbursed directly by their competent institution."
"In this case, when they are obliged to pay for the emergency medical treatment themselves, they may be reimbursed only after they have returned to the country where they are insured."
"I am quite sure that my constituent's E111 was in a better state than this one, which was issued in 1990."
"However, when he presented it at a hospital in France, the specialist he saw ripped it up and came to a private agreement with him that he should pay a fee, instead of advising him that he should go to the appropriate office to get reimbursement."
"He then got in contact both with the Department of Health and Social Security in Britain, and with myself, and I and my staff also got in touch with the Department of Health and Social Security, which suggested that I should raise it with you to try and ensure that this sort of thing does not happen, and that medical staff in all our Member States are reminded of their duty to advise people who are ill who come to them to go to the office to obtain reimbursement."
"Just very quickly;"
"I very much regret the difficulty your constituent had."
"You did not say whether the constituent was finally reimbursed but you are making the point that we want to see a better system put into place, and I take note of what you say."
"Of course the person did the right thing, he went to his department when he got back to his own country of residence and got reimbursed."
"It should not happen that way."
"There was a fault in the first instance in that the person was not sent to the proper institution."
"But I will certainly look into the possibility of getting better information to all those involved."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply to Mrs Hardstaff."
"But following on from Mrs Hardstaff's question, would the Commissioner care to comment on the fact that the E111 does not appear to cover all medical costs in an emergency situation."
"Some of my constituents have been left with a bill, even after using the E111 form."
"Will the Commissioner therefore be recommending that citizens of the European Union should be taking out additional medical insurance to cover the shortfall on the E111 form as they travel across the European Union?"
"It is an interesting point."
"There are two main possibilities of obtaining medical care outside the state of residence."
"The first is that a person staying temporarily outside the competent Member State is entitled to all necessary medical benefits in kind, using the E111 form."
"Secondly, a person can move to another Member State in order to undergo treatment, but should obtain the prior authorization of the competent sickness institution, that is, form E112, in order to be properly reimbursed."
"The Court of Justice has been asked to determine whether the current rules are compatible with the Treaty provisions on free movement of goods and services."
"We are awaiting the outcome of that judgment."
"When we have it I will be better able to answer Mr Truscott's further point."
"As the author is not present, Question No 28 falls."
"Question No 29 by James Fitzsimons (H-0921/97)"
"Subject: Toy safety"
"Given growing concern about the use of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in children's toys, given that PVC can have chemicals added to it that can be hazardous to children if ingested and that certain Member States have already acted to have toys containing PVC removed from shops, is the Commission prepared to investigate the matter with a view to introducing European-wide rules?"
"I should like to say to Mr Fitzsimons that the Commission is well aware of the issues he has raised."
"The growing concern mentioned by Mr Fitzsimons relates to the use of soft PVC in toys and childcare articles such as teething rings, and not of PVC in general."
"The chemicals referred to are, in particular, some plasticizers."
"They are called phthalates, and are used to make PVC soft."
"The Commission has reacted promptly to the initiatives taken by certain Member States and, in particular, by the Danish authorities in the framework of the Community rapid alert system."
"These initiatives concerned three teethers which are made in China, which brought the issue to the attention of the public and the authorities all over Europe."
"The Danish Environmental Protection Agency alleged that these teethers leached an amount of phthalates judged inadmissible for babies."
"Representatives of the Member States were invited by the Commission to a meeting of the emergencies committee dealing with consumer health in October 1997 to discuss the issue, given its potential implications for consumer health and safety."
"Significant differences concerning test methods and conditions were highlighted and there was a general consensus on the need for harmonized test protocols."
"The urgency of the matter led to the decision to consult the Scientific Committee on Toxicology, which met on 17 November of this year."
"The committee decided to further investigate the issue and a working group on phthalates focusing specifically on toys and childcare articles, composed of prominent academics and researchers, held its first meeting on 8 December 1997."
"It will deliver its findings in the first half of 1998."
"In the meantime research on those substances has been going on with the support of several Commission services."
"Besides the outcome of the working group that I mentioned, the investigation of the matter with a view to introducing European-wide regulation in this field as requested by Mr Fitzsimons is already under way."
"Most of the chemicals involved are amongst the substances identified as priorities by Regulation 793/93 on evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances."
"This means that risk assessments are currently being carried out by the Member States which have been designated as rapporteurs in this case, namely the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, Regulation 793/93 being EEA-relevant."
"The first results of these assessments are expected shortly."
"The results of the investigations will allow the Commission to propose if necessary the appropriate measures to be taken at European level to regulate the use of these substances in toys and in other products as well."
"I thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"I am very pleased that research is being carried out with regard to the concern about toys."
"There is quite considerable concern in the Member States that too often Christmas, which should be a time of joy, is a time of tragedy."
"Only in the last few days the European Consumers Association has issued a statement in this regard."
"Further to what the Commissioner has said, is the Commission aware that several PVC toys have already been taken off the market in Spain, Sweden and Italy?"
"Given this situation, would the Commissioner now ensure that some ground rules are laid down concerning the manufacture and sale of such toys?"
"Would he also ensure that all other Member States remove such toys from their shelves before this Christmas?"
"In reply to Mr Fitzsimons, the Commission is aware of the voluntary withdrawal by toys distributors in several Member States of these particular items."
"For the time being no ban has been implemented by the Member States in general."
"So far as this particular distributor is concerned, they have agreed to voluntarily withdraw from the markets where they have been contested."
"The Commission and the Member States await the outcome and the opinion of the Scientific Committee, before taking the adequate measures to restrict the use of soft PVC in toys."
"What is needed is harmonization of the testing methods, and that is being considered by the working group."
"As soon as the information is available the necessary action will be taken."
"Mr Commissioner, I am having some difficulty with what you are telling us."
"Toy safety is regulated by a guideline from 1988, in which it is stipulated that the Commission shall ensure by 1989 that the appropriate technical standards shall be enacted to guarantee this safety."
"I ask you why it was only two years ago that the Commission applied to the CEN to set legal limits for organic chemical substances and plasticizers, which we are debating now."
"And why, after two years, has this still not been done?"
"There was a misunderstanding here, I feel, because what we are talking about here..."
"Mr Flynn, it is not that I want to give permission to speak."
"But when you can understand the language in which the question is asked, you answer straight away, while I - being no polyglot - am still listening to the skilful work of the interpreters."
"That is why there has to be a short pause between the end of the question and your reply."
"The floor is yours."
"I appreciate your point, Mr President."
"There must be no misunderstanding."
"What we are talking about here is the question about plasticizers in PVC toys."
"As far as the note I have here is concerned, we are talking about the fact that this group has been set up to deal specifically with the complaints that have been received."
"As soon as the opinion has been received the matter will be addressed."
"But the complaints have been dealt with in so far as the importer or the distributor has withdrawn the product, so there is no danger consequently."
"Concerning the Member States where it has been contested, you are quite right, because there are differences in testing procedures."
"It is precisely to do that and to harmonize the testing procedures that the working group is sitting to deal with the matter."
"Mr Flynn, I think Mr Martin wants to put a supplementary question."
"It is very encouraging that the Commission has taken the action it has."
"I wonder if you have gone far enough."
"The fact is that this product can still be legally on the market in 12 of our 15 Member States."
"I understand that you need scientific evidence, but in the United States they would withdraw the product and then, if the scientific evidence proved the product to be safe, allow it back on the market."
"In the meantime we are allowing this product, which there are serious concerns over, to remain on the market."
"I wonder if we should not be taking action now to remove it from the market and then, if the scientific evidence happily proves it to be safe, we can allow it back on the market."
"I am advised that the Commission does not have the legal power to do that under the existing situation and that a standardization is under way, but is not going to be ready before the year 2002."
"Because of what you say and because of the difference in the testing procedures, which cannot be agreed, it is going to take some time."
"I will bring the matter to the attention of the relevant Commissioner and make the point that you have addressed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is now 6.03 p.m. and an act of solidarity with those who have suffered the effects of terrorism is about to start in Hall 5 of IPE II, under the aegis of the European Parliament and at the instigation of the President of this institution, to mark the presence here today of the family of Mr Miguel Angel Blanco, the town councillor murdered by ETA."
"As you can imagine, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to be present at that ceremony, and I am sure you would too."
"However, to be working here today in Parliament is also an expression of solidarity, because the terrorists, who are totalitarian fascists, want to destroy democracy. Therefore, by continuing to work within our democratic institutions we are displaying our solidarity, and also showing the terrorists that though they may murder democrats in such a despicable manner, they cannot kill democracy itself."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Question No 30 by Hugh McMahon (H-0872/97)"
"Subject: Removal of age limits in Commission recruitment"
"I congratulate the Commissioner on his recent announcement on BBC Radio that he intends to remove any reference to age limits in recruitment advertisements for Commission posts."
"This is a most welcome move by the Commission which encompasses the full sense of equal opportunities as adopted in article 6a of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Can the Commissioner say when his proposal will be put to the Commission and become official Commission policy, and whether this will be in time for the next recruitment round in 1998, as he indicated in his radio broadcast?"
"Question No 31 by Bryan Cassidy (H-0875/97)"
