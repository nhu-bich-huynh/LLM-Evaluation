"In the next few days the Council is expected to draft a reply to the letter from the President of the European Parliament, Mr Pöttering, regarding interinstitutional cooperation on human rights dialogue."
"I can assure you that there is great political will to strengthen these relations, at least on the part of the Presidency."
"In conclusion, I welcome the report by Mrs De Keyser and Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on election observation missions."
"Election observation missions are a very important element of European Union policy for fostering democracy."
"They contribute to enhancing democratic dialogue and the democratic election process and help build democratic institutions."
"This year elections have been, and will be, held in many countries."
"The Council has been monitoring them closely and will continue to do so."
"As part of our efforts to strengthen links between the European Parliament and the Council as regards election observation missions, we have already carried out an exchange of views with MEPs who have led observation missions."
"Their reports make a significant contribution to shaping policy in this area and I believe that today's debate will also be useful in this regard."
"I would like to point something out to the Minister, who has expressed amazement that the debates have been delayed."
"This is what happens when speakers take up a greater amount of time than was anticipated."
"As we agreed earlier, the Minister was to speak for 5 minutes."
"He spoke for 10 minutes, so we have a further delay of 5 minutes."
"This is how it happens, with half a minute here and 5 minutes there, and these delays do add up, so let us feel jointly responsible for keeping to schedule."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is of course a great pleasure that I can again participate today in the joint discussion in plenary about two key reports in the field of human rights and democracy: the Cappato report on the EU annual report on human rights and the Salafranca/De Keyser report on election observation missions (EOMs)."
"I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs on their excellent work."
"I also welcome the fact that the two reports on human rights and on election observation are discussed jointly because I think this is a living proof of our shared conviction that human rights and democracy go hand in hand and should not be considered separate."
"Human rights are the foundation of democracy, and democracy is indispensable to protect and promote human rights."
"Let me address the two issues on our agenda today one after the other."
"Obviously I am only giving a general overview here but I am ready, of course, to go into more detail afterwards in the debate."
"Election observation is a success story of European Union foreign policy and thank you, Mrs De Keyser, for what you have said."
"As a result, I think, of consistent, rigorous methodology and independent, impartial long-term observation, the EU ranks among the most credible international observer organisations."
"This was confirmed in recent EU observation missions to delicate election processes such as, for instance, Kenya (that was Mr Lambsdorff), Pakistan (Mr Gahler) and Nepal (Mr Mulder)."
"Upcoming missions include Cambodia and Rwanda, both recovering from a very painful past."
"As in 2007, these missions will be financed in full respect of the agreed budgetary framework."
"The well-established cooperation between the EU EOMs and the European Parliament combines technical expertise with political sensitivity and ensures that the EU speaks with one voice."
"I would therefore again like to congratulate all chief observers so far for their outstanding work."
"In fact, the professionalism of the European Union EOMs has been a top priority for me since the beginning of my term of office, during which there have been chief observers in some 36 countries."
"I agree that EU election observation cannot be a stand-alone policy but must be part of a broader human-rights and democracy-support strategy."
"There is a need for enhancing political and technical follow-up to EU EOMs."
"We all have to play a role and the Commission will use the forthcoming review of the country strategy papers to devise more coherent policy approaches at country level, as suggested in the report, to ensure that our actions in the fields of protection and promotion of human rights, democracy promotion, electoral support and development assistance aiming at improving democratic governance and the rule of law are mutually reinforcing."
"There is certainly room for further improvement of the policy."
"I will continue to do so in close dialogue with Parliament."
"In this context I propose to hold a second joint seminar on election observation in the autumn, building on our successful meeting last year which pointed to the essential issue of follow-up as well as of sustaining the quality of the observation work."
"In these areas we have already taken important steps: EU EOMs are now systematically thought into the electoral cycle and there is an increasing awareness for integrating recommendations of EU EOMs into dialogue with partner countries."
"The two entirely reviewed methodological guidelines which have just been released, as well as the continuous support to training programmes for observers, will help us to sustain the thorough high-quality work by the chief observers and their teams on the ground."
"The second seminar could focus on enhanced visibility for EU EOMs and the political dimension of the election support."
"We can, of course, discuss possible further opening of our missions, as mentioned by Mrs De Keyser."
"So far we already include observers for instance from Switzerland, Canada and Norway."
"I will try to be short on the second part because our Council President has already said a lot."
"This year is an important year for human rights as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 15th anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights."
"I think what we should say is that the past year has been characterised by the pivotal changes seen within the UN human rights systems with the finalisation of the institutional design of the Human Rights Council."
"Now the first round of Universal Periodic Reviews (UPRs) has come to a close and the second round started on 5 May."
"With both some EU Member States and third countries under scrutiny, I think it will be very useful to analyse in a detailed manner whether this key innovation will contribute positively to enhancing the Human Rights Council's effectiveness."
"The relevant EU Council group (COHOM) - this is in Geneva - has started to improve coordination in view of a more coherent EU position in the Human Rights Council and will discuss in detail conclusions to be drawn from the first two rounds."
"I am not going to go into all the details now."
"I think the rest will come up in the debate, and I will then be ready to answer all the questions."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Burma in the wake of the disaster: paddy fields strewn with corpses, homeless survivors, relief organisations unable to enter the country."
"Burma's gas exports earn the country EUR 3 billion each year, yet the regime is now spending just EUR 5 million on emergency aid."
"This is a shocking pittance given that the junta knew about the cyclone but failed to warn the population."
"Burma is an enormous challenge for EU human rights policy."
"Tougher sanctions are the only solution."
"Strengthen visa restrictions, catch those businesses that support the regime, close the EU to all the regime's banking transactions."
"The Council should have taken these steps last week."
"It did not do so."
"Commercial considerations took precedence."
"This kind of critical analysis is totally absent from the EU's Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2007."
"New sanctions against Burma will have to wait, however."
"First the EU must rouse ASEAN countries to provide assistance."
"The Member States themselves must also stand by."
"The Security Council must send Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Burma."
"Burma's borders must be opened."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is often concerned about human rights violations outside our territory and fails to realise that our policies contribute to the systematic violation of rights outside the EU."
"This is why we believe that the mandate of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency should also cover countries which have concluded stabilisation or association agreements, or even to countries which have concluded readmission agreements with the EU."
"We believe that this is important for migrants and for asylum-seekers, who are often expelled from our countries and sent to places where individual freedoms and fundamental rights are not guaranteed."
"We should also mention the country which currently holds the EU Presidency, Slovenia, where citizens without records and therefore without citizenship are sent to countries such as Kosovo or Serbia, with no guarantees for their safety."
"We are also concerned because in the fight against terrorism, international cooperation has reduced the level of protection of fundamental freedoms."
"It is for this reason that the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on this report demands that all measures provided by Parliament be implemented, particularly with regard to CIA flights and the illegal detention of suspected terrorists."
"I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members whose joint efforts have facilitated the preparation of the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2007 and the EU policy."
"Many thanks Mr Cappato."
"Our cooperation has been productive and pleasant."
"Our resolution highlights human rights as the main priority and value."
"My political family, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has always considered human rights to be an issue of the utmost importance."
"At the top of our agenda are the abolition of the death penalty, the unacceptability of torture, the rights of women and children and the fight against discrimination."
"The EPP-ED Group has always given a great deal of attention to human rights in such countries as China, Russia and Iran, and not without reason, as the human rights situation in these countries gives cause for great concern."
"It is widely known that the EU has developed and implemented many measures relating to the protection of human rights and the spread of democracy."
"These include political dialogue, démarches and financial instruments - European instruments for protecting democracy and human rights, the framework, the work of multinational forums."
"Therefore, one of the aims of our resolution is to assess the efficiency of EU policy and the measures currently being implemented along with their results and to suggest ways of improving these measures while making them more consistent and ensuring that they are transparent and visible."
"It is important to point out the fact that relations between the EU and the UN institutions in the sphere of the protection of human rights have yielded brilliant results; therefore, future efforts in this sphere are essential."
"Frankly speaking, because of our different beliefs, experience and culture in the European Parliament we tend to differ in our assessment of certain issues and problems, such as sexual and reproductive health."
"In dealing with such controversial issues the most accurate standard is that of human rights, particularly the rights of children and women."
"Therefore, paedophilia (attempts have been made to disguise this under the term 'sexual health') should not be tolerated, whatever we call it."
"I have to mention the importance of the role of civil society, as without civil society, without the active participation of NGOs, politicians' efforts would often fail to yield results."
"Defenders of human rights, regardless of the country they are from - Oswaldo Payá and the Ladies in White from Cuba, Yuri Bandazhevsky from Belarus, Salih Mahmoud Osman from Sudan and hundreds of others - deserve our respect and increased support."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Mr President, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Marco Cappato for his balanced and thorough report, and for his great openness and willingness to cooperate."
"It is particularly important that, on the recommendation of the Socialists, economic and social rights have been given greater emphasis in the report."
"If, regardless of our party politics as members of the European People's Party, Liberals, Greens, or Socialists, we are proud of a Social Europe, then it is very important that we should require others - quite rightly - to respect social rights."
"In the case of China and Russia, for example, many hundreds of millions of village dwellers have no social insurance, no access to basic medical and health care, and no pension."
"These things, I believe, are a fundamental human right and much more attention should be given to this issue in future."
"We are very proud that your report calls for enhanced cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe in the field of minority rights."
"On the basis of the Copenhagen criteria, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages are, after all, key documents for both the European Union and the European Council."
"At the same time, however, we consider it a major problem that there is no separate report, or even a separate paragraph, on national minorities, since we - and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner over there - will be overseeing Kosovo, and we will be determining what happens as regards minority rights."
"In our report, meanwhile, there is no mention of anything other than China and Russia."
"In future it would therefore be good if the human rights report were to contain a separate section on ethnic minorities, on the Roma and on migrants, in other words on the new minorities. Thank you for your attention."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (PL) I would like to concentrate for a moment on the link between human rights and democracy."
"It is generally felt that these rights can be fully observed only in a democracy."
"Democracy is in turn identified with majority governments that come into being through an election mechanism."
"This was Greek democracy, where the majority decided on everything."
"Through this system of majority voting, though, Socrates was condemned to death."
"Therefore, the will of the majority cannot always serve as a guarantee of citizens' rights."
"This is why in the 19th century a fear arose in political thought - one that is poorly understood today - a fear of extending voting rights to broader social groups, which is linked to the assumption that only an enlightened minority is in a position to respect human rights and freedoms."
"Today we often run up against situations in which quite respectable elections lead to dictatorial governments, or support such governments."
"Just think of countries like Belarus, or the Hamas governments in the Gaza Strip."
"It is also worth recalling the famous response by President Mubarak of Egypt, who, when called upon to hold fair elections, said that they would result in governments in Egypt being taken over by radical fundamentalist Islamic groups."
"Clearly elections are something of untold value, and that is why they also need monitoring."
"Who knows, however, whether a rule-of-law government and a genuinely independent judiciary might not be more important than elections in many countries these days."
"Otherwise we could have a democracy that is no more than a dictatorship propped up by an election mandate - a dictatorship in which there are no independent institutions to create a complex system of balances and securities to protect citizens from arbitrary action by the authorities."
"Democracy must be liberal democracy, not dictatorship by the majority."
"We should therefore maintain the practice of observing elections, but we must not limit ourselves to such actions in the fight to establish an authentic liberal democracy."
"This means that more attention needs to be devoted to establishing a democratic culture and the institutions of a civil society."
"Such actions cannot count on support from autocratic authorities."
"Better assistance mechanisms therefore need to be developed, mechanisms that are even more flexible than those we already have, and the scope of our support must be broadened by providing assistance to those courageous individuals who are subjected to various repressions on account of their activities."
"(PL) Mr President, I believe that the only explanation for the lack of adequate words on the subject of religious freedom in the world in the report on human rights can be the prejudices of the left, and also, perhaps, of the rapporteur."
"Freedom to profess and practise a religion is one of the most important elements of human rights."
"It has been confirmed in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in Article 16 of the OSCE Final Document and Article 9 of the European Convention."
"This is a freedom that has been violated on a large scale."
"Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world and may not practice their faith freely in China, Saudi Arabia or Iran."
"In Iraq, Assyrian Christians, who have inhabited that land for centuries, have had to flee from their homes."
"In Russia the work of religious communities that do not belong to the Russian Orthodox Church is becoming increasingly difficult."
"We shall not, unfortunately, learn about this from Mr Cappato's report."
"Such censorship is a direct route towards the loss of what constitutes the only force in the system of protection of human rights: the route to a loss of credibility."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the reports put forward are very precise and well documented."
"They give a convincing indication, I believe, of Parliament's current ability to evaluate EU policy on human rights and democracy."
"Guidelines, dialogues and consultations, action plans, the human rights clause, election observation missions: these instruments are evaluated thoroughly and the progress that still needs to be made is also clearly identified, whether it is by devising human rights strategies for each country or precise indicators to evaluate situations, or asking Parliament to initiate appropriate measures for the implementation of the human rights clause."
"These objectives are, I believe, well known both to the Commission and to the Council, and will remain on the agenda for our discussions."
"Specific demands are also addressed to the Member States."
"In particular, we deplore the fact that a large number of international conventions and additional protocols have still not been ratified by many of them: the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families; the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture; the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; and other instruments, such as ILO Convention 169."
"Ratifying them would honour the Member States and the EU as a whole."
"There are also some even more difficult, and recurrent, issues that the international situation unfailingly places at the forefront of our concerns: issues concerning a comprehensive, integrated approach to human rights in all EU policies."
"Yes, the asylum and immigration policy being pursued by the EU and the Member States leads to massive human rights violations, particularly at our external borders."
"Yes, large European companies turn a blind eye to direct attacks on employment law or the right to a healthy environment, or are even the cause of them."
"The EU should be moving towards a legislative framework that fosters compatibility in its activities and respect for human rights."
"Yes, the food crisis calls our agricultural and energy policies into question."
"Yes, once again, the impact of climate change on human rights is obvious."
"The rights to life, health, housing and food are at the top of the list of violations."
"Our ambition is a comprehensive, integrated policy."
"Work on implementing the Treaty of Lisbon has begun."
"It will mark an additional step in our commitment to human rights."
"This commitment needs to be guaranteed by more substantial and coherent organisation and resources when it comes to human rights."
"The European External Action Service should, for example, include a centre focusing on the cross-cutting nature of human rights."
"The European Parliament itself should take the plunge."
"A fully functional parliamentary body is highly desirable for this purpose."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, advocating and defending human rights today risk becoming hollow gestures, especially if statements of principle do not follow specific events."
"For some time the European Union has pretended to be helpless against regimes that violate human rights, interested only in the advancement of trade and economic relations."
"The Commission is increasingly undermined by the Council and the Member States in its strategies for promoting human rights throughout the world."
"For some time we have been witness to a conscious renationalisation of competences as regards the promotion of fundamental rights."
"Never before has the Commission been so weak in terms of proposals on human rights and democracy throughout the world, as demonstrated, for example, by the refusal to deploy the democracy clause that Parliament voted on two years ago."
"Human rights are once again at the mercy of economic or military control, as evidenced by the 'war on terror' of the Bush administration."
"For this reason, it is important that the European Parliament continues to play a galvanising role in this area, for example with reports like the one by Mr Cappato."
"Of course, this report focuses exclusively on one aspect of human rights, an aspect that I would call 'individualistic'."
"Mr Cappato himself voted against our amendments, which sought to demonstrate how the promotion of human development and social, economic and cultural rights, as defined by the UN, are a prerequisite for the enjoyment of individual rights."
"It is these very concepts of interdependence and indivisibility of rights that define this idea."
"Yet again, the rapporteur has resorted to drawing up a blacklist of countries in which the usual suspects are attacked and the most powerful evade criticism."
"With these amendments, we tried for example to throw a spotlight on the fact that Turkey is guilty of a policy of wiping out the cultural, political and social identity of the Kurds."
"This repression affects millions of people, but nothing has been done."
"In my opinion, the Kurdish question is the key to the future of a democratic Europe, all this together with general and generic formulations about human rights, which smack of double standards."
"This is why our group decided to abstain in the final vote."
"If anyone was waiting for the speech by Mr Georgiou of the Independence and Democracy Group, they are in for a disappointment, as he is not in the Chamber."
"(NL) Thank you, Mr President."
"I think that, whilst a number of aspects of the voluminous Cappato report are open to criticism, the report, to its credit, places discrimination against minority religions in a number of third countries expressly on the agenda - something that was much needed."
"We should simply have the courage to state a few things more clearly and, without beating about the bush, to denounce first and foremost the fanatical totalitarianism of Islamic states."
"The fact is that, whereas in Europe Islam is recognised and treated as a religion of equal standing and Muslims are of course recognised and treated as equal citizens, and in my country Islam is recognised and subsidised by the government, in the Islamic world, Christians and non-believers are openly regarded as second-class citizens and discriminated against as a result."
"To give just one example, in supposedly 'modern' Algeria, a five-year prison sentence and sky-high fines are envisaged for anyone attempting to convert a Muslim."
"In other Islamic countries, too, discrimination and oppression of non-Islamic minorities is simply official policy."
"Consequently, it is time for firm European action."
"I note that, whereas the Organisation of the Islamic Conference is constantly talking about the discrimination against Muslims that is supposedly taking place here and there, the European Union is utterly silent about the most unreasonable, systematic, officially organised persecution of adherents of other faiths in Muslim countries."
"This tends to give the impression that the official human rights dialogues and clauses have become just a kind of moral wrapping paper."
"Mind you, how credible can the European Union be if it itself opens the door wide to a country such as Turkey, where it is a known fact that torture is carried out on a massive scale by police?"
"What lessons can the European Union give about freedom of expression and freedom of the press when it itself has for years been secretly and openly conducting accession negotiations with a country such as Turkey, described by Reporters Without Borders as one of the worst violators of freedom of expression?"
"Also, what lessons can the Union give about freedom of religion when it embraces a country such as Turkey, which has massacred or driven out all its former minority religions and openly discriminates against the few that remain?"
"If, however, we look past the official rhetoric and the official declarations and clauses, we often see a European human rights policy of double standards, and an enormous gulf between word and deed."
"Incidentally, a perfect symbol of this equivocal European policy is the present European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Louis Michel."
"When he was still Belgian Foreign Minister, he appeared as a kind of global conscience with his European cordon sanitaire against Austria, whilst soft-soaping the villainous dictator Fidel Castro."
"A few months ago this European Commissioner once more advocated a massive improvement in relations with Cuba, even though all human rights organisations affirm that the Cuban state apparatus is lastingly geared towards curtailing the rights and freedoms of Cubans."
"Such people, such European Commissioners, are ill-suited to carry out human rights policy."
"A further consideration is that one thing totally absent from this report is an urgently needed plea for the restoration of the right to freedom of expression in a number of our own European countries, including Belgium."
"In Belgium, the opposition party is conspicuously besieged with submissions and proceedings, and numerous acts have been tightened up in order to render freedom of expression on the immigration problem impossible."
"It is time we had the courage to see the plank in our own eye."
"- (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that elections are observed by recognised institutions improves the election atmosphere and sometimes even helps to crystallise significant changes, as happened, for example, during the Orange Revolution in Kiev."
"Observation is obviously a costly undertaking, but one that is justified, since on the one hand it teaches democracy, and on the other hand it helps us to appreciate the political awareness and soul of a given nation."
"I have a few suggestions on how missions can be made effective without undue cost."
"Firstly, we should send people who know the local language."
"If this is not feasible, the group of observers could be put together in such a way that a single language (French or English) is used, into which translations are made, and which in turn means taking along interpreters to translate into that particular language."
"As far as possible, it would be worth recruiting volunteers from other countries, such as students or members of non-governmental and student organisations."
"Why?"
"The more observers there are, the better things will go."
"Even though we sometimes hear ironic comments, in Africa for example, that they do not need any more colonists, it turns out that contact and interaction with electors leads to their recognition of the mission and, at the same time, of that form of democratic support."
"Where human rights are concerned, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are for our part taking steps to ensure that people living in particularly vulnerable areas of the globe are aware of their rights and are able to fight for them."
"Constant education is needed for this."
"There is no other way out."
"I shall finish by saying that without fundamental human values and rights, democracy may be a defective solution, if not a caricature of how to govern."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the debate that is taking place today concerns one of the most important matters that the European Union, and certainly the European Parliament, is engaged in: observance of human rights in the world, and monitoring the current state of global democracy."
"The two reports seem to me to represent a very significant achievement by the European Parliament."
"I would like to record my congratulations to Mr Cappato and to Mrs De Keyser and Mr Salafranca on drawing up these reports."
"In such situations we are always faced with the following dilemma: how can we defend human rights, speak about the principles of law that we wish to demonstrate in other regions of the world, and at the same time conduct an effective EU policy?"
"This is the basis of the art of EU policy today: balancing these two principles, demonstrating the vista of human rights and, at the same time, the effectiveness of our policy."
"This is the stark issue facing us today in Burma, in China, in the Caucasus, and in very many regions of the world."
"It seems to me that the two reports make a very good attempt to balance these two challenges facing the European Union."
"One more matter: I would like to use this debate to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for her answer in the matter of observing human rights in Mongolia."
"My information turned out to be correct."
"Mongolia may be an example of a country in which we really are dealing with a positive trend in the field of human rights."
"Mongolia may be an example of how the situation may change for the better in this respect."
"It is a very important Asian country, which the European Union may in future point to as an example for other Central Asian countries."
"Mr President, election observation missions are a central and vital element of EU support for human rights, democratisation and good governance."
"I would like to speak with particular reference to observation missions in Africa because there is a special partnership between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"Often the observation mission takes place within a framework of development support under the Cotonou Agreement."
"For the elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2006, for instance, there was substantial technical support for the election registration process, and election observation missions should also come in a framework of support after the election, as Mrs De Keyser's report emphasises."
"There is a huge need for practical, technical help after elections - for example, for training of civil servants and for peer-to-peer exchanges with other parliamentarians."
"Newly elected parliaments need support so that they can strengthen their own capacity to hold their executives to account."
"There also needs to be a political follow-up to the elections, most obviously on the recommendations of the observation mission, which should be followed up before the next round of elections."
"I have a few other points."
"Yes, the election observation mission has a very special place in that it is independent and ring-fenced from the rest of the process."
"It is not the Commission; it is different from external relations; and, while it is true that the observation mission should talk to the local Commission delegation, to the ambassadors of the Member States and also to other observation missions, it is not answerable to any of them and its independence is its strength."
"While I agree with liaison and coordination, I do not think we should have joint missions with other bodies because that is liable to compromise the very important independence of the EU observation mission."
"I notice the wish to expand observation missions and make them more active in the southern Mediterranean."
"I can understand that, but it should not be at the expense of missions in emerging democracies in Asia, Latin America and especially Africa."
"As various people have said, missions do not come cheap, so, if we are going to have extra missions, we are going to need extra budget."
"(ES) Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Cappato, both on the work done and on the result."
"In fact, I would like to extend these congratulations to the whole of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, because I think that this report shows that for some time now the Subcommittee has come of age, with everything that that implies."
"With regard to the report, there are, however, some aspects that we would like to take up again, and we would ask that we all make a final effort for them to be acknowledged."
"Firstly, it should be recognised and recalled once again that human rights are universal and indivisible, which is not explicitly stated in the text and we would like it to be, therefore we have tabled an amendment in this regard."
"Secondly, it would also be good for us to agree that, in future, every EU special envoy should have a clear mandate in relation to human rights and, in particular, in relation to ensuring that the human rights guidelines are respected."
"Thirdly, in relation to these guidelines, I think that is it important to remember something else: although women's rights are, by definition, human rights, we understand that the specific elements that often accompany certain violations of those rights, from a gender perspective, mean that it is highly recommendable for some new guidelines to be adopted as soon as possible relating specifically to women's rights."
"Finally, although it is true that there are many specific cases that we should mention here, which we cannot do due to lack of space and time, I do at least want to take advantage of this debate to once again put on the table the violation of human rights that is taking place in the Western Sahara at the hands of the Moroccan authorities, as it is a clear case of incomplete or badly completed decolonisation."
"Therefore, Spain, and, by extension, the European Union, has an obligation not to hold back on this issue, especially as the UN Human Rights Council has once again called for the conflict to be resolved through a fair and lasting solution that is in accordance with international law, and we all know that, above all, this means that the right to self-determination should be applied."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Cappato and the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"However, I am not going to talk about this report."
"I hope that the Subcommittee on Human Rights becomes a full committee, rather than a subcommittee."
"I would also like to thank Mrs De Keyser and Mr Salafranca for their detailed and stimulating report."
"However, I regret that the report was not drafted jointly by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development, in view of the fact that the chairmen of these two committees jointly chair the European Parliament's election observation group."
"I would like to thank the Commission, and particularly Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, for the commitment and determination shown in developing the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights to help promote human rights through election observation, in the knowledge that democracy and human rights need not only free and fair elections, but development and a strategy for combating poverty."
"I only have a minute, so I would like to underline the need for greater coherence for the post-election period."
"For example, take the case of Palestine. I believe that this coherence, as well as continuity in following up reports and policies supporting national parliaments, are vital if the EIDHR is to be credible."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner's proposal for a second joint seminar on election observation is also important, particularly if we succeed in involving civil society and local election observers, who would be a vital channel of communication for us."
"- (SV) Mr President, the EU is a union of values which has its basis in a common agreement to respect human rights."
"When these are not respected within the Union or in the area close to the EU, the EU should act."
"However, it is unfortunate that this Parliament is attempting to use human rights to advance its own position within the field of foreign policy at the expense of the Member States' competence."
"We must not forget the fact that several of our own Member States do not always respect human rights, for example in the case of GLBT rights, when in our zeal we self-righteously beat our chests and criticise the policies of third countries."
"Mr President, I must ask, is this debate just an annual ritual to preen our human rights conscience, or are we serious in the EU about forcing real change by countries who are serial abusers?"
"Yes, the EU protests, but is our action measured in inverse proportion to the trading importance of those we target?"
"Take India and China."
"Both countries we are wooing for trade."
"Just how serious are we in pushing the human rights agenda with them?"
"Why do our trade agreements not have real human rights teeth?"
"Is the truth that trade matters more to the EU than repression?"
"I look at India, with its caste-based discrimination, its appalling record on bonded labour and sex trafficking, and widespread religious freedom abuses."
"And then I discover that all we have is an ad hoc dialogue with India and the absence of meaningful engagement on human rights issues."
"Little wonder things are not improving."
"I must also say that sometimes our focus is skewed."
"When it comes to development aid, the EU presses hard on a rights agenda, including promotion of abortion, even where it offends the local culture - as in Kenya, where EU-funded NGOs use the money for funding abortions in breach of local custom and law."
"Should our focus not be on fundamental rights and our development money better used to help in food and water provision, rather than in peddling our own agenda, even under the guise of a health policy?"
"Mr President, I think this is the right day to reflect on the importance of elections and observation missions."
"This very morning we have heard another set of results from the USA."
"There I think the election has been going on for ages, and we still do not know who the Democratic candidate for the Presidential elections is."
"I think it will be Obama, but they will not ask me."
"While this thing has been going on for months in the USA, there were elections in Russia, and today Mr Putin, I should say, handed over the Presidency to Mr Medvedev."
"I should say that Mr Medvedev was inaugurated, but that would not really be the right description, because when Mr Medvedev was campaigning, he took one single day for his campaign - that is what the Kremlin press communiqué said."
"It even specified that this day was unpaid."
"How can you run an election campaign if you do it in one day?"
"You can do it when you know that you are going to get 17 times more TV coverage than all the other three candidates put together."
"So that is the sad score in Russia."
"The Russian people deserve more."
"This is not Kremlin-bashing."
"We have to speak out for the Russian people and for those people in any other country where people do not yet have a democracy in the way we understand it."
"Are these observation missions important?"
"Yes, they are very important, because they are all about democracy building, which is our foremost mission in this House."
"Mr Salafranca and Mrs De Keyser have produced a very good report, but we simply have to pursue this issue."
"The EU still has to be much stronger."
"We cannot be silent, because we owe it to the people who do not yet have a democracy."
"Mr President, congratulations to an excellent rapporteur, Marco Cappato, on the annual human rights report."
"To explain two of our Socialist amendments: firstly, I do respect his and your position about Gandhi and non-violence and I think it is a very important tradition that you draw our attention to in Parliament."
"But we seek to delete that paragraph simply because it cannot be the only guiding principle of Europe's CFSP."
"Peace-making and peace-keeping sometimes involve military means and are still an honourable and noble part of what we can and must do as Europe to create a more peaceful and successful world."
"Secondly, with regard to our amendment about the UN Human Rights Council, as someone who with subcommittee colleagues regularly goes to Geneva, I share your concerns."
"It has been disappointing to see the polarisation that still exists about the occupied Palestinian territories, the bloc mentality, particularly in the African group, though we have to beware of that ourselves in Europe, too."
"Nevertheless, I think it is very important this year that we continue to support the spirit of UN reform, that we recognise the positive role played by EU Member States in the Human Rights Council and recognise too that the process of peer review is only just beginning and that to do it openly, comprehensively and effectively is the best way we can support that institution."
"Finally, in recital P and paragraph 4 we ask the Commission, together with the Council, to endorse the proposal of a consensus on democracy promotion in the neighbourhood policy, in the Copenhagen Criteria, in our regional strategies in the world."
"We talk about democracy promotion but there is no single European definition of it."
"The idea, in the same way as we had a consensus on development, that we get the Commission, the Member States and Parliament to jointly define and commit ourselves to democracy promotion in the world is a powerful one."
"Mr Solana has supported it and I hope both Council and particularly the Commission go on record as supporting the idea this evening."
"- (LT) Last year's EU report consisted of 104 pages, 4 of which were dedicated to the subject of human rights."
"This year the figures are 216 and 10 accordingly."
"Facts stated in last year's report, such as the development of the Fundamental Rights Agency and Parliament's work in this sphere, were repeated again."
"Nevertheless, the report gives a detailed account of how we Europeans are defending the rights of people worldwide."
"However, not a single word has been said either in the report or in the resolution about the protection of human rights or any cases of breaches within the Union."
"Are there no cases at all in which human rights have been breached in the EU, or if, perhaps, they do occur, do we in fact resolve them fairly and without delay?"
"In my opinion, neither happens to be the case."
"It looks as if it is easier to speak about the sins of others than to admit to our own."
"Are we not aware of the fact that illegal recruitment agencies in London are making slaves of immigrants from Lithuania and Poland?"
"Do we not know that in Paris mass arrests of 'illegal' persons are taking place by order of President Sarkozy?"
"What about the unlawful actions against Romanians in Rome?"
"Of course, the aggrieved can appeal to the court in Strasbourg."
"In several years' time, when cases in that court amount to thousands, justice might be restored."
"However, every day and every hour is of great importance to the people concerned."
"We have been elected to work for our people, represent them and protect their rights."
"Let us turn to face them."
"In Europe every person should be safe."
"Then we would be stronger and in a better position to help others."
"Thank you, Mrs Juknevičienė."
"This is a case of 'looking at the speck in someone else's eye and failing to see the plank in our own eye'."
"- (DA) Mr President, thank you for a superb report on human rights."
"It has one very serious fault, however."
"The world's biggest human rights problem - the discrimination against 260 million casteless Dalits - is mentioned only briefly, and even then only in connection with a list of things that could give rise to discrimination."
"In February last year, we approved a far-reaching decision in this matter, and it is therefore alarming that the amendment proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was rejected by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"We proposed that, together with the UN, the EU should prepare guidelines to combat caste discrimination and raise the problem at summit meetings with the countries concerned."
"Have India and the British Government been at it again, as they were against the decision last year, and have they succeeded this time?"
"The problem exists in many South Asian countries, but I mention India because it is democratic, a fact that was underlined as the most important factor in connection with human rights."
"It is democratic and it even has good laws against caste discrimination."
"However, these laws are continually being violated."
"India's democracy deserves these laws to be respected, and India should become a model for others."
"It is, however, also embarrassing that the EU is turning its face away from the suffering of the Dalits - and so is Parliament!"
"We could say these things last year."
"What has happened, that we cannot say them today?"
"Are things improving for the Dalits?"
"Is the discrimination in the process of disappearing?"
"No, everyone here knows that this is not the case."
"Why, then, should the desperate situation of these people not receive the active attention of the EU?"
"(ES) Mr President, thank you very much."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on 13 April Ennaama Asfari, a human rights defender in the Western Sahara, was arrested in Marrakech."
"Yet another arrest in Morocco."
"I am telling you this, ladies and gentlemen, in order to say that we should not forget that the European Union is responsible for the decolonisation process backed by the United Nations."
"We are responsible, and therefore any human rights report must say that the European Union should be exacting and vigilant and must comply with UN Security Council resolutions."
"Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, we are in a civilisation, in the 21st century, in which the population is getting poorer and hungrier, and there is more disease and more inequality."
"In the last ten years, according to the United Nations, Africa has become poorer."
"I would therefore like to demand, suggest, and ask that it be recognised that human rights means all rights: economic, social, cultural and political rights."
"If we had a scale, we would be very surprised to see the ranking of countries that do not respect human rights."
"I therefore think that we should have much greater awareness and raise all issues of compliance with human rights."
"Mr President, it is important when we discuss elections and observation missions that we look at ourselves under the Lisbon Treaty."
"How many of Europe's half a billion people outside the inner political circle of the Council will elect the President of Europe?"
"None."
"How many of the general public will elect Europe's prime minister, the President of the Commission?"
"Again, none."
"Maybe we will make more progress promoting democracy around the world when the EU itself embraces democracy."
"As Mr Bonde has pointed out this evening, when the President of China asked the future president of Europe when they are speaking about democracy how many votes he was elected by, it will be a very embarrassing moment."
"Mr President, I welcome the excellent report on the European Parliament's role in election observations."
"Election observations in new and developing democracies are rightly seen as a priority of the EU and a demonstration of its commitment to these nations."
"However, I see a further role for our Member States, for our so-called 'mature democracies', and this is leading by example."
"I recall a heated debate in Poland prior to the general election of October 2007."
"The OSCE wanted to deploy a small team of observers."
"This request was initially met with a negative reaction by many politicians who saw this as an affront and insult."
"Not so."
"Observation missions have been deployed to many old European democracies."
"The French presidential election is just one example."
"Ultimately, observers were made welcome in Poland."
"When convincing reluctant emerging or new democracies to allow international observers in, we must show that we ourselves allow others to scrutinise us."
"Our electoral processes are not without problems."
"The British have documented cases of electoral fraud in postal voting and we all face new challenges such as internet voting in future."
"So let us be open to scrutiny, for such openness can only increase our own credibility."
"(CS) Today we are debating two closely connected reports: the annual report on the human rights situation in the world and the report on EU election observation missions."
"Free elections and the right to democracy are fundamental human rights enshrined, inter alia, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and also by the UN Millennium Declaration."
"For these reasons the promotion of democracy is one of the main objectives of EU foreign policy."
"For that support to be effective, we need to strengthen our common foreign and security policy and make the EU election observation missions more efficient."
"I therefore support the recommendations of our rapporteurs."
"I also believe, for example, that the election process, including the pre-election and post-election phases, should be included in the political dialogue with the third countries concerned."
"One objective of an election process, not just the voting but also the pre-election and post-election phases in particular, should also be the consolidation of democratic institutions such as the rule of law, independence of the media and courts, civil society, etc. I am also convinced, based on personal experience of the observation missions, that the European Parliament should and can play a much more effective and significant role in this process."
"To conclude, as a representative of the Czech Republic I would like to say a few words regarding the ratification of the Rome Statute."
"As I did last year, I would like to call on the Members of Parliament and Senators of the Czech Republic to ratify the Rome Statute as soon as possible."
"The fact that the Czech Republic, which will hold the EU presidency in the first half of next year, is the only EU Member State that has not yet ratified it is, in my opinion, an embarrassment to what, unfortunately in this case, is my native country."
"Mr President, I say firstly - and directly to the Commission and the Council - that the EU needs to give serious support to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to implement the indictment of two individuals who have allegedly perpetrated human rights abuses in Darfur, one of them a serving minister in the Sudanese Government."
"The EU response has so far been weak, which, considering that we claim the credit - or much of the credit - for creating the ICC, is pretty shameful."
"We even risk being outflanked by the United States."
"In an interesting speech a fortnight ago, John Bellinger, the chief lawyer in the State Department, said that the US was willing, without changing its ideological position towards the ICC, to give practical support to its work, and he specifically mentioned Darfur."
"So I think we should get our skates on in terms of supporting the ICC over Darfur."
"Talking of the United States, we have a prospect, whoever wins the presidential election, of an end to the abuses - or at least the worst abuses - of the war on terror."
"All the candidates are committed to closing Guantánamo, but the EU has to help by following through on its call for closure and leading an international initiative to resettle detainees who are not going to get a fair trial."
"But along with that - and I agree with those who say that, to be credible in the world, the EU must respect human rights internally - we must have the accountability that still has not been delivered for collusion by European governments with extraordinary rendition - which, translated, means kidnap and torture."
"(PT) That is how things are."
"The death penalty, torture and hunger are barbaric phenomena that persist in this world that we in part govern."
"However, things will only continue in that way if we want them to."
"The Europe of Enlightenment, of values, of dignity, lacks policy coherence."
"The European Parliament and the Council do not always take exactly the same positions in this area, but there is only one way and that is for the European institutions to act coherently in all their internal and external policies."
"We have hopes for the effectiveness of the new External Action Service in the Treaty of Lisbon in the field of human rights."
"However, looking at the world and the examples which give rise to our concern: the United States has the death penalty as does Africa;"
"China not only has Tibet, but also slave labour, torture and summary execution."
"Such examples should lead us to tackle our lack of coherence."
"Europe needs a proactive human rights policy."
"It is important to mobilise civil society, but we must not forget that the fight for rights falls in the first place to the States and their diplomacy."
"The French President was right to say he would not attend the Olympic Games in Beijing."
"Neither should the other EU Heads of State attend."
"The Union is a unity based on values."
"It is not enough for Europe to make statements and resolutions."
"The European Union cannot sell its soul."
"- (PL) Commissioner, in congratulating the three rapporteurs, I would like to place particular emphasis on absolute and unquestioned consideration for the rights of women in all spheres of public life, in social relations and in purely human private relations - not just in theory, but in practice."
"This requires above all the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls."
"That, however, is not enough."
"Let us look at Europe."
"The European Union is preparing a number of resolutions that will call on Member States to give equal treatment to women and men and will then check whether and how these principles are being put into effect."
"I am, however, very curious, Commissioner, about whether the principle of gender mainstreaming will come into play in the European Union's internal structures."
"When new EU institutions are being established, for example, and the four highest posts are being filled - the President of the Union, the Presidents of the Commission and Parliament and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy - will there be a provision that reflects this principle?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, that will be a moment of truth, illustrating whether our true approach to women's rights is actually what we say it is."
"(EL) Mr President, the report we are examining today is the European Parliament's most important expression of policy on human rights throughout the world."
"The challenges are great; the European Parliament can and must act as the guarantor of democracy and human dignity."
"It is important that the EU should present a firm and united position on these issues."
"This is the only way it can help to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of common action."
"We should not have double standards depending on the interests at stake."
"We must include among the principal aims of our policy the abolition of the death penalty and torture, and the protection of children caught up in armed conflicts."
"Protection of human rights must permeate all relations and agreements with third countries."
"No deviation from this or expediency should be tolerated."
"Human rights must be our guiding light in every policy choice we make."
"Let me end by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent and detailed report."
"Mr President, when the EU talks about human rights violations in third countries, in order to be adequately convincing it must itself have a shining record of respect of such rights by all the EU Member States."
"As other speakers said, this is unfortunately not so."
"I will use only one example, which concerns Britain."
"The UK maintains, in violation of international conventions, two colonies in another Member State - Cyprus."
"These two colonies, namely Akrotiri and Dhekelia are inhabited by approximately 10 000 Cypriot civilians who are EU citizens although their homes are on land which Britain, for obvious reasons, has excluded from the EU."
"These people do not have the basic human right of electing their executive authority."
"They are governed by a governor who is a British Army general appointed by the Queen of England, and they do not possess the right of having an elected parliament."
"The laws applicable to these colonies are at the full jurisdiction of the governor."
"In effect, these EU civilians live under a British military dictatorship."
"It is truly shameful that the EP, the Commission and the Council always turn a blind eye to this situation."
"Maybe other Member States have their own dirty linen that they do not want exposed or maybe these institutions do not really believe in the principles of democracy and justice they claim they stand for, or maybe the EU cares for human rights only when it does not concern its own members."
"Maybe whatever."
"One thing is for sure: the continuation of British colonisation in Cyprus brings disrepute and loss of credibility to any EU report on human rights in the world."
"(RO) Mr. President, Madame Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would like to congratulate Mrs. De Kayser and to join those who have spoken here about the connection between human rights, elections and democracy."
"I come from a country, Romania, which has experienced years of totalitarianism and maybe we, those who still remember those times, should emphasize more the importance of organizing democratic, free and correct elections."
"A famous American professor, Larry Diamond, has recently called attention to a worrying phenomenon he calls ""democratic recession”."
"As the recent Freedom House reports also show, the year 2007 was the worst year for world freedom, since the end of the cold war."
"Under these circumstances, I agree that before, during and after the elections, the most important task of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Union's Member States is to draft a joint and global strategy for promoting democracy."
"I support the idea of helping newly-elected parliaments to strengthen and carry out legislative activity as close as possible to the established democratic standards."
"Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize that not every organizational shortcoming is a fraud attempt, but it is essential to establish to what extent the legal framework provides equity and transparency of the electoral process."
"We are now starting the time for speakers to take the floor by 'catching the eye' of the President."
"I would like to say that in today's meeting of the High-Level Group on Gender Equality and Diversity, a Vice-President was highly criticised because it is said that only male MEPs 'catch his eye', and that female MEPs do not 'catch his eye'."
"I would like to say that in this case it is going to be very easy for me because everyone who has asked to 'catch my eye' is female."
"We are not therefore going to be subject to the criticism directed at us barely an hour ago."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, Marco Cappato's report on human rights deserves the highest praise."
"I agree that the European Union must make a big effort to pursue a genuinely consistent, robust policy to promote human rights in the world."
"It is true that the monitoring for human rights protection needs to be more effective."
"I support the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Speaking with a single voice enables us to react to any kind of human rights violation in the world effectively."
"This may mean thousands of human lives being saved."
"I support the proposal to convene a European Conference on Non-Violence in 2009."
"The involvement of MEPs in election observation is extremely important."
"However, MEPs must behave impartially, as stressed by the rapporteurs Mrs De Keyser and Mr Salafranca."
"How can the participation of the European Parliament's groups in the observation of elections and the work of European observation delegations be made more effective without prejudicing either one?"
"We must find the solution together."
"The European Union is dealing with human rights more and more."
"And the world can see that solidarity and protection of fundamental rights is one of our basic principles, without which no country can achieve prosperity."
"(FR) Mr President, thank you for upholding gender equality."
"Personally, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the three reports, but I would also just like to highlight the importance of the observation missions we conduct throughout the world."
"I believe this should be restated: these are particularly positive actions which should really be promoted among our fellow citizens, particularly perhaps in the run-up to elections."
"Can I also just pay tribute to all the observers, because at the end of the day, although as chief observers we are present on the ground, although we also go on observation missions, we do have hundreds of experts - young and not-so-young - throughout the world, who generously go and support democracy in other countries."
"I do not think that we mention this often enough."
"Without this network of observers, we would not have these excellent observation missions."
"I would also like to mention the enthusiasm with which populations welcome these observers, particularly the long-term observers who remain in the country for some time."
"However, I am disappointed that my fellow Members did not support my amendment aimed at increasing the budget, because I think that the more expertise we have in electoral missions, the more the European Union will be in demand."
"It would be a real shame if a lack of resources prevented us from responding to these requests from countries."
"(ET) I asked to take the floor to call for a greater focus on human rights in Afghanistan, a country in which the Member States and the European Union as a whole have made a substantial contribution."
"I visited Afghanistan last week as part of the European Parliament delegation and would like to introduce you to two names."
"Perwiz Kambakhsh, a young journalist who was sentenced to death because he downloaded materials from the Internet on the position of women in Islam."
"His fate is now in the hands of President Karzai."
"The second is that of Malalai Joya, a young, female parliamentarian who, after criticising the power of the warlords in government and parliament, was simply ejected from Parliament."
"She was unlawfully stripped of her rights."
"There is no provision in law to that end."
"Today we are not dealing solely with the fact that she was unable to assert her rights or her mandate in court but also that her life is in danger."
"We met her and she genuinely needs us to help and intervene urgently."
"The European Union as a whole should give further consideration to the kind of Afghanistan we are building, particularly in view of the Paris International Conference where increased assistance to Afghanistan will be debated."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) Unfortunately, the time allocated to the Council representative in this debate has already expired and therefore I will be disciplined and extremely brief."
"Allow me just to congratulate all the rapporteurs for their extremely high-quality and useful reports."
"I would like to thank all those who have taken part in this debate for their views."
"On behalf of the Presidency, I can assure you that we will seek to take them into account as much as possible in carrying out the Council's activities in future."
"Thank you, Minister."
"In reality, in this debate neither the Council nor the Commission have a fixed time, however strange that may seem."
"You have therefore surpassed yourself in your consideration of the time that you had."
"Thank you very much, in any case, for having used it so moderately in this second intervention."
"Now our dear Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, has the floor."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, because I did not speak on human rights issues earlier, I will now try to come up with a few ideas."
"I would like to add something on human rights."
"Human rights dialogues have become an increasingly important component of the EU's activities to promote human rights worldwide."
"In line with the December 2001 Guidelines on Human Rights Dialogues, the European Union has established some 30 dialogues, and others - like, for instance, with Central Asia, Southern Caucasus, South Africa and possibly also some important Latin American partners - are also under consideration."
"Civil society, and notably Human Rights NGOs from the country concerned, are usually involved in the preparation of the meetings."
"We have also had very good, constructive results from some of our neighbourhood partners, and, we have to say, some more mixed results, like the recent dialogue with Russia."
"By the way, Russia was the first country where the Commission and the Council Secretariat had a briefing meeting with a restricted number of MEPs as a follow-up to the Valenciano Report, in order to meet your concerns regarding better coordination and information."
"I hope all parties involved find this beneficial."
"The new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is now also being implemented at full speed, with two calls for proposals for Objective 1 - the difficult countries - and one for human rights defenders under our evaluation by the Commission services."
"Most of the Country-Based Support Schemes (CBSS) have been published and are now under evaluation by our delegations at country level, so I hope that by the summer most of the projects will start on the ground."
"We are also actively integrating human rights and human security into all the relevant issues and policies."
"In the future, the new European security strategy will of course be there and I hope that we can establish a strong, human-centred approach to security, because human security aims exactly at encompassing human rights, security and development concerns."
"Both are there - freedom from fear and freedom from want."
"I would like to specifically draw your attention to a few things."
"Human rights within the European Union have been mentioned by several speakers."
"There has not been a report by the European Parliament since 2004 on this subject."
"Yes, of course it is important to address problems, and we have two key instruments for doing so. One is the Council of Europe and, secondly, we now have a human rights agency, which has just been established in Vienna, to monitor the situation in the Member States and which will prepare yearly reports."
"I also wanted to speak about something which has also mentioned - by a colleague who unfortunately has left - the protection of Christians in third countries."
"The European Union is strongly against discrimination affecting any religious group and our dialogue with third countries takes this up whenever appropriate and we do indeed try to clearly mention it."
"I should also like to say a few words about the election observation missions."
"Many have taken the floor who have already been excellent chief observers."
"I can only re-emphasise the independence of EOMs, the coherence in their policies and among actors and particularly their professionalism."
"This will be the direction in which we would like to continue in the future."
"Concerning women's issues - of course, I am a woman so therefore you can imagine that I always take gender issues very seriously."
"I organised a women's conference - very recently on 6 March - to which we will of course want to have a follow-up."
"There is mainstreaming and gender assessment in all actions."
"In the electoral observation guidelines there is a specific section on women."
"There is an important Security Council resolution, 1325, of the UN on women in conflict which is pushing for monitoring."
"We will soon also publish projects related to women's development."
"I would just like to say that, in the Barroso Commission, in which I myself serve, a third are women."
"I think that it not always quota, but also quality, that should also be important."
"In this context, I would just like to say that in general the Commission promotes a healthy and reproductive life."
"This is important for women's and children's lives."
"This is one of the projects mentioned in Kenya but also of course covers the whole world and I think it is important to mention."
"Another very specific point is the ICC - the International Criminal Court - for which there is strong support from the European Commission."
"We give EUR 4 million in the EIDHR 2008 Framework."
"The ICC clause is in our agreements."
"We have made démarches to have the ICC accepted with partners and there are international courts - if you think about Cambodia and many others - so we are really working very carefully there."
"Let me close by answering Mr Howitt's appeal to subscribe here to democracy promotion, as others also have been doing."
"This is, of course, our bread and butter."
"The Commission is recognised as the key institution in democracy promotion through our EOMs and other election support measures and through substantial support for democracy efforts of third countries and for international organisations like the UN, OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"Please rest assured that we take democracy promotion as seriously as anyone else in the European Union."
"Mr President, I just wanted to ask the Commissioner before she finishes: she mentioned the International Criminal Court and the support the Commission gives, but could she specifically answer my question and tell me what, in detail, the EU is going to do, and in her case the Commission, to enforce the indictments against the people in Sudan?"
"She did not answer that question and I would be grateful..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as I said, we in general, of course, support the International Criminal Court but it is then up to the Criminal Court also to see whom it protects, to what it is going."
"This is, of course, on the agenda of the Criminal Court."
"It is not our agenda."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am answering some Members who are not present, but I would like to clarify something: the report mentions minority rights and religious freedom."
"It does not mention respect for human rights in the EU simply because that does not come the remit of this report."
"However, I believe that we have actually covered this in some ways, because we have not simply listed our criticisms of everyone, we have talked about us, about how we use - for better or for worse - the instruments available, and respect for EU law."
"When we say that human rights clauses are not applied properly, we are talking about ourselves!"
"Therefore, I do not think that the report can be criticised in this way."
"I think Mr Lenarčič spoke at length about the instruments that should be used."
"The advice I would like to give, which is contained in the report, is to talk more about assessing results than about the individual instruments obtained."
"Mr Agnoletto criticised us for not saying enough about the collective dimension of human rights."
"In actual fact, I believe that fundamental human rights are based first and foremost on individual rights."
"Today, even with genocide, the most collective and terrible of crimes, individuals can refer cases to the International Criminal Court and thus protect their individual rights."
"The right to democracy is now a fundamental human right, and this is an important instrument to be used."
"Mainstreaming should, I believe, focus more on respect for human rights in terms of immigration and drug prevention policies."
"I would like to finish by answering Mr Howitt."
"The report does not claim that non-violence is the only means of promoting human rights, but that it is the most appropriate means."
"It argues for non-violence not only as the absence of violence, as pacifism, but as an active campaign of disobedience and sabotage of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships."
"In this sense, we propose that the EU should promote the technologies and techniques of non-violence in human rights and democracy promotion."
"I hope that this paragraph will be saved in tomorrow's vote."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members who have spoken, and say how much the warm words spoken, by Mrs Isler Béguin for example, reflect the enthusiasm of those who have taken part in electoral missions."
"Even though this report may appear to be very much based on consensus, and as has been said in some reports I have read, is of little media interest, involved little internal conflict, little external conflict, and little of anything, it certainly represents a great deal for countries that have young democracies and must hold elections."
"I would like to respond to two of my fellow Members in particular."
"First I would like to give an answer to Mr Onyszkiewicz, who raised a very serious issue: that of the minority."
"I would like to say to him that despite my understanding - and I understand very well that election observation is not yet democracy - I cannot follow him on the path of this philosophy that is really enlightened despotism or revolutionary avant-gardism, where even Condorcet talks about minorities."
"We cannot follow him along that path."
"Obviously democracy is not perfect."
"It would be fantastic if it was."
"It is democracy that allowed Mr Vanhecke to make a vile, islamophobic and racist speech today."
"Mr Vanhecke represents 30% of voters in my country, in the Flanders part."
"Sadly we cannot erase Mr Vanhecke's party and 30% of Flanders."
"Mr Onyszkiewicz - perhaps he is not here any more - we cannot erase the 50% of Palestinians who voted for Hamas."
"Democracy raises questions, and it is these questions that we need to answer."
"When we talk about political follow-up, about the questions that the election observations raise and about the challenges, it is these things we need to tackle."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would also like to thank my fellow Members for their warm words regarding the report that I drew up with Mrs De Keyser on election observation missions, which do not only refer to the election day but also the electoral system, the legal framework, equal opportunities and equal access to the media, to the funding of political parties, the system for resolving disputes, etc., etc."
"However, I think that what is most important, Mr President, is to point out that this report on election observation, like the report that Mr Cappato has drawn up on human rights in the world, do not fulfil an abstract purpose, but rather they have a cause, and that cause is the commitment that we have in the European Union, and in Parliament in particular, to a whole set of values: democracy, freedom, the rule of law and, above all, respect for human rights."
"Mr President, this House is the democratic heartbeat of the European Union, and therefore we always need to express ourselves very clearly and very strongly, sending a clear and very defined message of this total and permanent commitment that we have to the cause of human rights which, as we have heard in this House this evening, do not refer to nor are preached by one region or one continent, but are of a universal, worldwide nature, and we need to start setting an example of this in our own house."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) In 2009, legislative elections will take place in the Republic of Moldova, during which the Parliament will elect the State President."
"The Republic of Moldova is located at the European Union's eastern border and it is necessary for the democratic reforms to get this country closer to the democratic values specific to the EU Member States."
"This should be achieved including through the framework defined by the EU Neighbourhood Policy."
"The mission of observing the elections in the Republic of Moldova is necessary and opportune, but the monitoring should start focusing on the period prior to the future elections, taking into consideration the need to correct the serious infringements of freedom of the press by the Chisinau communist regime, the repeated breaches of judicial independence and the recent amendments to the electoral law by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, dominated by the Communist Party."
"On 10 April 2008, a series of amendments were brought to the electoral law, which seriously infringe the European democratic rules and practice."
"These amendments include: prohibition of electoral blocs, increase of electoral threshold from 4% to 6%, unrealistic and undemocratic electoral threshold in relation to the real political situation in the Republic of Moldova, prohibition for people with dual citizenship to hold public positions, including to become Members of the Parliament etc."
"in writing. - (PL) In the recently signed Treaty of Lisbon, the EU Member States took on a duty to strengthen human rights and freedoms and democratic order in the world."
"This is without doubt the main aim of the EU's foreign policy."
"Meanwhile, the behaviour of President Barroso and other commissioners during their recent visit to the People's Republic of China and their statement that the Tibet issue is an internal matter for China runs starkly counter to the idea that is not only laid down in the Lisbon Treaty, but that we are also trying to put into practice from one day to the next, especially here in the European Parliament - the idea of putting human rights first."
"In the light of this it is difficult to come to terms with the fact that Europe is treating Russia as a democratic partner, forgetting that this is a country whose authorities not only countenance numerous violations of our principal ideas, but also openly mock them."
"Why are we closing our eyes to the unceasing extermination of Chechens and the gagging of the press in that country?"
"Perhaps it is because the EU itself is not without its oversights as far as observing human rights is concerned."
"I regret that the right of parents and children to speak to each other in their chosen language is not respected by the Federal Republic of Germany, as arises from the current practice of courts and youth affairs offices."
"We have to find an answer to the question of what our aim is."
"Are our resolutions and endless debates really supposed to put the world to rights, or are they just a way of masking hypocrisy, so that European politicians can feel good about themselves?"
"in writing. - (FI) Human rights are an important component in the Union's common foreign and security policy."
"Human rights questions are also security policy questions."
"When we endorse human rights we are endorsing security."
"When we endorse human rights around the world, we are also endorsing security in Europe."
"New challenges, such as climate change, desertification and the food shortages that it causes, are threats to human security and human rights."
"Human rights are not just about political rights, but also the right to clean food and water, which is a priority in the everyday lives of people."
"When people's basic circumstances are acceptable it is then that they are also most likely to vote for moderate political leaders and insist on political rights."
"A lasting basis for human rights is made up of the ideals of democracy and freedom, as well as social and economic justice."
"The human rights report mentions Gandhi and the policy of non-violent resistance he represented."
"Human rights and freedom cannot be promoted through war and violence."
"The way forward needs to be in harmony with the values that human rights represent."
"If we promote human rights we promote security."
"Human rights are not merely a tool to achieve other political goals."
"They are a value in themselves."
"Human rights are universal values."
"For that reason, the EU needs to strengthen its human rights policy."
"Human rights are not an island cut off from other areas of policy, as the human rights report, to its credit, demonstrates."
"in writing. - (FI) I wish to thank Mr Cappato for his extensive and comprehensive report, one which rightfully demands from the EU a more consistent policy on human rights and more effective means to monitor its impact."
"The Union still has a long way to go in developing a clear, coherent and more widely influential policy in this area."
"We should not merely support but absolutely insist on respect for human rights both within the EU and in its external relations."
"As Mr Cappato's report emphasises, the rights of women, for example, should be integral to all the EU's human rights dialogues."
"The report deals very satisfactorily with Parliament's crucial role in the EU's human rights policy, for example in the regularly held emergency debates."
"The urgency resolutions that result from these have highlighted serious flaws in policy on individual and wider crises which is a gross violation of human dignity."
"To standardise the debates and improve monitoring, the parliamentary delegations should nevertheless in future incorporate follow-up talks on human rights more systematically in the agenda for visits to those countries."
"Finally, properly targeted financing is fundamentally important if the EU's human rights policy is to work properly and produce results."
"The strength of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) as a financial instrument is that it can be used to target resources directly and speedily at critical situations in difficult circumstances."
"It is important that these funds are also made directly available for the work of local human rights organisations as efficiently as possible."
"New ways of exploiting the financial instrument should be mapped out for countries where the work of NGOs is illegal."
"in writing. - (HU) It is shocking that in developing countries, 82% of people living with a disability still live below the poverty threshold and continue to be subjected to the worst possible human rights abuses, including denial of the right to life, ill-treatment and humiliation."
"The situation of children living with a disability is particularly alarming in this regard."
"The European Union is still a long way off pursuing a uniform and effective policy to protect and promote human rights around the world."
"In order to make it more effective, we need to make significant progress towards ensuring rigorous compliance with existing EU provisions on human rights."
"Owing to current deficiencies in this regard, a great many women may still be subject to negative discrimination in the workplace even today."
"The situation for Romany women is even more difficult, and they suffer discrimination on two counts."
"In this context a European Union Roma Strategy and a coordinating role for the Commission would represent a major step forward."
"I regret that the report does not make reference to European-level reform of the right to freedom of assembly, and I therefore propose this."
"Precise provisions are needed to avoid legal loopholes that can be exploited by the increasingly widespread extremist political groups, while allowing minorities to exercise their rights without interference, in a manner that does not disrupt the peace of the silent majority."
"Precise wording will help to ensure that both those assembling and the forces of law and order will know exactly what activities conflict with the law."
"I believe that regulating among other things spontaneous but peaceful demonstrations about which the authorities have not been given prior notification is both highly timely and necessary."
"The report cynically sets out the EU's imperialist policy."
"It hails the EU as 'defender' of human rights and 'ambassador' of democracy to the world."
"The EU's 'respect' for human rights and democracy has had tragic consequences for the peoples of the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine, which were turned into bloodbaths by the imperialist EU, United States and NATO in the name of human rights."
"The EU uses human rights selectively as a pretext for pressurising and blackmailing countries that, for various reasons, resist its imperialist aspirations, such as Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea, Belarus and Iran."
"The EU, while presenting itself as a global arbiter of human rights, says not a word about Israel's crime of genocide against the Palestinian people or about the massacre of Iraqis by the occupying forces of the imperialist United States and its EU Member State allies."
"The references in the report to poverty, the environment, workers' rights, health and the like are an insult to the peoples who are suffering under imperialist domination and capitalist exploitation."
"The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) is voting against the report."
"It denounces the provocative hypocrisy on the part of the EU as well as its selective use of human rights as a pretext to apply imperialist pressure and even to wage war against peoples."
"in writing. - I congratulate my colleague Marco Cappato on a comprehensive report, pointing out the most burning issues in the field of human rights last year."
"I agree with him fully on the need for a radical intensification of the EU-China human rights dialogue especially in the light of the upcoming Olympics in Beijing."
"It is regrettable that China has not significantly enhanced the situation of human rights in the country after Beijing was granted in 2001 the right to organise the Olympics."
"But this should definitely not be a reason to give up on China."
"As the report states, the Olympics 'constitute an important historic opportunity for the improvement of human rights in China' and therefore we should tirelessly remind the Chinese authorities of the promises they have made."
"But we should avoid making threats that might lead to some greater isolation and restiveness in China, as has happened recently, causing several anti-Western demonstrations in the country."
"We must be careful not to create an opposition to democratic reforms among the Chinese people."
"Instead we should concentrate on creating a dialogue that would give us a chance to present our position while not treating the other party with disdain."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, there is, as you know, a debate going on in Ireland on the Treaty of Lisbon as we have the privilege of voting as an electorate on this Treaty."
"But there is also - and today it intensified - a war of words raging between the agri-business sector and our Commissioner for Trade, Peter Mandelson, and it is with some regret that today that war of words has deepened and it is almost becoming intractable to separating concerns about the world trade talks from the vote on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I personally believe that we can pull back from this situation, but only if people are given the facts."
"What I really want to stress here this evening - and it is mentioned that this House is the heartbeat of democracy and the heartbeat of the European Union - is that we, as elected representatives, must be given the facts by the Commission."
"I have written to the Commissioner."
"I have now waited six weeks for a response."
"I rest my case."
"But the Treaty of Lisbon is important and it is a shame that these two issues have been linked together."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, freedom of speech is the most important feature of democracy."
"It cannot be the subject of any compromise."
"On 2 May, just one day before World Press Freedom Day, the bank account of the Moldovan newspaper 'Jurnal de Chisnau' was frozen by court order."
"This was done on the ground that the journal reported accusations of rape against the State Public Prosecutor."
"I repeat: it reported or gave an overview, it did what the media are supposed to do."
"As a journalist of twenty years' standing and the current Chairwoman of the Moldova delegation I unreservedly condemn this action."
"Several international journalists' organisations have also expressed their concern."
"The court order is nothing more than a new means of violating freedom of speech in Moldova."
"The European Union must continue to provide comprehensive support to Moldova."
"21st century Europe is a Europe of freedom of speech."
"Anything else would mean democracy was in peril."
"We should not sit and wait as things get really bad."
"On the contrary, in the name of democracy we should subject anyone who tramples our most precious values under foot to a verbal onslaught."
"Democracy and freedom of speech are irreplaceable."
"- (LT) From reading the guide to the European Union I still remember it stating that the Member States' solidarity is one of Europe's most significant values, with small countries, i.e. the Benelux countries, being the real driving force behind the EU internal market."
"The interests of each country were considered to be equally important."
"However, today the biggest countries' energy interests have dwarfed all EU values to such an extent that there is a danger that they will remain energy islands forever."
"If Russia cuts off the oil supply to Lithuania, the major Member States together with Russia will put the blame on Lithuania for having made Europe the hostage of the post-Soviet countries' energy interests."
"In other words, the post-Soviet countries are imposing an agenda that is unrepresentative of Russian-EU relations, which is in turn hindering strategic cooperation."
"The EU seems not to have noticed that Gazprom's oil pipeline network has already covered practically the whole of the EU and very soon we will find out who is the master of energy supplies in Europe."
"I would urge the European Commission and the Member States not to start negotiations with Russia until consensus has been reached with all the Member States, both large and small."
"The EU's double standards are a long-standing disgrace."
"(ES) Mr President, yesterday the European Commission published a note in which it says that the special tax called 'special tax on retail sales of certain fuels' does not comply with Community legislation."
"Among other grounds, the Commission considers that the main objective of the tax is to strengthen the autonomy of the regions, giving them the means to generate tax revenue."
"Tomorrow, 8 May, the Advocate General in Luxembourg will give his opinion on the case, which will settle whether the Basque provincial councils or territories have the capacity to legislate."
"As the Commission considers any distortion in tax rates to be State aid, it could be said that the Commission is against any entity other than the State having the capacity to set its own taxation rates."
"I therefore call on Parliament to consider this matter and ask the Commission to change its political line, as it could end up limiting the autonomy that is granted to many territories that are not States."
"Mr President, I am pleased to note the review of the common agricultural policy and the first anti-crisis actions being taken in the food economy sphere."
"The conclusions put forward and the decisions taken are, sadly, woolly and inadequate."
"It needs to be stated quite clearly that, in its present form, the common agricultural policy is leading to a loss of biological security in the European Union and a deepening of the global food crisis."
"Restrictions on agricultural production, orders, prohibitions, quotas and contingents are leading to a further diminution in food reserves, especially in the newly acceded countries."
"Before the start of the process of EU integration, for example, Poland used to produce twice as much food as it does now."
"It would produce a lot more now if it were allowed to."
"The conclusion is very simple: if there is a shortage of food, let us allow those who have the potential to produce it to go ahead and produce, and that means the new Member States."
"(EL) Mr President, more than 30 thousand police with special military units, water cannons and tear gas have set about beating and butchering workers in the streets around Taksim Square in Istanbul and the headquarters of the workers' confederation DISK."
"As a result, there were more than 500 arrests and casualties among the demonstrators."
"We express our solidarity with the working class and all of Turkey's workers in general. We demand an end to persecution for political and trade-union activity."
"The working class has the inalienable right to strike and demonstrate on 1 May."
"On this day we remember the workers who fell in the class struggle, defending and building on their achievements, and eliminating all human exploitation."
"We wish to condemn the unacceptable prohibition and brutal suppression at the hands of the Turkish Government."
"At the same time, we support the right of the trade unions and political parties to organise their May Day gathering in Istanbul's historic Taksim Square where, on 1 May 1977, 34 workers were murdered."
"(HU) Mr President, it is with sincere warmth and the highest regard that I congratulate Chancellor Angela Merkel on being awarded this year's Charlemagne Prize."
"She has made an outstanding contribution to promoting the Lisbon Treaty and facilitating the integration of the new Member States."
"I also welcome the fact that Charlemagne Youth Prizes were awarded this year for the first time."
"I am especially delighted and proud that this first-ever Charlemagne Youth Prize went to Hungary, to a fantastic team of young Hungarians, the Ferenc Rákóczi II Foundation, for their 'Students without Boundaries' project."
"I warmly congratulate the Hungarian team, as well as silver medallists Great Britain and bronze medallists Greece."
"The Hungarian 'Students without Boundaries' project is unique in that it provides an opportunity for young people from Hungarian ethnic minority communities in the participating countries, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine and Serbia, to exchange ideas on education and cultural issues in Europe."
"It is a milestone for such a distinguished European prize to be awarded in recognition of fostering links between segments of an ethnic group living in their home country and those abroad."
"Thank you very much, Mr Tabajdi."
"You will surely be pleased to know that I had the honour of being part of the jury that awarded the Charlemagne Youth Prize."
"I am telling you this so that you will know that we made the right decision."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, believers should know this better than I do, non-believer as I am, but it seems that from 13 to 17 May, Vietnam celebrates an important festival in the Buddhist calendar: Wesak, or the birth of Buddha."
"It seems, certainly as far as we are concerned, that today in Vietnam, the Supreme Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Thich Huyen Quang, who for 26 years has been under house arrest in his monastery, and Thich Quang Do, his deputy, the candidate nominated by many of us, will not even be able to celebrate the rites freely."
"Mr President, over the past 26 years we, like Parliament, have asked for their release 15 times."
"I realise that the time is up, but Europe's time for shame is not up, it has come back, so beware, ladies and gentlemen."
"(PT) The genuine crisis situation affecting vast areas of northern Portugal as the result either of the closure of many small and medium-sized enterprises or the relocation of multinationals or even also because of the very low wages offered, has in recent years forced more than 100 000 workers to move to Spain and other EU countries, in most cases in order to work in construction."
"Frequently, however, those workers ended up in precarious situations, in many cases their jobs came to an end, others found their contracts were not fulfilled and promises made were not honoured, wages were below the legal minimum or working hours were unreasonably long; in short, the companies contracting them generally failed to fulfil their obligations."
"We therefore stress that effective monitoring is urgently required in countries where such situations prevail and that measures need to be taken against such illegal practices as a matter of urgency."
"For example, trade unions have suggested that construction companies that fail to respect workers' rights or fail to meet the requirement to provide monthly information with a full list of workers on their payroll, including those who have relocated, or that fail to fulfil their obligations, should have their licence revoked."
"(RO) Mr. President, on 9 May 2008, we will celebrate fifty one years since the creation of the European Union."
"For all its citizens, this is a good opportunity to look with confidence and commitment toward the future."
"Today, at a European level, we are discussing the agricultural policy reform, the future common energy policy, the expansion of the Trans-European Network in the sectors of transport infrastructures, telecommunications and energy, climate change and the budgetary reform of the Union."
"The Lisbon Treaty has already been ratified by the parliaments of 11 Member States, such as Romania."
"The new Treaty emphasizes the importance of the social market economy, with a high degree of competitiveness for the sustainable development of Europe."
"The functioning of the single market also favours the harmonization of the social systems existent in the Member States."
"The Charter of Fundamental Human Rights, which has legal power, confirms the fundamental rights."
"Starting from common values - social justice, equality and prosperity for everybody - the European socialists aim at building social democracy, a society that excludes nobody and where all citizens have equal chances."
"The essence of the social-democrat approach is the construction of a social Europe."
". - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like my colleague Mr Pannella, I would also like to draw the attention of Members to what is happening in Vietnam, and not just to the matter of the leader of the Unified Buddhist Church, who is over 80 and who has been under house arrest for more than 20 years, but also to the persecution of the Montagnards living in the Central Highlands of Vietnam."
"We receive news from Kok Ksor and the Montagnard Foundation, for example on 28 April when Y-Tao Eban was killed by Vietnamese police and security forces, and on 15 April when two Montaguard Degar children were killed by four Vietnamese police officers."
"This is to ask for support for the letters circulated to all Members addressed to the Vietnamese regime and inviting the international community and European institutions to respond to the situation in Vietnam."
"(PT) In view of Morocco's deplorable and constant attempts to block and create an impasse in the negotiations for the realisation of the inalienable right of the Sarawi people to self-determination, currently being held under the auspices of the UN, I should like to take this opportunity to stress the need for full respect of the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination, which is the only realistic, fair and lasting solution for the conflict, that is, for an end to the shameful colonisation."
"Furthermore, we must insist that international law and UN resolutions are respected, denounce and condemn Morocco's brutal repression in the occupied territories against Sahrawi patriots who are resisting colonisation and fighting for their people's legitimate right to self-determination, denounce the real humanitarian drama being imposed on the Sahrawi people who are obliged to live outside their country in refugee camps and we must call for urgent and appropriate international humanitarian aid."
"Mr President, the cyclone that hit Burma on Saturday brought devastation and suffering to the people of that country."
"Up-to-date reports speak of 22 000 dead, 40 000 missing, hundreds of thousands injured and one million homeless."
"Yet, illogical and cruel as it might seem, international efforts of help have been hampered by the military dictatorship regime of Burma."
"One example is the fact that, four days after the catastrophe struck, visas for foreign aid workers are still not issued in time, with the generals in Burma presenting ridiculously naive excuses which no intelligent person takes seriously."
"Could the President of this House, in addition to his message of sympathy read out earlier on today, send a very stern warning to the junta of Burma and indirectly to their guardians in Beijing telling them to stop frustrating international assistance efforts and start at least trying to behave, if not democratically, at least humanely towards their own people?"
"- (PL) Mr President, people in the European Union are getting older."
"Demographic forecasts paint an alarming picture of a fall in the working population by as many as 20 million by 2030."
"It is not good for us to be in such a situation and we must therefore support an increase, including a natural increase."
"We have problems with infertility and we have problems with sterility."
"The World Health Organisation has recognised infertility as a disease, with the in vitro method being one of the ways of treating it."
"The number of couples for whom fertilisation by this method is their only chance of having offspring is growing year on year."
"This method is expensive, though, and not all countries refund the cost."
"For many couples these costs constitute a barrier that makes it impossible for them to undergo such treatment."
"It is a paradox that alcoholism, lung cancer and AIDS are treated in Europe, yet infertility is not treated in all countries."
"This is why I am drawing attention to this fact, and I would like all EU citizens to have equal chances and a guaranteed opportunity to receive in vitro treatment on a level playing field and on the principle of equality of access to medical services."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this week in the European Parliament we are discussing matters relating to sport, among other things."
"Topical as it is, this issue has taken on a particular complexion in Romania."
"With the final of this year's football championships approaching, there has been enormous pressure over the past few weeks on teams and players who might be able to influence the final outcome of the championship."
"There have been televised disputes, intrigue, brawls, suspended matches, and all because some people have found it inconceivable that a team other than the one from the capital could be the winner."
"In the deciding match, the team from Cluj-Napoca held on to its lead."
"Let us hope that the main problem was not the fact that there are only a few ethnic Romanian players in the Cluj-Napoca team, or that it is owned by a Hungarian."
"The clash between police and fans happened in the same town where Hungarians have been beaten up with almost predictable regularity over the past two months for using their mother tongue."
"All this ties in with the anti-minority sentiments constantly being fomented by extremist politicians."
"In sports and politics alike, we have to get used to the fact that one or two influential or central politicians may try to sway decisions and results, but actual outcomes are determined by concerted teamwork, dedication and fair play. Thank you."
"- (PL) Mr President, during the last plenary session in Parliament we discussed the problem of rising food prices."
"That coincided with a serious discussion concerning a review of the common agricultural policy."
"Today, when we have to face the problem of a food crisis on a world scale, we must ask ourselves where the causes of this state of affairs lie, and where we made mistakes."
"For more than 30 years the EU's food market was reasonably stable, and that led to a certain dulling of our vigilance."
"During this period there was no proper monitoring of the processes that were occurring, and no analysis was made of the link between a rise in food production and overall economic development, between the rising affluence of some societies and increasing demand."
"Rapid economic development such as has taken place in China and in India has in effect led to a rise in consumption, with a consequent significant increase in the food requirement, bearing in mind the number of people."
"Recent times have also seen a rise in production costs, especially fuel and energy prices."
"That concludes this item."
"Trade and Economic Relations with the countries of South East Asia (ASEAN) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Glyn Ford, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade and economic relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, firstly can I thank the Commissioner and his staff, the committee staff, my group staff and my own staff for the work that has gone into this report."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs on behalf of the major political groups who, in a spirit of cooperation, have made this report what it is today."
"I take full responsibility for the report, but all of the above have their political footprints trodden across its pages."
"In some sense we wish that this negotiation between the EU and ASEAN was unnecessary."
"My own committee's priority is very clear: we want a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Round, which unfortunately looks at the moment as if it is being sucked into the black hole of the US presidential selection and election."
"It may hopefully emerge relatively unscathed in six or twelve months' time after the inauguration of President Clinton, McCain or Obama when the US finally has a new trade spokesperson in place to continue the dialogue."
"But in the interim it looks like we will have negotiations with Korea, where my colleague David Martin was Parliament's rapporteur, with ASEAN and with India for bilateral or EU free-trade agreements."
"The Council's mandate to open talks with ASEAN, the EU's fifth-largest trading partner, covered only seven out of the ten members of ASEAN, since ASEAN is an extremely diverse region ranging from economies whose GDPs are equal to those of some nation states of the European Union to three less developed countries, two of whom benefit from the 'anything but arms' provisions and one of whom is the pariah state of Burma, of which we have heard so much talk today."
"It is clear that a free-trade agreement will potentially benefit both sides, increasing the flow of goods and services, and enhance innovation and boost economic growth."
"We welcome the signing of the ASEAN Charter on 20 November last year at the 13th ASEAN Summit in Singapore and look forward to its swift ratification."
"This should help to strengthen economic integration within the ASEAN countries and in my report we call on the Commission to provide technical and other assistance to facilitate the process."
"The negotiations need transparency on public procurement, competition and investment, intellectual property rights and state aids."
"We need to talk about the removal of non-tariff as well as tariff barriers, particularly with respect to banking, insurance and legal services."
"On our side, simplification of the rules of origin is important."
"Harmonisation of standards including product safety, child protection and animal welfare is something else we should be seeking."
"We need to protect against counterfeit pharmaceuticals, but at the same time the committee is concerned that we do not compromise the flexibility of the TRIPS arrangement."
"The Trade Committee believes that an essential part of any agreement must be a sustainable development chapter, including a sustainability impact assessment."
"Plus we need a parallel political cooperation agreement with binding social and environmental clauses committing both sides to the ratification of core ILO conventions, as well as the normal PCA clauses on human rights and democracy."
"Trade and sustainable development fora should be established including employers, employees and civic societies that can actually have an input not only into the negotiations but, more importantly, afterwards on how the agreement is carried out."
"The report suggests that we should consider environmentally friendly and fair trade goods having preferential access to the EU, that the tariff barriers should be taken down more quickly."
"But of course, were that to be implemented, we would require the Commission to modify its customs nomenclature to enable this to happen."
"There are some country-specific issues."
"On Singapore we have concerns about banking secrecy that were made clear when the committee visited and spoke to members of parliament in that country."
"We welcome the restoration of democracy in Thailand."
"And of course we have agreed that Burma should participate in, or at least sit in on, negotiations, though it is absolutely clear from our point of view that until the current regime has gone, there can be no prospect of signing any agreement with Burma."
"Our idea is to have a framework agreement for all that allows individual countries within ASEAN to act on the basis of their own current situation and to open up particular sectors at an appropriate speed for them."
"So eventually - and I emphasise eventually - we will have a common and full agreement with all."
"So while one can only welcome Vietnam's leadership of the process, the institutional architecture, compounded by a lack of drive and will on the part of some ASEAN nations, has made progress slower than anticipated or wanted."
"Let me be clear, the European Union should not allow foot-dragging by individual member states of ASEAN to veto progress."
"If there is no alternative, Council, Commission and Parliament might in the last resort look at the possibility of bilateral rather than multilateral arrangements."
"I hope that government and civil society in ASEAN see Parliament's position here today as an encouragement to move forward, and move forward quickly."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very grateful to Glyn Ford for his report and for the general support it expresses for the Commission's line in its free-trade agreement negotiations with ASEAN countries."
"South-East Asia deserves our full attention."
"Understandably, our focus in Asia is drawn again and again to China, but our partnership with ASEAN should be no less engaged, whether we are dealing with questions of sustainable development, of society or trade."
"That is why ASEAN was selected as a partner for one of our new-generation FTAs in Global Europe."
"The dynamism of the ASEAN economies is certainly an opportunity for Europe."
"However, a lot of that opportunity is still potential rather than real."
"EU businesses trying to trade or invest in South-East Asia still face tariff and non-tariff barriers and markets tilted against foreign service providers, especially in public procurement markets."
"The same is true for foreign direct investment in general."
"They also find that their intellectual property rights are still too poorly protected, and the general transparency of some markets is fairly low."
"This is the strongest possible argument for a free-trade agreement that is deep rather than quick and light."
"I do not believe in FTAs as quick, political fixes."
"The Global Europe trade strategy is about new trading opportunities, new exports and new jobs."
"This negotiation was launched on the basis of evidence that we could achieve those things if we were willing to be ambitious."
"We are right to reject the idea of an FTA covering certain tariffs only."
"I could not agree more with this report's call for ambition, therefore, in this negotiation."
"We have deliberately chosen to base an approach on region-to-region negotiations."
"I think that was the right choice."
"I believe that bilateral agreements can act as building blocks for the multilateral system, where they encourage regional integration and the growth of regional markets."
"I think that we can see this negotiation as a contribution to the ASEAN blueprint for an economic community."
"However, as this report rightly points out, negotiating such an ambitious agenda on a region-to-region basis is not the easiest, nor the fastest, route."
"Every time an ASEAN member country cannot deliver on a specific issue, we are faced with the lowest common denominator outcome."
"That is not fair for the others."
"We are also faced with problems of resources, because the capabilities of the ASEAN states are stretched by the wide number of FTAs they are currently negotiating."
"As a result, it is hard to see the timeframe for a full region-to-region agreement as less than three to four years, and it is difficult to see us achieving a consistent high level of ambition."
"At the same time, of course, our major competitors are cementing their links with individual countries in the region, one after another."
"Japan, Australia and the USA are all active."
"I note the paragraph in the report referring to the option of going bilateral, should the regional approach prove difficult."
"I do not want to give up the regional approach at this stage, but we are in the process of introducing some flexibility in this regional framework - a dose of variable geometry that takes into account the different levels of development within ASEAN and that could allow us to go faster with individual ASEAN countries."
"This would be economically sound and can pave the way for others to join later."
"In fact, our negotiating guidelines provide for a conclusion with fewer than 10 members as the LDCs within ASEAN - Laos, Cambodia and Burma/Myanmar - are not required to take on commitments in the FTA but will be following the negotiating process."
"Laos and Cambodia are currently working on WTO accession questions and, in any event, they benefit already from wide-ranging preferential access to the EU market via the everything-but-arms scheme."
"But they have a logical place, in my view, in the long-term agreement."
"On Burma, the report reflects the position of the EU that, although part of ASEAN, we are not negotiating FTA commitments as such with Burma."
"A final point on sustainable development."
"We hope to include environmental and social aspects in our negotiations with ASEAN, and we will do that in a cooperative spirit."
"In addition we have contracted an external consultant to conduct a sustainable impact assessment to analyse the likely impact of the envisaged agreement on various issues, including environmental and social concerns."
"This study should accompany the negotiating process during the next 18 months."
"Last week we also invited civil society to contribute to our reflections regarding our three ASEAN FTA negotiations."
"We have not noted any real disagreements that they might have with us."
"By building these concerns into the agreements from the start, we can ensure that problems are addressed early, if not before they arise."
"I look forward to working with Parliament as we go forward in these negotiations."
"It goes without saying that I will keep the INTA Committee updated on progress."
"I am very grateful for this report."
"It is of the standard I have come to expect from the INTA Committee and to depend on in its understanding and judgements of complex trade policy issues."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, thanks to the Nuremberg action plan and the first EU-ASEAN Summit held last year, relations were re-launched."
"For example, albeit slowly, as we have been told, a free trade agreement and bilateral association and cooperation agreements are being negotiated."
"In the Committee on Foreign Affairs we supported this stepping up of relations, also at the trade and economic level."
"ASEAN is a process of regional integration that we applaud and it is becoming increasingly relevant."
"It brings together more than 500 million inhabitants of ten countries, which are very diverse - as Mr Ford has said - and in general have great potential for growth."
"The European Union is ASEAN's second largest trading partner."
"We should increase our sales and also the investments made by our businesses, and an ideal instrument is the Free Trade Agreement."
"Other countries within and outside the continent want something similar, as the Commissioner said."
"The agreement should be very broad and not be limited to purely trade questions."
"It should also be accompanied by bilateral association and cooperation agreements that include the question of respect for human rights."
"These bilateral agreements can logically only be signed with the ASEAN countries that fulfil the necessary political and economic conditions, and of course not all the countries fulfil them, especially Burma/Myanmar, whose government is subject to restrictive measures adopted by the Council and supported by Parliament."
"Unless the political circumstances there change, it is clear that there cannot be a bilateral agreement with Burma, nor can Burma be part of the Free Trade Agreement."
"In April Parliament reiterated its rejection of the political situation and demanded the release of political prisoners."
"With regard to Burma, I must take this opportunity to express my condolences for the many victims of the cyclone."
"I echo the remarks of the President of Parliament at the beginning of the afternoon."
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must continue to make progress in its relations with ASEAN."
"We are offering a stronger political association, close economic relations in our mutual interest and cooperation in many spheres."
"Of course we support the step taken in 2007 in the integration process, the 'ASEAN Charter'."
"We want the commitments in this Charter on human rights and democracy to become a reality, especially in Burma and also in other countries in the region."
"On this basis, our relations will be strengthened. Thank you very much."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, Mr Ford's report as a whole is what my committee would have wanted to see."
"We are particularly pleased that all our main points have been incorporated."
"We emphasise that future industrial growth in the European Union is dependent on our openness to foreign trade and investment governed by fair rules, but that our competitiveness with the ASEAN countries is up to us, by improving our own levels of education, training, research, enterprise and innovation."
"We see scientific and technical cooperation and the protection of intellectual property rights as essential elements of a successful relationship."
"We expect, in particular, cooperation in combating counterfeiting."
"We look for improvement in rules of origin; in the harmonisation of standards, of product safety, child protection and animal welfare; in their bureaucratic procedures; in transparency of state aids and non-tariff barriers, and the elimination of discriminatory taxes."
"We expect to see covered the avoidance of environmental damage from deforestation and palm oil extraction and, while recognising the need to keep anti-dumping mechanisms at our disposal, we would much prefer avoiding the need for them by pre-emptive intervention and negotiation."
"We look for concerted actions with ASEAN on the energy front and for the Commission to promote joint research projects with establishments in that region."
"In this spirit, we look forward to a mutually beneficial and successful trade and economic relationship with the ASEAN countries."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, let me begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Ford, rapporteur of this report."
"The proposed trade agreement with ASEAN forms part of a wider strategy of bilateral and interregional negotiations with EU trading partners."
"If considered as a single entity, ASEAN would be the EU's fifth-largest trading partner, ahead of Japan."
"ASEAN is an extremely diverse region with three of its members being LDCs, while others have a higher income per head than many EU Member States."
"I and my colleagues in INTA strongly support the Commission's first option: to negotiate with the region as a whole, to strengthen regional economic integration between the ASEAN countries."
"The report stresses the importance of interregional trade agreements, which can usually supplement the multicultural system - provided they are wide-ranging and ambitious, going well beyond tariff reductions - and implement social and environmental standards."
"The report urges the parties to progressively reduce or dismantle all barriers to trade in goods and services, while fully respecting the differing economic positions within the ASEAN region."
"It also urges the Commission to ensure transparency and effective rules for public procurement - IPRs, state aid and other subsidies."
"In conclusion, let me also thank the rapporteur for his positive collaboration, reflected in some compromise amendments which put the report's main emphasis on trade and trade related issues, alongside topics of human rights and sustainable development."
"Adoption of these and other amendments made the report more balanced."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, firstly, let me add my congratulations to my friend and colleague, Glyn Ford, on what I think is an excellent report."
"I would also like to say to the Commission that I think the Commissioner was absolutely right a few years ago to launch studies into the prospect of a free-trade agreement with ASEAN and to act on those studies."
"Whilst, as others have said, ASEAN is already an important region for us economically, it is one of the regions where there is the greatest potential for growth if we really can achieve our free-trade objectives."
"Like Mr Šťastný, I agree that it was absolutely the right strategy to do this on a regional basis, despite all the complications that come with trying to do it this way."
"Mr Ford's report sends a clear and consistent message to the Commission: that Parliament wants to see a strong sustainable development chapter in all the new generation of free-trade agreements."
"The report has many references to non-trade clauses which I am pleased to say are consistent with the line that I took in my own report on Korea, and in particular I am pleased that the report emphasises strong social and environmental clauses."
"In my opinion it is important not only that the ASEAN members ratify the eight core ILO conventions, which only Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines have so far done, but also that we ensure that we put mechanisms in place to make sure they are properly enforced."
"The role of trade unions and workers' organisations should be more formalised, and I am pleased that the rapporteur has suggested the creation of a trade and sustainable development forum which can monitor standards and report on any violations."
"In terms of environmental standards, the Trade Committee has highlighted in many of its recent reports - for example the Lipietz report on climate change or my own report on Korea - that international trade should facilitate the diffusion of environmentally-friendly technologies, and I again acknowledge the fact that Commissioner Mandelson has on many occasions shown his commitment to reducing tariffs on environmentally-friendly technologies, and I hope the Commissioner can therefore take on board the rapporteur's suggestion to agree to this being part of the ASEAN negotiations."
"Any violations of social and environmental standards must be subject to the standard dispute mechanism."
"Given that the US is committed to this approach for all their FTAs, Europe must achieve similarly strict enforcement measures."
"Finally, let me just conclude by saying that, while I know we will not sign an FTA with Burma, I hope that Burma will not indirectly benefit from this agreement, because any expanded trade with the other ASEAN countries leads to the potential that Burma could expand its trade within the group and indirectly benefit from an EU free-trade agreement."
"So I hope we will look at ways of ensuring that trade sanctions against the current Burmese regime are enforced rigorously."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when we are talking a lot about Asia because of China and the problems we are aware of there, as well as the deadly disaster in Burma, on another level, the report we are discussing this evening essentially constitutes the response of EU citizens represented by Parliament to the Commission communication on the new strategy for the EU's bilateral and interregional trade negotiations."
"It is stating the obvious to say that the Association of South East Asian Nations is a collection of ten countries with particularly diverse levels of development, both politically and economically, as our rapporteur has just said."
"The trade agreement currently under discussion is looking at a market worth EUR 57 billion with 4.9% annual growth, which represents a very important potential for development. Although the EU's trade policy, consisting of a trade agreement between our two regions, seems straightforward, together we need to stimulate growth and job creation, and remain realistic about the difficulties."
"However, although the globalisation of the economy should be seized as an opportunity, our fellow citizens are often very concerned about the economy of our continent, as others are about theirs."
"The negative, marginal effects of globalisation, - too numerous for those who actually have to live with them - often obscure the benefits that should ensue from intelligently negotiated trade agreements."
"This report therefore aims to send strong signals to the European Commission to take the concerns of citizens properly into account, when in negotiations with ASEAN."
"We therefore need to achieve a balance - one that allows our partners to achieve a satisfactory level of economic, social and political development without encouraging distortions of competition and dumping."
"I would just like to highlight three points here that I feel are priorities."
"Firstly, from a strictly commercial point of view, it should be pointed out that any trade agreement has to be reached within the framework of mutual respect for the rules of international trade, which means respect for the rules of competition law and respect for copyright law."
"One example among many is that our negotiations must, in particular, find solutions in the fight against counterfeit pharmaceuticals, for example, while guaranteeing access to healthcare for all citizens in strict compliance with the spirit and procedures of the Doha agreement."
"Secondly, from the point of view of employment rights, the agreements clearly cannot overlook differences in levels of employment rights."
"Our partners must agree to meet the ILO minimum standards, in particular combating child labour and improving working conditions and pay."
"Thirdly and finally, of course it is also very important to point out, as has been done this evening in the various speeches, that any trade agreement must include the necessary requirements as regards the economy and sustainable development."
"Southeast Asia is one of the jewels of our planet, and together we need to protect its flora and fauna."
"The Commission has a duty to secure guarantees regarding illegal forestry operations and the management of fishing quotas, as the Commissioner pointed out just a minute ago."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Ford's report stresses the importance of cooperation between the European Union and the South East Asian Nations as regards trade and economic relations."
"In terms of their area and population numbers, these states are similar to the European Union."
"These countries are a significant sales market for the European Union and they export a range of important products to our market."
"These countries have a variety of political structures and economic potential, as witnessed by GDP figures per head, which in Burma are USD 211, and in Singapore USD 31 400."
"This presents certain problems for ASEAN-EU cooperation, as the rapporteur emphasises."
"Developing trade with states from this area requires harmonisation of standards, especially in the field of safety and public health protection."
"Economic and intellectual relations with ASEAN countries may give rise to an increase in prosperity and peace in the region."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) The report by Mr Ford illustrates the ponderousness of negotiations between the EU and ASEAN - which is not surprising given the particularly heterogeneous nature of the region."
"The interest of European industry - with regard to market access, for example - is great and calls for a faster timetable."
"The question is, therefore, whether the EU should continue with these multilateral negotiations or would be better switching to bilateral negotiations."
"This suggestion is already implied to some degree in Amendment 5 by Mr Ford and Mrs Mann."
"I would invite the Commission, therefore, to give the greatest possible commitment at multilateral level to the successful conclusion of the Doha Round."
"Negotiations can then proceed at bilateral level with the individual ASEAN countries if it turns out that multilateral negotiations are going to take too long."
"Of course, this does not mean that I am declaring my opposition to further regional integration in South East Asia."
"This integration is a matter of great importance."
"I am thinking here of the important role that ASEAN and ASEAN+3 can play in further integrating Myanmar into the region."
"The country, which was hit so hard by Cyclone Nargis last weekend, urgently needs assistance from the region."
"Particularly ASEAN+3, which also includes neighbouring China, must actively work to induce the junta to open the country's doors to the outside world, to better protect human rights and to give the opposition more room for manoeuvre. Thank you."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ford, on his good work and on the final result of his report, which with the contributions of the Committee on International Trade and the other committees has turned out to be a very balanced report."
"I would firstly like to say that the report highlights the major opportunity to deepen our trade and economic relations in this area of potential economic development and population growth, and I would also like to say that it takes into account the enormous disparities between the Member States of the ASEAN block."
"I would like to stress the importance of opening up the services sector, for both parties: it is crucial for the Union but also for ASEAN, which both need to demand more efficient services of higher quality for better prices, thus taking advantage of the EU's competitive advantages and experience."
"With regard to industry, we pointed out in our amendments, which have been incorporated into the report, the dual need to comply with minimum quality and hygiene and health requirements."
"These are demanded of our European industry and they should also be required of the other side in order to curb unfair competition."
"In addition, compliance with international agreements on social, employment and environmental matters; and especially, we would like to stress, the fight against child labour."
"We have drawn attention to the sensitive fish processing industry, because both problems exist there."
"We therefore genuinely fail to understand socialist Amendments 11 and 12, which dilute and reduce what was already adopted in committee, removing from current paragraphs 16 and 17 the specific mention of the tuna sector, which is really affected, of the resulting unfair competition and of the report by the European Parliament itself on this industry, that was and is supported by the European Commission."
"Therefore, for the sake of the consensus that has existed around this whole report, we ask the rapporteur and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to consider this and think about withdrawing Amendments 11 and 12, which our group will not support."
"In short, I think that, if this is done, what we will achieve is keeping the current ones, which are more complete and better than the ones they are seeking to introduce."
"(ES) Mr President, firstly, in response to the tragedy that Burma is experiencing due to the cyclone, I would like to express my sorrow for the victims and call for its authorities to allow the entry of international aid and start a credible process of democratisation that will put an end to the isolation of the country and open up new prospects for its population."
"ASEAN is a region with great economic potential and a similar number of inhabitants to the European Union. It includes 10 very different countries, but this diversity, despite making the negotiations for a free trade agreement more complicated, should not prevent us from achieving instruments that will provide mutual benefits and complement the WTO multilateral system, including from the point of view of a satisfactory conclusion to the Doha Development Agenda, that both parties consider to be a priority."
"The less developed countries in the region should be able to preserve their preferences and even have the opportunity to be included in the agreement in the future."
"Trade and economic relations are part of a broader strategy of consolidating overall relations between the two regions."
"We need to encourage further progress in political and security cooperation."
"In particular, an emphasis has been placed on counter-terrorism and crisis/disaster management."
"We also need to promote collaboration in the energy sector, R&D, the environment, climate change and sustainable development, as well as in the socio-cultural field and development cooperation."
"Cooperation in the field of public health is particularly important, because it should contribute to guaranteeing food hygiene and health conditions, that are essential for consumption and for developing trade."
"In this whole process, the involvement and support of civil society are essential."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ford, on a report which states that human rights and democracy are core EU values and demands that they form part of the negotiations and be included in the partnership and cooperation agreements that should go hand in hand with trade agreements."
"Given that they are going to represent a major step forward for EU-ASEAN relations, we hope that the negotiations will be successful."
"- (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, in rising to speak in this debate, I wish to draw attention to the following questions."
"Firstly, ASEAN, which brings together 10 countries that differ very widely in their level of development - from rich Singapore to very poor Burma, Cambodia and Laos - and that are home to almost 500 million people, is the EU's fifth largest trading partner and offers prospects of further development in economic and trade relations with the European Union."
"Secondly, a free-trade agreement with ASEAN countries will certainly bring these countries greater benefits than it brings the EU."
"It is therefore essential to conclude arrangements with these countries over and above the trade agreement, in which these countries agree to observe social and environmental as well as consumer protection standards."
"Thirdly, and finally, this is the only approach that will give us the opportunity to arrive at honest competition between companies originating from ASEAN countries and European countries."
"Only then will these companies begin to include in their manufacturing costs the overall costs of labour, environmental protection and consumer protection, and this will ensure that their product prices reflect the full costs of manufacture."
"- (PL) Mr President, I congratulate the Commissioner on holding the negotiations, and Mr Ford, the rapporteur, on his report."
"We are pondering how to surmount the hurdles and negotiate a good free-trade agreement with the ASEAN countries."
"We are emphasising the differences between these countries."
"I would like to draw attention to just one aspect of these negotiations, one that we were unaware of four years ago."
"Combating global warming has become an EU priority, and the EU itself has become a world leader in this area."
"We must place much more emphasis on this aspect in our negotiations."
"There will be differences here, too: we cannot ask anything of the poorest countries, but with economies in wealthy countries developing rapidly we must arrive at a community of interests where combating climate change is concerned."
"Two EU countries, Poland and Denmark, are responsible for negotiating a post-Kyoto agreement."
"This will happen this year in Poznań and next year in Copenhagen."
"This is also becoming an EU responsibility."
"If we are unable to negotiate a joint agreement by the end of 2009, we shall be, as it were, forced to change our ambitious policy on combating climate change. We do not want to do that, because we clearly cannot tackle these changes and the global threat all on our own."
"This is why it is important for us to make use of all EU negotiations with third countries in order to stress this aspect - a joint agreement on combating climate change on a global scale."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I want to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Ford, firstly for his ... (text inaudible) on two aspects that I think should be emphasised."
"The first is counterfeiting, particularly the counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals, which is a real danger, a real danger primarily for the progress and peaceful climate of economic and trade relations with the countries of Southeast Asia, but also especially for consumers, whether in terms simply of safety or in terms of product quality."
"It is therefore necessary to underline, to highlight, the need to prevent all forms of counterfeiting, using the restrictive tools contained in the agreements."
"I would just like to emphasise again how necessary it is to fight the counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals for these two reasons: to protect the safety of consumers and safeguard the pharmaceutical sector from any unfair competition that does not respect the environment or health and safety rules."
"Only effective cooperation among all those concerned will guarantee the protection of consumers world-wide, and specifically those in Europe."
"The second aspect concerns the development of legislation encouraging a reduction in CO2 emissions by companies, particularly mutual agreements on emissions trading."
"We need to bear in mind that the European Union needs to avoid penalising companies by imposing on them the proper and logical provisions of new environmental standards as part of the climate plan, without demanding the adoption of similar rules by other countries in return."
"Making these two points an integral part of our relations - in form and in spirit - would mean we could maintain the competitiveness of European companies while protecting consumers, and not forgetting climate protection of course."
"In short, it is undoubtedly a matter of finding a perfect balance in our relations."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate, although it is not my pet subject."
"However, I was rushed from the office when I heard comments made about standards, and I think paragraph 10 is particularly important in this resolution and should be read and perhaps added to."
"Perhaps we should add food safety and traceability standards."
"I endorse the comments made on counterfeit medicines, which is a serious concern."
"I have just returned from Brazil, and in a meat factory I searched everywhere for a warning sign about anything."
"There were none: in other words, there was no acknowledgement of the issues around safety in the workplace."
"In the bioethanol plants we visited, I was slightly nervous because, again, there was no emphasis on the safety of the workers."
"It is not to denigrate other countries."
"It is to recognise that we as Europeans have high standards, and we need to try and insist that we lift everyone, in other words, to our standard."
"Could I just say that I know Commissioner Mandelson has heard of me before, and he is in the newspapers in Ireland today?"
"If he wishes to make a comment in relation to those reports, I should be interested to listen."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, both the European Union and ASEAN possess considerable potential that will enable action to be taken to oppose such global challenges as climate change, energy security, the fight against terrorism and the battle against poverty and malnutrition for millions of residents of Asia."
"Representatives of the two organisations should therefore step up their dialogue and search together for solutions to these difficult matters."
"They should also create new forms of economic cooperation and take steps to increase mutual and beneficial trade."
"The European Union should share its experience and achievements in connection with the process of regional integration."
"Let us not forget, though, that the EU should go beyond economic matters and should continue to demand observance of human rights and democracy."
"(EL) Mr President, trade agreements can help to stabilise relations between both sides."
"At the same time, however, certain essential requirements and values in the negotiations for a free trade agreement must be taken into account."
"Allow me to suggest the following: respect for human rights, the economic capabilities of each country, the protection of intellectual property rights and of geographical definition; the harmonisation of product safety standards; and cooperation in the fight against diseases and epidemics, and in environmental matters."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the first thing I would like to say is that I would like to add my voice to the compliments for my excellent fellow Member, Mr Ford, and I will make the most of this speaking time to welcome Mr Hartmut Nassauer, who is the chairman of our delegation for relations with the countries of Southeast Asia."
"I remember, ladies and gentlemen, being in the Republic of the Philippines. It occurs to me as a result of this that perhaps we are neglecting development in these dossiers."
"I remember that trip to Kidapawan in Cotabato Province on the island of Mindanao, where we saw nearly 500 farmers with approximately 1.5 hectares of land who, thanks to European Union intervention, could survive on what they produced under subsistence farming conditions."
"We saw enthusiasm and gratefulness and I believe, Commissioner, that development must be taken into account in all European Union policies."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, can I thank all the Members who participated in this evening's debate."
"I am aware of the need, as Mr Audy has just pointed out, that we should make sure that development issues are not neglected with respect to a number of the countries, not just the Philippines."
"As someone who is much better acquainted with Indonesia than with the Philippines, I am aware there that there are many parts of Indonesia where it is not Jakarta, it is a developing country and we need to be paying attention there."
"I thank Mr Mandelson for his comments and I would make the point that in a spirit of cooperation and consensus I have just had a conversation with Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and I have agreed to withdraw Amendment 11 - we will deal with this tomorrow - in exchange for him supporting, as an addition, the new parts of my Amendment 12."
"So we have even more consensus now than we had at the beginning of this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Bearing in mind that the European Community, in its negotiations with the Association of South East Asian Nations with a view to concluding a second-generation free-trade agreement, should give priority to the multilateral trade system established by the World Trade Organisation, it is a matter of importance that ASEAN covers a widely varying area: one of the countries is among the least-developed nations, whereas others are highly developed."
"This is the main reason why these inequalities are playing an important role in finalising a free-trade agreement."
"During the process of concluding free-trade agreements, one priority matter is the signing of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement containing enforceable human rights clauses, as human rights and democracy are fundamental EU values."
"Attention must be paid to the consequences of the agreement for the small-scale farmers of the region and to monitoring and ensuring that family and sustainable agriculture are reinforced."
"Local authorities should also be sensitised to the fight against climate change by combating deforestation and by enhancing tropical forests."
"Trade in biofuels should therefore be restricted solely to those biofuels that do not disturb the equilibrium of the environment."
"The importance of ongoing cooperation on counter-terrorism and crisis/disaster management should also be stressed."
"An EU-ASEAN framework agreement could help to encourage future industrial growth in the EU, but should be based on the principle of transparency and on rules for competition and investment, intellectual property rights and state aid."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, many economists are pointing out that the South Asian region has the potential to become a world economic centre in the future."
"This is a dangerous trend, especially for Europe, which could lose a significant proportion of world trade."
"In Europe, meanwhile, we keep on tightening up conditions for companies and agriculture and trading with countries that do not even respect copyright law."
"In the light of this, can we talk of free and fair competition?"
"Of course, we must strive to support respect for human rights in Asiatic countries, but we must not do this while handing over European markets to goods that are manufactured under conditions that do not meet European competition standards."
"At the moment we are concentrating strongly on economic competition within the EU."
"Here we are making a mistake as well as acting foolishly."
"Meanwhile, Asia is subduing us economically, just as Europe subdued Asia militarily and politically in the past."
"Support schemes for farmers (support for cotton) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Ioannis Gklavakis, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, as regards the support scheme for cotton - C6-0447/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, before going into the content of the report, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gklavakis, and the Agriculture Committee members for the very good job they have done on this extremely sensitive issue of cotton reform."
"In 2006, as you know, the Court of Justice annulled the cotton reform that we agreed in 2004, ruling that it was in breach of the proportionality principle."
"The Court also ruled that a new regime should be adopted within a reasonable time."
"The Commission therefore immediately responded to the ruling by commissioning several studies, launching a comprehensive consultation process and carrying out the impact assessments."
"On this basis, the Commission proposes to continue coupling 35% of the aid, which allows for maintaining cotton production and respecting the Accession Treaties of Greece, Portugal and Spain."
"At the same time, decoupling of 65% is in line with the CAP reform process and the commitments of the European Union to its international partners, specifically in the developing countries."
"Against this background, I very much welcome the support in the report for the 35% coupled rate as a balanced way forward."
"Your report correctly draws attention to the process of restructuring which the cotton sector within the European Union is undergoing."
"I understand the needs of the sector and therefore I am positive about amendments proposing to support this process, for example through lowering the national base area and thereby increasing the coupled aid per hectare."
"On this point, I find your suggestions very reasonable."
"However, you also call for increased aid per hectare where the cotton area falls below the defined area at national level, and this poses a problem."
"I have to say that this is actually a countercyclical system that would make the aid within the European cotton sector more trade-distorting and would be in clear contradiction of our multilateral trade negotiation mandate within the DOHA Development Round."
"I can support the amendments regarding a national envelope."
"I specially welcome the measure aimed at restructuring of the ginning sector and improving the quality of production."
"However, all restructuring measures should be compatible with the WTO Green Box and not overlap with measures that we already have in place within rural development policy."
"Finally, it may not come as a surprise that I oppose a transfer of aid for cotton regions from the second pillar to the first pillar."
"I think it is obvious - and I have had the chance to express this opinion on several occasions here in Parliament - that we need to strengthen our rural development policy."
"I would like to underline that in cotton regions in Spain and Greece rural development programmes are actually efficiently used, for example the different agri-environmental schemes."
"I am looking forward to a fruitful discussion on this very important issue."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to the Commissioner."
"There are four cotton-growing countries in the EU: Greece, Spain, Bulgaria and, on a very small scale, Portugal."
"When I embarked on this report, I worked closely with a great number of people, received recommendations and took part in discussions, so I can say that it is the product of long, extensive cooperation."
"I worked with members of my committee, whom I thank, with Spanish representatives of the manufacturing and cotton-ginning sectors, and, of course, with my compatriots from Greece."
"I should like to point out that the report was approved by the Committee on Agriculture by 28 votes to 6."
"This shows a high level of acceptance."
"Allow me to mention briefly the 2004 proposal to support cotton."
"It was annulled by the European Court of Justice."
"It called for a 35% coupled payment and a 65% decoupled one."
"Then in subsequent years cotton-growing went into decline, and there was eventually a 50% decrease in Spain and one of about 20% in Greece."
"Cotton farms in Spain shrunk by 25% and in Greece by 11%."
"The aim of this report is that cotton should continue to be grown in Europe: the EU as a whole accounts for only 2% of world production."
"We have therefore agreed that the funding earmarked for the cotton-growing Member States will be maintained in full."
"Of course, to avoid the risk of cotton-growing going into decline or becoming uneconomical, we have requested a small increase in the funding per hectare and I am delighted to hear that you accept."
"It necessarily follows that as the overall sum remains the same, the cultivated area will be reduced."
"There is, of course, absolutely no implication that problems will arise if a Member State wishes to increase the cultivated area as it pleases without any defined upper ceiling."
"The ratio between coupled and decoupled aid remains at 35-65%."
"However, we have requested that Member States should, if they wish, be allowed to change their proportion of coupled aid, without going below the lower limit of 35%."
"Let me say here that one thing should be made clear."
"The new area of land will not represent a defined ceiling, with penalties imposed for exceeding it as before."
"On the contrary, it is a way of safeguarding the current overall aid to the sector."
"Indeed, we believe the proposed increase in aid will be a strong incentive to retain the crop."
"We also propose the creation of a national envelope of 1% funded by a deduction from the coupled aid, by unabsorbed appropriations, and from the EUR 22 million transferred to the 2nd pillar."
"What will the national envelope achieve?"
"Firstly, its aims are ambitious: for instance, aid will be provided for research into new varieties requiring less water and lower pesticide use, thus greatly benefiting the environment."
"Secondly, the quality of cotton produced will be improved, and the ginning industry will be modernised."
"The draft report meets the needs of cotton growers in the Member States while complying with the goals of the EU."
"It deals with actual funding and at the same time introduces environmental measures, which are vital in the EU."
"Allow me in conclusion to mention the excellent cooperation and support I enjoyed from all my fellow Members in drafting the report, which enabled us to introduce new ideas and recommendations."
"I am confident that the implementation of the new scheme will help preserve a flourishing cotton-producing sector in the EU and a viable ginning industry."
"Lastly, I would like to thank the Commission once again for the constructive way in which it has responded to the needs of the cotton-producing countries."
"We have finally achieved a result and will be able to point the Council in the right direction."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, it is surprising that the response from the European Commission to the judgment of the Court of Justice was a new proposal amending the support scheme for cotton, which is practically identical to the previous one, except in relation to linking the support to the cotton harvested."
"Due to all this, we warmly welcome the excellent report drawn up by Mr Gklavakis, which has put the finger on the main problems affecting the production and processing sector."
"Firstly, the Commission's proposal to maintain the 35% of coupled aid is, as has been demonstrated in recent years by the reduction in production in a country such as Spain, entirely inadequate; therefore, we think that the solution provided by the report to leave the maximum limit to subsidiarity is the most appropriate."
"Mr Gklavakis has given some figures, and I can tell you, Commissioner, that Andalusia, which is the main producing region in my country, has lost 65% of its production in the last three years."
"Also, contrary to what you said, Commissioner, and I am sorry to contradict you, I think that Amendment 17, which I tabled myself and which has been included in the report, is very positive, as it rightly states that aid to producers can be increased when the cultivated area is less than the size of the base area for production, which I do think will benefit the sector, maintaining financial neutrality, as well as resulting in full use of resources, and obviously giving great flexibility to the sector."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would like to point out, in relation to the ginning industry, that I believe was the great oversight in the 2004 reform and whose restructuring is an indisputable fact, that it is essential that a restructuring fund be created, which is mentioned in Mr Gklavakis's report."
"In addition, I do think that Amendment 39, which we tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, would help, through Article 69, to provide greater funding for this processing industry."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to express my rejection of the agreement reached this week by the Special Committee on Agriculture, because I think that it still does not provide an adequate response to the problems in the sector, and, above all, to the problems in the ginning industry;"
"I must tell you that today I received a note from the Spanish ginning industry stating that if the Council does not amend this proposal, it will cause the 27 ginning factories to cease activity."
"I hope that the Council will change all these things and I thank the Commissioner for being here."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to join in what I think are deserved congratulations for the rapporteur and thank him for his availability and cooperation at all times, especially in terms of meeting with all the producers in my region, Andalusia, as he did."
"I would like to say that we are dealing with a new reform of the cotton sector, because my country, Spain, and especially my region, Andalusia, appealed against the previous reform at the Court of Justice, and I would like to point out that this is the first time that a Commission reform has been thrown out."
"What is surprising, as has already been said, is that in response to this situation, the Commission has inexplicably presented a proposal similar to the previous one when, of course, what has not changed is the position of Spain."
"The Spanish cotton growers want - we want - to continue growing cotton."
"There has already been mention of the serious damage that has been caused to my region."
"In order to do this we need a reform that is different from the previous one and will enable us to keep growing."
"I therefore think that the report by Mr Gklavakis is appropriate and is a solution that should be taken into account."
"The report proposes ranges for the level of coupling of the more extensive aid and greater subsidiarity for the Member States."
"I think that the rapporteur has understood the different situation of the sector in Greece and Spain."
"I therefore think that the solution given in the Gklavakis report could enable cotton-growing to continue in the two main producing countries."
"It is also clear that we need an industry-restructuring plan."
"Last time the Commission did not take this into account, as Parliament asked."
"The industry is thinking about compensation for the damage caused, which is quantifiable and it would be good to take this into account."
"Finally, it is important to support the amendment from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament asking for a transitional period in order to adapt to the new situation."
"It is not about maintaining the current situation, which is unsustainable."
"I would like to remind you that this is not a CMO."
"We need to reach an agreement that will enable us to continue producing cotton in the European Union."
"Although unfortunately we still do not have codecision, I hope that on this occasion the work done and the opinion of Parliament will be taken into account."
"Otherwise, and following the reports that are coming from the Council, Spain is not ruling out asking for a revision of the judgment if Parliament's opinion is not taken into account."
"Mr President, the EU has a 70% deficit in cotton."
"The sector should therefore receive more aid."
"This would also help to develop the whole industry, from growing cotton to manufacturing fabric and clothing."
"Instead of this, what with quotas and co-responsibility levies, production, agricultural income and jobs are in decline."
"Since the last CAP reform, the consequences of this decline have been felt more acutely, owing to the introduction of partial decoupling from the volume of production at 65%."
"In Greece, a year after implementation of the new Common Market Organisation (CMO) in cotton, production is down by 20%, and in Spain by more than 50%."
"In Greece 11% of small- and medium-sized agricultural holdings have disappeared; the figure is 25% in Spain."
"A fair number of ginning plants are unviable and about to close down, and many jobs have been lost."
"The increase in production costs should have been matched by an increase in aid, which instead has been reduced."
"Despite the positive proposals it contains, Mr Gklavakis's recommendation does not solve the problem; it accepts the Commission's proposal."
"We disagree with reducing the quota in Greece in order to increase the coupled aid per hectare."
"This will cause yet more small and medium cotton-growers to disappear."
"Nobody else can count on finding a definite solution to their problems."
"Mr President, whenever we discuss the EU's agricultural policy in this Chamber, rational citizens are reminded how unreasonable it still is, in spite of certain improvements in recent years."
"We face continuous demands from interest groups for continued protection against foreign competition."
"The regime has been in force for so long that it has even distorted the way we think and talk about these issues."
"That is why the rapporteur is able to say the following with a straight face: 'It is vital for Community cotton production to remain prosperous, ensuring satisfactory production levels that allow for the continued viability of the ginning industry, which accounts for 3 200 jobs in Greece and 920 in Spain.'"
"If we applied the same reasoning to other areas, Europe would be on the road to ruin."
"The truth is that Spain is a highly successful industrial country with a labour force of around 20 million people."
"Such a country can have no problem guiding 920 people from cotton ginning to other more productive activities."
"The rapporteur also has no hesitation in using phrases like 'safeguarding a prosperous sector of Community agriculture such as cotton production is crucial.'"
"This is an extreme example of contradictio in adjecto."
"Common sense tells us that if cotton production is prosperous it does not require any support."
"The cold truth is that cotton production in the EU is unprofitable and should therefore be closed down."
"Such adaptation may be difficult and require State aid, but the support should be used for change, not to protect production which is clearly better carried out in other countries outside of the EU."
"(EL) Mr President, let me first congratulate the rapporteur on his work, and the shadow rapporteurs, who have cooperated with the rapporteur in compiling this report."
"Unfortunately, the report we are discussing today has come about due to pressure from the European Court of Justice's ruling rather than to a political wish to ensure a long-term and stable scheme in the cotton sector until 2013 or to bring about a reform respecting the terms and rules of the WTO and CAP."
"It is difficult to accept that eligible land in Greece will be reduced to 270 000 hectares from last year's 340 000 hectares under cultivation."
"The reduced area of land will result in a further curtailment of aid."
"It is also difficult to accept that ginning plants will receive aid under the 1st pillar."
"We might support an improvement in quality, but not for measures included in the 2nd pillar."
"We should naturally prefer stability, so that both decoupled and coupled aid as well as rural development come under the 1st pillar, and would be within the scope of the national envelope as covered by Annex VIII to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, according to which Member States would be allowed flexibility in the enforcement of this Regulation."
"Lastly, I should especially like to congratulate the Spanish Government for taking the cotton issue to the European Court of Justice, as the Greek Government should have done in the case of tobacco."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in the reply you are about to give, would you please clarify that, when 65 and 35 are mentioned, the 65% is not deleted but that businesses receive this money?"
"If, according to this distribution of 35%, no more cotton will be grown, then it becomes more worthwhile to take just the 65% and grow something else, or even to grow nothing at all, because the 35% is not sufficient to cover production costs in such a way that the cotton will be accepted at the prices that the industry pays."
"If it is now a matter of jobs in the processing area, there is no denying that it would be necessary to discuss with the industry again whether it is in a position to pay growers an appropriate price for this cotton so that growing cotton is worthwhile."
"Of course, it is important that the 65% that is de-coupled continues to be paid to producers, whether they are growing or not."
"That is the de-coupling system."
"It seems to me that this has been somewhat confused in the previous speeches."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have listened carefully to the different concerns, the different ideas raised by the honourable Members."
"I think that we are not that far apart, and I am sure that, at the end of the day, it will be possible to find an acceptable compromise."
"I think that we have to keep in mind that, when the Court of Justice annulled the cotton reform, they did not put into question the coupled/decoupled part, the 35/65: not at all."
"The reason for the position of the Court of Justice was the fact that they concluded that we needed to make a more in-depth impact assessment."
"That is actually what we have been doing now."
"But that does not mean that we have seen any reason to change the coupled/decoupled part, and if farmers should stop producing, they will, of course, not use the decoupled part."
"They can continue with their money, although they are not producing cotton in the future."
"I think that we might end up in a situation, because I think some of the difficulties the sector has been facing are actually rooted before the cotton reform was made in 2004."
"But I hope that the result of this reform will be that we will have a cotton sector."
"It will be probably with the development that we have seen - it will be smaller, but I hope that it will be more competitive as well."
"I think that quite a lot can be done - this was mentioned by Mrs Batzeli - to improve the quality of the production."
"Here we are contributing to adding value to the product with a label of origin."
"Here I think the cotton-producing Member States should take advantage of this possibility to get a better price for their products so that we can maintain a prosperous, competitive cotton sector within the European Union."
"Mr President, as I understand it, we all agree that cotton growing must continue in the EU."
"How could we not?"
"The EU has a 70% deficit in cotton."
"If cotton production continues to decline at all levels, the EU is going to be deficient in everything."
"In the EU, we grow only 2% of the world's production, which we must protect at all costs."
"Let us not forget that cotton represents only 0.15% of the EU's agricultural production."
"Furthermore, this report makes a special effort; significantly, in the cotton-growing countries I have visited, the producers themselves have assured me that they are keen to produce quality cotton."
"All the proposals put forward should make for considerable achievements."
"However, I need to point out again something that I realise has not been understood."
"The area of land has been reduced in order to increase subsidies, and the overall amount of funding per country has been retained."
"There is no prohibition on increasing the cultivated area, although this would, of course, be at the cost of reducing the funding per hectare."
"Thus in the case of Greece we have moved from 370 000 hectares at a subsidy of EUR 594 per hectare, to 270 000 hectares at EUR 750; but if we cultivate more than 270 000 hectares, opting for 370 000 hectares, which we are perfectly entitled to do, no one will come and tell us, as they used to, that there is an upper ceiling or a penalty."
"This means that there is essentially no prohibition."
"(Interjection from the floor)"
"Please address the House and explain."
"Be so good as to read the report, and you will see that it is absolutely correct, for if we exceed 270 000 hectares, we will receive a smaller amount instead of EUR 750."
"Please see this for yourself in the report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Management of deep-sea fish stocks (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Rosa Migueléz Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the management of deep-sea fish stocks."
"Mr President, on a point of order, before we start, could I just say a quick word about the lateness of the debates on agriculture and fisheries."
"This consistently is the case."
"We are always brought to the Chamber to have the last debates in the evening, both here in Brussels and in Strasbourg."
"I think it is deeply unfair."
"When the Lisbon Treaty is introduced we will have codecision powers in both the Committee on Agriculture and in the Committee on Fisheries."
"That means we will have equal status with all the other committees in this Parliament, and yet it is the Foreign Affairs Committee that always gets the afternoon sessions, and we are always made to speak late in the evening while our Foreign Affairs colleagues can go for an early dinner and an early bed."
"I do not see that that is appropriate, and I appeal to you, Mr President, to take to the Conference of Presidents - to the presidency of this Parliament - our complaint on behalf of all the Fisheries and Agriculture Committee members that we object to this and we wish fair play in the future."
"Sometimes we are prepared to speak late in debates, but sometimes we wish to be given preference and to speak early in the afternoon."
"I hope you will take that on board."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will obviously pass on your comment to the President of Parliament, but I also invite you to pass it on to the chairmen and women of your respective groups, because it will not have escaped your notice that it is the Conference of Presidents that decides the agenda and the order in which the reports will go through."
"I will therefore report back on my side; please pass on the information on yours."
"rapporteur. - (ES) The truth is that what Mr Stevenson has just said is a general feeling that we all share, because we have all been finding that we are speaking at these late hours for many years now."
"I think that even the Commissioners should start protesting."
"I urge Mr Borg and Mrs Fischer Boel to protest too so that these debates are scheduled for a more reasonable hour, not only for our convenience, but also because it is much easier for the public and the sectors concerned to find out about them."
"However, this evening we are talking about deep-sea species, and at this point I would like to remind you that European fleets began fishing these stocks in the 1990s when demersal species were in decline, and when cod in particular were disappearing, and that the Commission communication to which my report refers aims to assess the effectiveness of the regulations from two points of view: adequacy and implementation."
"The truth is, as I say in my report, that the initial allocation of quotas to the Member States was made and even extended before we had sufficient biological information, which resulted in successive distributions based on data that was not entirely reliable; therefore some Member States did not use up the quotas assigned to them, whilst others found their quotas were running out in the first few months of the year."
"The truth is also that the lack of knowledge of the geographical structure of these species and the lack of reliable scientific data meant that TACs and quotas were set for extremely broad management areas and that they were also too restrictive, even going beyond the conditions imposed for species subject to recovery plans."
"The truth is also, as we need to acknowledge, that the classification leaves a lot to be desired, because deep water species are considered to be all those living at a depth greater than 400 metres, this merging together a wide range of species that do not have any biological, zonal or morphological characteristics in common."
"I would say to the Commission that of course it seems necessary to differentiate more clearly between species requiring protection - and there are many of them - and other species that provide an alternative to demersal species and for which long-term fleet objectives should be set."
"The truth is that the Commission has already been obliged to withdraw species from the list and to recognise that they are merely taken as by-catches in shallow-water fisheries, and, for example, on a proposal of the United Kingdom, tusk was taken off the list of deep-water species and the alfonsinos quota is not counted when it is fished with pelagic trawls."
"In my view, the Commission should eliminate any differences in treatment for the various species that are not fully justified as a matter of urgency, and I would also like to point out that progress has been made in these fisheries and that the Community fleet is already implementing many measures that are not, however, implemented by other non-European fleets fishing in the same areas."
"Our fleet has restricted its fishing effort, through both cuts in TACs and capacity limitation and the creation of protected areas."
"There are other issues in relation to these species, such as the suitability of the TAC and quota system for managing these stocks, which is extremely difficult to do because these are mixed fisheries."
"Another issue appears to be, and is, the need to tackle the problem of discards, improving management in this area."
"Another problem that needs to be corrected is the management of fishing effort, because the Commission made the mistake of including all vessels holding deep-sea licences in the definition of vessels requiring special permits, which has led to much confusion."
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that I am going to listen to all of you and also to the Commission, and I will conclude."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, in reply to what Mr Stevenson and what Mrs Miguélez Ramos said regarding the timing, I need to stress that the Commission - respectfully, resignedly - accepts the times for debates set by Parliament."
"Allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for a very thorough report."
"As you know, the EU is an important stakeholder in deep-sea fisheries."
"The key EU Member States participating in these fisheries are Estonia, France, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Spain."
"Their landings represent the largest amount of global reported catches."
"Overall, the economic and social importance of the Community high-sea bottom-gear fleets is relatively minor compared to the EU fisheries sector as a whole."
"Nevertheless, in certain countries and regions - notably Spain and Portugal - it contributes significantly to catches, employment and value added at a local level."
"Deep-sea fisheries started in the late 1970s, developing rapidly from the 1990s onwards as a result of three factors."
"First, significant reductions of fishing opportunities in shallower waters due to depletion of stocks and the extension of the national jurisdictions under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in the 1970s."
"Second, the high value of some deep-sea species, and third, the advances in fishing technology that allow fishing at greater depths."
"Our regulation on deep-sea fishing tries to establish specific access requirements and associated conditions for fishing of deep-sea stocks."
"In fact, some progress has been made with respect to the previous development stage of the fishery, where there were no rules."
"Our latest proposals for the setting of TACs and effort limitations have increasingly been based on scientific information as this becomes more and more available."
"What we can be sure of is the fact that the state of these stocks has worsened in recent years."
"Scientific advice calls for additional data both in terms of quantity and quality."
"Our new proposal for data collection, currently being discussed within Council, also takes into consideration these issues."
"Furthermore, new surveys to cover deep-sea fishing grounds will be included as part of the Member States' obligations, and additional biological sampling will be requested in our implementation proposal for data collection."
"However, it is clear that the rules contained in our Deep-Sea Fishing Regulation need to be reviewed."
"Our communication analyses its drawbacks and points to the problems that need to be addressed."
"We hope to start a review exercise of this Regulation, establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks with your valuable help."
"A thorough consultation involving all stakeholders should take place in 2009, with a view to considering stricter rules to be applied to this fishery."
"From your report it is clear that we share the same concerns and objectives, and we hope that we can work closely together to take urgent action to protect the stock."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Mr President, many congratulations to the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"The proper management of deep-sea fish stocks is essential in order to promote the sustainability of the use of the seas and safeguard the conservation of marine ecosystems."
"With these principles in mind, an opinion was prepared and strongly endorsed by the ENVI Committee."
"This opinion consisted of a small number of suggestions aiming to complement Mrs Ramos's report and enhance its effectiveness and applicability."
"It highlighted, amongst other things, the need to reduce total allowance catches, in conformity with the relevant scientific advice, and to adhere more strongly to the recommendations of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea."
"Furthermore, concern was expressed over the inefficiency and poor implementation of the current regulations, especially with regard to the issue of monitoring and control procedures in Member States."
"In addition, it emphasised the advantages of setting up a network of marine protected areas within the Natura 2000 system."
"Also included in this opinion is reference to the need to develop common guidelines, exchange best practices, improve the use of available technology and involve think tanks and NGOs in order to better implement measures to reduce illegal fishing and the sale of illegal catches in European markets."
"The necessity of promoting more environmentally friendly catching methods, which do not harm the environment and ecological biodiversity, was also mentioned."
"The report, supplemented by the accepted opinion recommendations, is fully supported by my group."
"However, we are unable to support the three amendments submitted, as we feel that these run counter to the need to properly and effectively protect our sea ecosystems."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, can I firstly congratulate Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the excellent work that she has done in compiling this report."
"The science in relation to deep-sea stocks is not yet fully developed."
"However, we do know that these species live at great depths - we have heard from 400 metres to over 2 000 metres and even deeper."
"We know that they are slow maturing, not reaching breeding age sometimes until they are at least 25 years old, and they have a very low reproductive capacity."
"We know that there are millions of different species living at these great depths, of which only very few are edible."
"As a result, we know that fishermen in the deep-water fishery regularly discard around 55% of all the fish they catch."
"We know that the kind of fishing commonly carried out over sensitive deep-water ecosystems can be horrifically destructive - cold-water coral, sea-mounts and hydrothermal vents can be destroyed."
"Bottom-trawlers are operating in a way that would require a major environmental impact assessment in any other industry operating in deep-sea areas."
"So we need to apply strict controls to the type of gear being used in these deep-water fisheries."
"We need to avoid destructive gear."
"We need to ensure that such fishing activity is only permitted in areas where we can be certain there will be no damage."
"We need to avoid situations where nets can break loose and continue ghost fishing for decades."
"Having said this, I recognise the nature of the artisanal fishery off the coast of Portugal and around the Azores, where the fishing is carried out in a sustainable way."
"I accept that we should not target such fisheries for excessive controls."
"So we are dealing with this against a background of poor existing legislation, poor monitoring, poor science, poor feedback from Member States and a lack of overall credible information."
"I can only hope that this report paves the way for major improvements."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur and all those who, like Mr Stevenson, helped to improve this report."
"I should like, above all, to make a general appeal for us to avoid a repetition on the sea bed of the dramatic situations we have seen over recent decades with regard to the fishing of cod and other pelagic species."
"It is essential to observe the precautionary principle and the principle of ecosystem management."
"It is essential to maintain sustainable fisheries."
"This report contains a proposal in paragraph 8 that seems to me to be well-intentioned overall, but it includes a suggestion to ban fishing activity over seamounts, which would be impracticable in the Azores, since almost all deep-sea fishing is over seamounts."
"We are therefore unable to support that paragraph as it stands and we shall, naturally, be voting for the Socialist Party's proposal to amend that paragraph."
"Fundamentally, however, I think we must all bear in mind that when it comes to the sea bed - environments that are much more fragile than on the surface - we cannot repeat the mistakes made in the past."
"As already mentioned, species on the sea bed mature much much more slowly, damage is much more complicated to repair and, therefore, we cannot do the same as being done further up."
"I therefore urge the European Commission to give this its maximum attention."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) We congratulate the rapporteur on her work and in general support the contents of the report apart from a few points."
"Since the objective is to ensure sustainable exploitation of resources, we welcome the inclusion in the report of the need to invest in scientific fisheries research, devoting more human and financial resources to that research, the need to adopt appropriate socio-economic measures to compensate fishermen for the costs of reductions in activity connected with stock recovery plans and the need to involve fishermen in the definition of measures for the protection of the marine environment and the management of resources."
"Finally, as pointed out, we stress the need to find different and appropriate solutions for different species, taking account of the selective fishing gears used in each region."
"(ES) Mr President, I also think that there are ample reasons to support the amendments tabled for this report, and that the report is very valuable."
"With regard to the ban being discussed here on fishing at a depth of more than 1 000 metres, the Committee on Fisheries already made it very clear in another report that was much more directly connected with vulnerable marine ecosystems than this one is, in which linking depth to sensitive ecosystems was rejected by a large majority."
"Vulnerable habitats will have to be protected where they are found, irrespective of whether they are at a 1 000, 600 or 200 metres, and not based on whether they fall on one side or the other of an artificial line drawn in an office in Brussels."
"This is also the doctrine of the FAO, which in its preparatory work on the guidelines for the protection of vulnerable ecosystems ruled out using depth as a criterion, precisely because it considered it to be arbitrary, lacking in scientific basis and more fanciful than anything, because, as I have said, since it does not protect coral or seamounts that are at a lesser depth, it would immediately wipe off the map fisheries that have been operating for some time without any problems, such as, for example cutlassfish fisheries in the Azores or black halibut in the area regulated by the NAFO."
"These are just two examples."
"However, by supporting the amendments we would introduce greater consistency to legislative processes, as we are now in the process of preparing the future legislation on discards to be applied to all Community fleets."
"I therefore do not think that this is the time to jeopardise certain fleets with regulations on discards which could ultimately result in inconsistencies with the general rules, which goes against the practice of better regulation to the benefit of the public."
"- (PL) Mr President, in view of the particular nature of stocks and the marine ecosystem, deep-sea fishing constitutes a unique micro-climate, a micro-world that most starkly reveals both the familiar assets of fisheries policy and its permanently apparent shortcomings."
"The interesting report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos and the discussion it has initiated amount to a characteristic object lesson, a further justification for maintaining humility in the face of the mysteries of the deep - humility, may I add, that requires the necessary compensation at least in the form of research into the deepest European basins, the scope of which is regularly enlarged."
"Whilst listening to the dynamic parliamentary debates it is hard to resist forming the impression that many research centres are continuing to make use of schematic, hackneyed methodological principles."
"Three depth zones appear to be recognised here: up to 400 metres, 400 to 1 000 metres and deeper than 1 000 metres."
"For example, some kind of mythical significance is being attributed to depths exceeding 1 000 metres without any fully convincing reasons being put forward for this."
"I am in favour of searching further for more efficient methods of measuring the state of stocks, adapted to the ecosystem of a given basin."
"The results of such comprehensive research - and not just estimated data - should form the basis of fishing limits for deep-sea fishing; and not just for this type of fishing."
"It is precisely improved methods of research that can create guarantees for a system that is more precise than those used hitherto for exchanging information and controlling this important and delicate segment of fisheries."
"Mr President, thank you and congratulations to Mrs Miguélez Ramos for a very good report."
"It is worth recalling that 70% of the world's surface is covered by oceans."
"More than 97% of our planet's water is contained in the oceans."
"The oceans provide 99% of the earth's living space and fish supply the highest percentage of the world's protein consumed by humans; 3.5 billion people depend on them for their primary source of food."
"It does no harm to remind ourselves how important these fisheries debates are."
"Sustainable management of our global fish stocks therefore needs to be a priority and we must constantly review how we do that management."
"I agree with the Commission that there needs to be an ecosystem-based approach to the management of deep-sea fish stocks."
"This in my view should facilitate the use of various approaches and tools, eliminating destructive fishing practices and the need to establish marine protected areas consistent with international law."
"Management of the deep sea must also be based on the very best peer-reviewed science, which will include effective by-catch and data-collection programmes."
"Furthermore, effective research relating to the mapping of the seabed and the natural resources of the oceans, especially in the light of climate change impacts, must be a priority."
"I am very concerned at the current lack of sufficient data to carry out a scientific assessment of the state of our deep-sea fish stocks."
"It is imperative that we introduce a ban on discards in deep-water fisheries as this would enable scientists to study with more precision the complex diversity of species being landed."
"It is not sufficient simply to reduce discards, as bottom-trawling in deep water has a relatively high impact on by-catch and discard species."
"I really do think that the debate around the definition of what is 'deep' is futile and I agree fully with the FAO dismissing it as a crude measure and a crude criterion which is very arbitrary in terms of the sustainability of the species and fish stocks."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their comments and suggestions, which we will certainly take into account as we undertake the review of our legislation next year."
"May I now turn to some specific comments."
"First of all, it is extremely difficult to make and provide a definition of deep-sea fish."
"I have, however, taken note of the remarks made in this regard."
"We need to learn also by experience and by using the data on these deep sea species, which we have only relatively recently begun to collect."
"In the mean time, we need to adopt a precautionary approach, given the poor quality of information on these species."
"The Data Collection Regulation will certainly help to correct this situation."
"I agree that these species are much more vulnerable, and so we need to be extremely careful and cautious in the management of this fishery."
"On discards: as I have had occasion to say in this House before, this is an issue that we take seriously, and progressively we aim to cover all fisheries for the required reduction on discards."
"On the two amendments, the Commission intends to agree with Amendment 2, which aims at reducing the level of discards rather than introducing a complete ban across the board from the very outset."
"On the first amendment, the Commission is of the view that the original text is more protective of the fishing activities and sensitive habitats which, in particular, foresees that no fishing can take place in areas beyond the 1 000-metre depth."
"However, this limit will be reviewed and, if appropriate, revised in two years' time."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to stress the urgent need for more and better information on these species, especially in relation to those listed in Annex II, and for more human and financial resources for research."
"I would like to remind you that we held a hearing in the Committee on Fisheries on this issue and that the experts stressed the need for the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea to identify for each species the stocks which can be exploited sustainably, and they also asked for greater scientific rigour as regards sampling schemes, and more concise data."
"With regard to closed areas, for which no reliable data are actually available, the experts advised that these areas should be redefined and made smaller, since closing zones whose exploitation is feasible would lead in practice to more illegal fishing with greater impunity, given the lack of fishing interest among the parties, which would also exacerbate the scarcity of data with which to assess stocks."
"I would like to remind Mr Stevenson that the text of the Amendments 2 and 3 corresponds exactly to what our committee adopted based on Mr Schlyter's report on a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European fisheries, without a single word or comma added."
"The word 'ban' frightens me."
"'Ban' can confuse, and may also demotivate; and, of course, it could do a great deal of damage to our fishermen, who are currently doing their job as best they can."
"The best thing to do is to eliminate and then gradually introduce the ban, as the Commission proposed; if I am not mistaken, I think that those were the exact words."
"I would therefore ask you to please support the amendments in the vote tomorrow."
"Thank you."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (ET) The 20th century brought breakthroughs in scientific and technological progress, extending man's knowledge of nature to a previously unachievable level."
"In 1969 the American Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon; the Voyager missions, launched in 1977, have left the solar system, meaning that astronomers will be able to discuss not only the outer reaches of our galaxy but the outskirts of the whole of the visible universe."
"Compared to conquering the cosmos, scant attention has been paid to the ocean depths which measure only a few kilometres."
"The legislation regulating the trade in deep-sea fish stocks needs to be thoroughly reviewed."
"I agree with the rapporteur on the urgent need to devote more resources, both human and financial, to scientific investigation."
"It is vital to define what constitutes a deep sea fishery."
"Currently there is talk of depths and fishing gear."
"The Member States of the European Union must, however, jointly agree on the substance of the definitions and the importance of agreements."
"I would like to draw attention to point 8 of the report, which bans bottom-trawling at depths below 1 000m. Why do we have to provide for a specific depth restriction?"
"The commercialisation of stocks and maintenance of the biological balance should be based on regional features and international agreements."
"If a fishing ban at a given depth is justifiable in a given area, then the restriction should apply to all fishing gear which comes into contact with the sea bottom, not only bottom-trawls."
"We need a flexible system to manage fish stocks and the opportunity to react quickly."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, who has drawn attention to the ineffectiveness of the legislation in force."
"in writing. - (RO) The continuous and rapid exhausting of deep-sea fish stocks and the insufficient measures of protection of deep-sea biodiversity require urgent actions in order to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of fish species."
"Although the 2002 and 2004 recommendations of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) called attention to the fact that most species are below the biosafety levels, the European Union has not reduced its fishing efforts enough to ensure sustainable fishing."
"The Commission Communication regarding the review of deep-sea fish stocks confirms that the current levels of deep-sea stocks exploration must be reduced and that the measures in force have been implemented insufficiently in order to be efficient."
"For this reason, before adopting new management actions, we should establish the reasons why the existent actions are not implemented and the reasons behind the Member States' failure to meet their commitments or their late fulfilment."
"Moreover, the EU should make significant efforts for the complete and efficient implementation of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61/105 on deep-sea fishing areas in free sea and protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems."

"Framework for the activities of lobbyists in the EU institutions (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Alexander Stubb, replaced by Ingo Friedrich, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the framework for the activities of lobbyists in the EU institutions."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, the background is as follows."
"With the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament's powers will substantially increase again, and in view of this increase in powers, it is particularly important for us to carry out a precise analysis of the legislative process once more."
"As we do so, we see that interest representatives - or lobbyists, as they are often called - also play a very significant role in Brussels."
"We estimate that there are as many as 15 000 interest representatives working in Brussels, of which 5 000 are already registered with the European Parliament."
"Our task, then, is to establish a framework in which lobbying activities can be conducted in a fair and acceptable way."
"Parliament has maintained its own quasi-obligatory register of lobbyists from as long ago as 1996, as well as a very precise code of conduct."
"The task now is to see whether a similar arrangement can be achieved for all the European institutions."
"The contents of the report to be voted on today therefore represent an important step towards more transparency: in other words, towards the provision of accurate information about who has participated as a lobbyist - an interest representative - in the development of European legislation, how they have done so, and in which areas."
"Secondly, we wish to establish ethical and moral standards governing these lobbying activities."
"Thirdly, there must be proper safeguards in place to ensure the independence of the political decision-making process in Parliament and the Commission."
"Lobbying activities must be removed from the grey area, as it were, so that we have a clear and factual picture of where influence is genuinely being brought to bear."
"We have therefore introduced the following elements into the report, which are new features compared with the previous situation: firstly, a relatively wide-ranging definition of what lobbying means, or what it is, namely 'activities carried out with the objective of influencing the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions'."
"The second new feature is the introduction of a 'legislative footprint'."
"This would mean that when a new directive is deliberated and adopted in a parliamentary committee, the committee secretariat would annex a page to the document listing which associations had participated in the debate and whether they did so in the framework of a public hearing or other type of meeting."
"This list should also help the interest groups themselves to see who was involved in the process, and who did not wish, or was unable, to participate."
"Thirdly, our aim is to establish a common register for interest representatives in the EU institutions."
"It remains to be seen whether this really will happen with the Commission and Parliament."
"We intend to set up a working group to look at this issue."
"It would of course be easier for all lobbyists if we could get a kind of 'one-stop shop' where they could register and sign up to indicate that they intend to comply with the rules."
"That is the aim, but as the rapporteur, I must say that I am not certain at this stage whether we really will get a common register."
"At any rate, the registers need to be linked up so that it is a straightforward process, in terms of the bureaucracy involved, to set up this common register."
"Paragraph 21 also talks about the requirement of financial disclosure, which would be an entirely new element."
"We also talk about the option of sanctions which should apply to lobbyists who breach the code of conduct."
"Here, we have to consider what kind of sanctions we want."
"The Greens' idea is to have a black list, but in my view, this is reminiscent of a pillory in the Middle Ages."
"Black lists are really not appropriate in a democracy."
"What we would want instead is for inclusion in the register to confer such a high degree of prestige that serious-minded associations will want their name to appear in the European institutions' official register."
"It must be a prestigious and desirable aspiration, not only because they are then issued with a pass to grant access to the institutions' premises, but also because inclusion in the register would be sought-after in its own right, signifying that the association concerned is recognised as an important and useful interlocutor which is taken seriously enough by the institutions to warrant inclusion in the register."
"In the event of misconduct, the association would be struck from the register and the pass would be withdrawn: that would be the sanction."
"Yes, I will be as brief as possible."
"It is important that church organisations should not be defined as lobbyists."
"I am very disappointed by Amendment 3."
"Mrs in 't Veld from the Liberal Group has said that churches should be lobbyists."
"That really would run counter to everything we have agreed in Parliament to date."
"According to the Treaties, the churches are partners for our institutions, but they are not lobbyists."
"Overall, my assessment is that this is a major step forward towards a situation which is more transparent, correct and fair."
"I hope that we will thus set an example that can be followed around the world, showing how lobbying can and should be taken seriously."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am really glad to attend this plenary session where your discussion on the European Transparency Initiative will come to a conclusion."
"I have been following your debates and have participated in your debates in different committees."
"I am convinced that the report as it stands is a real step forward to improving transparency in the European decision-making process."
"The Commission welcomes the positive reaction of the European Parliament to its suggestion to consider an interinstitutional approach for a register and a code of conduct for interest representatives, who think that such a one-stop shop for registration would best serve the purpose of enhancing transparency, while avoiding an unnecessary administrative burden."
"I think that your report is an excellent starting point for discussions in the future interinstitutional working group that you suggest."
"I would like to underline one point."
"The European Commission is convinced that the activities of interest representatives are legitimate and offer valuable input in the decision-making process, but things have to happen in a transparent manner."
"This is why the European Transparency Initiative aims at opening what is too often perceived as a black box."
"Citizens, stakeholders, decision-makers and the public at large can then form their own views of what is going on in Brussels."
"When I look at what information Parliament and the Commission expect registrants to disclose, I observe that, here again, we largely agree."
"The Commission considers that it is important to know who the interest representatives are, what interests they represent and against what financial background."
"It goes without saying that non-respect of the rules of the code of conduct must be followed by sanctions."
"Sanctions would mean suspension or even withdrawal from the register."
"The Commission announced that it would launch its European Transparency Initiative Register in spring 2008."
"I can assure you that we expect to meet this deadline."
"Having recently talked to the services, I expect the register to open in six weeks' time."
"We have also decided that the register is a pilot project and that we shall review it after one year, which means in early summer 2009."
"The European Commission is ready for discussions with Parliament and the Council of Ministers, as well as the two consultative committees, in working towards the development of a shared system."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (ES) Firstly, Mr President, it is a shame that the Finnish Foreign Minister, Alexander Stubb, is not here today as he contributed so much in the Committee on Budgetary Control and to this report."
"I am here to give the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Following on from the final words of Commissioner Kallas, I would stress once again that the role of the Members of the European Parliament is to remain in as close contact as possible with all citizens - with interest representatives and with non-interest representatives - and that this Parliament therefore has to have its own rules."
"My office is open to anyone wanting to have a coffee with me or invite me for a walk."
"I cannot demand that people are registered in a special register."
"I cannot tell someone who is not registered that I cannot receive them in my party, the Unión del Pueblo Navarro."
"I cannot say 'you must be registered'."
"No, indeed: administration is one thing, but the political function of this Parliament is something else entirely."
"We would therefore do well to have two ways of ensuring transparency."
"I was the rapporteur on transparency, that great project which has brought Commissioner Kallas here."
"Transparency must not prevent our contact with real life, with interest representatives or non-interest representatives."
"Thank you."
"I am sure that Commissioner Kallas understands this."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I am in a paradoxical situation, as has happened on a number of occasions, for example when the rapporteur, Mr Pistelli, who was in the vanguard of what will undoubtedly be the European Parliament's position on transparency, was unfortunately disregarded by our committee."
"I am therefore delighted with what I am sure will be our final result today."
"It is impossible to imagine the markets functioning properly with transparency being anything other than the fundamental rule."
"We, the legislators, must apply that rule to ourselves, particularly as we know all too well that in our legislative process - and I say this to the previous speaker - our relations with external representatives, be they pressure groups or religious organisations - and that is directed at Mr Friedrich - play a decisive role in our European legislative process."
"It is our duty to set an example in this area, including going as far as ensuring the systematic use of this idea of a 'legislative footprint', which I think would be extremely beneficial."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, without transparency, there can be no European democracy."
"Brussels already has a reputation for allowing the major corporations to call the shots and pull the strings."
"That is dangerous for the European project, and it is an issue which is of great concern to me on a personal level and to the Greens as a whole."
"As the European Parliament, we therefore have a responsibility to show our hand to voters in the run-up to the next European elections."
"We have a good report in front of us, but there are dark forces at work and they want to suppress two of its core elements."
"Firstly, they want to prevent financial transparency."
"Without financial transparency, we can never be sure who is really behind the campaigns."
"I am astonished to find that it is actually the Socialist Group which is opposed to financial transparency and is thus undermining one of these core elements."
"As for the second core element which is being undermined, there are people in Parliament who assume that lawyers should not be regarded as lobbyists, even if they are not defending people in court, but instead are trying to pull strings to influence legislation in Europe."
"Let me quote from the website of a law firm in Brussels."
"It says that because we are not currently regarded as lobbyists under this legislation,"
"'Therefore lobbying by lawyers will be more and more effective and goals are more likely to be achieved with legal support."
"Alber & Geiger as a law firm exclusively specialised on lobbying and government relations will be at your side to assist you in reaching your goals within the EU.'"
"(DE) As you see, even the law firms themselves are admitting that they are lobbyists."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is unacceptable."
"If we allow that to happen, we will undermine our own credibility."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs was very supportive of the Commission's initiative and of the rapporteur's stance."
"I think we supported without question that there should also be a coordinated approach between all the institutions."
"But, having said that, we would wish to emphasise the particular openness of this institution as a democratic decision-making body; further, that lobbyists should be treated equally."
"In that sense, in the longer term, we would want to move towards a mandatory register where everybody is treated equally."
"I would like to return, if I may, to the issue of lawyers as lobbyists, which Mr Turmes has just raised."
"There is an issue here, and I would ask everybody to have careful regard to the very nuanced definition that the Committee on Legal Affairs gave in relation to when is a lawyer a lawyer, and when is a lawyer a lobbyist?"
"That definition was very carefully thought through, and I would ask that that is the one that be taken into consideration."
"Mr President, the report that we are considering here is a good one."
"It is a step in the right direction - not a big step, but a step nonetheless."
"There is also a need for action, not because all lobbying is harmful, or because all lobbyists are evil, but because it is completely unacceptable that lobbyism has such a major influence without there being any binding rules in place on maximum openness in the area."
"Lobbyists have a major influence within the EU system."
"This is apparent from the sums that are spent on lobbying and from the number of lobbyists around."
"However, the report could be better and the controls on lobbyists could be strengthened if you were to adopt the amendment proposal, which is partly an extension of the statement from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"We must have a mandatory common register, which ensures full clarity and full transparency with regard to the amount of money that is being spent on lobbying."
"We must have a register and an ethical code of conduct for all lobbyists, including legal companies carrying out lobbying, that can enter into force before the elections in 2009."
"We must have effective controls and visible sanctions to be imposed on those who breach the adopted rules."
"However, it is also a matter of looking inwards."
"It takes two to tango."
"We are therefore proposing that lobbyists must be obliged to disclose the same information on expenses for an individual member that that individual member is obliged to disclose in his or her financial declaration."
"A little more control over ourselves would not harm our reputation amongst the electorate."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, this House should welcome all initiatives which increase the transparency of the EU institutions, which is why I support the proposals before us today."
"However, we must ensure that the nature of the work of each institution is also taken into account."
"Parliament to this end works in a wholly different way to the Council and at a different stage in the legislative process from the Commission."
"Taking this into account, a common single register for all institutions would, I believe, be very difficult to achieve and would in fact put in place an over-bureaucratic procedure for applying for access when lobbying only the Parliament."
"We are also an autonomous institution and I do not feel it is therefore appropriate for other institutions to dictate our policies in this area."
"I would also like to raise an issue which has previously been brought up in this Chamber by a number of colleagues: how NGOs, in particular, are financed by the Commission and, in turn, use this money to lobby MEPs into taking certain positions."
"If the end result of what we are debating is to increase transparency, the House must be provided with a certain amount of non-commercially-sensitive data on how these organisations who lobby us are financed."
"On a more general note, I express concern at the free access that some lobbyists have to Members' office floors in this Parliament."
"Once in the building, people are freely able to walk around and have unrestricted access to private offices."
"Having the right to freely roam the building does nothing for transparency, but leads to malpractice by some individuals."
"I am sure Members have all experienced this."
"In many of our national parliaments, there are central lobby areas where lobbyists who have appointments can be greeted and escorted to Members' office areas."
"We should, in my view, try to implement a similar system."
"Overall, I am pleased to see Parliament addressing the issue of transparency, but we must also ensure that the organisations who lobby us are just as transparent as we are."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, firstly, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I must say that I support the report we are debating this morning and will very likely adopt later on in plenary."
"I believe this represents a major step towards transparency and control in an area which is undoubtedly surrounded by a great deal of myth."
"Lobbyists are not bad or good by definition; it depends on how they act and on how they are controlled."
"I must say that we Socialists have been at the forefront, right from the start, in reinforcing transparency and control and, as a result, democracy with regard to lobbyists."
"Mr Turmes, it seems that you have a fixation with the Socialist Group."
"Focus on other groups."
"I wonder, did the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety decide, in its opinion, to criticise the Socialist Group?"
"You are speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Environment."
"I would ask you to please give your opinions on other groups when you are speaking on your own behalf and not when you are speaking on behalf of a committee."
"We believe that the definition of lobbyists contained in the report is correct, although we should like more differentiation."
"Profit-making private companies are clearly not the same thing as non-governmental organisations or trade union federations."
"However, the footprint is legislative."
"The common and mandatory register and code of conduct, the corresponding sanctions and financial disclosure are key issues which are correctly included in this report."
"I would also draw your attention, Mr Turmes, to the fact that you insist that we Socialists are against financial disclosure, when some of your group's amendments set limits on this financial disclosure, whereas we do not want any limits."
"We also want entry into force before the 2009 European elections and for the planned working group to complete its deliberations before the end of 2008."
"Do you know, for example, that the Socialist Group will support two of your amendments in this respect?"
"You must be unaware of this."
"Myth and reality are being mixed up in this issue, but we Socialists, having been at the forefront of the fight for transparency and control, are not going to allow anyone to perpetrate a false myth that we have a hidden agenda."
"We have an open agenda which involves the citizens and transparency in the European Union."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in the power of the European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty will put pressure on the aim of greater openness in legislative work."
"It is vitally important that the work of the EU is transparent and that the public knows who has had a say in the content of laws."
"The purpose of registration is not to restrict or hamper the work of lobbyists."
"Their work is important."
"The current system of registering lobbyists in the European Parliament is more, however, and above all, a matter of security rather than one of openness."
"The report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has changed a good deal since the first drafts presented by the previous rapporteur, now the Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Stubb."
"I am particularly pleased, as is my group, that the report's wording is now a lot more forceful than it was initially and that the mandatory system of registration that my group supports is to come into being, because it establishes impartiality."
"I would like to refer to Amendment 3, which has already been discussed here."
"Some of the Members in my group support it, but as the current rapporteur said, and I am with him on this, churches are not lobbyists."
"On this matter my group is divided and it will probably vote two ways."
"The report by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes that the rapporteur may attach a list to his or her report of the registered interest representatives who were consulted during the preparation of the report."
"I hope in future this will be made an official practice."
"It would cause rapporteurs to listen objectively to the various points of view expressed."
"This way it might also come to light if someone was eating directly out of another's hand."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity of taking the floor after the former President of Finland as we debate a report by the current Finnish Foreign Minister, Mr Stubb, who was until recently a Member of this House."
"The Lord does seem to move in mysterious way where Members are concerned!"
"The latest report by NGOs indicates that lobbyists' influence on the European Commission's decision-making process has become a serious problem."
"For example, lobbyists hold a significant number of experts' posts in various bodies close to the European Commission."
"Five thousand lobbyists out of the 15 000 operating in Brussels have access to the European Parliament."
"These 5 000 need to operate according to very clear rules."
"The proposal to set up a common register of lobbyists is a good idea, as is the threat of sanctions."
"It is high time our electorate knew who the lobbyists are."
"Voters are entitled to know how lobbyists are financed, and which of them attempted to influence certain reports in various ways."
"This report is a step in the right direction."
"It is an attempt to regulate a situation that already exists."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the Greens/European Free Alliance Group the watchword on the ex-Stubb report is transparency."
"There is undoubtedly a tendency - and we have heard from some of its exponents here - to underestimate, probably in good faith, the effects and effectiveness of lobbyists' work, possibly in ways that none of us can even imagine as serious Members who operate in good faith and are decent and respectful of others."
"The facts are clear and keep coming to light daily: for example, we have known for a few weeks now that 34 officials within the Commission are being paid directly by private firms."
"Some recent research has found that most of the Groups - with the exception of just one, my own, but probably others too - that most of the amendments they tabled on REACH originated from a lobby."
"Furthermore, it emerges that some of the officials assisting Members with their work in certain committees are or have been employed by firms and are now working for us as national experts; Members are obviously unaware of this."
"In our opinion, therefore, the work we are doing today does not put an end to the issue of lobbies, and I do not believe that the work of Commissioner Kallas ends with the report we are adopting today."
"That is why we have emphatically backed all the amendments and all the work done by everyone - including the Socialist Group, the GUE/NGL Group and the Liberal Group - on those amendments and texts aimed at improving the situation and enhancing transparency."
"However, there are still some problems concerning the Stubb report which we hope can be resolved at the vote."
"The first relates to lawyers: when lawyers work with us and seek to influence legislation they are lobbyists, even when giving a legal opinion."
"We hope that this amendment will be rejected."
"Next, there is obviously the question of determining when this code of conduct should enter into force."
"It absolutely has to do so before the forthcoming European elections, because otherwise we will be starting off another term, another excessively long period of time."
"Finally, Mr President, I really do not think that this question of lobbying can be settled by stating that we dislike it, or by criminalising lobbies."
"In our opinion the problem with transparency is finding out whom we are dealing with, what they are doing and who is paying them: that is, the issue of financial disclosure."
"The report perhaps does not yet make all of this absolutely clear, but it can be clarified, and here I agree with Mr Carnero about the tasks of the working group which is to be set up."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, of course lobbyists should not be made a scapegoat."
"Of course it is perfectly legitimate, in a thriving democracy, for the various groups in society to represent their interests and concerns pro-actively and bring these interests to bear on social processes."
"It is also entirely legitimate for them to address these issues to the men and women in the institutions which prepare and take the decisions."
"Indeed, as legislators, we have a duty to inform ourselves as fully and accurately as possible before taking decisions on any legislative initiative that we are dealing with, and take account of the concerns of stakeholders with all their conflicting views."
"It is also clear, however, that transparency is essential to ensure the fair representation of interests, and is crucial for the European Union's credibility."
"That is why our Group believes that the three institutions must at last set clear rules which must apply to all interest representatives."
"In our view, this is long overdue."
"We have a duty to demonstrate very clearly to our citizens that the European institutions are not acting as accessories to 'dark forces'."
"Lobbyists should therefore be required to disclose publicly whose interests they represent, what their objectives are, and above all, where they get their funding from."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Parliament's working group on reform has been in Washington to study the US Congress."
"We saw how all lobbyists have to register their function and their income from their different clients."
"It is mandatory in the US and Canada and not voluntary, as the Commission proposes."
"We also saw how each member of Congress documented their budget, including every paid cup of coffee."
"If they can do it, why cannot we?"
"Why cannot we be fully transparent with our secretarial allowances in the EP, and then demand transparency in the other institutions?"
"At the last meeting of the Conference of Presidents we became aware of organised lobbyism in our own House."
"In a very big and nice room on the fifth floor of the Spinelli building, 28 multinational companies have their own office, the telephone numbers and e-mail addresses paid for by Parliament."
"This may be a very good scheme linking companies to MEPs, but no one presented this proposal for us; it was established behind our backs."
"The views of the small and medium-sized companies are missing; the views of the consumers, trade unions, green organisations are missing."
"It may be a good idea to rent facilities to lobbyists, but then everyone should be invited and an elected board could supervise the activities."
"Multinational companies are not those who most need our financial support."
"Support for the scheme has been hand-picked and not elective from the political groups."
"This is the latest lobbyist scandal I hope you will redress."
"This is my last political speech in the European Parliament."
"If I may have one wish, it will be for the adoption of the proposal from the Convention signed by 23 governments and every single member from the national parliaments, every MEP except one: make all documents and meetings open unless you decide a grounded derogation."
"This simple proposal will also solve most problems that bias lobbyism."
"We would then be able to see what they write to us or to the Commission and we would take part in the decisions on derogations from transparency, so we would know what is hidden from us and why."
"We need the lobbyists to raise and improve the laws."
"We need their knowledge and advice and counter-arguments from other interests."
"We need balanced or pluralist information since we were elected to serve all citizens equally."
"Thank you, Mr Bonde."
"I am sure you have the best wishes of many colleagues in your retirement."
"We may not always agree with what you say, but you are always worth listening to."
"(DE) Mr President, it is no secret that we live in a European Union in which events are bypassing citizens and increasingly benefiting the major companies."
"This is undoubtedly due, first and foremost, to the influence of lobbyists in Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Who would be surprised to hear, then, that the Alpine-Adriatic Convention which is so unpopular with the freight lobby is still not being implemented?"
"Who would be surprised to hear that more and more small and medium-sized enterprises are being forced to throw in the towel because they are snowed under with paperwork and regulations, and because they are literally being starved of any support from the funding opportunities available, while industry giants - the multinationals - understand only too well how to exploit these opportunities and, grasshopper-like, constantly relocate from one Member State to another, leaving a trail of devastated jobs in their wake?"
"Let us take the debate and the decision-making process on the much-discussed and contentious topic of the REACH draft legislation, which aims to improve safe use of chemicals, as an example: if citizens hear that out of 132 proposed amendments, 32 were identical and were accompanied by written recommendations from the chemical industry associations, if citizens hear this, they will of course steadily lose faith in Europe, and they will have the feeling that European policy-making is simply there to do the multinationals' bidding."
"If we want to prevent that, if we want to curb the growing Euro-scepticism, we must achieve a situation in which it is clear who is influencing decision-making in Europe, who is lobbying on behalf of donors and who these donors are, and who is seeking to bring influence to bear on the legislative process."
"Mr President, number one: we congratulate Alexander Stubb on his elevation to Foreign Minister in Finland."
"Number two: we congratulate Ingo Friedrich and thank him for taking over the report and, hopefully, bringing it to a good end this afternoon."
"But..."
"(DE) I will now continue in German."
"After this twofold tribute to Alexander Stubb, a 'but' is necessary."
"It is good to have rules on lobbying, but in Parliament, we already have good rules, and I am not entirely sure that this attempt to achieve a combined arrangement is really a wise move."
"Transparency is a good thing, but it cannot work miracles, especially if it is essentially piecemeal in nature."
"Registration and disclosure of the financial interests of registered lobbyists are all very well, but what about the numerous letter-writers, experts, and our other contacts?"
"How should we deal with them?"
"Will we expect them all of them to be registered in future, and to disclose their financial interests?"
"I do hope not!"
"Then there are the exceptions: in particular, two exceptions are proposed in two of the amendments which certainly do not promote transparency."
"Amendment 3 has already been mentioned."
"The aim is to bring about a situation in which the churches will be deemed to be official lobbyists."
"In my view, this is not about transparency; it is simply the reflection of an anti-clerical attitude, and we should say 'no' to that."
"A similar attempt is made in Amendment 10, namely to achieve an arrangement, via an exception to the exception, which also does not serve the matter at hand."
"In reality, this is simply an attempt to penalise certain sectors."
"We should ensure that we have a transparent system and that we improve it."
"However, we should not assume from the outset that this now represents a major change compared with the current situation."
"Mr President, we can be proud of the fact that the European Parliament in many ways is already at the forefront when compared to some national parliaments in terms of how we handle these issues."
"We already have a register of interests."
"We have a code of conduct for lobbyists, and we have an absolute prohibition on Members of Parliament receiving gifts."
"That is good."
"What the issue is here is whether we can extend this system to cover the other institutions."
"We are willing to embark on negotiations to attempt to do so, to try and reach agreement - because that would be better - and, secondly, whether we can upgrade the requirements and be even more at the forefront of openness and transparency."
"My group supports the report, which attempts to do that."
"We also support many of the amendments which would improve the report and would indeed increase the transparency requirements."
"We are even supporting some of the amendments from the Green Group, but not an amendment which would actually limit the way it is written and would actually set a ceiling on the transparency requirement."
"So I was somewhat astonished to hear the spokesman of the Committee on the Environment attack the Socialist Group for being less transparent than the Greens, when in fact the Greens have an amendment which, if you read it literally, would actually put a ceiling on the transparency requirement."
"That is the position of our group."
"We are at the forefront of openness and transparency on this, and we do resent unwarranted attacks on our position by groups who are trying to portray themselves in public opinion as being the champions of all this, ahead of everybody else, when they are not."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that there needs to be a compulsory register, a register accompanied by a code of conduct for lobbyists, but it should apply to all the institutions and above all, if I may say so, to the Commission."
"It is obviously vital that the code of ethical behaviour should lay down sanctions in the case of impropriety and make financial disclosure mandatory."
"These records should be easy to access and available for consultation via the internet; that would be ideal."
"The Friedrich report recognises that there are thousands of lobbyists seeking to influence the institutions' decisions, even though it should be acknowledged, all things considered, that in many instances they do provide MEPs with detailed information on various aspects of the measures under discussion."
"Personally, as those who know me will confirm, I am highly unlikely to be influenced by anyone at all."
"Notwithstanding that, in order to guarantee independent decision-making and oversee activities which are often geared to influencing the allocation of Community funds as well as the monitoring and implementation of legislation, rigorous ethical criteria must be scrupulously applied."
"I shall therefore vote in favour of the Friedrich report."
"(FR) Mr President, in order to clear up certain misunderstandings and correct the populist statements made by some Members here and in the press, I wish to point out, too, in my capacity as a Quaestor, that the European Parliament has had rules to govern our relations with lobbyists for 12 years."
"These rules, set out in Rule 9(4) of the Rules of Procedure - which would be worth reading at least once! - stipulate that access to the European Parliament for lobbyists is controlled, regulated by access badges."
"In order to obtain a badge, lobbyists must fill out an accreditation form and provide a character reference and a letter signed by the police."
"The European Parliament keeps a register of all lobbyists, which is published on the European Parliament's website."
"Accredited lobbyists must also comply with a code of conduct."
"Mrs Frassoni and others are thus stating the obvious."
"Any infringement of this code is punished by withdrawal of the lobbyist's badge and exclusion from the register."
"As regards the proposal for a single register, I do not think that there is any need for such a register with the Commission since the European Parliament and the Commission operate in completely different ways and, consequently, have different relationships with lobbyists."
"In the interest of the separation of powers at European level, Parliament must at all costs continue to be the sole body responsible for its Rules of Procedure."
"The Commission can copy our excellent system but we must have the last word when it comes to our own Rules."
"The report adopts a cautious approach to this register and I agree with that."
"As regards financial disclosure, I do not see why accredited lobbyists should have to provide detailed financial information indicating the source of their funding and the allocation of these resources."
"Such a measure would be totally impracticable and counterproductive."
"I am also of the opinion that the scope of the lobbying is not always reflected in the financial means."
"An organisation's good reputation and level of expertise are also crucial."
"I fully subscribe to the description of lobbying provided in recital D of the report. I must pay tribute to our former colleague, Alexander Stubb, with whom I did a lot of work on this issue, and I want to distance myself completely from the sweeping accusations made by the Greens who have spoken in this debate."
"I long ago learnt it is not worth trying to stop Mrs Lulling from speaking."
"(Laughter)"
"(DE) Mr President, the longer our esteemed colleague Mrs Lulling spoke for, the more points she offered for attack."
"The committee would like to have a common system in place in Brussels, because citizens do not make a distinction between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"To them, it is just Brussels; it is the EU!"
"I think that a common system would be good, and, Mr Kallas, we appeal to you to allow the working group to convene swiftly after today's debate and to draw up common rules which would still leave the individual institution the requisite autonomy to make its own decisions."
"I would also like the Council to be involved."
"The Council is a legislative body, just as we are, and of course lobbying plays a part in its ranks too."
"For that reason, the call to participate in this initiative goes out to the Council as well."
"Overall, we want a new system of transparency - a new culture of transparency - in Brussels, so that we can thus demonstrate openness and build confidence."
"Lobbying is good, and representation of interests must of course take place, but the rules must be clear."
"It must be a fair and honest process."
"We must ensure, above all, that it is not about selling opinions."
"With today's decision, we are taking a major step forward; that is beyond question."
"However, there is still a great deal of work to be done, because the devil is in the detail, for example on questions such as: who is a lobbyist?"
"The definition which we have provided in the report is very broad."
"In essence, we are saying that a lobbyist is anyone who wants to influence us."
"Nonetheless, there are exceptions."
"The municipalities, the regions, the social partners, the political parties: all of these are institutions which are enshrined in the Treaties."
"They are involved in lobbying as well, but they are not defined as lobbyists in our system."
"We will have to define the boundaries for lawyers and the churches as well."
"These are questions which have yet to be resolved."
"In my view, financial disclosure is important, Mrs Lulling."
"This is the new step forward which has been lacking until now."
"Money is not everything, but money is used to achieve a great deal."
"It is time to start work, and I would like to thank Mr Stubb and Mr Friedrich and, indeed, everyone else who has made a contribution to this process so far."
"(EL) Mr President, I think the topic we are discussing today is extremely interesting."
"I should say that for once the European Parliament is showing the way on an issue not discussed at all in our national parliaments, least of all in the Greek Parliament, and one to which no solution has been found."
"There are three important political problems involved here."
"Firstly, how do we deal with the issue?"
"Are we afraid of the way informal lobbyists go about their business or are we trying to operate transparently?"
"I believe we must do as follows."
"We must operate transparently; we should not be afraid of the lobbyists or of their existence, and we should lay down some rules."
"Secondly, how is transparency best achieved?"
"The answer is with very strict rules, regulating even sums of money, or in a general compulsory framework."
"I must emphasise here that this register could very usefully be mandatory and shared by all three EU institutions."
"Thirdly, we are talking about groups operating informally, but within an institutional process."
"It is crucial to distinguish between different types of lobbyists."
"Greenpeace and Shell have nothing in common when they act as lobbyists."
"That is why this distinction is essential, at least in the register."
"(SK) Lobbying is a legitimate part of every democratic system."
"Wherever democracy is not to be anarchy, clear rules must also apply to lobbying."
"American lobbyists consider their law to be too strict; on the other hand, in the new Member States, no rules exist, to the point where people often think of lobbying as having negative undertones."
"Therefore the new EU model should be somewhere between these extremes."
"My view is that the proposal to establish a common interinstitutional system for the mandatory registration of EU lobbyists, the disclosure of financial background and the 'legislative footprint' will contribute to the transparency of rules on lobbying."
"However, I also believe that after today's vote the churches will remain our partners and will not be classified as lobby groups."
"I am convinced that the Stubb/Friedrich report will eliminate all kinds of prejudices and negative views about lobbying and that European citizens will view lobbyists as specialists who bring knowledge based on practical experience, helping to prevent European legislation from having a negative impact."
"(PL) Mr President, lobbying at the European institutions is a complex issue."
"On the one hand, access to the institutions' activities is a consequence of the principle of transparency of their operation laid down in the founding treaties."
"It is also a way of bridging the gap involving the so-called democratic deficit, because expert organisations provide valuable expert analyses which have a beneficial impact on the quality of European legislation."
"On the other hand, however, large international corporations can resort to specialist lobbying companies to influence the institutions' work, aiming to promote the corporations' own interests first and foremost."
"The problem of lobbying at the European Parliament is gaining prominence as the competences of this House increase."
"We should therefore support the Commission's initiative proposing cooperative interinstitutional work to define a framework of operation for lobbyists, including the creation of a common register of lobbyists."
"The principle of transparency pursuant to which lobbyists can access the work of the institutions should also be applied to the lobbyists themselves."
"Voluntary registration is not enough."
"It should become compulsory for lobbyists to register in order to gain access to the institutions of the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, I have been a Member of the European Parliament for twelve years."
"I must say, I feel I should thank many of the lobbyists, for they have proved to be a source of considerable expertise in our day-to-day work."
"In my view, it is always good for Members to listen to all sides and keep their door open to citizens."
"If we currently have 5 000 lobbyists registered with Parliament - all of whom we can recognise by their badges and who are accredited or certified, as it were - that works out at an average of six lobbyists for every Member."
"I think it is extremely important for us to utilise this expertise appropriately in our legislative work, for the fact is that Members cannot be specialists in every area."
"That is why it is important to listen to the practitioners and recognise that in reality, lobbyists do enhance our parliamentary work."
"- (SV) Mr President, as Mr Bonde pointed out, Europe is one of the world's most underdeveloped regions when it comes to rules on lobbying."
"However, we can make things better today by supporting the amendment calling for a mandatory register of financial interests and real sanctions for those who break the rules."
"In addition, we need to clarify what those people working in the Commission who are paid externally are actually doing."
"As many people point out, lobbying is not bad in itself, but the problem is that when we centralise decisions it becomes easy for large companies to turn economic power into political power."
"At least four fifths of lobbyists are paid by big companies."
"That imbalance affects our legislation."
"Transparency must therefore mean that all amendments to legal texts submitted by lobbyists must be registered openly so that we can see who is behind them."
"When the register of those who are allowed to come here is set up, I call upon Mrs Lulling to ensure that one third of the places are given to companies, one third to non-governmental organisations and one third to others."
"That will enable us to have a balance."
"(ES) Mr President, when we talk about transparency, we cannot talk in the abstract."
"Our voters should know who is in the seats of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy when we are discussing REACH or the telecommunications package; they should know who is tabling amendments; they should know who is preparing many of the reports of this Parliament, which they can find out through this Parliament's webpage, and they should know, through a register, who is spending hundreds of hours in the corridors of Parliament."
"This is all possible."
"Just as they should know who attends a committee meeting and who attends plenary - through Parliament's website - our voters should know which lobbyists are spending hundreds of hours at our meetings."
"We want transparency, but we want this to be truthful."
"We want it to be known, after the vote on each report, which lobbyists have tabled the amendments that are shaping our future, word for word, amendment by amendment. Thank you."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the debate about lobbying is always interesting and exciting."
"I enjoyed very much hearing the observations of the honourable Members, which reflect the understanding which was also mentioned here by Mr Leinen: the devil is always in the details."
"I totally agree with Mrs Frassoni that work will not be finished with this report or even with the opening of the Commission's registers."
"I can assure Parliament that we are very cooperative and we are doing everything we can to start this interinstitutional group and to work out a common approach as soon and as smoothly as possible."
"I would like to say that, in my view, this common register is not some kind of heavy animal which will threaten everybody."
"It is a common package of information, common storage of all necessary information so that all interested representatives do not need to submit different applications to different institutions, with these applications not being interoperable."
"This was your suggestion for how not to create a burden."
"But all other details have been discussed over the years since we started our debate about this in 2005."
"I shall only say - in answer to one point you raised - that there are, of course, a lot of complicated details in defining who is lobbying and on what subject."
"In our discussions we have met lawyers' organisations."
"They have accepted our approach that, when and if they are really acting as lobbyists, then they must declare this as lobbying and they have no need to declare their activities as legal advisers or something like that."
"There is just one thing that I must say in connection with what was raised: the issue that some people are working in the Commission and receiving salaries from the private sector."
"This is finished."
"We have still some finished contracts, but this practice has ended."
"I would like to thank Mr Friedrich for taking over the report from Mr Stubb, who has our congratulations on being appointed Finnish Foreign Minister."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a. m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The pluralism of interests is an important feature of democracy."
"It is therefore legitimate that members of society organise and lobby for their interests."
"However, lobbying does lead to the risk that democratic principles may be corrupted."
"The power of corporations to influence politicians can lead to unequal access to law- and decision-making processes vis-à-vis the ordinary citizen."
"Very few European countries have regulated lobbying."
"This parliamentary report on lobbying will be a valuable step in strengthening transparency, accountability and citizens' participation in the democratic process at the European level."
"However experience in countries that have implemented lobbying legislation shows that this should only be one part of a broader range of guidelines and measures."
"From non-transparent lobbying it is only a short step to corruption and the distortion of the market to the detriment of those companies who play by the rules."
"The involvement of industry representatives in preparing this report is welcome."
"They should now be urged to take up the initiative and show that responsible corporations have a vital role to play in the process of regulating lobbying."
"in writing. - (PL) Special thanks and congratulations are due not only to the rapporteur but also to Commissioner Kallas, who took the lead regarding new regulations for the principles of lobbying."
"This is particularly important in view of the new competences to be acquired by the European Parliament pursuant to adoption of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Nonetheless, I wish to express my concern as to the effectiveness and credibility of a voluntary register of lobbyists."
"The register should be compulsory and common to all European institutions."
"In view of its nature, Parliament should retain its autonomy, however."
"Compulsory registration should apply to the whole range of lobbying bodies."
"I have in mind, amongst others, regional representations, sectoral organisations, lawyers undertaking a lobbying role and research institutions."
"All those who exercise influence in order to obtain economic or social benefits should be registered."
"The requirement to submit only financial information is not always reliable and does not enable a full assessment to be undertaken as intended."
"in writing. - (PL) Regulation of lobbying should certainly be welcomed."
"At last there is a chance of transparent cooperation between Parliament and interested groups, namely lobbyists."
"It is proposed to create a compulsory register of all lobbyists interested in presenting and defending their interests at the European institutions."
"This proposal deserves our support."
"Entry on the register would allow interested lobbyists to access the European Parliament's premises, attend committee meetings and also to make contact with Members in their offices, but without disrupting their work."
"The effectiveness of civilised and therefore transparent lobbying largely depends, however, on the lobbyists' behaviour."
"It will therefore be necessary to draw up a code of ethical practice for lobbyists at the same time."
"Parliament should also monitor implementation of these provisions, especially as regards checking the veracity of the information on the register."
"Lobbyists providing inadequate or untrue information should be sanctioned."
"The sanctions imposed should be in proportion to the offence and serve as a deterrent, ranging from suspension of registration to permanent exclusion from the register inclusive."
"It should be remembered that this new proposal was drawn up at the European Parliament's own initiative."
"The proposal will also prove very helpful to other European institutions and to the national parliaments of Member States of the European Union that have not yet adopted measures in this regard."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption of this report, which, in my view, will enable us to improve significantly the relations between interest representatives and the EU institutions."
"Rather than trying to establish and keep up-to-date a comprehensive list of these representatives - a tedious and perhaps even impossible task - it proposes, in particular, establishing a global definition of the term 'lobby', which will ensure that any bodies that are not on the list cannot get around the rules we have laid down."
"Another major step forward is the harmonisation and simplification of the regulatory framework applicable to lobbyists, and in particular the creation of a single register that is common to all the institutions, which will list all lobbyists and will, in the long term, become a reference and a pledge of seriousness and credibility for all accredited organisations."
"However, this register will also promote greater transparency vis-à-vis the general public because it will be accessible online in its entirety and will include for each body its complete identification details, including details of its staff, as well as all of the pertinent financial information relating to it."
"In addition to this 'one-stop shop' a common code of ethical behaviour, Members of the European Parliament who draw up a report will have the opportunity to list in the report the names of the organisations that have helped them with their work."
"in writing. - (RO) Consulting and involving as many groups of interests as possible in drafting, implementing and monitoring the enforcement of European laws is an objective requirement for the good development of the legislative process, for correcting errors and avoiding biased opinions."
"The open dialogue with the representatives of all the actors involved in this process lays at the basis of our democratic system and represents an important source of information, provided that this happens in total transparency."
"For this reason, the initiative of introducing a ""legislative imprint”, even if voluntary, both for the documents drafted by the Commission and for the European Parliament reports, is welcomed."
"Consulting as many interested parties as possible, including antagonistic parties, as well as making the process itself transparent, is essential for drafting a complex and honest legislation that would cover all aspects of the field, guaranteeing the balance and efficient harmonization of all the points of view, avoiding conflicts of interests and preventing subsequent deficiencies."
"The correct exchange of information regarding the lobby organizations attached to the European institutions will determine, in the long term, not only the facilitation of the legislative process, but also the transparent and equitable cooperation between the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, a cooperation whose ultimate beneficiary is, without any doubt, the European citizen."
"in writing. - The lobbying report which we have been discussing is an important step toward transparency."
"When we can show who has been consulted on any one legislative package, it gives legitimacy to the process which is so important for us here."
"It is equally important to make sure that all interests that approach Parliament have to register."
"We cannot allow any loopholes which would let some interests go unregistered."
"For one, lawyers and think-tanks that take part in lobbying activities are for all intents and purposes lobbyists and should therefore be registered."
"In short, I would like to welcome this report which is a good first step in the move for greater transparency."
"in writing. - (ET) The report tabled by Alexander Stubb is extremely important as the number of lobbyists in Brussels will soon be the same as the number of European Commission officials."
"I welcome the fact that, unlike the European Commission, Parliament is supporting the idea that a register of lobbyists should be mandatory."
"If that were not the case the report would not fulfil its primary objective and indeed would fail in its task."
"On the issue of including lawyers on the list, which is currently the main bone of contention, I favour inclusion in a mandatory register."
"There is no reason to exclude them from the register as lobbying of European Union institutions is increasingly conducted through law firms."
"Law firms should not be given the opportunity simply to classify any activity as legal consultation and thereby eschew the register and the requirement for transparency in lobbying."
"The idea of a 'one-stop' register is a good one."
"It is important for the Council to be involved with the register as well as the European Parliament and the Commission."
"In the interests of usability of the data collected, a single data base, available on-line and accessible to all the institutions, should be established as a matter of urgency."
"White Paper on Sport (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Manolis Mavrommatis, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the White Paper on Sport."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the Commission and Commissioner Figeľ for their initiative in drawing up the White Paper on Sport and the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan."
"This is the EU's first effort to deal with sporting matters."
"May I also thank Commissioner Špidla for being here today in place of Commissioner Figeľ, who is travelling outside Europe."
"My thanks also go to my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"They have cooperated excellently in drafting the report on the White Paper on Sport."
"In the European Parliament report, the key points of the White Paper were covered by 16 conciliation amendments jointly agreed by all the political groups in the Committee on Culture."
"The main points were also covered by 426 amendments tabled to the lead committee and to the other seven committees, which gave their opinions."
"Doping is once again the focus of attention because there are unfortunate examples of it every year in almost every sport."
"Through the White Paper, the European Parliament seeks to adopt measures allowing athletes not be forced by their heavy schedules to resort to performance- and stamina-enhancing substances."
"In addition, internal and external independent checks on professional associations and sports organisations, as well as educating male and female athletes on the side effects of doping may help to curb this problem."
"Debates have focused on two issues of the financial side of sport."
"The first is sports betting."
"We in the Committee on Culture all agree that the possible deregulation of the gaming and lotteries market will be problematic for the funding of amateur sport so long as the existing system of state betting agencies provides it with considerable income."
"For this reason, the White Paper calls on Member States and the Commission to adopt regulations which ensure that amateur and professional sport is protected from any improper influence relating to betting."
"While continuing to protect the betting market, we are thus increasing transparency, and also guaranteeing the state aid for amateur sport, culture and other social activities."
"The second issue is the sale of media rights."
"As we all know, the 27 EU Member States go about selling television rights for major sporting events in different ways."
"This is especially true of Champions League matches and the UEFA Cup."
"Rights can be sold either individually or collectively, but they are the main source of income for professional sport in Europe."
"Similarly, rights to sports events are a vital source of programme content and income for many media owners."
"Parliament's report also recognises the importance of fairly redistributing income among sports associations, however small, and between professional and amateur sport."
"The collective sale of media rights, which the Commission presents as incompatible with competition law, is therefore important for the redistribution of income."
"It may thus help to achieve greater solidarity among sports."
"We therefore call on the Commission to recognise collective sales and accept that such practical solidarity among small sports clubs is sanctioned by law."
"Lastly, as we stated in the Belet report on professional football, UEFA and FIFA should reach agreement and work with the agencies of the Commission."
"They must ensure that football is universally accepted by the citizens and Member States of the EU without losing its independence; it must not overstep the powers conferred on it by the statutes."
"It is important for everyone that UEFA and FIFA recognise in their statutes the right of recourse to common courts."
"We must, of course, accept the principle of self-regulation and the structures of the European model of sport governing the organisation of sports events."
"Let me end by reaffirming the satisfaction we all feel at the official recognition of sport by the Member States in the reformed Lisbon Treaty."
"We do of course recognise and respect the special nature of sport."
"It is of great significance for Member States and the sporting world in general that the EU will in future be able to substantially contribute to and promote European policy on sport."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) In the first place I should present apologies from my colleague Commissioner Figeľ, who cannot take part in this sitting because of a long-planned working visit to Egypt."
"I accepted the proposal that I should deputise for him with pleasure, inter alia because much of what falls within my competence is closely related to sport."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent report that he and his colleagues in Parliament have spent six months preparing."
"I am convinced that the report is a balanced document and deals with all the relevant themes."
"Thank you for the European Parliament's support for the White Paper on Sport and for your high level of cooperation with the European Commission."
"As the European Parliament has emphasised, it is important to recall the principle of the applicability of Community law to sports in Europe, whilst also respecting the specific nature of sport."
"Therefore the European Commission remains active on sport, and from now on will apply Community law, including the competition rules, to that area."
"The White Paper and its annexes are useful aids for sporting organisations and for Member States in the concrete application of the acquis communautaire to decisions in the area of competition and to judgments of the European Court of Justice."
"On the question of the specific nature of sport, the European Commission will lead and support open dialogue with sports organisations, Member States and the European Parliament within the framework of the structured dialogue on sport."
"This dialogue will be conducted in such a way that issues of the specific characteristics of sport will be dealt with concretely."
"The European Commission does not have any general objections to the amendments to be discussed at this plenary session, especially if their aim is to preserve the proper and equal participation of representative structures in controlling sport."
"However, we cannot agree with an unconditional obligation for young players to sign their first professional contract with the club that has trained them, because this infringes the fundamental freedom of free movement of workers."
"Meanwhile, as you know, the implementation of the White Paper is continuing according to plan."
"Twenty-six of the 53 actions in the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan have already been carried out; this year, for example, three studies will be initiated (with results in 2009), on the following themes: sports funding, players' agents, and volunteering in sport."
"In autumn last year, under the leadership of my colleagues, Commissioner Frattini and Commissioner Figeľ, a conference took place on the high level of violence in sport, which identified concrete methods that could achieve an improvement in combating this phenomenon."
"The results of measuring the impact of sport on the economy can also be viewed as a significant success."
"As far as the matter of 'home-grown players' is concerned, a short time ago the European Commission was handed the results of an independent expert report analysing UEFA's rules."
"The European Commission is at this very moment examining the compatibility of these rules with Community law."
"New possibilities for funding sport and physical activities have also been opened up by various EU programmes, especially the lifelong learning programmes 'Youth in action and 'Europe for citizens'."
"We hope that the Lisbon Treaty will soon come into force and we are delighted with the European Parliament's support for the preparatory actions in the field of sport, which contribute to implementation of the new EU competence in this area."
"Allow me to thank you once again for your contribution, support and splendid cooperation in this important, sensitive and very popular area."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (NL) Well, Mr Špidla has said it all."
"An important role has been set aside in sport for employment, for social affairs."
"Sport does indeed have an important social function, for example fighting problems such as racism."
"Racism in society is reflected by racism in sport."
"I am extremely glad of the attention that this White Paper pays to eliminating racism and discrimination, in both professional and amateur sport."
"Sport also has many advantages for, to take some examples, social inclusion, integration of migrants or reintegration into the labour market."
"For this reason I welcome the Commission's recommendation to direct the Member States to make use of the EU's existing funds."
"Furthermore, sport is becoming more and more professional, and there is a need for good training for sportswomen and sportsmen so that after their careers they can return to society."
"I have one final point: it is also important to improve the professional qualities of sports managers and for this reason we support a licensing system at European level."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (NL) I would like to thank the Members for their extremely pleasant cooperation on this report."
"I think, however, that it must have taken a great deal of time to achieve this proposal."
"I find, sadly, that in some matters it does not go far enough."
"It is very important, in my opinion, to create guidelines to which sporting organisations can commit themselves."
"When it comes to State support, we should aim for the same treatment throughout Europe, particularly where professional sporting organisations are concerned."
"I also find that the distinction between the specific characteristics of sport and the economic activities that frequently accompany sport is a little too explicit, because I believe that economic activities - including those that protect sport - cannot have exceptions made for them in the Treaty."
"That is fortunately also not mentioned in this report."
"That is also the reason why I wholeheartedly support it."
"I think it is good that sporting organisations have started talking more than they did formerly about this subject, and that is a significant step forward. Thank you very much."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (ES) Mr President, I am convinced that the subsequent legislative development of Article 149 of the Lisbon Treaty will positively benefit sport in the European Union."
"However, in territorial terms or, in other words, on the ground, I believe that the European Commission, in exercising its legislative initiative, must act carefully with regard to the different local situations and the differences between sporting disciplines."
"Its contributions should be general and should respond to an overall European interest, and not to a thirst for interventionism."
"It must therefore be respectful of the principle of subsidiarity."
"This is what the Committee on Regional Development thought."
"As a result, I welcome the amendments tabled by various parliamentary groups in this same respect and I hope that, this morning, the House can adopt these through a positive vote."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, I welcome the white paper on sport and I particularly support the emphasis on securing greater legal certainty, because relying on a case-by-case approach in the courts has led to an inconsistency of approach in terms of governing sport."
"I note the actions that the Commission has outlined this morning, but I would like to ask the Commissioner to comment on whether it intends to propose guidelines to clarify which aspects of sport are governed by EU law and which are exempt and should be dealt with by sporting bodies."
"Another issue which I believe the Commission needs to tackle urgently is that of illegal trafficking of children, especially from West Africa, to the European Union due to demand in Europe for talented African players."
"This has sparked a growth of unlicensed football academies in some African countries and I am deeply concerned that young children are being exploited by ruthless agents and then sold on to clubs as if they were commodities."
"Some find themselves abandoned in Europe, having sacrificed their family's entire savings to pursue their dreams."
"Stronger action by Member States, European clubs and African governments should be taken to ensure that they do not participate in this."
"Finally, I would like to ask the Commission what deliberations it has engaged in on the issue of sports and intellectual property rights, especially with the growing accessibility of sports footage on the internet."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Few people know that sport accounts for 4% of the European Union's gross domestic product and provides employment for some 15 million people."
"If this statement is true, then it is likely that revenue and employment indicators for sport will be similar in the statistics for individual Member States."
"This stands in stark contrast, however, to the fact that some countries, unfortunately including my own country Hungary, spend only a tiny fraction of their national budget - something like a half of one per cent - on promoting sports and healthy lifestyles."
"There are therefore good grounds for asking who exactly is supporting whom?"
"If we take the role of sport seriously, then sport should not just be a profit-generating sector; we should be seeking to ensure that governments not only put their moral weight behind sport but also much greater financial support than previously."
"In my opinion, the next generation's health, their physical and emotional health, capacity for work - their sense of wellbeing if you like - is a strategic issue, and so I welcome the White Paper on Sport and the fact that the Lisbon Treaty is dealing substantively with this issue."
"Let us not forget that sport is an important educational tool; it is important for social cohesion and for maintaining health, and it contributes to our quality of life."
"In this case, however, the amount spent on sport - barely half of one per cent in some countries - is out of all proportion to the significance of sport as a social phenomenon."
"I sincerely hope that the 'Pierre de Coubertin' Action Plan that forms part of the White Paper will be taken seriously by the Member States and that the Commission will provide the necessary guidance and, where appropriate, economic assistance from the development funds at its disposal."
"I also hope that from now on no one in Europe will be able to say that they do not really know what we mean when we talk about sport, as the White Paper provides excellent guidance in this regard for all governments and sports ministers."
"As a sports leader myself, I am delighted that the document also refers to the autonomy, self-regulating capacity and specificity of sports organisations."
"I congratulate my honourable friend Mr Mavrommatis. Thank you."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, first I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, for his excellent work and commitment to this report."
"To begin with, I want to say that I think it is very important that during the implementation phase of the White Paper the policies on sport as a general-interest, non-profit, voluntary activity should remain priorities in Europe."
"It is also vital that through this document we are able to say we have respect for the specificity of sport, self-regulation and structured dialogue, and we therefore want to lay down guidelines for the application of European Union law in sport."
"Furthermore, there is a crucial link between sport, exercise and public health."
"Current problems we have in Europe that we are trying to control are metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and obesity."
"Healthy exercise enables us to prevent these problems in the best possible way."
"Secondly, we need to realise that it is important for the European Sport for All policy to retain national gambling systems."
"They need to be preserved because they have created a unique opportunity to finance amateur sport, as well as culture, science and research."
"Other social sectors have thus benefitted from sport."
"This needs to be taken into consideration in the future."
"Thirdly, I want to mention that sport will acquire a firmer legal basis under the Lisbon Treaty."
"We also have to prepare for this new situation, with a pilot programme and budget headings for 2009 being planned now."
"We have to move on from words to deeds, and that also holds true for sport."
"We can achieve much overall with the document being discussed."
"I would once again like to thank Commissioner Figel, and, in particular, that great man of sport, Mr Mavrommatis, who has done pioneering work to promote sport's new march forward in the context of European culture and society."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the development of sport and support for its many facets is rightly considered to be one of the European Community's strategic aims."
"The report deals with some very important issues related to regulation of the organisation of sport, and emphasises its economic dimension."
"I am very pleased to note also the prominence given to so-called sport for all."
"Supporting this notion is particularly important, because a large proportion of sporting ventures at club and association level are not undertaken for financial gain."
"For that reason they are in fact in danger of disappearing as the market has become so commercialised."
"Recognition of the importance of amateur sport is therefore in line with the idea of bringing sport close to the citizens."
"The report rightly draws attention to negative phenomena in the sporting world."
"I refer for instance to doping and to the exploitation of sports people."
"Even young sports people at the start of their careers are at risk, and protecting them is a priority issue."
"Hence the restrictive provisions concerning the transfer of young sports people and the approval of the principles regarding signature of the first contract with the club that trained the young person."
"This is a step in the right direction, as is joining forces to combat doping and coordinating activities at international level."
"Guaranteeing professional sports people the same rights as contracted workers is also important."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate Mr Mavrommatis on preparing a good report."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the White Paper on Sport, following on from the own-initiative report on the future of professional football, known as the Belet report, is a substantial and necessary document."
"It was time for the European Parliament and the European Commission to tackle the issue of sport."
"However, good intentions are not enough to cope with the scourges and problems threatening our sports."
"In the face of scourges such as racism, mafia-style groups, violence inside and outside sports facilities, doping and the purchase of young disposable players from Africa or elsewhere, action is needed!"
"Given the difficulties such as the management of huge sums of money - notably in football but in other sports, too - the existence of agents of all types - agents for players, clubs, coaches - the dictates of ratings, the liberalisation of gambling, we need clear directives that allow for continuity and the development of European sports federations and leagues at both amateur and professional level."
"Sport, the economy, finance, employment, diplomacy: today these are all closely related."
"Athletes should not have to pay the price even if they are also citizens who can and must act in good conscience."
"It is up to the politicians to assume their responsibilities."
"The European Union will have to do so at the Olympic Games in China in order to reaffirm that respect for cultures, for local religious beliefs and for democracy are essential and non-negotiable."
"We will vote in favour of the report by Mr Mavrommatis on the White Paper on sport as it is an excellent report."
"The Olympic flame is presently travelling across all the continents of the world, reminding us of the message of sport, for which we are indebted to the Greeks."
"They were of course the first to understand what a purifying role sport can play in human culture."
"Sport teaches us that people can compete with one another without causing harm, injury or even death; sport teaches fair play and offers everybody the same chances and the same rights."
"But modern times have made sport into a business, a milieu pervaded by the negative influences that we already encounter almost everywhere: money, corruption, lobbying, racial prejudice and also the new phenomenon of various performance-enhancing drugs, factors that damage the integrity of sport and reduce the positive potential that sport has for bringing up young people or breaking down barriers between peoples and races."
"Therefore I welcome the Commission's work on the White Paper on Sport and I value Mr Mavrommatis's report."
"Both documents warn of the need to protect sport as a cultural value."
"I would also personally like to emphasise even more the need to support sport at the amateur level too, to create the conditions needed for people to participate in recreational sporting activity, which is not easy, especially in large conurbations, as well as making it financially accessible, which is a limiting factor for the socially disadvantaged."
"Sport offers children and young people an alternative way of using their free time and being active."
"It can serve all the generations in the same spirit, so we should also not forget older citizens and should instead look for further ways of making it possible for them to join in sporting activity."
"Sport is a means of improving physical condition, but obviously it also influences the human psyche."
"Professional sport is only the apex of a pyramid whose base must be created by sporting activity involving the greatest number of people on our planet."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, it will not surprise you, but I do not welcome the conclusions of this report."
"The fact that it declares 'sport is rightly subject to the application of the acquis communautaire' flies in the face of all current evidence."
"It ignores the most public lament of sports bodies throughout Europe: that the Bosman and Kolpak rulings have left then unable to foster the development of home-grown sports talent."
"As a direct result, national teams are underperforming on the international stage."
"Even the president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, believes the rules need to be changed."
"But if sports bodies thought the current situation was bad, the Lisbon Treaty is going to make things even worse by providing the Commission with the treaty heading it requires to start interfering - I am sorry, legislating - over sport directly."
"The UK Government's refusal to honour its promise to hold a referendum on the Treaty means we do not have the opportunity to save sport in the UK from the impending doom of Commission interference."
"Perhaps the vote in Ireland will save us all."
"(BG) Mr. President, dear colleagues, those who know me can tell for sure that sport and everything related to physical education is a way of life for me."
"I accept the publication of the White Paper on Sport with the hope that it will provide the foundations of a future consistent policy."
"I believe that when we speak of an European policy in this field, we should think, first and foremost, of our children, their health, future and social integration."
"The encouragement of sport in the educational standards is an important factor for the psychological and physical development of our children, a major tool for the protection of their health."
"The adoption of the White Paper and the establishment of an integrated structure at the European level to develop, promote and implement common policies in each type of sport, starting from sport for the youngest all the way to professional sport, not forgetting, of course, people with disabilities, will offer all citizens opportunities for participation and personal involvement in the community and contribute to the encouragement of the intercultural dialogue."
"(NL) What should have been a memorable moment here this morning, namely the approval of the report on the White Paper, has been overshadowed by the tragic death of one of Belgium's top footballers."
"The footballer François Sterckele was this morning involved in a traffic accident."
"He was one of the greatest talents in Belgian football."
"I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of François Sterckele and to the supporters of Club Brugge."
"As a young footballer and a young talent, ladies and gentlemen, Sterckele got all his chances in various clubs in Belgium, and there he eventually developed into the top scorer in the Belgian league."
"He is excellent proof that investing in young talent, our own talent, really pays dividends."
"That is exactly, ladies and gentlemen, what we want to support by means of this report."
"For this reason, we support, too, the 'home-grown' regulations, such as those applied by UEFA."
"We also appreciate that the European Commission is prepared to support the training of young players."
"Other than that, I would like to advise you to read the annual report of the Deutsche Bundesliga, which has just come out."
"The German league is, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, a role model for Europe."
"Here are a couple of examples: it has very strict licensing regulations, it invests a lot in its own talent and it also has clear rules to prevent German clubs being sold off to investors who have no connection with either the club or the supporters."
"The joint initiative of two representatives of the Council, the French and the Dutch Ministers for Sport, is a perfect answer."
"We expect, therefore, that the French Presidency in the autumn will work to introduce measures securing the future of professional and amateur sport in Europe."
"(NL) I would like first of all to begin by thanking Mr Mavrommatis for his outstanding report and excellent cooperation."
"I spoke a moment ago as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and now I am speaking as shadow rapporteur for the press."
"I would like to underline three points, namely the importance of clear directives, the importance of the lotteries and home-grown players."
"First of all, I would like us to look at the specific aspects of sport and sporting organisations that require clear guidelines, where European legislation applies."
"I think that we must then give an answer in place of our hitherto preoccupied, case-by-case approach."
"Secondly, let us consider home-grown players."
"We must ensure that professional players of a young age are protected and are trained in an atmosphere of stability."
"For this reason we support the so-called home-grown players rule so that young people are trained by a club and can get their first contract with the same club."
"In this way it will naturally be the case that many national players can play in a club, without us discriminating on the basis of nationality, which is not the intention."
"We must respect the free movement of players, and that is an important principle for us."
"For this reason we do not disagree with FIFA's so-called 'six-plus-five' regulation."
"Finally, we come to the lotteries."
"National lotteries have an important function."
"You could say that they perform a public service, as they support many social organisations, including sports structures."
"Liberalising the market has a positive impact, and therefore before any action is taken, its impact and viable alternatives must be carefully examined."
"(RO) Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Mavromatis for this report."
"The initiative of a White Paper on Sport is not only opportune, but also necessary."
"Taking into consideration the great number of employees in the field of sport, as well as the revenues sport generates, we should pay more attention to the manner in which the labour law is implemented in this field; many times, performance is achieved at early ages, but this is only one step away from exploiting minors."
"We should make sure that the revenues coming from sport activities are legally obtained and taxed according to the law."
"Violence in sport represents another problem."
"Human lives are lost every year in confrontations between supporters."
"On the one hand, the police forces and the clubs should cooperate in order to ensure a comfortable and safe environment during the sport events, and, on the other hand, the legal system should toughen punishments for violent acts related to sport events."
"In conclusion, Mr. President, I think that Mr. Mavromatis' report proves that, at a European level, we need a coherent policy and concrete actions in order to turn to good account and make sport more efficient and I hope we will see more initiatives in this respect."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the insertion of the new Article 149 into the Treaty of Lisbon constitutes recognition of the major economic and social role played by sport."
"The detailed report by Manolis Mavrommatis highlights the numerous areas of life affected by sport, and I should like to look at just a few of them."
"The first is the relationship between sport and health: although everyone is well aware by now that physical activity is essential in order to remain in good shape, there is a worrying tendency in certain EU Member States to reduce the number of hours devoted to sport in schools."
"This trend, combined with a poor diet, is creating an army of obese youngsters, with the possibility of negative repercussions on their physical condition."
"Sport is an original and enjoyable way to learn a language."
"Back in the early 1970s I learned of a very well-organised and widespread system of study vacations in the United Kingdom geared to learning the language of Shakespeare through the practice of various sporting disciplines."
"Sport ought to support brotherhood among nations, but unfortunately that is not always the case: we regularly witness scenes of indescribable violence inside and outside of stadiums, especially in the case of football."
"Amateur and professional sport, uncontaminated and unpolluted sport, sport as a personal development tool, an instrument of cohesion and solidarity among peoples: we are still a long way away from satisfactory standards in Europe, Mr President, and the responsibility lies entirely with politics."
"We can only hope that the White Paper on Sport will act as a wake-up call and reverse the trend once and for all, so as to make up for an excessive lack of sensitivity and too many sins of omission."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Mavrommatis on his good report and his excellent cooperation with all our fellow Members who were interested in this issue, and there were many of them."
"Sport plays a more important role than had previously been recognised in the Commission and Council."
"In my view, this White Paper and the report are a good basis for developing all future activities and policies in the field of sport, especially since the Treaty of Lisbon finally gives sport the legal basis that it deserves."
"The White Paper and this report endeavour to strike a balance between competing interests, different types of sport, amateur and professional sport, between the specific characteristics of sport and the requirements of EU legislation, between social and cultural, economic and financial interests, and between profit and voluntary participation in these fields."
"I believe, therefore, that this endeavour deserves our genuine recognition. It opens up the opportunity to promote and cultivate the European model of sport."
"It thus maintains the specific characteristics of our sports organisations, which, after all, largely work on an autonomous basis and wish to continue doing so, especially as they tend to be highly reliant on volunteers' input."
"Secondly, we must try to support and promote the implementation of self-regulatory mechanisms at national and European level."
"May I recall paragraph 16 here, which I believe is extremely important."
"Thirdly, the report offers greater legal certainty with regard to the application of EU legislation to sport."
"Fourthly, the role of sport in education is an issue which has been mentioned frequently, and I would remind you of my report on this topic which dates back to 2004."
"Fifthly, the report discusses economic aspects, including the requisite financial commitment, particularly through lotteries, which has not been ruled out for the various sports here."
"Ten years ago, in my report on the role of the European Union in the field of sport, we called for a White Paper, and I am pleased that we are able to vote on it today."
"(DE) Mr President, for a long time now, all the sports organisations have been calling for sport to be given greater significance and, indeed, greater visibility than has hitherto been the case, and we are acting on this call today."
"It will come into even sharper focus with the Lisbon Treaty."
"The many aspects of sport - its contribution to society, its role in personal development and fulfilment and in promoting social integration, etc. - have already been underlined."
"Sport is also a very important factor in promoting health, which is why it is worthwhile investing on a broad basis in sport, and particularly in physical education in schools."
"That is an investment that really would pay dividends."
"We are therefore appealing to every minister of education in the Member States to introduce a requirement for at least three hours of physical education in schools per week."
"That is the minimum, for otherwise, there is little point to it."
"There are 700 000 clubs and associations which are making an invaluable contribution to our society, and that is why I oppose the possible liberalisation of gambling and the lotteries, for at present around 10% of levies accrued from this industry go into sports, the arts and social amenities, and without this funding these organisations could not survive."
"I would ask everyone to be mindful of that."
"The important economic dimension of sport is borne out by the statistics: sport generated value-added of EUR 407 billion in 2004 and created 15 million jobs; there are other figures, too, which prove my point."
"That means that rules are needed."
"We need to strike a careful balance between the economic aspects of sport, transparency, sale of clubs, and licensing, as Mr Belet has just emphasised."
"Here, we need rules which are fair, so that 'fair play' has genuine and practical meaning."
"We need to make sure that there is appropriate redistribution between small and large clubs, so that we can develop the next generation of sportsmen and sportswomen."
"In my view, there should be a more equitable balance in the media."
"There really is more to sport than football."
"Nonetheless, I would like to extend a warm invitation to everyone to come and enjoy the Euro 2008 games in Vienna."
"That is a major sporting event which I am certainly looking forward to."
"Mr President, in sport we must not let good intentions bring unintended consequences."
"Economic competition rules cannot always apply."
"Collective selling of television rights is the financial lifeline for many clubs that would otherwise be squeezed out by the famous."
"In a utopian world we could watch everything and never pay, but in the real world that would result in little of quality being left to watch."
"Observance of copyright protects the income that maintains high-quality events."
"Rising instances of ambush marketing and circulation of unauthorised highlights is as damaging as any other kind of piracy."
"It is also imperative not to inhibit flexibility in the means of raising income, movement of players or their ability to choose where to sign their first contracts. Finally, we should stick firmly to subsidiarity and keeping decision-making within the industry and close to fans."
"(PL) Mr President, the White Paper refers to long-standing problems such as doping, and to issues regarding financial disputes between television companies over broadcasting rights, which obviously have negative consequences for both fans and viewers."
"In addition, the White Paper deals with a much more serious problem that constitutes an increasing threat to honest sport, notably football."
"I refer to betting establishments."
"They may well represent the greatest challenge to contemporary sport."
"By way of example I could mention the latest scandal to affect the national football league of the country we are currently in."
"The Chinese Mafia is said to have fixed the results of Belgian football matches."
"The forthcoming liberalisation of the market in games of chance, including those related to the world of sport, will create further temptation to infringe the principles of fair play."
"Finally, I have to say that I do not agree to the European Parliament's proposal opposing FIFA's stance on the principle of six players from a given country."
"FIFA's proposal is sound. It will be the saving of national sport."
"(PL) Mr President, one of the fundamental difficulties I should like to highlight is the lack of legal certainty."
"The Commission has not established clearly which aspects of the organisation of sport are covered by Community legislation and which are of a purely sporting nature and therefore fall within the competence of the sports organisations."
"I share the rapporteur's opinion that relying exclusively on the European Court of Justice does not provide further legal clarity."
"The European Commission's stance whereby regulation of the organisation of sport must comply with the Treaties does not do so either."
"This is not enough."
"I therefore support the appeal to the European Commission to adopt interpretative guidelines that will bring clarity and precision to operations in this field."
"It should of course be emphasised that any action by the Commission must comply with the principle of self-regulation in sport."
"It must also respect the structures of the European sport model and the fundamental principles governing the organisation of sporting competitions."
"I disagree with the views of certain sports organisations that believe that there would be more disputes in court following some kind of consolidation or codification of principles relating to the activities of sport beyond the strictly sporting context, complying of course with the principles of self-regulation."
"In my opinion, the opposite would be the case."
"Greater legal certainty can only be beneficial."
"I should also like to appeal to sports organisations to accept the right of appeal to the common courts."
"Every individual has the right to appeal to the courts."
"The competence of tribunals of a strictly sporting nature is not at issue, but the restriction of these rights by certain sports organisations is unacceptable."
"Finally, I should like to raise another very important matter."
"Sport plays a very important role in society."
"The Member States should therefore retain the right to take measures aimed at protecting the right to information and ensuring viewers' access to television broadcasts of major sport events."
"I have in mind the Olympic Games and the European Championship or World Cup."
"Everyone should be able to access such events freely."
"Before I conclude, I must thank Mr Mavrommatis for his excellent work on this report."
"Mr President, sport should, of course, be run by the sporting authorities themselves but, to the extent that it is also an economic activity, it unavoidably falls under employment law, competition law, copyright law, media rights and so on."
"The problem is that these laws have often been drawn up without the specific needs and requirements of sport in mind."
"Under the current Treaties, there is little leeway to take account of those specific needs."
"I am glad that with the Lisbon Treaty, there will be a greater margin to allow us to derogate, to make exceptions or to interpret laws with the specific needs of sport in mind."
"We cannot, for instance, apply competition law in its purely economic sense if that would ultimately destroy competition in its sporting sense."
"There is no better example of this than the collective sale of TV rights, as is practised by the English Premier League, for instance, with redistribution to all clubs."
"This is in contrast to Spain where two clubs pick up more than half of the TV revenue just for themselves."
"We should also accept that the UEFA scheme of home-grown players is a proportionate response and is acceptable under European Union law, unlike FIFA's bull-in-a-china-shop 'six-plus-five' scheme."
"(PL) Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to highlight the role of the regions and local government in developing sport infrastructure, organising widely accessible events, and promoting sport and a healthy lifestyle amongst the residents of local municipalities, that is to say, amongst European citizens."
"I should also like to draw attention to an issue related to access to sport for the disabled."
"The Member States should at least guarantee disabled pupils access to basic physical education classes."
"Wherever possible, these pupils should also have access to higher level classes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it should be remembered that sport is one of the most effective methods of achieving social integration."
"It ought therefore to receive much more significant support from the European Union, by way of special programmes, especially for the organisers of international sporting events for young people, including those that make a particular contribution to integration by involving disabled persons."
"Sport involves more than physical activity and health."
"It makes an invaluable contribution to developing the spirit of tolerance, honesty and respect for the principles of fair play."
"All this is particularly important for the children and young people who are today's young citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, before I speak I should declare that I have a number of financial interests related to this subject, which are listed in my declaration available on the internet."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, for his concern and knowledge of this subject, especially regarding doping in sport."
"In fact, the first draft of his report, before the amendments came in, was probably as good a document on this subject as you will ever find in short form."
"As ever, though, the committees came in at this point, and the amendments that were adopted in the Committee on Culture ruined just about any good work that was done."
"For example, the bizarre call for a European police force for sport in paragraph 59, or the talk about 'financial doping' in paragraph 16, which is having a snipe against private investment and in some cases inward investment into the European Union."
"This report unfortunately looks at sport through the lens of professional football."
"As a soccer referee, mainly at the amateur level, for the last 28 years, I can tell you this report does absolutely nothing to address the problems that amateur football has, let alone those of amateur sport in general."
"This House says that we are not trying to influence the decisions of governing bodies, but already we have seen in the debate today an attack on FIFA's 'six-plus-five' idea."
"Governing bodies should watch out."
"Giving the priority on sport to the European Union is not a good thing."
"Turning to sports betting, we have heard many views on this."
"Using this report to try and close down the debate on liberalising gambling and the lottery market is plainly wrong."
"This debate should go in a different direction and come from a different committee."
"Those that talk about it should just look at what is happening in Italy, where the gradual liberalisation of the market has grown the amount of money available to all."
"We have talked about the collective selling of television rights which I am in favour of because it has worked in the UK, but I strongly believe in subsidiarity and surely this should be left to the Member States."
"There are many good things in this white paper on sport, even if too little mention is made of the Special Olympics and the Paralympics movements."
"But, overall, this report is an insult to the Irish voters by talking about the Lisbon Treaty as if it were already here and as if their vote does not count."
"Therefore the UK Conservative delegation will have to vote against at the end."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on a report aimed at giving strategic guidance on the role of sport in the European Union."
"Sport is a social phenomenon which has always fostered values such as solidarity, team spirit and identity, as asserted by the Declaration on the overall significance of sport, annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Sporting activity helps to develop physical, intellectual and social skills, which is why sport should be practised both within the education system and in other aspects of social life."
"One point that should not be underestimated is the benefit to disabled people of practising sport: all the Member States, local and regional authorities, and sports organisations should guarantee and facilitate disabled access to sporting installations."
"Sport is having to confront new threats in contemporary society, such as the exploitation of young players, doping, racism, violence and money laundering."
"The problem of violence arises not only inside but also outside of the stadium."
"I compliment the Commission on its undertaking to prevent disorder by facilitating dialogue with Member States, international organisations, sports bodies and police forces."
"It is also important to emphasise the economic side of sport."
"Discriminatory tax systems applied by Member States in favour of players can result in distortions of competition."
"Rules therefore need to be adopted to ensure fair competition between sports bodies."
"- (SV) Mr President, the report's eulogy of sport is something one can only agree with."
"Sport means a great deal for society, and it creates many important values to which I can hardly do justice in only two minutes."
"It also contributes to bringing Europe together."
"However, just because something is important, that does not mean it is political, and just because something contributes to bringing Europe together, it is not a primary responsibility of the EU."
"That is something which I think is being lost in this debate, not least if people maintain that more sport-related initiatives should be taken at EU level."
"That is not what I think."
"Therefore I do not consider that we need a special European gambling police."
"I do not think that sports agents earn too much money, and that there should be an argument for us to create special training for sports agents."
"Nor should we even out incomes between successful and less successful clubs."
"Trying to limit what the report calls the excessively busy schedules of athletes will probably not get them to resist doping."
"However, we must examine a number of false assertions made about the gambling market in Europe."
"There is no connection between private players in the gambling market and match-fixing."
"On the contrary, some of the biggest scandals we have seen in Europe have affected countries with monopolies."
"There is no connection between gambling monopolies and a restrictive gambling policy."
"On the contrary, many of the state monopolies in Member States are some of the largest advertisers."
"It is not countries with competition that have an unregulated gambling market."
"On the contrary, it is in many countries with monopolies that gambling services are most poorly regulated and monopolies can most frequently do as they will."
"We should not attempt through incorrect facts to keep the EU out of an area in which the EU actually has an important role to play."
"We have free movement of services in Europe, which should, of course, also apply to gambling services."
"The Member States' false figures about gambling addiction often conceal pure protectionism and protection of their own revenue from gambling monopolies."
"In fact, all this hypocrisy about gambling policy merely shows that it is the finance ministers in the Member States who are suffering from the worst kind of gambling addiction."
"That is why we Swedish Conservatives find it very difficult to support large parts of this report."
"I have just received eleven requests for the floor, which therefore cannot be granted. I would remind Members who do not speak during the debate that they may submit a written statement of no more than 200 words, which will be annexed to the verbatim report of the debate, or give an explanation of vote at the end of the speeches."
"(RO) Mr. President, dear colleagues, I would like to congratulate my colleague Mavromatis and, at the same time, to thank him for cooperation because I proposed several amendments to this report."
"I consider it is essential to introduce free access to sport events for young people under 14 years old, to create European championships at the level of schools and universities, as well as a ""European Day without Food Additives”."
"It is essential to adjust the sport and school infrastructure to the needs of disabled people, to introduce mandatory medical insurances for high-performance athletes, and to draft European projects for prevention of violence on sports fields."
"It is essential to create European projects designed for pupils with special physical qualities."
"In conclusion, I would like to express my conviction that, by adopting the White Paper on Sport, we will contribute to promoting a healthier and more valuable European society."
"(EL) Mr President, all my life I have absolutely loved sport, both as a participant and as a spectator."
"I should of course add that for years my fellow Member and friend Mr Mavrommatis and I were writing sports articles for the same paper."
"However, I am hardly optimistic after today's debate."
"Whatever we do and however much we try to put these matters in order, the events themselves show that the situation is pretty dire."
"Doping is a daily problem and there have even been fatalities."
"The commercialisation of sport has been taken to extremes."
"Owing to the success of sport there is a preoccupation with spectacular shows on a grand scale, and this has led to corruption."
"In sport, television reigns supreme."
"I therefore think a symbolic gesture is very important."
"Bearing in mind the problems with the Olympic Games, I think we shall have to consider whether the Games should be returned permanently to Greece."
"Mr President, as the President of the Estonian Ski Association, I agree with the concern mentioned in the report on the decreasing number of hours in both primary and secondary education for physical education."
"Physical education helps schoolchildren to develop the habit of pursuing a healthy lifestyle."
"It is a great challenge for many people involved in sport to increase their interest in sporting activities."
"For example, the Estonian Ski Association has created a year-round system of participation for children and non-professionals, but this has been quite an expensive undertaking."
"In this connection, I should point out that the funding of sporting activities benefits greatly from gambling."
"Many sports are subsidised from the profits of state-run lotteries as well as licensed gambling."
"I think that we have to find some alternative sources of financial support if we do not use that money."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on preparing this report."
"We have heard a great deal here today, but I would like to draw your attention to a few aspects in particular."
"Obesity is becoming endemic, and our largely sedentary lifestyle is in no small part to blame for this."
"The situation could therefore be helped, as the previous speaker also said, by making daily physical education classes compulsory in the Member States from primary school level right through to higher education."
"For this we need facilities, however, and we also need to change the curriculum."
"As regards facilities, the situation could be improved if the government were to take on a greater role, since at least half of the revenue from sports, accounting for 4% of the EU's gross domestic product, would need to be reinvested to bring about a major change in this situation. I certainly recommend doing this."
"I hope that the White Paper will improve the situation. Thank you for listening."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) As the vote will begin in a few minutes, I cannot make a longer speech."
"However, I would like to say a few things and reply to some questions."
"In my opinion, it is clear from the debate what a complicated phenomenon sport represents in the life of a modern society."
"The other thing which I am pleased to say is that, following the vote on Mr Mavrommatis's report, we will have a very solid base for Europe's forthcoming coherent policy on sport: a base grounded in the White Paper and Parliament's report."
"Understandably, the debate has revealed a whole range of thoughts, which it will be necessary to take up and begin work on in the near future."
"I would just like to emphasise the things I have listed here and which occur to me as especially significant."
"One of the problems, which is actually covered in the White Paper, is the education of sportspeople, especially young people, so as to prevent the situation that has been described, where their careers come to an end but they still do not have an adequate long-term future established."
"It is also equally important to address problems of people trafficking or the risk of trafficking in some cases in sport."
"Similarly, the Commission must apply itself to the issue of intellectual property, especially in relation to the Internet, which when all is said and done is the business of the Commission; but because I can see that actually the atmosphere is not conducive to long speeches, I shall just quickly answer the questions that have been posed."
"First there was the question of the so-called 'guidelines'."
"The Commission is of the opinion that, as yet, it is still not the right time to formulate these; nevertheless the Commission considers that attention should be paid to this problem."
"Of the other issues, I would like to mention the question of lotteries, which is very often cited."
"Here I would like to state that lotteries fall outside the Services Directive; consequently they are subject to Community law and it is necessary to seek a decision in each individual case."
"Another important question was the collective sale of broadcasting rights for television programmes."
"The Commission envisages that a solution will be found everywhere that will contain a significant element of solidarity, as has been mentioned."
"I think that I have very quickly touched on most of the questions that have been posed."
"Otherwise, obviously this is just one step, although a very important one, taken by the Commission and Parliament together."
"Mr President, let me once again thank all the Members who have spoken here today and all those who have submitted amendments to the report on the White Paper on Sport."
"A total of 520 amendments have been tabled in the eight committees."
"I have aimed for conciliation solutions as far as possible, and this has now been achieved."
"The mere fact that these amendments were tabled by eight committees and voted in shows how important this report really is."
"Of course, it also shows the significance of the text that is to be incorporated into the Reform Treaty."
"This is an important first step for sport and for the EU."
"Much can be achieved though our joint cooperation and assistance."
"(DE) Mr President, I am not sure under which rule I should rise at this juncture, but I will do so nonetheless."
"I would ask you to inform the Bureau that for me personally, at least - but I am sure I speak for all the Group chairmen here - the atmosphere in the Chamber at present is totally unacceptable."
"We cannot even hear people through the headphones, there is so much noise; it is quite appalling."
"Much of Commissioner Špidla's speech and Mr Mavrommatis's comments were largely inaudible because of the dreadful noise in the House. That is quite unacceptable."
"Would you please make sure that the Bureau leaves at least five minutes between the end of the debate and the vote, because we should not have to put up with this situation here in the Chamber."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Voting time is scheduled immediately and we shall now proceed to the vote."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) I applaud the work of the rapporteur, Mr Mavrommatis, and welcome the eagerly awaited White Paper on Sport adopted by the Commission."
"It is a useful and necessary measure, in that sporting activity constitutes such a significant dimension of European society."
"I would draw attention to the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, emphasising that sport must be valued socially, especially in the case of young people as a means of teaching them tolerance, respect and involvement."
"I believe that the Member States - backed by clear, transparent Community guidelines and policies - should make suitable spaces available for sport and involve society as a whole, including disadvantaged groups, in order that sporting activity can bring people together and help combat phenomena such as racism and xenophobia."
"Given that a lack of physical activity encourages diseases such as obesity and other chronic illnesses, I believe that cooperation between the sports sector and the health sector is crucial."
"The European Union has a vital coordinating role in informing citizens and encouraging them to take part in a range of sporting activities."
"in writing. - (RO) I would like to emphasize the importance of physical education classes in the EU schools and secondary schools."
"For the moment, physical education remains the only discipline in the school curriculum that aims at preparing children for a healthy way of life."
"I appreciate the EU initiative to increase the number of physical education classes in schools."
"Together with the increase in the number of physical education classes, we should also take into consideration two important issues: I refer to attractiveness and the possibility to have differentiated physical education classes."
"My statement relies on the discussions I have had with pupils and sports teachers in Romania."
"Unfortunately, the fact that physical education classes are not attractive leads to an increase in absenteeism."
"One of the reasons is the absence of an adequate material basis to diversify classes."
"Another problem is the absence of special physical education classes for overweight or obese young people."
"Physical education classes have the same degree of intensity both for healthy children and for children with problems."
"Thus, sometimes, young people are forced to remain off the sports field."
"These are some of the problems we find in several European Union Member States and for which we have to find solutions."
"I invite the European Commission to come up with solutions and even with examples of good practice in the Member States."
"in writing. - (HU) The report on sport by my fellow Member from Greece is an important document on an issue that is close to my heart."
"Sport has been part of European culture for many thousands of years."
"Ancient Greece bestowed on humankind among other things the joy of the Olympic Games."
"Today many people are concerned about whether it will be possible to protect the Olympics from a boycott, and from political passions that may be justified in other respects."
"I am pleased to say that in Hungary the key forces in politics and public opinion alike are against a boycott of the Beijing Olympics."
"As far as I can see, the mood is similar throughout the whole of Europe."
"It is therefore to be hoped that this time, after previous unfortunate boycotts, politics will not spoil the enjoyment of sportsmen and women and the many hundreds of millions of people who love sport."
"Participation by politicians at the opening ceremony is another matter entirely."
"This is a matter for politicians to decide in their capacity as politicians, and neither sport nor sportspeople should be drawn into it."
"in writing. - (RO) When speaking about the reviewed Lisbon Strategy, we cannot ignore a sector that employs 15 million people and produces around 4% of the European Union GDP."
"Indeed, sport can be an important component for our 2 big objectives: economic growth and employment"
"This is why I would like to emphasize some budgetary aspects of the European Union's support for the sport sector."
"For the moment, we have no clear reference in the treaties in force that would allow our active involvement through programmes and funds."
"Nevertheless, until the Lisbon Treaty becomes effective, we can still initiate preparatory actions in the Committee on Budget, which, although limited to insignificant amounts, could start very useful projects for European sport from 2009."
"I regret that, during this week's presentation of the new Preliminary Draft Budget, we did not discuss more on the budgetary line that can be established at Chapter 3 - Citizenship of the EU Budget."
"I hope that, by the first Budget reading in the autumn, we will submit constructive proposals for this field."
"in writing. - (HU) Let me first of all congratulate my honourable friend Mr Mavrommatis on his report encouraging European Union Member States to exchange best practice in the interests of preventing violence, racism and xenophobia at and around sports grounds."
"Taking action to combat the racism that, unfortunately, is occurring increasingly at sporting events is a task to be performed jointly by the authorities in the Member States, sports associations and competition organisers. It is also in their common interests."
"Some superb initiatives that stand out in this regard include the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)'s campaign 'Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE)', and the series of events entitled 'Racism spoils the game'."
"The most effective mechanism for combating the racism and exclusion occurring in the sporting arena, however, is the game itself, as it fosters in individuals a sense of team spirit, cooperation and fair competition, as well as reinforcing cooperation and solidarity as social values."
"According to statistics, however, certain groups in society, notably the most disadvantaged ethnic minorities, engage much less in sports activities and have less access to government-run sports facilities."
"For this reason, the European Union needs to establish an appropriate reference framework for promoting equal opportunities in the pursuit and funding of sports."
"The leadership of sports associations in the Member States, meanwhile, in cooperation with local and regional government, must give priority to participation by disadvantaged groups in their given branch of sport."
"in writing. - (BG) I would like to congratulate our colleague Mavrommatis on his excellent report."
"I commend the inclusion of sport in the Lisbon Treaty, the requirement for the 2009 budget to have a separate budget line for the activities in the field of sport, and the development of measures for its promotion in the Member States."
"I believe that today's debate sets the beginning of the promotion of a consistent European policy in the field of sport."
"Being a member of the Committee on Regional Development from Bulgaria, a country with underdeveloped sport infrastructure, especially in amateur sport, I would like to call upon the European Commission and the Member States to more actively use the European Regional Development Fund and the other financial tools for investment in the urban environment, and for development of sport-related infrastructure and projects."
"I do believe that sport should and can become part and parcel of the strategies for sustainable development of our regions, municipalities, cities and villages with the EU assistance."
"in writing. - (FI) Sport is competition, but of a sort to which the EU's laws on competition cannot be applied."
"To preserve the specificity of sport, it should be given a chance for self-regulation in the future, in accordance with each sport's best traditions."
"As legislators, we need to pass laws which guarantee that politicians and judges keep as far away from sport as possible."
"This seemingly contradictory requirement is dealt with more coherently in this report than it is in the Commission's White Paper."
"It is important for European sport for all and grassroots activity that Member States are able to preserve their national gambling systems, which are an essential ingredient in the specificity of sport."
"The by-products of gambling are also easier to prevent in countries where the state has a monopoly."
"In all sports, professional sport and businesses structured around it benefit from voluntary, unpaid, grassroots activity and public funding."
"Parliament, for its part, needs to be able to ensure that the social basis for sport does not crumble under pressure from market forces."
"in writing. - (PL) Sport is such an important part of daily life and is also so globalised that it merits the attention of the European Union's institutions."
"A joint effort to combat certain related phenomena is more effective than action by individual Member States."
"Doping is a recognised and widespread scourge of contemporary competitive sport."
"That is why the fight against doping is given precedence in the European Parliament's report."
"Members who hail from the former Communist bloc recall how doping can become a nationalised method of breeding champions, sanctioned by the authorities of a country building its prestige on the basis of success on the sports field."
"The rapporteur made a wise remark, based on the reality of the situation."
"He stated that on its own, treatment of the symptoms through increased controls will not be effective."
"It has to be accompanied by measures to eliminate the underlying reasons for this phenomenon."
"I have in mind a schedule of events that is more than the body can stand and education."
"Another noticeable scourge of mass sport events is the expression of racism and discrimination."
"I make a distinction between this and the restrictions imposed by FIFA concerning the number of national and foreign members of a team, for example."
"Such restrictions are governed by concern for the progress and development of young talent (instead of transfers), and are not an instance of discrimination against players on the grounds of their national origin."
"I also welcome the attention paid to phenomena linked to the commercialisation of sport and its side effects such as games of chance and unequal access to broadcasts of sport events."
"I agree that these are important issues too."
"in writing. - (BG) Mr President, it is great that the EP is discussing the White Paper on Sport."
"We should pay attention to the need for balancing the policies aimed at the development of professional and amateur sport."
"Sport excellence costs a lot, but it is equally necessary to increase the funding of mass sport from childhood to retirement age."
"It is necessary to establish infrastructure enabling the integration of all social groups of citizens."
"Sport calls for education from an early age and sport is instrumental in eliminating many other problems such as the abuse of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco."
"We should urge all Member States to set up areas for free sport and areas free of drugs, alcohol and tobacco."
"I have recently made a public opinion poll which makes it very clear that young people engaged in sport do not use drugs and alcohol."
"Their behavioural culture is very different; tolerance and solidarity are very important elements that sport nurtures in them."
"Therefore the involvement of education in sport is of special significance."
"There is also something else that I would like to share with you: there exist specialised sport schools and it is very important for their activities to be balanced with the work of sport clubs recruiting their athletes."
"It is necessary to have legislative regulation to this effect for both sport and education."
"in writing. - (ET) Much has been said here about the role of sport in culture, its effect on health etc. Sport has a very big role to play both physically and psychologically."
"In recent years the social benefit of sport has been actively promoted in Europe to give everyone the opportunity to participate to the best of their ability in the life of their communities."
"I am extremely sorry that the same cannot be said for disabled sport."
"As President of the Physically Disabled Sports Association in Estonia I know how difficult it is to organise sports events for the disabled, to get them coverage in the media, and to obtain resources from government and from sponsors."
"Our sportsmen and women are aware that equal conditions and opportunities have not been established for them."
"in writing. - (RO) The cultural statistics published by Eurostat in 2007 were obtained based on the activities the Member States acknowledge to enter this category."
"Unfortunately, sport and tourism were excluded and I believe this should be corrected."
"I appreciate as positive the development of sport tourism over the last years, and the promotion of winter and nautical sports."
"The existence of sport facilities in hotel complexes or the creation of tourist routes for bikers could have a beneficial impact both on the population's health and the environment."
"In great European cities, there are already parking facilities that provide tourists with bicycles, free of charge, during the entire period of stay of the vehicles."
"On May 1st, in Galaţi, the town where I come from, I waited for the people who decided to devote their time to participating in a cross-country race at the finish line."
"I was glad especially for the children and the disabled people who crossed the finish line."
"Education is essential in promoting sport."
"In Romania, the construction of several hundreds of sports halls for schools and high schools began in 2001, both in the urban and in the rural environment."
"I think this type of investment should continue."

"In this context, the Commission underlines that paragraph 11 of the agreement covers extremely urgent cases in general."

"(DE) Madam President, in our deliberations on the joint motion for a resolution which took place on a cross-party basis on Monday, we forgot that the IMF recommendations on financial crises are already available and that it is now a matter of their implementation."
"I would therefore recommend - and I very much hope that this will have the support of the House - that the following phrase be inserted in the text:"
"'To the implementation by both parties of the conclusions.'"
"(DE) and then the remainder of the text."
"There would be no other changes to the text."

"- Before the vote on Amendment 3:"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, may I simply make the following statement on behalf of my group: we wish to withdraw this Amendment 3."
"We continue to take the view that non-violence is, unfortunately, not always enough to ensure respect for human rights - I would merely recall Kosovo and Darfur here - but that should not imply that we are against the principle of non-violence."
"We therefore wish to withdraw our amendment."
"We will vote for the amendment tabled by the PPE-DE Group and proceed on that basis."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 7:"
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to thank Mr Swoboda of the Socialist Group for having withdrawn this amendment, for the sake of simplification, and also for clarifying that the proposal is not, in a manner of speaking, the only instrument."
"I should like to table an oral amendment on the amendment put forward by the PPE-DE Group, also aimed at simplification: the beginning of the paragraph would read as follows: 'considers non-violence to be the most appropriate means', and the rest of the paragraph would remain as it stands."
"I would also ask that the word 'non-violence' be written as a single word in all language versions, because it is not merely a negative concept indicating the absence of violence, but a positive concept of action, as the Dalai Lama, Gandhi and other historical figures have taught us."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 23:"
"(FR) Madam President, I wish to propose an oral amendment to paragraph 23, with the agreement of our rapporteur, to state the following:"
"'notes with concern that during the last year of activities that new body has not proved its credibility but stresses once again the crucial role of the UNHCR within the overall UN architecture;'."

"I would remind you that the deadline has passed."
"However, if there are no objections, we will agree to your request."
"(The President established that there were no objections to the request)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 10:"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of this amendment is to delete the following words: 'when they are acting in accordance with the role, and carrying out the tasks of such bodies, as provided for in the Treaties'."
"It has to do with the fact that regions and local authorities, unlike private lobbyists, represent the general interest: it would therefore be simplistic to liken regions and local authorities to private lobbyists."
"Indeed, the statutes of many European regions and local authorities allow them to intervene in a much broader manner than is provided for by the Treaties in order to safeguard at Community level the public interests in question."
"That is why I called for the last phrase of the amendment to be deleted."
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 3:"
"Madam President, we have an oral amendment to Amendment 3."
"We want to replace the word 'churches' with the word 'religious' so the phrase will go like this: '[...] should be considered lobbyists and treated in the same way: professional lobbyists, companies' in-house lobbyists, NGOs, think-tanks, trade associations, trade unions and employers' organisations, religious, philosophical and nonconfessional organisations [...]' and so on."
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is proof that lobbies do work!"
"(Applause from the centre and from the left)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 15:"
"Madam President, it seems that European English has betrayed us."
"Therefore, because the text of this amendment is apparently not very clear, my group will withdraw Amendment 15 on the question of the bands of money requested to declare the financial disclosure of a lobbyist."
"But we really do hope, even if the vote is not going as we would like it to go, that, during the discussion of the working group, this issue will be clarified and will come back."

"(EL) Madam President, for a delicate and particularly important product in Greece's agriculture, one would expect that with a reform yielding, if anything, to the pressure of the European Court of Justice rulings there would be a safeguard for the new CMO in cotton until 2013."
"This consolidation would be based on the principles of the CAP under the single payment scheme, the financial guarantee of Community funds in the national envelope of each country, and the possibility of flexibility in the Member States on the management of the national envelope."
"We should aim at the greatest possible area payments per hectare within the bounds of budget neutrality."
"We should also channel aid to producers who will improve the quality of their produce."
"However, this has not been achieved."
"Indeed, in a proposed formation of a restructuring fund, as has been suggested in the report in the framework of the 1st pillar, it is suggested that there should be funding to modernise the sector, especially the ginning industry, as stated primarily in amendments 9, 14, 16, 23, 26, 31 and 39."
"There is a reconstruction to counterbalance the losses that the ginning industry will suffer as a result of any decrease in production or disturbance in the cotton market."
"For these reasons, the PASOK Parliamentary Group has voted in plenary against the report on the direct support scheme for cotton."
"Madam President, thank you very much for this opportunity to explain the way I voted on the TEC agreement."
"I think it is fair to say that we all welcome regulatory cooperation, especially where this will help to facilitate more trade and especially where it helps facilitate transatlantic trade, because all too often, our two large trading blocks - the EU and the US - are at loggerheads on trade issues."
"However, we should ensure that any agreements that we come to on common regulatory standards are not used as an excuse for joint protectionism."
"We have to make sure that any global standards that we arrive at together are not used as an excuse to shut out producers and suppliers from other world markets."
"Therefore, as we seek to adopt common global standards, let us make sure that we are also in a position to help producers from poorer countries to adopt those standards as well, so that we are not using these standards as an excuse to shut them out from world markets."
"Altogether I think on both sides we welcome this agreement, and for this reason I voted in favour."
"(DE) Madam President, I voted in favour of Mr Cappato's report because it deals with one of the European Parliament's most important functions, namely to perform an oversight function in respect of the Council's and the Commission's performance on human rights policy."
"This strengthens the European Union's role as the guardian of human rights worldwide."
"As part of this process, it is essential, for example, for the Subcommittee on Human Rights to undertake a systematic evaluation of the relevant instruments, and for Parliament to be involved in the European Union's human rights dialogues."
"Nonetheless, any policy pursued in this area will simply be window-dressing unless it takes, as its starting point, the basic premise that these fundamental rights are indivisible."
"That is the only way to ensure that credibility wins out over double standards."
"Madam President, I voted against paragraph 141, which declares full support for the Yogyakarta Principles."
"Now, these principles are anything but clearly defined, especially on such delicate issues as sexual orientation and gender identity."
"Instead, I supported Amendment 15, which 'takes note of' these principles."
"The point is that these principles should not be interpreted as something like a norm for the Member States."
"(BG) Thank you, Mme Chair."
"I am taking the floor on the Cappato report because of the amendment proposed by the rapporteur himself; namely, the first amendment in which the rapporteur all of a sudden begins to philosophize on the adequacy of the modern national state and national sovereignty in modern times."
"Mr. Cappato may not be very clear about these things; it is up to him but absolutely the same ideas were promoted by the communist totalitarian regimes that did not care for human rights at all."
"The same thing which features in his amendment was explained by the communists in Bulgaria and the other Eastern European countries."
"Therefore I would suggest to Mr. Cappato that he visit Kim Chen Ir in North Korea if he would like to continue in the same vein."
"There his ideas would be shared and, I am sure, warmly welcomed."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of this report."
"I think the EU's work in election observation missions is extremely powerful, it is extremely important, and it is conducted with a great degree of professionalism."
"It contributes to the democratic process and to democratic development in many underprivileged and developing countries."
"I had the privilege of being chairman of Parliament's election observation mission in Sierra Leone, a very difficult country, a very poor country, a country that presented many logistical difficulties, particularly weather difficulties in the rainy season, with the mission that was conducted. It was conducted with great professionalism by all of the staff, both EU staff and locally-recruited staff."
"It was indeed very humbling to see the enthusiasm with which the election was viewed by many ordinary Sierra Leoneans, queuing up for many hours in the rain to cast their votes in a democratic election."
"Our contribution to that is well worth the relatively small amount of money, and I am delighted to welcome this report and vote in favour of it."
"Madam President, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to give my explanation of vote on the Ford report on the agreement with ASEAN."
"In general I think we prefer to improve and increase international trade through the multilateral framework of the World Trade Organisation, but I think we have to recognise the role that bilaterals play in extending trade and the benefits of globalisation throughout the world."
"I thought it was particularly important in this report that we highlighted human rights issues."
"Generally I am rather sceptical when we do this, because quite often it is an excuse for protectionism against products from other countries."
"But in this context it is particularly appropriate, given that Burma is a member of ASEAN."
"However, I did have a real problem with this, because I did initially put an amendment to committee, which was accepted, saying that if particular ASEAN countries did not want to be part of this agreement, we should still go ahead with agreements with those countries that did want to."
"We should not let the most protectionist country hold up agreements."
"Unfortunately the EU is hell-bent on trade-block-to-trade-block negotiations, and for this reason I abstained."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great satisfaction to make this explanation of vote while you are in the Chair, Mrs Morgantini, and especially with the welcome sound of Members applauding behind me."
"I wish to say in my personal capacity, and this relates to me personally as an individual Member and also as a representative of the Pensioners' Party, that I voted against this report on the regulation of lobbies."
"The reason is this: I am unimpressed by the fact that it is taken for granted that Members of the European Parliament are influenced in their decisions by other people, and that, consequently, regulation is deemed necessary."
"True enough, I have always been influenced in my decision-making by Carlo Fatuzzo, by Carlo Fatuzzo alone and by none other than Carlo Fatuzzo."
"I therefore find it very odd that any such possibility can be accepted."
"If anything at all were to be done, or should be done, to help us better understand the documents on which we vote, we ought to have experts available who each say the opposite of the other, and then we can use our own intelligence to decide."
"I would conclude by asking myself and asking you this, Madam President: who influenced the decision to regulate lobbies?"
"There is obviously a lobby - the lobby of lobbies - which has influenced the rules on lobbies!"
"I see that you are still an individualist: I hope you will have an opportunity to compare notes with others."
"Madam President, firstly it is a huge pleasure to see you in the chair today."
"You should be chairing more sessions."
"It is also a huge pleasure to follow Mr Fatuzzo in an explanation of vote."
"Fortunately, I did not do it through my first mandate, otherwise I would never have had lunch in Strasbourg."
"I was wondering, when we were voting on this report, whether we were actually targeting the correct audience."
"It is good that we are honest about the lobbyists that we see in this place, and it is good that we get a record of who the Commission is seeing. But I do wonder if we should not get a record also of who the Commission is influencing to try and influence parliamentary votes on directives it is sending through."
"Already we have had exposed by my illustrious colleague Mr Hannon, in Commission Questions, the amount of money that charity organisations like the NSPCC in the UK get directly from the European Commission, and then it comes as no surprise when they write to us to say: actually, we should be in favour of the Lisbon Treaty."
"There are a whole bunch of organisations that received EU money when it came to the Citizens' Agora in the build-up to the Lisbon Treaty, yet they were all on one side of the argument."
"There is a small problem with democracy in this place: the people we fund tend to be the wrong ones, and actually it would be better if we cut all this money out altogether."
"Madam President, lobbyists love Brussels."
"They arrive in the European institutions and they perceive at once that the system was designed by and for people like them."
"They can get legislation through here that would never pass through a popularly elected legislature."
"I am thinking of bills such as the ban on higher-dose vitamin and mineral supplements that was the subject of intense opposition in all the Member States but that was pushed through here by a few large pharmaceutical corporations in backroom deals."
"So much, I think, is well known outside this Chamber."
"What is perhaps less widely appreciated is the extent to which these lobbying organisations, as my colleague Mr Heaton-Harris has just said, are themselves creatures of the European Union, wholly dependent on the Commission for their funding."
"And so, when the European Commission goes through the motions of consulting civil society, what it actually means is that it is consulting the European Union of Journalists, the European Women's Lobby, the European Trades Unions Congress and a bunch of other organisations that depend on the European taxpayer for every euro of their income."
"I am bound to ask whether there is anybody out there in the nation states who genuinely supports this project without, on some level, being paid to."
"The way of testing whether I am right about that is to put your Lisbon Treaty to the people in a referendum."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"
"(PL) Madam President, in the context of this important report I would like to draw attention to the issue of sport amongst young people at local level."
"Actions aimed at making physical activity more attractive to children and young people should be promoted, as should schools that actively support sport."
"It is therefore essential to support projects aimed at the development of sporting facilities in schools and beyond, together with plans to involve children in extra-curricular activities."
"I believe that it is important to support sporting activities at grass roots , that is to say, at the level that is closest to the citizen."
"This can be achieved by providing appropriate financial support to smaller clubs and sport facilities."
"Madam President, I did speak in the main debate on this subject."
"But what I did not do was actually explain why I voted against."
"This was because of all sorts of reasons I explained in my vote."
"I would have loved to have voted in favour of this, if only the European institutions were doing something useful in sport."
"Last year in the budget debate, we actually voted as a Parliament against a line of money which had been match-funded for the Special Olympic Movement for Unified Sports, a programme which would have run across 10 countries of the European Union involving 3 000 people with intellectual disability."
"I am bringing this proposal back - and I have been talking to all the different rapporteurs in this place - but you do wonder actually how interested this place is in sport."
"Maybe it just wants to suck the power up so it can dabble in people's everyday lives."
"But it does not want to actually do anything positive sometimes when it comes to people with disabilities."
"I think we missed an opportunity last year."
"I will be pressing this again this year and I record this interest with the Special Olympics, a wonderful organisation, here today."
"(PL) Madam President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Mavrommatis."
"I did so not only because I consider it to be a comprehensive and well-prepared report, but also because I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur and to the Committee on Culture and Education for incorporating the amendments I tabled to the document."
"These amendments aim to ensure equal treatment for disabled sportspeople in the context of social solutions."
"Certain national legislative systems provide for financial support of Olympic athletes experiencing financial difficulties after the end of their sporting careers, but the provisions concerned do not apply to Paralympic athletes."
"Involvement in sport heightens the sense of personal dignity and self-esteem of the disabled."
"Madam President, I do not know whether I am in order or not."
"I have not made a written application for an explanation of vote."
"But if I may just very briefly reply to my good friend and colleague, Mr Heaton-Harris, I think we all have our own points of view about the value of the European institutions, but I do not think it is fair to attack the European Union, national governments, local government, for being interested or disinterested in the question of the disabled and sport."
"I have many examples in my constituency where the European Union quite frankly has brought enormous benefits to people - disabled and, indeed, not disabled."
"I just think it is unfair to attack any institution in that way."
"I think all of us want to do what we can to encourage sport, to encourage everybody to take a fair part."
"Whether you are pro-European or anti-European, that is another issue."
"(FI) Madam President, I would like to say a few words about Mr Mavrommatis' report."
"I voted in favour of it and I consider it to be excellent."
"What is especially good about it in my opinion is that it recognises the specificity of sport and gives attention to special needs groups, including the disabled."
"I agree with Mr Beazley and I do not completely understand my good friend Mr Heaton-Harris's logic in this matter, as it is exactly in this way that we can ensure that special needs groups and the disabled receive equal treatment."
"Healthy exercise is one of the specific priority areas in this report."
"Sport has also proven to be a very good way to prevent racism and xenophobia."
"I also want to say that there was something wrong with my voting machine and, for example, at point 42 I could not get it to work properly."
"I hope that the technical department will look into why my voting machine sometimes jammed."
"I noticed that others had the same problems, and I wish to send a message to the technical department that hopefully next time it will be working properly."
"(DE) Madam President, may I begin with the Mavrommatis report."
"I voted in favour of the report because it particularly emphasises the contribution made to the financing of sport by the lotteries and Austria's casinos."
"I welcome the paragraph in question."
"I voted for the Friedrich report because it rejected the attack on the unique and wide-ranging role played by the recognised churches in society, and also offers a more nuanced view of the role of lawyers."
"I attach great importance to the expertise and information that we derive from our exchange of experience and dialogue about possible solutions with citizens, interest groups, lawyers and lobbyists."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the hundreds of discussions, as well as the countless e-mails and ideas that I receive."
"A few of them are irritating because they simply take up valuable time, but I have found the majority to be both informative and useful."
"Once again, I would like to express my thanks for that, but I would also like to say that the responsibility for the way we deal with lobbyists ultimately lies with us."
"We decide who we want to talk to, how much of our time they take up, what we talk about, and how we develop a working relationship."
"I say 'yes' to clear and transparent rules, but 'no' to overregulation which makes this working relationship more difficult and bureaucratic."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) As we believe it is important to maintain and improve, as necessary, the agreement with the Republic of Seychelles, we agree with the assessment describing as inadequate the inclusion in the text of the protocol (setting out the fishing opportunities and their financial contribution) of considerations on the state of local port infrastructures and the possibility of changing aspects (including the objectives in using the financial contribution) under the exclusive competence of the Seychelles authorities."
"Likewise, we regard as negative the proposal to include measures, such as those on the suspension of licences by the European Commission, which do not take into account, in particular, respect for and protection of the competences of the Member States."
"Furthermore, the principle of equal pay for equal work is still not ensured as the agreement only specifies that the wage conditions of crews from the Seychelles, on board vessels originating from EU countries which will benefit from the agreement, cannot be worse than those of crews from the Seychelles carrying out similar work on board vessels from that country."
"in writing. - I voted against the report of Mr Ortuondo Larrea relating to a fishing agreement with the Seychelles."
"The CFP has been an unmitigated disaster and has not promoted a sustainable fishing industry around our coasts."
"As a result of this, hundreds of Scottish boats have had to be scrapped and fishing communities have suffered."
"The answer to this is not to export other Member States' over-capacity in the form of third-country fishing agreements."
"If other Member States have too many boats to fish their own traditional fishing waters they should address this issue themselves - and not depend upon the EU to find more waters for them to plunder."
"in writing. - (FR) I am pleased that the European Parliament approved the amendments to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Seychelles for the period 2005-2011."
"The changes do not modify the fundamental elements of the Agreement."
"They are merely a reflection of the success achieved and allow a practical adaptation that corresponds to actual needs. That is why, given the average level of catches over the past three years, the reference tonnage has been increased from 55 000 tonnes to 63 000 tonnes."
"Moreover, in order to balance the situation, the fee paid by shipowners has been increased to EUR 35 per tonne to bring the protocol into line with other tuna agreements, hence reducing the Community contribution from EUR 75 to EUR 65 per tonne. The total annual financial contribution thus increases from EUR 4 125 000 to EUR 5 355 000."
"The success of this Agreement reflects the European Union's clear and mutual interest in concluding partnership agreements, notably in the fisheries sector."
"The Réunion fleet has been able to benefit from these fishing possibilities and I hope that the vote today will help to strengthen and stimulate our maritime economy."
"in writing. - (PL) The sea and maritime resources are very important for the European Union in terms of employment and economic growth."
"They are a source of food and energy."
"In addition, coastal regions are experiencing significant development of the tourist industry, which represents an important sector of the economy."
"Maritime resources should be exploited in a responsible manner."
"The EU's fishing sector is the second largest in the world."
"The fisheries and aquaculture sector supplies approximately 7.3 million tonnes of fish a year; 360 000 people are employed in the fisheries and processing sector."
"I therefore believe that the EU should reach agreements with third countries on common fisheries policies, or improve existing arrangements."
"in writing. - (PT) We support the application of more individual rules, with derogations and specific, different and tailored measures duly adapted to the economic realities of the outermost regions and more favourable to their production capacities."
"This report aims to apply a special rate of excise duty to beer produced in Madeira."
"This rate, which is lower than the national rate fixed, will apply in those cases where the annual production of the brewery does not exceed 300 000 hectolitres."
"As pointed out by the Commission, the price of locally produced beer, even with the tax benefit of 50%, is still 7.5% higher than the retail selling price of beer brewed in mainland Portugal and sold on the market of Madeira."
"If the benefit of the tax reduction is lost, local breweries will be unable to match the competition."
"As a result, bearing in mind the specific characteristics and demands of the situation in the outermost regions, we support the measures which therefore aim to guarantee the right of production in line with the region's specific potential, which recognise the regional economy and, as a result, which guarantee the survival of the local brewing industry faced with the national and international market."
"in writing. - (DE) The only reason why I am voting in favour of this decision on excise duty is its limited local scope, so it cannot adversely affect the Brauerei zu Göss brewery in Austria, which - as is well-known - produces the best beer in Europe."
"in writing. - (PL) The issue dealt with by the rapporteur invites reflection on how to reconcile support for consolidation of a system of genuine competition with the principle of equality before the law."
"Clearly, the free market is the best mechanism for regulating the economy until something better is thought up, to paraphrase a certain statement."
"From that standpoint, the rapporteur's initiative may indicate interventionism, which would have negative implications for the economy."
"On the other hand, ensuring sustainability of the market involves protecting subdivision and preventing monopolisation."
"Broader debate and more expert research are required before taking a decision as important as the one involved."
"The report does not deal with all aspects of the subject."
"That is why I decided to abstain."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Italian colleague Monica Frassoni on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council Decision laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission, as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC of 17 July 2006."
"Unfortunately, the comitology procedure is not working well and it is becoming urgent to put in place measures to enable the Commission to exercise its implementing powers and the European Parliament to monitor it."
"When applicable, reference in the texts to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny is obligatory for all three institutions."
"I am pleased that the new agreement defines more precisely the Commission's obligation to inform Parliament in accordance with arrangements that ensure that the transmission system is transparent and efficient and that the information forwarded and the various stages of the procedure are identified."
"I welcome the introduction of an 'early warning system' whereby Parliament is informed of draft implementing measures."
"I support the idea that the Commission should make all draft implementing measures public as soon as they are formally proposed."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in favour of the Frassoni report concerning the new comitology procedures."
"The new powers attributed to Parliament in the scrutiny procedure, enabling Members to block the passage of a text approved by the committee if the experts have not complied with their mandate, constitutes a major success for this House and an important step towards improving the balance of power between the European institutions."
"I agree that it is advisable to heighten the efficiency of the procedure by making committee decisions clearer and more accessible."
"Similarly, I am in favour of establishing an electronic register making it easier to verify decisions taken through comitology."
"It is of course essential that the three-month limit envisaged for Parliament's right of scrutiny should be confined to exceptional cases only, in keeping with the letter of the July 2007 Interinstitutional Agreement: a shorter period should be admissible only where justified on grounds of urgency or efficiency."
"Some EP committees have already successfully threatened to use the right of veto in order to obtain an immediate response and clarification from the Commission."
"I therefore believe that this is an instrument which Parliament should increasingly use to exercise political control, too, over technical decisions."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Italian colleague Monica Frassoni on the amendment of Rule 81 of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure on the so-called 'comitology' implementing measures."
"Rule 81(4) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure stipulates that where the implementing measures envisaged by the Commission are subject to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the time for scrutiny shall start to run when Parliament receives the draft measures in all official languages."
"I support the proposal to add that where shorter time limits apply, as provided for in Article 5a(5)(b) of Decision 1999/468/EC, and in cases of urgency, as provided for in Article 5a(6), unless the Chair of the parliamentary committee objects, the time for scrutiny shall start to run from the date of receipt by Parliament of the final draft implementing measures in the language versions submitted to the members of the committee established in accordance with Decision 1999/468/EC."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, Mrs Frassoni's report highlights the somewhat cavalier attitude the Commission adopts, when it has power, in relation to the European Parliament."
"The rapporteur is right to remind the Commission of its duties and we support this attempt to restore a minimum of democratic scrutiny of the Commission's activity."
"It is doubtful, however, whether this will result in better application of this scrutiny in the future, if only because of the Commission's secret desire to prevent Parliament from holding consultations on the measures it plans to implement."
"We also regret that there is no mention of the fundamental problem, namely the extent of the Commission's implementing powers, which resemble those of a genuine legislative and regulatory authority but entrusted to civil servants, and the democratic fraud that is the comitology procedure."
"We consider that the common agricultural policy should be abolished."
"At the same time we consider that agreements which have been entered into should be complied with."
"In today's vote we have therefore voted in favour of the Commission's proposal to comply with the accession treaties with Portugal, Greece and Spain in which the EU unfortunately committed itself to guaranteeing support for cotton production which also includes production support."
"We therefore regret that the Commission has not had the opportunity to present a proposal in this area which is in line with the policy for other agricultural sectors in which support has been de-coupled from production."
"The European Parliament's report proposed an opportunity for an even lesser de-coupling of support, and we therefore chose to vote against that report."
"in writing. - (PT) Given that the cotton sector is of great socio-economic importance to certain regions of the European Union, particularly Greece and Spain, the European Commission and the European Parliament should pay particular attention to this."
"The truth is that, with the reform of the common agricultural policy which began in 2003, the introduction of the single payment of aid decoupled from production led, in 2006, to the Commission putting this principle into practice in the cotton sector."
"However, Spain referred the matter to the European Court of Justice on the grounds that no impact assessment had been carried out prior to the reform."
"The Court found in Spain's favour and annulled the new support scheme for cotton."
"However, the proposal now presented by the European Commission is practically identical to the previous one."
"In addition, barely more than a year after the implementation of the reform of the common organisation of the market in cotton, the disastrous consequences of this can already be seen: production in this sector has fallen almost 20% in Greece and over 50% in Spain."
"Likewise, the number of farms has dropped by 11% in Greece and 25% in Spain."
"Even the ginning plants are threatened."
"That is why we voted against this resolution."
"I have voted against the Gklavakis report, as did my political group, because, despite a limited number of positive amendments to the Commission's original motion, the overall balance is negative."
"Greater support for cotton growers is necessary without further cuts in production."
"At the same time, substantial measures for environmental protection and viable agricultural development must be adopted."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution of 8 May 2008 on the Transatlantic Economic Council, which underlines that a close transatlantic partnership is a vital instrument to shape globalisation in the interest of common values and towards an equitable political and economic global order."
"I share the view that a functioning and competitive transatlantic market is the base on which to anchor the transatlantic partnership so as to enable the EU and the US to jointly tackle global political and economic challenges."
"Secure trade is particularly important in an ever more integrated global economy, but I agree that the proposal to scan 100% of foreign containers as part of the fight against terrorist threats is unjustified and unrealistic."
"There is an urgent need for cooperation on the application of intellectual property rights, including measures to strengthen cooperation in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, with a clear roadmap to facilitate mutual recognition of international patent law."
"I regret that monetary cooperation on the dollar/euro was not developed."
"in writing. - (FR) I abstained during the final vote on this resolution for the following reasons in particular."
"The resolution contains positive points, such as the reference to the precautionary principle."
"However, I cannot support certain proposals and objectives."
"Although I can accept the principle of a transatlantic market, it will be impossible, and even less desirable, to complete it by 2015."
"Completing this market implies the elimination of non-tariff barriers (para. 17), i.e. social, health, environmental and other standards."
"The provisions the EU has adopted in these areas through its legislation provide satisfactory protection for European consumers and citizens, and they must be maintained if not improved."
"Similarly, labelling and traceability are not enough to enable consumers to make informed choices (para."
"28). A consumer protection policy cannot be reduced to this type of measure."
"Consumers' choice of agricultural products must also be guaranteed by preventing the contamination of traditional and organic crops by GMOs."
"Finally, as regards the import of American poultry treated with chlorinated water, the wording in the text is too ambiguous."
"Imports must be banned if we want to preserve the Community's food safety policy."
"in writing. - (PT) At a time when the crisis of capitalism is deepening and its contradictions are increasing, this resolution and the goals set for the ('long-term') creation of the 'transatlantic market' are presented as a real escape route, pointing to the increasing liberalisation of the markets in these two poles of the 'triad' and pillars of NATO as a 'way out'."
"In addition to reaffirming the 'transatlantic' strategic partnership, the resolution acts as a genuine roadmap to the liberalisation of the financial markets and trade relations between the EU and the US, by listing the obstacles to greater competition and capitalist concentration, to the joy and benefit of large financial and economic groups."
"The resolution, in an (impossible) attempt to hide the true aims, contradictions and consequences of realising the 'transatlantic market', highlights certain potential social or environmental concerns."
"However, these seem to arise only as a function and variable of capitalist competition, particularly in the World Trade Organisation."
"Despite trying to mitigate the situation by confronting the brutal reality of 'capitalist globalisation', the resolution conceals the profound consequences for workers and people in general, and for small and medium-sized enterprises, not only in the EU and the US but also internationally."
"in writing. - We have voted against Amendment 4, because it states 'is of the opinion that any possible solution should not lead to distortion of competition'."
"In the light of the issue, this underlines that economic interests are more important than public health concerns."
"We find this reasoning unacceptable."
"We believe when it comes to matters of food safety the European Union should adhere to the precautionary principle."
"in writing. - (PT) The realisation that there is a great deal of life in relations between the United States and the European Union, aside from third-country issues (although, even in these, the disagreement is not necessarily insurmountable), is vitally important."
"This debate, the indicated texts and the document adopted today may therefore prove to be very useful."
"As a result, it is essential to complete the steps needed to achieve the goal of reinforcing transatlantic economic integration."
"In that respect, the efforts that have been made, particularly those aimed at removing non-customs barriers (obscure general rules which severely inhibit international trade) are, as demonstrated by recent studies, extremely useful."
"This must therefore result in greater commitment from both parties."
"Apart from that, in this same area of international trade, the commitment on both sides of the North Atlantic must be intensified and made more consistent."
"in writing. - As a co-author of this resolution, I am in support of the realistic intentions of the TEC process."
"It is necessary for the EU and the USA to undertake this search for barrier-reducing initiatives."
"In particular I welcome the steady progress that has been made on financial services, IFRS and the broker/dealer agreement."
"More has to be done and other avenues should be explored, including the multilateral approach."
"I am concerned, however, that both sides should not wait for remedies which may or may not close differences between us."
"This will take hard work instead, and this is no more apparent than in the area of insurance and, in particular, the collateral issue."
"The TEC is not a trade issue per se."
"It is about a deepening of our relationship at the regulatory level which improves the openness and efficiency of our industrial performances and which does away with the weak excuses of the past."
"We now face a mounting challenge in the world where the interest for the EU and the USA is in having systems which promote growth rather than protectionism and isolationism."
"TEC helps to bring the EU and USA closer together, but it will not do to rely on the outcomes of TEC by themselves."
"More needs to be done to fold this kind of approach into our day-to-day considerations at this level."
"Failure is all too easy to predict based on our political economies - hard work is needed to overcome this fear."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Italian colleague Marco Cappato on human rights in the world in 2007."
"I support the statement that the Commission and the Council should take priority action - along the same lines as for the establishment of the ICC - to support the activities of the international courts involved in protecting human rights."
"The new United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has the potential to develop into a valuable framework for improving the human rights situation in the world."
"I am in favour of promoting non-violence as an essential means of ensuring respect for fundamental human rights and in favour of the fight against the death penalty."
"Like my colleagues, I am surprised that a number of European countries have not yet ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture."
"I am pleased to see how effective the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) has been but its budget falls drastically short of the expectations of it, and I support an increase in the EIDHR budget from 2009."
"in writing. - (IT) I am explaining my vote in favour of the report on the protection of human rights, given that they are still being infringed all too often today."
"The European Union lists human rights among its founding principles, so much so that their observance rightly constitutes a prerequisite for EU accession."
"The European Union therefore has a responsibility to act as a guarantor of human rights in Europe and in third countries, by means of a coherent common foreign policy that is independent of the Member States' interests and positions."
"The EU must promote ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court around the world to protect individuals from so-called crimes against humanity and to prevent genocides and other atrocities being perpetrated in future without fear of sanction; it must also help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the UNHCR."
"I likewise think that the United Nations resolution on the universal moratorium on the use of the death penalty must be put into practice."
"The European Union must also contribute to the observance of human rights by its major trading partners."
"I hope China will discontinue its practice of torture as an important sign of openness to a culture that is respectful of human rights and consistent with the spirit of peace which has always symbolised the Olympic Games."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption today of Mr Cappato's motion for a resolution on the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2007 and the EU's policy on the matter."
"This report looks at the progress made in all parts of the world in the area of human rights and assesses the efforts made by the EU to promote human rights in its actions and policies."
"It rightly underlines the need to improve the consistency of internal and external policies in this area."
"The report focuses, in particular, on the question of the death penalty, on the fight against all forms of torture, and discrimination and violence against women, and on the need to strengthen the protection of children's rights."
"It reiterates the EU's responsibility to promote the role of civil society in order to make the fight more effective and more pertinent and to strengthen the means envisaged for that purpose."
"The June List supports the important work for human rights which is taking place all over the world, but we consider that this Annual Report is yet another attempt by this Parliament to extend the EU's competence in areas of foreign policy."
"The situation in many countries is very disturbing, and the international community must of course react."
"However, this must take place through the UN and its various bodies which, unlike the EU, have legitimacy and broad support among a majority of states."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the report."
"in writing. - (PT) Every year we are confronted with this exercise in hypocrisy of the European Parliament on human rights in the world."
"Obviously the report contains points which we support."
"However, in essence, it is a perfect example of the instrumentalisation of human rights and their unacceptable use as a political weapon in favour of the interests of the EU's major powers, and their large financial and economic groups, and against those people who reject their dictates."
"As such, there is a total absence of any references to and denouncements of the flagrant violations of human rights in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, occupied Cyprus or the Western Sahara, as perpetrated by EU countries and/or their allies such as the US, Israel, Turkey or Morocco."
"As such, there is once again an attempt to dissociate human rights, by subordinating them to economic and social rights."
"The defence of human rights - including the fact that they are indivisible and cannot be ranked - and their status as a prerequisite for respect for the rights of people and for genuine social justice, peace, freedom and democracy must form the framework of our political action."
"For us they are about defending the rights of people, not exercises in hypocrisy."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Cappato report on human rights."
"Human rights abuses take place around the world and we in the EU must always act as advocates for those who suffer as a result."
"We must also be alert to human rights abuses taking place within our own borders - with the example of rendition flights serving to show us how easily these abuses can happen."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I voted against the group on Amendment 12 to paragraph 94 of Mr Cappato's report, by which the concept of 'sexual and reproductive health' would be deleted."
"Although the term 'sexual and reproductive health' also covers abortion, which I do not support as an absolute right, in my view it needs to be mentioned in this context."
"Paragraph 94 is a reminder that health programmes, including sexual and reproductive health, should be prominent in the EU's development and human rights policy, in particular where gender-based violence is pervasive and women and children are put at risk of HIV/AIDS, or denied access to information, prevention and/or treatment."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report on the state of human rights in the world in 2007 and the EU's policy in this area."
"Human rights are universal rights and must apply without restriction."
"The EU has the opportunity to champion the cause of human rights globally."
"An accurate analysis of the current situation is the prerequisite here, which is why I welcome Mr Cappato's initiative."
"Harmonisation of the EU's human rights policy is especially important in order to achieve a common approach, for example against the death penalty or torture."
"A unified stance is also desirable in the international arena."
"Certain countries such as China, Russia and Iran appear to be making little effort to tackle the grave human rights violations occurring on their territory."
"The EU must present a strong and united front in its dealings with these countries, and that is only possible with a common human rights policy for the EU."
"in writing. - I welcome Mr Cappato's report on the state of human rights in the world in 2007 and the EU's policy in this area."
"The report highlights the need for the EU to increase its focus on human rights, particularly in trade negotiations."
"As well as recognising the shortcomings on human rights identified in the report I also support certain solutions Mr Cappato proposes such as a greater role for the Parliament's Human Rights Subcommittee and Council involvement in such debates."
"I voted in support of the report."
"in writing. - (DE) It is bizarre that the European Union is proposing to declare a 'European Year of Non-Violence' while the EU itself is deploying missions in Chad, where French interests make it impossible to achieve the requisite impartiality."
"When it comes to the CIA's secret prisons and rendition flights, too, just how non-violent and respectful of human rights was the EU's action then?"
"To say nothing of the fact that accession negotiations are in progress with a country which tramples minority rights under foot, treats the female section of its population as second-class citizens, and cheerfully follows the US example and, with the US's blessing, embarks on a war of aggression against its neighbour."
"To say nothing, too, of the flouting of democratic rights - notably by disregarding the outcomes of referenda - and the sacrifice of more and more fundamental rights on the pretext of combating terrorism."
"If the EU is genuine and serious in its intention to champion human rights, then it must shed light on all the still unanswered questions regarding the US's torture prisons and the CIA's 'extraordinary rendition' programme, and immediately halt its negotiations with Turkey, for a key element of the EU's human rights policy must also be to uphold democracy and democratic values at home."
"in writing. - (DE) The reasons why I did not vote for the motion for a resolution on the human rights report are as follows:"
"1."
"The report contains a number of points which are worthy of support."
"However, it completely ignores the absence of social and economic rights in much of the world, as a result of which millions of people are dying of hunger or lack housing and employment."
"The report reduces human rights to civil rights alone, and thus neglects the principle of the indivisibility of human rights, as enshrined in the UN Charter;"
"2."
"The report does not deal with the human rights violations perpetrated or endorsed by EU Member States."
"However, in order to avoid any accusations of hypocrisy, the EU must investigate and shed light on the human rights violations committed with the participation or compliance of EU Member States in third countries or against third-country nationals; these include, for example, the accusations of torture levelled against troops engaged in the EU's Operation Artemis in Congo;"
"3."
"War is still the worst of all human rights violations, but is completely ignored in the report."
"However, with the Lisbon Treaty and the announcements made in connection with France's assumption of the Council Presidency in the second half of 2008, there is a real concern that the EU will be involved in more military missions."
"Human rights should not be used as a pretext for these operations."
"This aspect is completely absent from the report."
"in writing. - (PT) The report voted on today, which follows on from the Council and Commission report, has the virtue of generally being an up-to-date and critical depiction of human rights in the world."
"Unfortunately, however, it is not much more than this."
"Despite the effort made to list various European Parliament initiatives on certain situations, it seems that the goal of assessing the true impact of European policies on the promotion of human rights has not been adequately achieved."
"This assessment, in order to be effective, should have included a clear description of the specific objectives, a comprehensive view of all the political instruments used in this respect and then an evaluation of the results achieved."
"In other words, our report is an important and very significant list, but it will never be as much as it could and should have been."
"For this reason, I share the concern of various fellow Members, particularly in the PPE-DE Group, with regard to revising the terms under which this report and this debate occur every year."
"in writing. - (ES) The PPE-DE Group voted against and flatly rejects, in the Cappato report, the paragraph referring to the Yogyakarta Principles."
"Only a small number of countries have signed and applied these and their content is only taken into account by the international community."
"The same can be said about the broad concept of 'sexual reproductive health', a catch-all term within which some try to hide or introduce ideas in which anything goes."
"We cannot subscribe to this."
"in writing. - With the dramatic rise in global food prices, the need to see having enough food as a human right is important."
"This food crisis, where the poorest in our world will suffer the most, needs immediate action."
"I call on the European Council and Commission to use all means necessary to help those affected by the dramatic increase in food prices."
"I chose to abstain from voting on this matter because Mr Cappato's report contains parts which advocate that decisions should be taken by the EU (in particular paragraphs 15, 45 and 141)."
"I believe that it is up to the Member States to decide on issues relating to human rights."
"in writing. - (PL) The Cappato report gave priority to the issue of unspecified discrimination based on sexual orientation and to reproductive rights."
"At the same time it paid scant attention to current widespread infringement of religious freedom."
"That is the reason why I was unable to support this report during today's vote."
"in writing. - British Conservatives recognise the important role of the EU in promoting human rights and democracy in the world."
"We can support a number of important points that are contained in the Cappato report."
"However, there are a number of paragraphs that we fundamentally disagree with."
"For instance, paragraphs 2, 5, 14, 15, 30 and 38."
"In addition, British Conservative Members have, in accordance with convention, been given a free vote on matters relating to the death penalty and abortion."
"We have voted in favour on the final vote because we wish to make clear our support, in principle, for the cause of upholding and strengthening human rights throughout the world."
"We believe the EU's Member States have an important role to play in this task."
"in writing. - (DE) I did not vote for the human rights report, for the following reasons:"
"1."
"Human rights are inalienable, indivisible and universally applicable."
"Nonetheless, social and economic rights, and the massive violation of these rights worldwide, barely feature in the report."
"The fact that millions of people are deprived of their most basic rights, the fact that - partly as a result of the EU's highly problematical policies - they have less and less food available, and that hunger, disease and a lack of decent housing are their cruel reality, that many people have no access to education, and that workers' rights are being trampled under foot: all this is largely ignored."
"2."
"The report fails to make any mention of the human rights violations that are occurring in the EU itself and in which the EU is involved around the world, partly as a result of its military and armaments policy and its ever-expanding military missions."
"Only the human rights violations taking place outside the EU are criticised; the EU's own omissions and responsibilities are ignored."
"The internal and external effects of the EU's neoliberal policies, with their negative consequences for human and fundamental rights, are not mentioned in the report."
"3."
"The report adopts a highly selective approach to the voicing of criticism, as the choice of countries selected for criticism and the scope of this criticism demonstrate."
"Human rights policy cannot be based on political exigencies, however, if it is to retain any credibility."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report prepared jointly by my Belgian colleague Véronique de Keyser and my Spanish colleague José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on EU election observation missions (EOMs)."
"The observation of elections, particularly in new democracies, must continue to be an EU priority because although elections do not constitute a democracy, they are a key component of it and, consequently, a fundamental right of the people."
"Like my colleagues, I regret that the Union still lacks a common, comprehensive strategy for promoting democracy."
"It is essential to continue to carry out post-election operations because it is not enough, in some cases, to adopt a passive attitude towards countries whose election process has been harshly criticised by observers."
"in writing. - I support De Keyser and Salafranca's report as someone who has been on two occasions a Chief Observer on behalf of the European Union; Indonesia 2004, Aceh 2006/7."
"I believe that the work done by the Union improving the integrity of the electoral process is vital."
"Our job is generally not to confirm the winners but to reassure those who have lost that they have lost fairly and can be vital in diffusing tension post election."
"While I agree with the participation of nationals from countries outside the EU like Switzerland, Norway and Canada, we do need to ensure that the majority of those present are EU nationals."
"On one occasion to my knowledge they were close to forming a majority of the missions observers."
"It is right and proper as paragraph 38 states that we should give support post election to new Parliaments."
"I am aware as someone who has behalf on the UNDP on advising the new Indonesian Parliament in 1999 on revisions to their Rules of Procedure, of exactly how useful this can be."
"I congratulate my two colleagues on their report which I am sure we will revisit in the new legislature after 2009."
"We are opposed to the passages in the report which seek to turn the EU's election observation missions into policy toward third countries."
"Irregularities found should be dealt with through bodies with greater legitimacy and broader support than the EU, in this case primarily the OSCE and the UN."
"However, the EU does have a role to play as an election observer together with these other international bodies."
"The experience and expertise which the EU has built up is of great importance and should also be used in future."
"We have therefore chosen to support the report."
"in writing. - (PT) This own-initiative report must not be viewed in isolation, but rather as an integrated element of the EU's common foreign and security policy."
"As a result, we would say that it is imbued with an attitude of arrogance and self-praise, one example of which is the self-assessment of the EU as 'leading' in the area of international election observation."
"It is based on this attitude of the 'superiority' of the 'values' and conduct of the EU that frequent attempts are made to use election observation missions as an instrument of pressure and interference in the internal affairs of countries, mainly those which insist on development projects based on an affirmation of national sovereignty and independence."
"Viewed in another way, what is the EU actually attempting to do with the 'common, comprehensive strategy for promoting democracy'?"
"What is the EU attempting to do with the financing of national parliaments and political parties in other countries?"
"The answer is given by our own situation."
"The EU is attempting to impose a single model (of capitalism) on people."
"This model serves the interests of intensified exploitation and imposes the liberalisation of international trade."
"It accepts the sacrifice of progress for people and development for countries to the interests of multinationals."
"in writing. - I supported the De Keyser/Salafranca Sanchez-Neyra report, which deals with important issues."
"The EU's commitment to reinforcing democratic processes is a worthy cause and the report rightly notes that democracy can only exist within the context of the long-term rooting of democratic values."
"This crucial fact was ignored when the US and UK decided to go to war in Iraq."
"The disastrous circumstances which now exist in that country merely go to prove that democratic values must be nurtured and cannot exist at the end of the barrel of a gun."
"in writing. - (DE) I am in favour of strengthening the EU's election observation missions in order to provide effective support to young democracies."
"In this context, I welcome the call for a European consensus on the promotion of democracy, which could boost the effectiveness of election observation missions."
"Elections are an important step towards stable democracy and have great symbolic significance both for the country concerned and for the wider international community."
"The EU has taken on a leading role in election observation and should now develop this role intensively."
"In this context, improving post-election follow-up is especially important, in my view."
"The EU must identify the key challenges arising from the conduct of the elections and respond in a unified and comprehensible manner."
"It would also be sensible for the European Parliament to provide support for the newly elected parliament."
"I fully endorse all these objectives, especially as my own experiences as an EU election observer in Guatemala testify to their necessity."
"in writing. - Election Observation Missions form a key part of the EU's foreign policy role."
"As a Union of democratic states, the EU's experience should be shared effectively and requests for our cooperation in the election process should be encouraged throughout the world."
"It is by improving the practices and methodology of the Union's Observation Missions that we can effectively contribute to strengthening democracy throughout the world."
"I therefore voted in favour of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra's and Mrs De Keyser's joint report."
"in writing. - (DE) This House flies the flag for democracy and sends its observers to various elections."
"For the citizens of the country concerned, it is vital that these elections are conducted fairly and in a proper manner."
"Our influence here also makes an important contribution to democratic progress, provided, of course, that our recommendations are genuinely taken to heart."
"However, let us not delude ourselves about our own adherence to democratic standards here in the EU: not as long as someone who voices unpopular truths is written off as a right-wing radical; not as long as a Treaty which was rejected in referenda in two Member States is pushed through the parliaments in a cosmetically enhanced form; not as long as the population is allowed to vote repeatedly until the desired outcome is achieved; and certainly not while there are plans to allow Turkey's accession to the European Union against the popular will."
"in writing. - (PT) The moment of an election is not in any way the only moment or the only exponent of democracy."
"However, it is often the turning point."
"In countries without an electoral tradition, the holding of elections can be and often is the occasion when the process of democratisation becomes irreversible."
"However, this is a process that we are talking about."
"For this reason, everything stated in this report on the success, difficulties, inadequacies and needs for reform of the European Union's election observation missions (EOMs) is important and deserves our full attention, but it will always miss the essential point: the overall contribution of the various European instruments to the achievement of democracy (in which the EU's EOMs are obviously involved)."
"This, I believe, is the challenge raised by this debate which, having made us think about it, we must accept."
"The promotion and protection of democracy are not only part of the DNA of the European Union but are also part of its world vision, both in terms of principles and values and in terms of its own interests."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent own-initiative report by my esteemed British colleague Glyn Ford on trade and economic relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is part of a broader strategy of bilateral and inter-regional negotiations with the trading partners."
"A partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA), containing enforceable human rights clauses, is a prerequisite for the Union to conclude a free trade agreement (FTA) with any country."
"A resolution to the problem of banking secrecy in Singapore is essential if there is to be a real prospect of concluding a region-to-region free trade agreement."
"Like my colleagues, I attach particular importance to the fight against counterfeit pharmaceuticals, which represent unfair competition and a danger to consumers."
"I regret the adoption of the principle of the maximum use of flexibilities set out in the Declaration amending the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS Agreement) and access to medicines, given the lack of any serious evaluation of these mechanisms."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am backing this report because I am convinced that free trade is a necessary step towards global well-being."
"However, our support for any supranational economic agreement has to be dependent on stringent rules committing all parties to ratification of the fundamental ILO conventions, thereby guaranteeing that employees are safeguarded and protected."
"As the rapporteur has recalled, ASEAN as a whole is the EU's fifth largest trading partner."
"This highlights our many trading interests in that region, which is without doubt a rapidly growing market."
"The region's strong presence, and the absence of effective local employment legislation, obliges us to ensure that the new agreement lays down robust rules not only of an economic nature but also, above all, as concerns employment, the environment and human rights, thereby limiting the effect of social dumping."
"Product safety and the protection of employees and the environment cannot and must not be jeopardised by any kind of purely economic agreement."
"All of us, united by identical values, have a moral and institutional duty to find the courage to be much more rigorous and selective in choosing our trading partners: all of our partners must provide Europe with guarantees that they set an example to other peoples around the world."
"We are opposed to the fact that the report contains a number of aspects which have nothing to do with trade policy."
"The political situation in Myanmar and the release of political prisoners are very important issues, but they should not be made part of the EU's supranational trade policy."
"We see this as yet another attempt on the part of the EU to expand its powers in the area of foreign policy."
"On the other hand, the June List sees free-trade agreements between the EU and other regions as a natural consequence of having a single market and a common commercial policy."
"We have therefore, in spite of everything, chosen to vote in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (PT) According to the report, obtaining commercial advantages by establishing free trade agreements (FTAs) with various regions is the best political strategy for Europe to overcome the crisis, at least while the impasse in the World Trade Organisation continues."
"However, the report also looks to go further."
"In parallel with the FTAs, it argues for the economic integration of regions, in a similar way to the EU, and, if possible, subordinated economically and politically to the latter."
"The broad rejection of the amendments tabled by our Group clearly reveals the ultimate goal: to liberalise without taking account of means or consequences."
"Even amendments which underlined the need to take account of existing disparities between the two regions and the objectives of creating employment and ensuring sustainable economic development, food sovereignty and security, and environmental protection were rejected."
"Not even the objective of facilitating access to medicines and to the transfer of technologies was accepted by the majority of the House without conditions."
"The effects of this policy are evident, such as the rise in energy and food prices and the increase in social inequalities and regional disparities, poverty, hunger and disease."
"We could therefore only vote against this report."
"in writing. - I support Glyn Ford's report on Trade and Economic Relations with ASEAN."
"It is essential that the Commission includes strong IPR clauses in the new generation of FTAs that it is proposing."
"Such a move would not only stimulate innovation and research in the ASEAN countries but also, more importantly protect consumers from unsafe counterfeit goods such as fake pharmaceuticals."
"Indeed, a recent OECD survey on counterfeiting, discussed in Parliament this week, states that trade in counterfeit goods in Malaysia and the Philippines has reached proportions similar to China."
"The report deals with these issues and I voted in favour of its recommendations."
"in writing. - I shall be voting in favour of this excellent report."
"Key for me were Amendments 7 and 14 and paragraph 42."
"These sections recognise the importance of ensuring accessible and sustainable public services - Amendment 7; the enforcement of labour standards through a dispute settlement mechanism - Amendment 14; and the need to treat environmentally friendly and fair trade goods differently when it comes to tariffs - paragraph 42."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ford, on his report."
"in writing - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Ford on trade and economic relations with ASEAN (the Association of the South East Asian Nations)."
"I should like to emphasise that for it to bear fruit, an agreement requires the commitment of both partners."
"In the light of reports on recent negotiating rounds, the prospects for an early and ambitious agreement with ASEAN may be undermined by a lack of negotiating capacity and difficulties in developing a common position."
"ASEAN would be the EU's fifth most important trading partner."
"The report supports the concept of a free trade agreement with ASEAN provided that the agreement meets certain key conditions."
"It is important to ensure that consumer protection is not curtailed or environmental protection reduced."
"Negotiating an agreement with a region composed of 10 independent countries is very complicated and time-consuming."
"At the same time, interregional agreements do offer significant gains because they promote regional integration, which strengthens partner countries' economies and reduces the number of regulations."
"in writing. - (PL) The European Union should exercise particular care when handling trade and economic relations with third countries."
"The rate of GDP growth in ASEAN countries is increasing year on year."
"Amongst other forecasts, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is anticipating an increase of between 4.8% and 5.5% in the Philippines' GDP."
"It also predicts an 11% increase in exports and a 10% increase in the value of remittances in foreign currencies from Filipinos working abroad."
"Malaysia's GDP translates into USD 6 721 per inhabitant. It is forecast to increase to USD 7 596 in 2008."
"In 2007 the Malaysian economy recorded a 6.3% increase in GDP."
"Total GDP growth for all ASEAN member countries is estimated at around 6%."
"These are important indicators for assessing trade and economic relations with the countries of South East Asia (ASEAN)."
"in writing. - (PT) A response is urgently needed to the problem of a lack of information on deep-sea fish stocks and also data on catches and fishing effort and their implications for the populations of each species."
"Just as this information is vital for producing studies and scientific opinions, it can also decisively contribute to the establishment of adequate fishing management measures."
"We therefore feel it is essential that this forms one of the priorities of the Member States' action in terms of improving the collection and availability of reliable data, including the analysis of reasons for non-application or less correct application of the management measures in force, as mentioned in the report."
"The possibility raised by international organisations of some of these species suffering from overfishing reinforces this need."
"The aim must be to adopt a precautionary approach which tries to balance fishing opportunities with stock stability."
"We therefore support the amendments tabled."
"We consider that the measures to be adopted must take account of the specific nature of each species, the fishing area and the fishing gear used, particularly those which are more selective and have less impact on the seabed."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Miguélez Ramos report on deep-sea fisheries."
"Deep-sea fishing is a fairly recent innovation and a number of previously unexploited fish stocks have been targeted with little scientific research or legal regulation."
"It is right therefore that these issues are addressed."
"I welcome the call in Mrs Miguélez Ramos' report for fishermen and their associations to be fully involved in defining measures designed to safeguard the marine environment."
"Sustainable fisheries depend upon decisions being taken at a local level and involving those to whom they are addressed."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, some 2 500 lobbying organisations are currently active in Brussels."
"More than 300 of these are representations of local and regional authorities operating as if they were embassies."
"They include the representation of Małopolska (Lesser Poland) which is my European constituency."
"I should like to take the opportunity provided by the debate on the report before the House to draw attention to the issue of the relationship between EU institutions and organisations of this type."
"As they strive to obtain reliable information from European institutions, the representatives of local and regional authorities also supply the most recent data on the situation in their regions."
"The rapporteur stated that transparency is a two-way street."
"Following on from that statement I should like to emphasise the importance of increased transparency on the part of the European institutions, and equal treatment of all organisations represented in Brussels."
"I supported the aforementioned report because of the specific examples of how the European Parliament can improve the transparency of the procedures applied to external organisations."
"in writing. - (PT) It is well-known that the professional lobbying sector - with the aim of influencing EU policy making - is developing fast and constantly in Brussels."
"It is therefore necessary, at the very least, to lay down rules which ensure that information is provided on the interests represented by lobbyists, although, even so, it will always be difficult to ensure that there is transparency and that unethical practices are avoided."
"That is why we voted in favour of this report."
"However, we can only regret that the proposals tabled by our Group were not adopted, specifically those arguing that interest representatives, in addition to being under an obligation to register, should also be obliged to disclose their expenditure on their activities, particularly by giving the same information on interest representation expenditure spent on Members of the European Parliament as the latter are obliged to disclose in their financial declarations."
"in writing. - I will be supporting this report, strengthening as it does the rules of the European institutions regarding lobbyists."
"I was the author of the first report on this subject more than a decade ago, in January 1996, produced by the then Rules Committee, and the legislations we currently have in place regarding lobbyist are those proposed in my original report."
"More than 10 years on it is clearly time to modify and strengthen these rules."
"We failed last time to have a common system for all of the institutions but this now seems possible."
"For me lobbyists are all those who want to come into the Parliament, Commission or Council to influence the decision-making process, whether employers or employees, consumer groups, producer groups or special interest groups."
"It is estimated there are around 5 000 lobbyist in Brussels - seven for each and every MEP."
"The vast majority do a good job - a very small number do not."
"We need to ensure that the few do not taint the many and that our work benefits from outside inputs rather than being distorted by it."
"I look forward to the proposals for a 'common legislation' by the end of the year."
"in writing. - (FR) I abstained on the Stubb report on the framework for the activities of lobbyists because I believe that some of my fellow Members are making too much of a fuss over an activity that is as old as mankind, namely the attempt to influence decision-makers."
"It is normal for citizens to get together to defend their interests."
"Trade unions, employers' associations and NGOs have the right to defend their interests to any legislator."
"The legislator has the duty to listen before making a decision."
"However, the legislator must remain independent, hence the importance of Members declaring their financial interests."
"Nevertheless, the report's main shortcoming is that it remains silent on the funding of certain associations from the EU budget."
"That is an area where transparency should also come into play."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is perfectly normal to consult the parties affected by legislation that is being prepared or adopted."
"As parliamentarians who are called upon to make decisions on issues that are sometimes extremely technical, we are the first to recognise the very important informative role played by what are commonly known as lobbyists."
"Their activity is useful, but their relations with all the institutions must be governed by a strong, coherent framework, and that is why we will vote in favour of this report."
"I would, however, like to make a number of comments."
"It is important not to put all interest groups together: the representatives of multinationals or NGOs cannot be treated in the same way as the representatives of democratic local or national authorities."
"In our opinion, the 'legislative footprint', i.e. the reference to the groups consulted, must be compulsory, notably for the Commission."
"We know how much influence these groups have on the preparation of legislative proposals or the direction of a European policy, and how difficult it is for the legislator to amend such proposals or directions to any great extent."
"Finally, the financial information requested of lobbyists must be sufficiently detailed to enable us to identify clearly the financial interests at stake and the source of the funding."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report, which ensures greater transparency."
"Lobbyists are important actors who can provide useful expertise."
"It is, however, essential to be able to identify the organisations represented by the pressure groups."
"A compulsory public register for lobbyists, shared by the Council, the Commission and Parliament and listing all of their sources of funding, is a good initiative that will provide greater clarity."
"The establishment of a 'one-stop shop' where lobbyists could register only once in order to have access to Parliament, the Commission and the Council will also simplify the situation."
"It is normal, too, that sanctions should be envisaged for lobbyists who do not comply with the code of conduct."
"There should be a set of rules governing permanent access by lobbyists to the premises of the European Parliament."
"We support the current Code of Conduct."
"We support increased transparency in political decision-making."
"We voted against the report because it leads to a bureaucracy which counteracts its own objectives."
"Comprehensive regulation of the contacts of politicians obstructs natural and open contact between citizens and elected representatives."
"Citizens should be able to contact their representatives without their conversations and opinions being reported openly."
"It is not possible to provide a detailed account of how opinions and views are formed."
"The argument and responsibility for decisions must be transparent, not the dialogue between individuals."
"It is important to safeguard the integrity of individual parliamentarians and individual citizens."
"The transparency which is proposed in the report risks becoming illusory and misleading."
"Transparency must be based on politicians taking responsibility for their positions and accounting for their motives."
"Furthermore, a common register of lobbyists shared by the European Parliament and the Commission would be to give up Parliament's independence."
"In summary, political decision-making should be based on the elected representatives having and being presumed to have integrity."
"in writing. - I welcome the proposed register of lobbyists."
"At a time when public confidence in politics is at a low, it is essential that the political institutions are as transparent in their operations as possible."
"I also welcome the fact that lawyers will be exempt from registration when giving legal advice; this is in keeping with the principle long recognised in the Scottish legal tradition of lawyer-client confidentiality."
"However, a number of my own group's key amendments designed to make stricter rules were unsuccessful and accordingly both I and the group abstained on the final vote."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this report, but I believe more actions could be adopted in order to guarantee a balanced representation of the citizens, without favouring the groups of interests around the European institutions."
"The lobby activity has experienced an important evolution, currently reaching over 2,500 organizations with more than 15,000 employees in Brussels alone."
"Once the Lisbon Treaty comes into force and new competencies are created for the Parliament and the European Union, this tendency will intensify."
"While the groups of interests with headquarters in Brussels have easy access to the European political process, the groups of citizens and the nongovernmental organizations do not have the same means to make their voice heard when adopting the European legislative acts."
"It is obvious that we have to facilitate the dialogue between the European institutions and those organizations in the Member States."
"For this reason, I believe the Commission and the Parliament representations should fulfil the function of transmitting the opinions and various initiatives of the citizens to the European decision-making institutions."
"We should also create the adequate budgetary lines for financing this activity."
"in writing. - (PL) I am glad that the European Parliament is dealing with lobbying."
"This cannot be a taboo subject for public opinion. Certain rules are required, and transparency is essential."
"This is a sensitive area in political and economic terms."
"We are aware that lawmakers benefit from the subject-specific knowledge gained from contacts with experts."
"This is also a type of dialogue with society, and has a kind of reciprocal effect."
"After all, Members and officials of the European Commission and other institutions do not operate in their own isolated world."
"The knowledge gained enables them to create better and more user-friendly legislation."
"On the other hand, the question of unfair influence on lawmaking arises."
"There are also instances when the law is slanted so as to favour the interests of specific pressure groups, such as pro-abortionists and large corporations."
"This leads directly to corruption and the final outcome is not genuine legislation but a hotchpotch of provisions."
"Will we really contrive to make legal provisions stricter and tighten them up so as to prevent inappropriate lobbying and corruption?"
"Sadly, the answer is obvious."
"We will be unable to do so."
"It will always be possible to find a loophole in the provisions or a way around them."
"We should also bear in mind that so-called bad lobbying is also possible through direct contacts in the Member States."
"I am positively inclined towards the report, but cannot accept the amendments whereby churches are deemed to be lobby groups."
"We must consider ethics, compliance with transparency and morality as well as the letter of the law."
"Morality can never be the enemy of democracy!"
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, it is a pity that Amendment 7, which was proposed on behalf of my group, was not adopted."
"The amendment would have been essential to understand the scale of the debate on lobbying, not just as a reminder to the Commission but also to a wider audience."
"A good example of this is the environmental organisations, whose resources are frequently compared to those of industry, though in an utterly peculiar way: the budget for a single organisation's forest campaign might be compared to the totals for the entire budgets of all forest companies."
"This is to forget that forest companies cannot spend all their money on communications: they are actually engaged in producing timber and paper."
"It would be more reasonable to compare companies' budgets for communications, but from that would have to be subtracted the stock exchange release, which is a drain on resources."
"Then on the other side one would have to calculate the forestry campaign cash for all the environmental organisations."
"When we look beneath the surface, therefore, the resources used are very often revealed to be on a more equal footing than the image created might suggest."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the report on the establishment of a framework for the activities of interest representatives in the European institutions."
"In order to safeguard the transparency of the European institutions, a structured framework for the activities of lobbyists is required."
"I agree with the definition of lobbying as all areas of activity carried out with the objective of influencing the policy formulation and decision-making processes of the EU institutions, and that all players falling within that definition should be considered lobbyists and treated in the same way."
"in writing. - (NL) Half-baked measures will be no help at all with the problem of lobbyists."
"Only complete transparency and obligatory records can restrict the growing influence of the industrial lobby."
"We need this quickly, as all too often we see Members tabling amendments here which have literally been taken over by a lobbyist."
"Politicians should be influenced in the first place by their voters, their supporters and their own good sense, not by an army of professional lobbyists."
"I therefore call on the European Commission to come up with a much more far-reaching package of measures."
"The report on the 'interest groups', and well-known 'lobbyists', is a blatantly cynical admission of the deeply reactionary role of the European Parliament and the EU as a whole, and the class interests that it serves."
"The European Parliament has for years officially sanctioned the right of representatives of monopoly groups to have free access to the European Parliament in order to apply pressure, bribe and insist on legislative interventions ensuring and increasing their profits."
"Using the transparency rules as a pretext, the report tries to whitewash the direct intervention of monopolies."
"It brands trade-unions, professional and mass organisations as 'lobbyists'. The workers' and popular movement is thus lumped together with capitalists, whom the report has the nerve to describe as representatives of civil society."
"The only difference is that they find the doors of Parliament wide open to them, while the workers are not allowed near them."
"Let the workers have no illusions."
"The European Parliament and its Members are not independent."
"They have been elected on a platform representing class interests which they represent in the European Parliament."
"For the workers, the course that best serves their own interests is to overturn political groupings, weaken the capitalist parties, and resist and oppose a capitalist-orientated EU."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the recommendation contained within the report 'Framework for the activities of lobbyists in the EU institutions'."
"These proposals for more transparency in lobbying place the European Parliament well ahead of almost any other parliament in the world in terms of regulating lobbyists and ensuring full financial disclosure."
"in writing. - (NL) The politics of the EU are to a large extent becoming prescribed by the interests of large enterprises, which try to reinforce their global competitive positions by cutting costs in the areas of the environment, wages, industrial safety and consumer protection."
"It does not surprise us that these companies are doing this, but as long as they are doing it, it must be clear to everyone."
"That puts the trade unions, the environmental movements and the consumer groups in a position to do something about it."
"For years I have been urging, in questions to the European Commission among other things, the strictest possible regulations governing transparency with regard to lobbyists."
"I see that the tough version has still not been adopted today."
"Then the 10 specific amendments tabled by the United Left and the Greens did not get a majority."
"These proposals related to a common register of all lobbyists who have access to EU institutions, openness regarding the aims and financing of lobbyists, further measures to be introduced in 2009, publication of unethical behaviour by lobbyists, clarification concerning special consultants to the European Commission, and a clampdown on civil servants acting as paid lobbyists while on leave."
"In spite of the rejection of this better option, the decision that has been taken today is a step forward."
"On account of that, the two representatives of the Dutch Socialist Party voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Stubb report on the development of the framework for the activities of interest representatives (lobbyists) in the European institutions."
"It provides a clearer definition of the activities of lobbyists, of whom there are an estimated 15 000."
"I therefore support the initiative to establish a common register where lobbyists will be able to register just once to gain access to the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"In addition, all lobbyists will thereby commit to observing a code of conduct."
"It is essential for Members and European officials to be able to identify the organisations represented by interest groups and for these groups to respect the principles of honesty and good conduct."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report aimed at providing a better framework for the activities of interest representatives in the EU."
"There is an army of lobbyists in Brussels: it is estimated that are some 15 000 of them, representing 2 500 pressure groups."
"Their main aim is to influence Community decisions and their activity - although viewed with mistrust and suspicion by some citizens - is an important part of democratic life."
"For example, a Member will always have a better understanding of the issues involved in a legislative proposal after having listened to the opinion of the professional associations, NGOs, trade unions or regional representatives."
"Nevertheless, lobbying can only serve democracy if it is transparent."
"Members, like citizens, must be able to determine the precise identity of these actors."
"Who finances them?"
"What interests are they really defending?"
"By requiring lobbyists to join a public register shared by all the Community institutions and indicate in it the details of their funding, the text meets this requirement."
"In addition, lobbyists will from now on have to comply with a code of conduct and will be subject to sanctions if they fail to respect the rules therein."
"in writing. - (PT) The changes in our globalised world and their consequences on the institutions are undoubtedly resulting in ever-increasing exposure to various social actors."
"We are therefore seeing increasing numbers of groups contacting this Parliament or the Commission, providing specialised information which is recognised as important."
"It is thus necessary to act so that these new interest representatives are clearly identified and so that rules on their activities are laid down and observed."
"This report provides a definition of 'interest representatives', together with measures for assessing the implications of a common register for Parliament and the Commission."
"It also aims to increase information measures with regard to the financial data needed to ensure that political decision-makers and the general public can identify the main driving forces behind a given lobbying activity."
"I believe that these measures are important steps for ensuring greater clarity and legitimacy of the decision-making process of European political decision-makers, particularly as, in the vote, certain amendments were rejected which would only have served to devalue the correct assessment of this activity, in the name of outdated ideological preconceptions."
"A parliamentarian always has a great need to obtain relevant information in order to be able to make good decisions."
"It goes without saying that one person cannot be an expert in everything."
"In that sense, lobbying can be a valuable addition to information-gathering by providing expertise and relevant impact analyses."
"However, citizens are entitled to know what special interests are active."
"How influential a lobby group is does not necessarily depend on financial strength - animal rights activists and other social movements can be at least as successful as industrial interests."
"Registering interests is, of course, not entirely simple, not least when it comes to defining who or what groups are carrying out lobbying activities."
"However, as a decision-maker I consider it relevant continuously to monitor who is putting time and effort into influencing legislation."
"If you have nothing to hide, you also have nothing to be worried about."
"Trolls are destroyed by daylight."
"in writing. - (DA) I voted in favour of the lobby report in its final version because in spite of everything it is a microscopic step forward in relation to the current situation."
"The failure to progress further is in itself proof of the influence that lobbyists have over the EU system."
"in writing. - The need for greater transparency of lobbying is essential in the European Parliament."
"I hope that this report will increase openness and transparency of lobbying in Parliament."
"I voted in favour of the lobby report in its final version because it is, in spite of everything, a microscopic step forward relative to the present situation."
"The fact that it did not succeed in going further is in itself testament to how much influence lobbyists have over the EU system."
"Sport is part of the Lisbon Treaty and will therefore gain a more prominent role in EU policy with the entry into force of that treaty."
"We Social Democrats would like to emphasise that sport is already a cross-border activity, but that does not mean that European institutions like the Council, the Commission and Parliament should involve themselves in the detailed management of the sports movement."
"Instead, sport should govern itself as far as possible in order to retain its independence and autonomy."
"in writing. - (IT) It is a great pleasure for me to vote in favour of the report by Mr Mavrommatis on safeguards for sport."
"Indeed, I believe that sport is an indissociable element of European culture and citizenship."
"Given that it is a significant way to promote social inclusion and intercultural dialogue, sport must be regulated at last so as to safeguard young people and protect them from dangers inherent in the sector: commercial pressure, fraud, the exploitation of minors and violence."
"Of course, the entire sporting system cannot survive without funding."
"In many instances funding comes from television rights, so for this reason I believe it is advisable not only to allow media organisations to pay to cover sporting fixtures but also to ensure broad public access, at least to major events."
"I am pleased to note that the report also contains a reminder of proper sporting conduct and appeals for measures to tackle racism and doping which, quite apart from its possible effects, is the most unsportsmanlike practice imaginable."
"It is therefore a good idea to have closer cooperation at every level to combat the problem, because doping undermines the very essence of sport: a love of competition, drawing on all one's resources and performing to the best of one's ability."
"Man has always risen to this challenge."
"in writing. - (PL) In the context of the debate on the role of sport in the European Union I should like to emphasise the importance of local activities."
"I believe they represent the first step towards the development of a European policy aimed at promoting sport."
"I represent Małoplolska (Lesser Poland)."
"In that region, more than 60 000 individuals suffer from diabetes."
"Circulatory diseases are the main cause of death, amounting to 51% in 2005."
"These conditions are largely the consequence of obesity and lack of activity."
"One of the main objectives of the Voivodship's development strategy is the promotion of a healthy lifestyle."
"Achievement of this objective will involve investment in infrastructure and the construction of new facilities in the area, such as swimming pools, sports grounds and indoor sports facilities."
"In addition, my region encourages sporting activities by arranging financial awards for the best young sports people."
"Over 120 young people have received awards so far."
"Support for this type of action at regional level should be a key element of the effort to promote a healthy lifestyle across the European Union."
"I supported the report by Mr Mavrommatis because I believe it raises many important issues relating to the development of sport."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on the White Paper on Sport."
"Lack of physical exercise has negative consequences for the health of European citizens, leading to an increase in cases of excess weight, obesity and many chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes."
"For this reason, I defended the importance of medical advice for women on the potential benefits to be gained from physical activity during pregnancy and after childbirth."
"I must also stress the importance of non-discriminatory rules governing sports competitions, by fixing equivalent prizes for men and women."
"in writing. - (PT) The report contained proposals that we tabled in committee recommending that the specific associations for the different categories of persons involved in sport should also be appropriately represented in the decision-making bodies of international and national federations, and defending preventative measures and health checks for young sportspeople, ensuring that all the rights enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child are respected."
"More proposals that we tabled were adopted in plenary, in particular recommendations on: the need to provide 'dual career' training - sporting and academic - to young sportspeople to ensure the reintegration of professional sportspeople into the labour market at the end of their careers; the importance of encouraging people to play sports, by guaranteeing access to sport for all and equal opportunities and by investing in the training of teachers and sports coaches as well as in more public sports facilities, with the state having to assume the costs of safety at non-professional competitions organised by non-profit-making bodies; the importance of giving recognition to sporting successes achieved by women and the fight against discrimination in prizes; the defence of career opportunities for women in fields linked to the world of sport, including in decision-making posts, and drawing attention to non-professional sport."
"However, we disagree with the references to the Lisbon Treaty."
"The June List is firmly opposed to this report."
"First, the report refers to the Lisbon Treaty, which has not yet been ratified and is subject to a referendum in Ireland in a month or so."
"The European Parliament's federalist majority is thus breaching fundamental constitutional principles."
"The Lisbon Treaty is also 96% identical to the Constitutional Treaty which has already been rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"It is therefore completely unprincipled to refer to the Lisbon Treaty in this report."
"Secondly, the report means that the EU will go into yet another policy area which the June List considers to be a matter for Member States."
"We are therefore voting against this report."
"in writing. - (PL) I congratulate the rapporteur and am glad Parliament acted on its own initiative to take up an issue of such importance to citizens of the European Union."
"The section of the report emphasising the importance of the message sport conveys merits a special mention."
"The message generally reaches us through the well-known slogan stating that sport equals health."
"As a result of that slogan, millions of Europeans are taking more care of their physical and mental health."
"That is not all, however."
"From our earliest years, sport teaches us about fair competition and honesty, and helps us to understand that our so-called role in the match depends on our own commitment, and that all the work and huge effort devoted to preparing for competitions will be rewarded."
"Foreign sportspeople take part in sporting competitions."
"This helps to counter discrimination and teaches us tolerance at the stadiums."
"Tolerance is a fundamental element of respect for human rights."
"It is mentioned in all EU documents."
"There is a further feature of this report that contributes to its added value."
"Genuine sport must be free from violence, whilst individual efforts to achieve the best possible results must be free from the scourge of our times, namely doping."
"I voted against the report because I think it is too closely related to the Lisbon Treaty."
"I do not want to make sport supranational and instead think that it is fine as it is today."
"However, I do think that the amendment on women and sport was good."
"in writing. - We accept the specificity of sport; however, the English version of recital I is extremely unclear and open to misinterpretation."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the amendments to the Mavrommatis report explicitly recognising the autonomy of sports organisations."
"My own country, Scotland, has a long tradition of autonomous, independent sporting bodies with organisations such as the Scottish Football Association being recognised as a full Member State organisation of FIFA and likewise the Scottish Rugby Union being a Member State within the IRB."
"This recognition of Scottish sporting independence has played an important role in my country's past and will play an important role after the 2010 Scottish independence referendum - when Scotland will become a full, independent Member State of the EU."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of the White Paper on Sport in order to underscore the importance of sport in the European Union and foster dialogue on this issue."
"Sport is an effective means by which to promote social integration and mutual understanding at national and international level."
"Sport also has an important economic dimension."
"For these reasons, it is important to create a framework in which the Member States can support sports organisations and events."
"As sport operates to a large extent at national level, Member States must have the possibility of self-regulation."
"The White Paper underlines this point and is also an appropriate basis on which to deal with aspects of concern to all countries, such as youth development, anti-doping programmes and anti-discrimination in sport."
"I also welcome the creation of a special Sports Fund to support sporting activities and facilitate people's access to sport."
"in writing. - We recognise that sport has a special role in society as an instrument of social inclusion and integration, and as a promoter of local democracy."
"We acknowledge the considerable importance of sport in health terms as a preventive measure for obesity and chronic conditions."
"We fully support the notion of strengthening the role of women in sport; the importance of protecting athletes of all ages during and after their sports career; the promotion of sports in society, including physical activities in the school curriculum; the need for redistributive measures in sports financing; and the citizens right to information and wide access to broadcasts of sports events."
"However, we do not support the enhanced role of EU-level policy in sport."
"We therefore cannot support the steps taken to further increase EU policy in this area."
"Specifically, we cannot support the idea of setting up a European police force for sport."
"The report, like the Commission's White Paper, treats sport as yet another area of business activity designed to rake in money."
"The EU is trying to convert sport wholly into a commodity so that it brings even greater profitability to sports business groups and multinationals."
"This is why the EU is using the Lisbon Treaty to extend its powers to cover sport."
"This is tantamount to the systematic dismantling of amateur sport, even at school level."
"Amateur sport provides raw material for the sports industry and commercialised championships."
"Young people and the public as a whole are being treated as spectators and customers of sports entertainment organised by the commercially oriented federations."
"The fine words about the values promoted by sport, the fight against doping, etc. seem a mockery when the desire to emulate is replaced by ruthless competition."
"Corruption, doping, bigotry and intolerance are integral parts of commercialised sport; they are used to promote the products of the companies that control it."
"The sporting and physical exercise needs of young people can be met only by creating infrastructures and developing mass popular sport."
"The values of collectivity and solidarity must be promoted to oppose the corrupt model of sport produced by the capitalist system, which subordinates everything to profit."
"in writing. - I generally support Manolis Mavrommatis' white paper on sport."
"I believe that most of its recommendations will benefit sport at all levels across the EU."
"Indeed, I feel that encouraging football clubs to focus on nurturing talent is a positive step for the game."
"Every club - even the big ones - must accept some responsibility for training and not rely solely on their financial muscle in the transfer market to acquire players who were trained by others."
"Football should not be merely a financial contest."
"in writing. - The White Book on Sport is like a Russian ""matrioshka"" puppet: the first is amateur sport, the second is professional sport and the last is football (where the big money is)."
"Thus, it gives the impression that amateur sport which is its declared ""raison d'etre"" is only an alibi for approaching professional sport, especially football, which seems to be the main target."
"The White Book is also unequal in its approach: tough on extending the existing rules in traditional fields like discrimination, illegal immigration, illegal drugs, and competition to sportive activities, but soft when it comes to devising special rules for them, as if the people involved should not be scared somehow."
"In any case, the White Book is heralding a new era of active involvement on the part of the EU bodies in regulating professional sport, mainly European soccer."
"The good news is that it intends to do it by first talking to the people involved."
"in writing. - (IT) I welcome the report by Manolis Mavrommatis on the White Paper on Sport."
"Indeed, I recognise the important role played by sport in the life of every individual and society, in that it is a means whereby everyone can overcome personal challenges, discover their own passions and talents, identify with a group and understand the importance of abiding by rules."
"By extrapolating these values to an international level one can understand why sport is able to break down geographical barriers and promote social intercourse and peace."
"I believe it necessary to point out that any kind of infringement of civil or moral ethical rules in sport - such as doping, deliberately racist gestures or gambling - must be punished, in an attempt to return to the ideals and ultimate purpose of sport."
"Last of all, I would point out that there is often a tendency to justify the growing importance of certain types of sport to the detriment of others, through huge wage differentials between the players of various sports."
"For this reason, I believe that support measures should be introduced in favour of less widespread and well-known sports."
"The report on sport contained a lot of interesting and sensible things."
"No one can reasonably be opposed to EU Member States taking strong action against doping and xenophobia within sport."
"It was more controversial, but in my opinion sensible, to support the Commission's idea of a common European police force to cover sporting events."
"To that extent I was prepared to support the report."
"Unfortunately, the really big issue, the one concerning the liberalisation of gambling monopolies in Europe, missed the target."
"Personally, I believe that liberalisation, under controlled forms and with licensed gambling and lottery companies, would be able to satisfy both the interest of consumers in a range of gambling options and the sports movement's need for resources."
"I therefore abstained from voting."
"in writing. - Sport is an important part of everyday life."
"Most EU citizens either participate or spectate at a number of sporting events and it is often seen as more important than life itself at times."
"Sport should not be above the law, but we as legislators should also recognise the unique position sport has within the European Union and the role played by various governing bodies."
"We should also recognise that whilst Association Football is the dominant game, it is not the only game being played, and we must recognise that other sports and pastimes as diverse as rugby league and hurling or crown green bowling and pigeon racing have an important part to play."
"It is not the role of the EU to govern these sports nor indeed act as some kind of sports police."
"That role should remain with the appropriate governing body."
"However, the EU can be complementary in nature and help in developing all kinds of sport by speaking out against sporting discrimination which still happens when one sport feels threatened by another."
"I cite the Greek Rugby Union as a classic example."
"I will be supporting the Mavrommatis report, perhaps not as enthusiastically as I support Wigan Warriors rugby league team or St Mirren and Blackburn Rovers, but then again this is only politics when all is said and done."
"in writing. - This report on the White Paper on Sport needs to recognise that there is a subsidiarity issue over sport in the EU."
"That is why I support Amendment No 2."
"in writing. - We recognise that sport has a special role in society as an instrument of social inclusion and integration, and as a promoter of local democracy."
"We acknowledge the considerable importance of sport in health terms as a preventive measure for obesity and chronic conditions."
"We fully support the notion of strengthening the role of women in sport; the importance of protecting athletes of all ages during and after their sports career; the promotion of sports in society, including physical activities in the school curriculum; the need for redistributive measures in sports financing; and the citizens right to information and wide access to broadcasts of sports events."
"However, we do not support the enhanced role of EU-level policy in sport."
"We therefore cannot support the steps taken to further increase EU policy in this area."
"Specifically, we cannot support the idea of setting up a European police force for sport."
"in writing. - On behalf of the EPLP. We accept the specificity of sport, however, the English version of Recital I is extremely unclear and open to misinterpretation."

"An officer of the Guardia Civil, Juan Manuel Piñuel Villalón, was killed by a car bomb in front of the police barracks in Legutiano, in Álava province."
"The European Parliament strongly condemns this despicable murder as well as the despicable act that resulted in injuries to other officers."
"On behalf of the whole European Parliament, I should like to express our deep sorrow and sincere condolences to the family of the victim."
"I also wish to declare our solidarity with the people of Spain and with their public authorities, their democratic institutions and their security forces."

"You know yourself that all European elections since 1979 have been held on the second or third weekend in June."
"I would like to ask who decided, and when they decided, to move next year's European elections forward to these new dates around the first weekend in June."
"We shall minute your point of order, Mr Posselt, and we shall provide you with an answer in the appropriate manner."
"Order of business"
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 15 May 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"(DE) Mr President, once a year - in May, for some inexplicable reason - it is customary for all the committees to meet in Strasbourg."
"There appears to be no logical justification for this."
"As a result, we have committees meeting this evening at the same time as subjects within their sphere of responsibility are on the plenary agenda."
"This is an untenable situation."
"The only possible solution, really, is that the committees meet in Strasbourg in future and that we move the plenary sittings to Brussels to resolve the conflict!"
"Seriously, though, committees meetings here in Strasbourg cannot continue to clash with plenary sittings and group meetings to the extent that this has been happening, especially over the last two years and in spite of all the declarations that such clashes were to be avoided."
"Now we even have a cooling-off period."
"There is no practical reason whatsoever why committee meetings here in Strasbourg need to clash with plenary activities."
"I should be grateful if you would do everything in your power to put matters right."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Nassauer."
"I shall apprise the Conference of Presidents of the situation you have described, and I am confident we shall find a satisfactory solution."
"The following amendments to the agenda have been proposed:"
"Monday:"
"No amendments."
"Tuesday:"
"The Socialist Group has requested the addition to the agenda for Tuesday of a Commission statement on the situation of the Roma in Italy without motions for resolutions."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to clarify the nature of our motion."
"We are requesting a statement from the Commission not only on the situation of the Roma in Italy but on their situation there and in Europe in general."
"At our group meeting today, we discussed the fact that there is a very difficult situation in Italy at the present time."
"We have no wish to imply, however, that the situation is confined to Italy or that the protection of minorities and the social integration of the Roma are specifically Italian issues."
"We have merely referred to Italy because that is where the problem is currently surfacing on a huge scale."
"We want to know from the Commission what it has done in recent years with the substantial funds we have allocated to it to support local projects effectively with a view to avoiding the sort of scenario that we are now experiencing in Italy."
"What we are requesting, then, is a general debate."
"Its starting point would be the situation in Italy, but please let me stress categorically that I do not want it to focus on Italy alone."
"We have many other factors to take into consideration, not just the Italian situation."
"Above all, we want to know from the Commission what it has done in the past and what further action it intends to take in the future."
"We would therefore be grateful if the Commission could make such a statement on Tuesday."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Verts/ALE Group supports this proposal and it supports it on two counts, because we feel that it is important to discuss what is happening to the Roma in the European Union as such - being only too well aware of recent events in Italy - and also because we all know that the European Union has the means to intervene, but those means are not well known and tend not to come up for discussion."
"From both points of view we are perfectly happy to have this debate, but we fear that it may not be the last, at least as far as Italy is concerned."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, the Conference of Presidents did not foresee this but obviously there is room for it on the agenda."
"We had a debate in September 2007."
"The problem of the Roma is a very real one, for Europe generally and also for Romania, and it was something we were aware of when we visited Romania."
"I believe we are scheduled to debate the issue in September."
"Would it not be preferable - as our group proposes - for the problem in Italy to be discussed initially by the Committee on Civil Liberties, and to hold off on an official debate here in the House until we have prepared for it?"
"That is the position of the PPE-DE Group."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"Wednesday, Thursday:"
"No amendments."
"(The order of business was thus established.)"
"(DE) Mr President, for the sake of good order, I wish to announce that we intend to move a postponement of the vote on the Grosch report, which deals with rest periods and the question of bus drivers."
"There is agreement in principle between the employers' and the employees' sides, and we want to see this reflected in the Grosch report."
"I only wish to forewarn the other groups that we shall be asking for this postponement of the vote."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(FR) Mr President, an administrator's post in the European Parliament information office in Luxembourg has been vacant for more than two years."
"I should like to know the outcome of advertising the post; why was there one candidate whose application file was incomplete; and what was missing from the file?"
"Why have we had no information on this matter?"
"I should also like to know what the administration intends to do about filling this post that has been vacant for so long?"
"(ES) Mr President, many thanks for your words at the beginning of this plenary to the family of the murdered Guardia Civil officer, the Spanish Armed Forces and, of course, the Spanish people."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I believe that the only way to defeat ETA and the terrorists is for us to remain united against terrorism."
"I think that all European democrats should show their unity and support for the governments of Spain and France in this collective task and we should put to one side the absurd divisions of the recent past."
"Let us show we are all united against terrorism."
"(SL) On 28 April a plane belonging to Macedonian airline MAT, en route to Egypt with 76 passengers on board, was forced to land in Istanbul because the Greek authorities refused to allow it to cross Greek airspace."
"In February, the Greek authorities had refused to grant MAT a permit for charter flights to Corfu, citing as grounds the airline's name, MAT (Macedonian Airlines)."
"The aim of the European Common Aviation Area Agreement signed in June 2006 was to create an expanded common aviation area with neighbouring states, including the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Under the Treaty, the Greek authorities are obliged to grant MAT's request."
"The Greek blockade of MAT flights constitutes a breach of the law applicable, of the EU Treaties, and of international law on air traffic."
"Citing the airline's name as grounds for this decision is also contrary to common European values."
"I should be interested to learn what action the European institutions and the Commission propose to take to put an end to this discriminatory practice, which is contrary to free movement of persons, goods and services, and is directed against states that are applying for European Union membership."
"(HU) Mr President, in the eastern central European region we are also having to deal with Communism's harmful legacy for the environment."
"In no way can this be considered a purely domestic issue; it is a common European problem that affects us all."
"When the regime change came about, our countries, including Romania, were unprepared as regards environmental protection strategies."
"I support the report by Mr Hartmut Nassauer of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (PPE-DE Group) on protection of the environment through criminal law, and I want to see those who cause serious environmental harm being held liable for it under criminal law by tightening and ensuring compliance with European Union legislation."
"Cyanide technology must be banned in Roşia Montană (Verespatak)."
"The destruction of forests in the Szekler Land and other regions of Romania is also harming the environment."
"The motorway that is under construction in Transylvania could likewise cause serious environmental damage."
"Construction work on the Bystroye Canal in Ukraine continues."
"In Bulgaria a new nuclear power station is being built after this Member State was forced to shut down the Kozloduy plant."
"We should be paying greater attention to these issues."
"(DE) Mr President, in the debate on the Lisbon Treaty in Germany, some left-wing groups are alleging, and invoking the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in support of their allegation, that the Treaty would reintroduce the death penalty, so that - as they claim - people could be executed for the purpose of quelling an uprising."
"This is essentially an outrageous slur on the EHRC, which represents the inalienable core of the European value system and hence the symbol of a Europe which is committed to peace, freedom and the rule of law."
"I am appalled that people are being exposed to this kind of scaremongering about the EHRC, to which the EU is to accede under the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I also protest vehemently against the statements made by some adherents of the Left equating the Reform Treaty with Hitler's Enabling Act of 1933."
"These are not only utterly absurd; they also amount to a monstrous trivialisation of German fascism."
"That goes beyond the bounds of decency and morality."
"Mr President, Britain is one of seven countries proposing legislation to adopt a Council framework decision for common rules on the enforcement of legal decisions rendered in absentia."
"It will mean that a British citizen can be tried, convicted and sentenced in a foreign country without their presence in a court of law, and then removed to that country for imprisonment."
"They will find themselves in a position not of defending themselves in a trial, but of proving themselves innocent after a conviction."
"Whilst there is a provision for retrials, not all EU Member States recognise retrials under their legal systems."
"This will further destroy the principle of habeas corpus and the freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment traditionally enjoyed by British citizens and fundamental to English law and freedoms."
"Everything that was good about Britain is gradually being destroyed by membership of this malignant organisation known as the European Union."
"(BG) Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the actions of Bulgarian authorities over the past several weeks clearly indicate once again that they have no intention nor any will whatsoever to deal with the main problem our country faces: to reform the judicial system and home affairs."
"Instead of protecting the lives and rights of citizens, the president, the prime minister, the prosecurot's office, the Ministry of Interior and the Sofia mayor have merged into a symbiotic entity and are using the levers of power solely for political recketeering of those who disagree with them."
"What is worse, most of the media in Bulgaria, which ought to be the staunchest safeguards ensuring the irreversibility of the democratic path of development of our country, have entered into a bond, through financial interest, with the criminal element, and with the powers that be, and have become their vehement protectors and accomplices."
"Anyone who disagrees with the official line has their voice muffled and is deprived of access to the public stage."
"Unfortunately, all our efforts to raise these issues and discuss them in Bulgaria have met with vehement resistance by the corrupt authorities, which is why we have been forced to seek the involvement of the European Court of Justice in order to save statehood in our country."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to say something about the very critical and deeply worrying situation in Lebanon."
"In Parliament we have been watching the situation and have on many occasions debated the consequences of a prolonged crisis caused by the breakdown in the operation of institutions, the inability to elect a President of the Republic, the economic impasse resulting from occupation of the commercial and administrative centre, and fear of terrorist attacks."
"This situation has culminated in all kinds of violence at the hands of Hezbollah because of the government's decision to ban the former's uncontrolled telecommunications network from operating."
"Mr President, let me remind you that a delicate national consultation is under way in Qatar."
"We must try however we can to encourage this national dialogue, which needs to be conducted with due regard to the general interests of the citizens of Lebanon and their desire for prosperity, security and national independence."
"Let us take advantage of all the opportunities offered to us by our Association Agreement with the country."
"Mr President, I would invite you to join with me, on behalf of the European Parliament, in sending good wishes for success to all the troops from the European Union Member States serving in Chad."
"That high-risk EU mission, sanctioned by the United Nations, will have 4 000 Member State troops on the ground, seeking to protect and assist the 430 000 refugees and internally displaced people currently living in 42 camps."
"It includes many hundreds of Irish troops who are following in the proud tradition of the Irish army's peacekeeping and humanitarian role."
"This mission is an example of what we in Europe can do now, and indeed an indication of what we could do even more effectively and in a more timely fashion as soon as we can implement the humanitarian aid, the Petersberg tasks and the common foreign and defence policy provisions of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I would urge you, Mr President, to convey our good wishes to the troops on the ground."
"Mr President, I rise on the situation of the Roma minority and citizens from new Member States in Italy."
"In recent days there have been police raids on Roma communities in Rome."
"118 of those detained have been ordered to be expelled immediately and the new mayor has said that he will expel 20 000 people."
"There have been arson attacks on Roma camps in the suburbs of Naples, with the mob preventing fire services getting in to extinguish the fires."
"Hundreds of immigrant families have fled for their lives and there are reports of a number of children missing."
"My colleague, Viktória Mohácsi, has been in Rome."
"She has sent worrying reports and I hope she will have an opportunity to respond to the Council's statement tomorrow."
"We know attacks in many of our Member States on immigrant communities are a problem, but the level of violence in Italy is unusual."
"The OSCE has accused Italy of stigmatising migrants and it seems to me that the nature of the recent election campaign has led to a culture of impunity for those carrying out these attacks."
"Even Commissioner Frattini, who was the first to lecture the new Member States on the integration of ethnic minorities, is now questioning the Schengen Agreements."
"This issue is of Europe-wide concern."
"It goes to the heart of the reasons for founding the European Union and I would urge the Commission and the Council urgently to discuss the matter to see what can be done to help."
"(PL) Mr President, at the Lima Summit pro-abortion amendments to the resolution on poverty and social exclusion were tabled by a Member of the European Parliament."
"This is an issue beyond the decision-making powers of the European Union institutions."
"Such matters are decided by national law."
"During the deliberations of the Committee on Social Affairs, Exchange Programmes, the Environment, Education and Culture, in a separate vote for representatives of the parliaments of the two continents, the representatives of the European Parliament rejected the amendment, which meant that the committee did not adopt it."
"Neither parliament found it worthy of adoption."
"Between the deliberations of the committee and the plenary proceedings, the voting procedure was changed to a joint vote of representatives of both parliaments."
"The amendments were then adopted thanks to the votes of the Latin-American parliamentarians."
"Acceptance of this practice would mean that each of us could introduce into international documents, on behalf of the European Union, provisions that exceed the EU's mandate and engage its responsibility."
"I protest against such practices."
"- (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the relevant bodies and institutions of the Community need to deal urgently with a serious phenomenon of the emergence of nationalist paramilitary groups in some Member States, specifically the Czech Republic and Hungary."
"As you know, so-called National Guards have been formed in these countries and are tolerated by the State authorities."
"The aim of these extreme right-wing organisations is to support nationalism and racism, and intimidate non-nationals and anyone with left-wing opinions."
"This was clearly demonstrated in Prague a few days ago."
"While the Hungarian Guard concentrates mainly on destroying relations between Hungarians and neighbouring nations, the Czech Guard, while also bigoted, is now becoming an instrument for intimidation not just of the left but of all democratic-minded citizens."
"These organisations, which are incompatible with the idea of a Europe based on friendship between nations, are all the more dangerous as they recruit into their ranks both former and present members of the military forces of these countries."
"I would like to make you aware of these facts as a matter of urgency."
"(DE) Mr President, the Conference of Presidents recently decided to curb the influence of the Intergroups."
"Our meetings can henceforth take place in Strasbourg on Thursdays only."
"On that day, human rights experts, for example, cannot attend Intergroup meetings, because they are on the speakers' list for debates on matters of urgent importance."
"Moreover, most Members set off for their constituencies on Thursday afternoons, and many have to travel for several hours before they reach home."
"While I fully understand the need to devote sufficient time to legislative work, the Intergroups are indispensable."
"We have voluntarily joined forces to examine issues that there is not enough time to deal with in committee, such as Tibet, the family and child protection, the Fourth World, the Baltic region or animal welfare."
"We are visible, we are audible, and we are responsible for many of the initiatives that emanate from the European Parliament."
"Now these most active of MEPs are being singled out, muzzled, stopped in their tracks and presented with a fait accompli in the form of a decision that they must no longer meet on Tuesdays or Wednesdays."
"Please ensure, Mr President, that this unwise decision is reversed."
"I do not wish to comment on the decision, but I have to say that the President of Parliament is not as powerful as you seem to assume."
"Nevertheless, I shall, of course, look into the matter."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"In the Vatican last week the Pope welcomed members of the Hungarian Conference of Catholic Bishops."
"At this audience, the head of the Catholic Church expressed appreciation for the activities of the Hungarian church and criticised the secular state, which he said penalises families; he condemned the law allowing unmarried couples to register as legal partnerships on the grounds that it legalises cohabitation by unmarried couples and gives civic rights to gay partnerships."
"He asserted that this law not only runs counter to Church doctrines, but also violates the Hungarian Constitution."
"In secular Europe the Member States do not intervene in religious matters and the church does not put ideological pressure on the state."
"The Lisbon Treaty guarantees fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion, and establishes institutional relations between the EU and the churches."
"Cooperation can only be based on reciprocity, however, and for this reason we strongly urge the Commission President, Mr Barroso, to act on the basis of the mandate he has been given and initiate a dialogue with the Catholic Church to protect secular Europe and European values. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, I would like to continue the topic raised by my colleague, Thomas Mann, about moving intergroup meetings to Thursday afternoons."
"If the point is to help MEPs to concentrate more on plenaries, I really doubt it."
"In a way it is our job to be Mädchen für alles, to divide our time between different activities, and such a step also cannot prevent most MEPs leaving Thursday afternoon, because they have to catch their planes to reach their homes, to meet their voters the next day, Friday."
"And I am afraid that in this way the intergroups will unfortunately be placed between the hammer of plenaries and the anvil of constituencies."
"I think it would deal a crippling blow to their vibrant activities."
"Maybe the best way is to trust intergroups to find the most practical and flexible modus vivendi by themselves, and I am encouraged by your response to Thomas Mann, Mr President."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, it is somewhat worrying that the Commission should have to be reminded of its responsibility for the fair implementation of European policies within each national territory."
"The fact is that the French Government has singled out the region of Auvergne and withdrawn responsibility for the management of European Social Fund resources there from Local Employment Plans."
"The Government's position is incomprehensible."
"The bodies concerned have an excellent administrative track record and this partisan decision jeopardises structures that have been working for years to integrate the poorest people in society."
"The European Commission needs to remind the French Government of its duties to be consistent and to respect the rules on implementation of European funding."
"We cannot have agreements with the European Union being applied in a divisive, partisan manner in different parts of the same country."
"Mr President, the opening of negotiations on a new EU partnership and cooperation agreement with the Russian Federation has experienced certain setbacks, owing to the behaviour of some Member States, that many might perceive as obstructionist."
"I am glad the EU Council Presidency, the Commission and Lithuania have reached a consensus that enables us to renew the old agreement, which expired last year."
"In delaying negotiations with Russia we are sawing off the branch on which we are sitting."
"There are several topics, from the environment and energy to visa regimes, immigration, cross-border projects and unresolved issues relating to Georgia and Moldova, that require a comprehensive political agreement on common objectives and measures."
"I trust that the Commission will use its mandate in the negotiations to the best interests of all the Member States."
"(HU) Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming Russia-European Union summit in Siberia may open up new opportunities."
"One potentially important outcome of the meeting will be the bilateral treaty, which could define relations between the two parties in the long term."
"Energy issues must be given a key place in this agreement, while at the same time keeping sight of the principle of reciprocity."
"A major prerequisite for building reciprocity is ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty by Russia."
"This treaty creates transparent relationships in the energy market, contributes to security of supply, and stimulates investment."
"All of these are issues of vital importance for Russia too."
"After all, if capital investment in development is neglected, Russia could find itself suddenly unable to meet its commitments."
"Ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty by the Kremlin is therefore in both parties' interests."
"The success of the forthcoming summit will depend on whether the Member States are able to step out of the shadow of short-term considerations and speak with one voice in order to protect the common interest. Thank you very much, Mr President."
"(FR) Mr President, you did indicate earlier that you were not all-powerful: nonetheless, I am sure you are powerful enough to implement decisions by the Conference of Presidents."
"On 24 April this year the Conference of Presidents decided, quite rightly, to ask the Quaestors to reconsider their decision of 26 September 2007, allocating facilities on the premises of the European Parliament for the European Business and Parliament Scheme."
"During our last part-session we adopted the Stubb/Friedrich report on lobbyists."
"Quite frankly, for representatives of employers' organisations to set up shop within a parliamentary institution would seem to me to be a case of combining two things that should be separate and skewing our relations with the social partners - a step entirely alien to our parliamentary tradition in the European Union."
"Furthermore, I do not understand why - following that decision by the Conference of Presidents - we have received invitations on your behalf from Mr Vidal-Quadras, Vice-President of Parliament, to a launching ceremony for the European Business and Parliament Scheme on 3 June."
"I hope, Mr President, that you will bring your full authority to bear to restore order here and ensure that the decision by the Conference of Presidents is respected."
"(BG) Mr. President, colleagues, the next Monitoring Report on Bulgaria is coming up."
"As a deputy chair of the Regional Development Committee and as a member of the Movement for Rights and Liberties, a party which is part of the ruling majority, I have been following closely the implementation of the Agreement on Bulgaria's accession to the EU."
"I am positive that in the past month the government of our country has once again rendered an unbiased analysis of problem areas and has declared its determination to deal with them."
"An indicative fact is that in order to improve the absorption of European funds, a new deputy prime minister post was created, to oversee and coordinate operational programmes."
"This will improve communications with the European Commission and she will monitor the accurate and proper fulfilment of commitments made."
"Structural changes are underway to streamline the functioning of administrations within ministries and state agencies."
"There have been changes of ministers in the government, the legal framework of home affairs and security is being amended, top officials are being replaced."
"The new Minister of Interior is taking measures to combat corruption and crime."
"Bulgaria is proceeding on its way to cohesion with the Member States and I am confident that European institutions will make an objective assessment of our country's efforts."
"(LT) I will take this opportunity to speak about the EU diplomatic mission in Belarus."
"Quite recently a European Commission Office was opened in Minsk."
"A total of 14 Member States have their diplomatic missions in the Belarusian capital."
"Two more EU countries - the Netherlands and Finland - are covering Belarus from other EU countries."
"However, as many as 11 Member States are covering Belarus from Moscow."
"A few examples of these are Austria, Belgium, Greece, Denmark, Spain and also, regretfully, the country currently holding the EU Presidency, Slovenia."
"In my opinion, the wrong signal is being sent to the people of Belarus, especially when they are struggling to resist the designs of the regime to sacrifice Belarus to Russia."
"I believe it is time to urge all the Member States to start covering Belarus from their own territory, not from Moscow."
"That concludes this item."
"Protection of the environment through criminal law (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Nassauer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law - C6-0063/2007 -."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, the European Union is resorting to the instrument of criminal law."
"In other words, sentences are to be passed in future in the name of the European Union, and these powers are to be exercised initially in respect of infringements of environmental law."
"This is a far-reaching and remarkable step, because criminal law is actually outside the sphere of competence of the European Union."
"Indeed, it is one of the core areas of the Member States' national sovereignty."
"That is precisely why it took two rulings from the European Court of Justice to break the ground for this directive."
"That is curious in itself, because both the Council and the Commission and Parliament have long been in agreement that penal measures are a valid instrument for the enforcement of environmental law."
"It took several years, however, to establish where responsibility lay for such measures - with the Member States on the basis of framework decisions or with the Community on the basis of a directive."
"The European Court of Justice endorsed the position adopted by the Commission, which is not surprising."
"Moreover, having now been defused, the conflict is unlikely to resurface, since the new Treaty of Lisbon addresses the problem and comes down more heavily in favour of the Community than the rulings of the ECJ."
"This, indeed, is the reason why we concluded a first-reading agreement."
"We wanted to avoid having to restart the whole procedure from scratch if a solution did not materialise this year."
"Given a change in the substantive legal basis and in view of the forthcoming European elections, a considerable length of time might no doubt have elapsed before the appropriate legislation could be enacted."
"This is why we unanimously took the view that we must make every effort to reach a solution at first reading."
"When I say 'we', I mean the Slovenian Presidency - and I very much regret that it is not represented here, especially since I put on a tasteful tie in its honour - the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs, to whom I wish to pay special tribute for their amicable, constructive and informed cooperation."
"It was a joy to work with them."
"The new directive rests on three pillars, which I should like at least to outline briefly."
"First of all, we have not only defined the criminal acts that would henceforth be punishable but also set out in an annex the specific provisions under which offenders may be charged."
"That accords with the principle of nulla poena sine lege."
"It is not just any criminal offence which would be punishable but the infringement of one of the legal provisions precisely defined in the annex."
"It was important to enshrine this principle in the legislation."
"The second point is, to a certain extent, an incorporation of the proportionality principle."
"The purpose of the directive cannot be to throw the book at everyone who commits even the most trivial environmental transgression but rather to combat significant offences."
"For this reason, petty offences would not be punishable under the directive."
"Thirdly, we also laid down that punishability would presuppose unlawful conduct."
"We unanimously enshrined these three principles in the draft."
"We also decidedly improved the definitions."
"I now keenly await the debate."
"Let me reiterate my thanks to all the Members of the House who have made this compromise possible."
"Thank you, Mr Nassauer."
"You referred to the particular quality of your tie."
"I had noticed that too but did not venture to remark on it."
"Now that you have done so yourself, however, I gladly confirm that it had indeed come to my attention."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Nassauer and I may not be wearing entirely identical ties, but he nonetheless has my entire support for the work he has done - and my sincere thanks."
"The Commission welcomes the outcome of the negotiations with Parliament and the Council, and the fact that agreement at first reading seems possible."
"This is yet another success for the three institutions and it demonstrates, Mr President, that the codecision procedure is very effective, even where the issues are complicated and difficult."
"I must say that Mr Nassauer, as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs, the draftsman of the Environment Committee's opinion and the shadow rapporteurs all worked hard and constructively with the Council Presidency and the Commission to achieve this compromise from the informal trialogue, which is before you today."
"Mr Nassauer has explained the issues well, so I shall be brief."
"It is true that efficient environmental protection depends on the effective and complete transposition of Community policy."
"Criminal law is an indispensable tool in that respect."
"When it comes to the most serious offences, the only real deterrent is the sharp sanction of criminal penalties, always bearing in mind, as you have pointed out, the need to respect the principle of proportionality."
"While the Commission would have wished to approximate the level of penalties, the Court of Justice judgment of October 2007 makes that impossible on the legal basis of the Treaty, and the Court's ruling must be respected."
"Even without approximating the level of penalties, however, the directive will contribute significantly to more efficient protection of the environment - not least through its deterrent effect."
"The Member States will agree on definitions of environmental offences, on the extent of corporate liability for such offences, and on the need to introduce effective, proportionate and deterrent sanctions."
"We therefore hope and trust that, given the ground we have already covered, all this can be achieved."
"The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law was signed here in Strasbourg 10 years ago - and it has not yet come into force!"
"It is thus high time that we created an effective European legal instrument concerning protection of the environment in criminal law."
"I am counting on Parliament's support so that we may achieve our goal without delay, and I should like once again to thank the rapporteur."
"In conclusion, the Commission is bound to make certain declarations which form part of the compromise agreed with the legislative institutions."
"I shall now read these declarations, Mr President."
"'Declaration No 1: the European Commission takes note of the following amendment, adopted by the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs."
"""Where a continuing activity proves after a lapse of time to give rise to environmental damage which may in turn give rise to criminal liability under this Directive, the question whether or not the perpetrator of the damage acted intentionally or negligently should be determined by reference to the time when the perpetrator became aware, or should have been aware, of the facts constituting the offence and not to the time when the perpetrator commenced its activity."
"It should be borne in mind in this connection that the prior grant of an authorisation, licence or concession should not constitute a defence in such circumstances.”"
"The Commission fully understands the concerns expressed in this amendment."
"These matters lie within the competence of the Member States and we are confident that the Member States will take these important questions into consideration.'"
"'European Commission Declaration No 2: the secondary legislation associated with Annex B of this Directive, concerning health and safety and intended to protect the public and the environment against dangers arising from activities involving ionising radiation, was adopted on the basis of the Euratom Treaty."
"Member States' obligations to introduce criminal penalties in application of the Directive therefore extend to unlawful behaviour in breach of the provisions of legislation adopted on the basis of the Euratom Treaty, and they must be determined with reference to that legislation.'"
"I am sorry that I had to read these two texts out, but I was required to do so."
"That done, Mr President, I now intend to give my full attention to the debate."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying that there is not only reason to praise Mr Nassauer's tie."
"There is also reason to say many nice things about his major contribution in connection with finding a compromise in this difficult matter."
"The decision that we are now taking is an extremely important one."
"One of the major problems with the EU's environmental policy is that it is unfortunately not being implemented uniformly in the individual countries, and in particular is not being managed uniformly in the individual countries."
"This is therefore the problem that we are now seeking to resolve through this major step forward."
"In the future, we will ensure that the same breach is punished in the same way in all EU Member States, wherever it is committed."
"I am also very happy to note that we now have some definitions of what such breaches consist of."
"We now have a clear list, which we stress must not be static, but dynamic, and which shows when the fundamental principles of environmental policy are being breached."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have been very concerned about ensuring that habitat areas in particular are protected, and we are pleased that this has been included. We would also like to have had more details on how tough the penalties should be."
"This was unfortunately not possible on the basis of the current treaties, but overall we are very pleased about the result."
"It is a big step forward for environmental protection."
"Mr President, last summer Greece suffered one of the worst disasters it has known in recent times."
"More than 60 people perished, there were many casualties, and thousands of hectares were reduced to ashes."
"Such was the tragic toll of the fires of the Western Peloponnese, Attica and Evia."
"Similar disasters have been experienced in previous years by other Mediterranean EU countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal."
"Forest arson endangers human lives and the natural wealth of a region."
"It is undoubtedly one of the gravest and most heinous criminal acts of our times."
"A Commission directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law has been proposed."
"The directive does not take into account the final outcome of the relevant legislative process, which will owe more to differences in legal technicalities than to substantive issues."
"However, a move is being made in the right direction; it will provide vital means of protecting the environment more effectively in the years to come."
"I should personally like to thank the European Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Nassauer, for the sensitivity he has shown in a conciliation amendment by adopting a provision billing the act of arson as a criminal offence."
"I also thank the members of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who have supported my amendment."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President."
"I believe that, in a few years time, this European Parliament part-session will be seen to have established an important precedent in the development of European Union law."
"In principle, the European Union has no competence in matters of criminal law, which lies with the Member States."
"As the rapporteur said, the two Court of Justice rulings have opened the way for a certain level of Community competence in criminal law, albeit limited."
"Mr Jørgensen said this is not about harmonisation, but about the approximation of laws, and in this respect I believe that Parliament, through its rapporteur Mr Nassauer, the Council and the Commission, the Slovenian Presidency and Commissioner Barrot have all helped to promote an agreement that is acceptable to all."
"As I said, we are talking about harmonisation and not legislative approximation."
"We are going to harmonise the categories of crimes, which is the principle of criminal law, and as Mr Nassauer said, with legal precision, criminal categories cannot be general or arbitrary in character."
"We are respecting the principle of proportionality while eliminating minimum sanctions, and we are establishing the principle that you cannot prosecute conduct if there is no sanction available for such conduct."
"I believe that the Commission's Declaration, especially what it said about negligence and the establishment of liability, will help us to continue making progress on this issue."
"For the moment, we can go no further, and I believe that we will only be able to do so if there are substantive changes to European Union law, with new constitutional rules."
"However, Parliament, along with the Council and the Commission, is doing everything it can to strengthen the law on the protection of the environment and the corresponding criminal regulations, in accordance with the old Council of Europe Convention, which provided for the establishment of criminal liability for breaches of environmental regulations. Thank you."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as has already been said, we should thank Mr Nassauer for his work on this first-reading agreement; also particular thanks should go to the Commission for helping us get there in the end."
"As Mr Medina has just said, it has been and will be a noteworthy first-reading agreement."
"It is historic in the development of the codecision process and particularly for this House to be involved in setting penalties in relation to criminal law."
"It really is a noteworthy development."
"This directive will at last bring legal certainty in an area where in the past we have witnessed a rather undignified ping-pong between the European Court of Justice and the various arms of the European legislature."
"Now we have some certainty and some clarity."
"Above all, it is a big plus for protection of the environment."
"Over the years, as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I have noted that it is damage to the environment that most frequently brings our citizens to seek our help in implementing what they see should be European law."
"Now at last we will be able to say that we have - or should have - the effective means to make sure that European environmental law is indeed implemented and enforced as our citizens expect across the European Union."
"But not only that - there is another strong message for this Parliament here."
"One of the things we insisted on in this agreement was the so-called correlation tables."
"These would enable us to see, in this very complex piece of legislation, exactly where Member States insert European legislation into their national law."
"This is something that we are serious about as a Parliament and at last we have been heard."
"I think it goes a long way towards showing our competence and growing effectiveness as a legislature, which augurs well for the coming entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my Group does not usually like first-reading agreements, because the quality of the law is often compromised in the rush and pressure to reach agreement."
"I have to say, Mr Nassauer, that if you had asked me a year ago whether in my opinion we would reach a bipartisan agreement on protection of the environment through criminal law, with Mr Nassauer as rapporteur and at first reading, I would probably not have believed it."
"Nevertheless it has happened, due to excellent teamwork, made possible through strict observance of the informal dialogue procedures with the Commission and the Council who, whenever possible, have involved the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, and due also to the valuable work of the Environment Committee."
"I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur and his colleagues most sincerely because this is an important achievement, as indeed all the other speakers have said."
"Mr President, the Court of Justice ruling has clearly prevented us from establishing penalties and this has clipped our wings somewhat but, as a result, I hope that after the vote we, the European Union, will collectively keep this issue in mind."
"I think we should pay serious attention to this matter when the Lisbon Treaty has been ratified."
"Of course, as with everything in life, this directive is not perfect."
"For example, we are not very happy with the complicated annex which gives a long, albeit exhaustive, list of the directives to which this new law is to apply."
"We would have preferred simply to have a system proposed by the Commission and approved by the Environment Committee, which made it perfectly clear that a whole series of offences were automatically classed as punishable under criminal law in addition to the directives in question."
"Nor are we all that happy with the fact that the transition period is two years."
"We feel that this could have been improved and, like Mrs Wallis, we are very pleased about the obligation placed on the Member States to provide correlation tables, in other words States must inform us swiftly of how they are applying the laws, which they often fail to do."
"However, we fully support the move to ensure that a series of offences can no longer go unpunished."
"I come from a country, Italy, where there has been a temptation to do this, where it has actually been done, and I am pleased that this directive rejects the possibility and that the destruction of natural sites, vandalism and other similar matters will no longer go unpunished."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) There is no doubt that anyone who offends against environmental laws must be punished."
"The penalties must be severe and have a deterrent effect so that environmental crimes will not be repeated."
"But should we harmonise the criminal provisions?"
"Should the EU say what the sanctions should be - custodial sentences, fines and other penalties?"
"No, it is up to the Member States to decide on those matters."
"The risk in harmonising legislation is always that progressive countries may be forced to lower the standard of their provisions."
"That is not acceptable."
"If we hand over the right to decide on these matters to the EU, what is the next step?"
"Of course the EU must act to ensure that the Member States improve their environmental legislation."
"We can and must disseminate good practice, and we can help and support those Member States which for various reasons are lagging behind."
"Drawing up tables with concrete indicators by which Member States can be compared is an excellent example."
"In that way we create a system which has a high degree of legitimacy and is democratically anchored."
"That is also how we can work best to defend the environment."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for collaborating so thoughtfully and to say how pleased I am that we managed to find a solution in our discussions which everyone could accept."
"Having said that, I would like to make three points."
"Firstly, I fully support the idea this report has to be adopted before the Lisbon Treaty enters into force."
"This will mean that all Member States will have to apply criminal sanctions in accordance with the new directive sooner rather than later."
"The burning of forests in Greece should be very instructive for all of us."
"Secondly, I would like to stress the desirability of the new wording for point 'h' of Article 3 in relation to any conduct which causes 'the significant deterioration of a habitat within a protected site'."
"This represents a considerable improvement over the narrower wording originally proposed by the rapporteur."
"Thirdly, our most controversial discussions concerned the annexes."
"In this connection, I note that the scope of Member States' competence will not be limited thereby, with regard to Article 176 of the EC Treaty."
"In addition, a list of relevant Community legislation will provide the necessary legal certainty required in the context of the criminal law."
"This approach also avoids the need to define certain terms, such as water or waste, in the directive."
"For this reason, I support the introduction of the two annexes to the directive."
"I fully support the document proposed by Mr Nassauer."
"(SL) We in the Environment Committee expected the creation of common standards for criminal prosecution in the case of environmental offences to go beyond this compromise and, in addition to Community law, to cover Member State legislation as well."
"However, it turns out that at the moment the compromise reached is the limit of what is acceptable."
"Nevertheless, it is a major step forward for environmental protection, since in the case of serious criminal offences against the environment as listed in the Annex, coordinated application of effective, commensurate and deterrent sanctions is provided for."
"With regard to the criminal law policy of the individual states, which will develop on this basis, we should like to draw attention to the rules of modern criminal law, under which the level of the threatened penalties is less crucial than the reliability of criminal prosecution."
"The perpetrators can be certain that they will not find a safe haven anywhere in Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, it is really very heartening that the Commission did not let itself be unnerved by the Member States and has presented a proposal on the criminal liability of environmental offenders, because we cannot go on treating infringements of environmental law as mere peccadilloes."
"It is also encouraging, on the very day when the UN Biodiversity Conference opened, that the legislative proposal defines nature reserves better and more clearly and helps to spell out what constitutes an offence."
"It is, however, regrettable that there are no sanctions and that there is no blanket treatment of offences as criminal acts."
"That, sadly, creates loopholes, especially with regard to the protection of flora and fauna, where offenders are not sentenced as a matter of course and many are able to escape by pleading ignorance."
"It would therefore have been logical and beneficial if this directive had covered genetic engineering too."
"Criminal conduct in environmental matters must be punished, and I hope that this directive will be a milestone and will demonstrate clearly that the environment is an asset which is worth protecting and that we must make every effort to ensure that infringements of environmental law do not go unpunished."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, this debate really has highlighted the fact that we are taking an important step into a new phase. Perhaps I should say we will be taking that step if, as we hope, this text - and I would again like to thank Mr Nassauer for his role in preparing it - makes clear, to borrow Ms Frassoni's words, that 'offences can no longer go unpunished'."
"That, I believe, is what matters."
"It is a genuine step forward."
"I would add that the Commission was not initially in favour of annexes; however, while the Commission still takes the view that this type of annex is not necessary, its inclusion, in accordance with the wish of most Member States, is acceptable."
"The annex as it is now tabled is comprehensive and includes all the major pieces of environmental legislation of potential relevance to the offences described in the Directive."
"At the same time, of course, we cannot claim to have produced an exhaustive list, and indeed it would have been risky to claim that any such list was exhaustive."
"On the other hand, it is now my conviction - and I would simply like to share it with the Members of the House, Mr President - that, once the Directive has been adopted, the Member States will have 18 months to transpose its content into their national laws and it goes without saying that the Commission will scrutinise the transposition process in great detail."
"In the light of the legal framework, it will reassess the need to bring forward proposals for additional legislation."
"I am convinced that particularly vigilant screening will be needed to ensure that the transposition properly reflects the spirit which, on the European Parliament's part, has informed this legislation."
"I am told that the compromise time limit is 24 months."
"Yes, that is correct, 24 months is indeed the compromise."
"I was being rather more ambitious."
"That said, the Commission can assure you today that it will be keeping an extremely close eye on the transposition of this text, which does indeed signal major progress on environmental protection in Europe."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, if I may begin with the last point, namely the transposition period, let me say that this directive sets a precedent."
"Mr Medina rightly pointed out that all of the environmental legislation in the Community will have to be screened for penal compatibility, as it were, in the light of the new definitions of criminal offences."
"This will be being done for the first time and is a very extensive undertaking."
"Accordingly, it makes sense to give the Member States 24 months rather than only 18."
"The other thing I wanted to say is addressed to the Commission."
"This matter may not necessarily lie within your sphere of competence at the present time, Commissioner Barrot, but it will in the future."
"The Commission now has a new resource; it has a new set of instruments at its disposal which, as I have said, are essentially and fundamentally in the hands of the Member States."
"I believe that the Commission would be well advised to exercise caution in the use of these instruments."
"Penal screening of Community law, of course, is not solely applicable to environmental legislation but can, in principle, be applied to all other areas of Community activity."
"That is why I believe the Commission would be well advised to proceed with caution here, for criminal law is the last resort in the enforcement of legislation and not an instrument for everyday use."
"The Member States will not exactly be over the moon about all of this."
"Besides, to put it very delicately, legal scholars have been extremely hesitant to incorporate the judgments of the European Court of Justice into legal doctrine and jurisprudence."
"My advice to the Commission is therefore to make cautious use of these instruments, and the directive will be all the more effective when it is subsequently applied in practice."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 21 May 2008."
"2009 budget: Parliament's estimates (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Lewandowski, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2009."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, in assessing the European Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2009 we have taken account of the special circumstances and challenges facing us in the coming year."
"All of us here agree on what those challenges are: Parliament needs to be adapted to its increased powers after the expected entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty; elections are in the offing, and the election campaign has to be funded; new rules on MEPs' remuneration are to be adopted, as well as - let us hope - transparent rules governing the employment and remuneration of parliamentary assistants."
"Not every challenge of the year to come has been quantified and taken into account in the expenditure estimates."
"In cases of uncertainty, the obvious answer is a budget reserve, and this was precisely what we discussed at our meeting with Parliament's Bureau, referred to in our budgetary jargon as the 'preconciliation' meeting."
"I am pleased to be able to tell you that the atmosphere at the meeting was good and that many of our proposals were accepted."
"Specifically, the 65 new posts planned were integrated into the estimates, with some of the money placed in reserve."
"Also, a 'Lisbon reserve' was created to take account of the findings of the ad-hoc working group now assessing the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on Parliament's new needs."
"The Budget Committee considered the demands of the political groups and recognised the need to strengthen the support staff, but subject to the principles of budget discipline, i.e. reemployment must take precedence over the creation of new posts."
"With regard to buildings and buildings policy, we await presentation of a long-term strategy in May, especially as the sums allocated and held in reserve for the time being, together with carry-forwards from the current year, are considerable."
"We found in the budget an appropriation of EUR 3.4 million for the removal of asbestos from the SDM building in Strasbourg."
"In view of the rather unfavourable publicity surrounding the conflict with the Strasbourg municipal authorities and the sensitivity of the issue, the matter requires clarification, and there are amendments to that end."
"They go so far as to demand a reserve to cover the necessary measures."
"I shall not go here into other issues involving a heavy financial burden, namely computerisation of the Visitors' Centre and additional services for MEPs."
"What should be stressed above all is the fact that we are still below the ceiling of 20% of the overall administrative expenditure of the European institutions."
"This figure of 20% is not an end in itself but a sensible self-imposed limit that increases our credibility when we call for budgetary discipline on the part of other institutions."
"I hope the expenditure estimates will prove to be close to Parliament's final budget."
"I hope that we shall maintain the climate of trust that is to a considerable extent the personal achievement of Secretary-General Rømer."
"Tomorrow's vote should go smoothly, as only four amendments have been tabled."
"Finally, I would like to thank all those who have helped to make the pilot procedure - which was thought likely to prove troublesome - run smoothly so far."
"I hope it will continue to do so until the final adoption of Parliament's budget."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that only four amendments to the Lewandowski report have been tabled is ample evidence of the rapporteur's outstanding preparatory work and his sterling efforts to arrive at an understanding with the political groups."
"Perhaps it also demonstrates the purpose of what is known as the pilot process, in which we seek to take a first step this year towards a successful system of cooperation between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets, based on a division of responsibilities and preceded by very intensive discussions with both the Bureau and the parliamentary administration in order to eliminate the sort of misunderstanding and even incomprehension we have frequently experienced."
"Apart from anything else, we need to adopt a common approach."
"It is also important, particularly at a time when the implementation of the Reform Treaty is under discussion, to re-emphasise that Parliament remains firmly committed to budgetary discipline and that it will not exceed the limit of 20% of heading 5 as long as the present situation continues."
"It is likewise important to re-emphasise that it amounts to a virtual cultural revolution, and at least represents a good start, when the Bureau itself decides, as it has now done, to put the appropriations for certain new posts into the budgetary reserve and not simply to rubber-stamp an administrative proposal here and there but to engage in a more detailed substantive discussion of what lies behind the budget."
"That will also facilitate the work of the Committee on Budgets and make it easier for the Committee and the Bureau to engage with each other."
"At first reading we must, of course, discuss in far greater detail the question of reallocating funds for the purpose of strengthening the committees and the political groups so that we can successfully perform the tasks assigned to us by the Reform Treaty."
"To put it very plainly, I expect - not least on the basis of plenary decisions and of our preliminary talks with the Bureau - that this week, either today or on Wednesday, the Bureau really will take the essential decisions on the questions of the assistants' regime, the assistants' statute and on the other outstanding matters."
"There have been clear plenary decisions on these matters, and the Bureau need only implement them in order to respond fittingly to the internal and public debate."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) How much longer is at least one in ten of the MEPs' assistants going to be working here without any social security protection, in a maze of different kinds of contracts that is totally unclear and gives rise to a suspicion of fraud?"
"Whenever the Socialist Group in the European Parliament attempts to give the Members' assistants a proper contract, with all the usual social security guarantees, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats tries to stand in the way of such a statute for assistants."
"The word 'statute' really is taboo for the PPE-DE."
"This time the word 'statute' is to be replaced by 'regime'."
"That is not just a play on words."
"This Parliament should set an example with working conditions, but it is hopelessly behind what have long been perfectly normal standards."
"Without a uniform statute, our colleagues will never be given the protection to which they are normally entitled."
"This one point, a statute for assistants, is therefore important, and the amendment aimed at scrapping it would be a blot on the otherwise excellent report by Mr Lewandowski."
"I agree with his comments and those by Mr Böge."
"The budget is still within the limits, despite the wider responsibilities Parliament is given under the new Treaty."
"Certainly more clarity is needed, firstly on the allocation of staff and secondly on the removal of asbestos from the European Parliament buildings."
"Clarity on those points must be an express requirement if the amounts we wish to place in reserve for that purpose are to be released."
"Mr President, the Parliament's budget is not adopted until October, but with Mr Lewandowski's report we are in principle supporting the proposed budget for 2009 adopted by the Bureau in April, and in particular the dialogue on the details of the proposal, which is being carried out as a pilot project this year."
"I think that the initial experiences show that it is useful to have such a dialogue."
"It means that the budget will be reviewed in detail by those who are politically responsible, and that the Committee on Budgets is properly involved."
"This is good."
"The dialogue has focused very strongly on the staff requirements in connection with Parliament's new tasks arising from the Treaty of Lisbon, not least the matter of ensuring that needs are met through possible reshuffles before we start talking about increasing the number of staff."
"We have of course seen large increases in staff numbers with the expansion of the EU, and we must now have a period of consolidation while we review the staff requirements carefully."
"We have also agreed to prepare a long-term strategic plan for buildings and their maintenance before the end of this month."
"Again, it is necessary to consider future policy in this area."
"The asbestos case shows that details are of interest."
"We are surprised that funding has been set aside for the removal of asbestos from the SDM building, as when Parliament purchased the building, we were told that there was no asbestos!"
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe thus supports the proposal put forward by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to put the money in reserve."
"Last, but not least, I would also like to underline the need for us to adopt a regime for the assistants, as discussed with Parliament's Secretary-General, Harald Rømer."
"It must not go wrong this time."
"We must sort this matter out."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the motion for a European Parliament resolution on Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2009 tabled by Mr Lewandowski, together with the preliminary draft budget, reconciles the achievement of Parliament's tasks in that year - the tasks imposed by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament elections, the new Members' Statute, buildings policy, the improvement of services for MEPs, energy saving, and so on - with further budget savings."
"What has always been said about the EU budget as a whole - that you cannot do more for less money - has now proved possible."
"The know-how and enormous experience of Mr Lewandowski and the rest of us, plus excellent cooperation with the Bureau, has worked a miracle."
"My group will be voting in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, on 21 April the Bureau adopted preliminary draft estimates totalling over EUR 1.5 billion for the cost of the European Parliament."
"2009 will see the impact of the Lisbon Treaty - if indeed it is ratified by all Member States."
"We were told that the Lisbon Treaty - in fact, the European Constitution by another name - was just a tidying-up exercise which would simplify the workings of Parliament."
"But EUR 2 million is being asked for by officials to cover the additional costs that will be created by the Treaty and 65 new jobs will be required in Parliament alone to help political groups understand it."
"This is all being approved before the Treaty is ratified in Britain and before the people of Ireland have had their say in a referendum."
"Of course, Parliament has already decided that it will ignore the decision of the Irish people if they vote 'no', and, in order to encourage the Irish to vote 'yes', the EU has promised Ireland another EUR 332 million in funding."
"Let us hope that the Irish do not hold their freedom so cheap."
"But as that great Englishman, Ken Dodd, once remarked, every cloud has a silver lining, plus VAT."
"The report notes that there is an additional need for more money for the Visitors' Centre."
"I have always thought that the more visitors that come to Parliament and see the great talking shop and legislative sausage-machine in action, the more they will turn against it."
"If every European citizen could see the chaotic and shambolic way in which legislation is voted on in this Parliament, then there would be a party like the UK Independence Party in every EU Member State."
"That, at least, would be money well spent."
"(EL) Mr President, I think we have made a very good start on the parliamentary budget for 2009."
"It is a realistic and politically astute start because it should not be forgotten that 2009 is an election year."
"I believe the plan we are discussing today has three plus points that allow us to talk of a good start."
"The first is discipline."
"Contrary to what we hear from the Eurosceptics, this is the third successive year that the European Parliament has kept below the 20% administrative cost limit."
"Parliament has disproved extreme European views by functioning in a disciplined, rational manner."
"Secondly, human resources reflect for the first time our increased need for co-decision under the new Treaty."
"We have an organisational structure that is transparent and clear-cut."
"The third positive aspect is the buildings policy."
"I think we should be generous here."
"When it comes to removing asbestos, we should be aware that we cannot put a cost on safety; price is irrelevant."
"We must therefore be generous and act wisely."
"Every one of us here as well as our fellow civil servants must work in an environment where health and safety in the workplace are guaranteed."
"Of course, this is only the start; we are not ready yet and first reading will take place in the autumn."
"I think the excellent cooperation between the Committee on Budgets and the Presidency on these matters should continue."
"We expect the Presidency to stay in direct contact with us in order to give the forthcoming stages of first and second reading a truly sound basis."
"(SK) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report."
"This budget is specific in the way that it has to take several important new realities into consideration: ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, European Parliament elections, and introduction of the new status for Members of the European Parliament and, I believe, for assistants, too."
"However, we must also consider and set effective parameters for a property policy, including maintenance and environmental protection costs."
"In order to make the right decisions we need a long-term strategy in this area, which we will be able to consider as early as next month."
"Our main task is to prepare good legislation."
"The proposed knowledge management system, interpreting and translation services, and the library analytical service will ensure higher quality services and save resources."
"That is another reason why we should have all the necessary analyses available to us before the first reading of the budget, so that we can prove to our citizens that we are using their money in a responsible way."
"(NL) Just like many other people, I also think there should be a statute for MEPs' assistants as soon as possible."
"It could save us a lot of trouble in the future."
"I should like to say something about the buildings."
"When we bought several buildings in Strasbourg some years ago, whether or not they contained asbestos was very important."
"An expert inspection was carried out and revealed that there was asbestos in the buildings - that was true of all buildings built at that time - but it was definitely not dangerous."
"We bought the buildings on that basis."
"There was never any suggestion that we would have to remove the asbestos as quickly as possible."
"I therefore think that the administration is on the wrong track in asking for that now, because if it has to be done, Strasbourg council should pay for it."
"Whilst there is uncertainty on that point, I do not think we should start removing asbestos from the buildings at Parliament's expense."
"We need to clarify the position with Strasbourg city council first, because they must pay for it."
"(PL) Mr President, I wish to make three points."
"First, if the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified by all Member States, 2009 will be the first year in which Parliament will operate on the basis of that Treaty."
"Not only will the European Parliament have greater powers, it will also be obliged to consult the parliaments of the Member States with respect to proposed legislation."
"That will certainly mean a considerable increase in operating costs, with the employment of more staff, greater expenditure on expert opinions and consultation, etc."
"Second, the year 2009 will see new elections to Parliament, and especially the introduction of the new Members' Statute, which will undoubtedly involve a considerable increase in Parliament's expenditure."
"Third and last, experts estimate that the average annual inflation rate in the EU in 2009 will be around 4%, which will result in an appreciable increase in Parliament's administrative costs."
"I trust all these factors will be taken into account in preparing the final draft of the European Parliament's budget."
"(LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the European Parliament's 2009 budget estimate, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the fact that his rigorous approach to budget expenditure has been proved right and the European Parliament's total level of expenditure next year will not exceed 20% of total EU administrative expenditure."
"Thus, regardless of the changes to the European Parliament's work expected in 2009 - pursuant to the Lisbon Treaty, this will include a growing volume of legislative work, a change in the system of remuneration for MEPs, as well as a public information campaign in connection with the European Parliament elections - the total amount of expenditure will remain within the bounds previously set."
"Within the context of the 2009 budget we should also properly evaluate the return on individual ambitious projects."
"Firstly, there is talk about the European Parliament's web TV project."
"In order to assess the usefulness of this and similar projects, we ought to aggregate data on the popularity of the European Parliament's web TV and find out how many viewers are in fact attracted through these multi-million investments."
"In relation to the European Parliament's communication policy and the expected public information campaign, greater weight should be placed on decentralised communication through Parliament's information offices in the Member States."
"Communication with citizens of the various Member States takes place more effectively by this means than when it is centralised. Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Mr President, once again in this budget debate thanks must go to Mr Lewandowski for his very well balanced report."
"And once again I would remind you what an important year 2009 will be for European democracy: with both a new Parliament and a new Commission taking office, it will be a key year in terms of our institutions' communication with the public."
"However, in order that members of the public should feel interested in, and affected by, European issues and should turn out en masse to vote, communication emanating from the different institutions will have to be consistent and clear."
"With that in mind and in the interests of greater efficiency, close cooperation among the three main institutions that are engaged in communication - either directly or on a decentralised basis through their representations in the Member States - is of the utmost importance with elections just a year away."
"Such is the thinking behind Amendment 2 to Mr Lewandowski's report, which my group has tabled."
"Our aim is to be more citizen-friendly and that is a matter of real concern to all of us here in this House."
"(FI) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lewandowski, for doing an excellent job, and I would like to focus attention on a few points."
"Firstly, I would like to say something about the regime for assistants."
"I am in favour of what the rapporteur has proposed."
"He states here that this is an important issue and it must ultimately be resolved as a result of this report."
"Now I want to turn to the issue of the asbestos problem which has been discussed here."
"Before any financing is granted it needs to be established who is responsible and how much money will actually be needed."
"There also needs to be a clear plan as to how to proceed."
"It is quite obvious that we cannot work in a building where, incredibly, we find there is asbestos after we have bought it."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that there has been talk about an Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS) for a long time now, although there are no clear plans regarding it."
"I also hope that the majority in Parliament have clearly decided that the administration should draft a proposal that we invest in more environmentally friendly vehicles for everyday use here in Parliament, but there are no plans yet for this either."
"(FI) Mr President, I approve of Mr Lewandowski's report in principle, but we are abstaining because Parliament's budget will not be voted on in its final form until the autumn and Parliament's first draft budget is unsatisfactory."
"Our experience shows that by the autumn it will be clearer and so we cannot as yet adopt a position on the final wording, which will not be presented until then."
"On a positive note I would like to draw attention to the statement by Secretary General Rømer, who said that travel expenses during the next parliamentary term will be paid entirely on the basis of genuine costs, and that no interim or temporary solutions will apply."
"I agree with the criticism made by Mr Mulder regarding the Strasbourg building programme: in our view it will be a swindle if we have to carry out renovations due to asbestos."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, in the first place, transparency in the rules governing the remuneration of parliamentary assistants that were are trying to achieve ought not to be an area for haggling and conflict among the political groups: it is the joint responsibility of Parliament as a whole, which will be asking next year for a renewed vote of confidence."
"Secondly, the climate of trust between us and the Bureau will be all the better, the more frequently and more fully we are informed in advance of undertakings with financial implications."
"Thirdly, the purpose of our work on the budget is precisely to prepare for the most likely scenario in the coming year."
"Where there is uncertainty, the answer is a budget reserve, and that applies also to uncertainty with respect to the Lisbon Treaty and its impact."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 20 May 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) The purpose of the report before us today is for our institution to state its position on the estimated budget for the European Parliament for 2009."
"It will be a crucial year: a year in which Parliament will be renewed; a year that will also see significant changes in the statutes for MEPs and their assistants; and, above all, the first year in which the Lisbon Treaty will be in force, giving our institution extra responsibility and the extra work that goes with it."
"I wish to support the draft estimates that the Bureau has submitted."
"Taking account of the increased financial requirements Parliament will face, these draft estimates keep us below the threshold of 20% of expenditure under heading 5."
"Our administration must pursue its rationalisation drive with a view to further optimising our efficiency, notably through staff redeployment."
"I would add that an impact analysis is being carried out of the needs that will be generated when the simplified treaty comes into force, and that adjustment of the estimates will be possible until the first-reading vote on the budget in the autumn."
"Trade in raw materials and commodities (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Holm, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade in raw materials and commodities."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Ladies and gentlemen, first a big thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs for their close cooperation."
"We have all seen pictures of the scenes precipitated by the recent food shortages."
"Agricultural prices, not least for foods, have shot up over a very short period."
"This has come as a mortal blow to many developing countries which are heavily dependent on food imports and were already living on the margins."
"Let us hope that this report on international trade in raw materials will help to remedy some of these problems."
"After all we have committed ourselves to eradicating hunger and poverty in signing up to the so-called Millennium Goals."
"United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently warned that the increased food prices were jeopardising the most important objective of the Millennium Goals, namely to halve poverty in the world."
"So it is high time that urgent measures were taken."
"In particular, the recent food crisis has shown that food is not just any raw material."
"If such an elementary requirement as to ensure that people are fed cannot even be met, the rhetoric on development is not worth much."
"We should therefore be careful in making food an international trade commodity like any other."
"The world's developing countries have even been forced to deregulate their food policy and switch from production for national needs to export production."
"This is the policy of the IMF, the World Bank, the USA and the EU as well, which have all imposed these demands."
"By abolishing protective tariffs and subsidies many developing countries have become extremely vulnerable to heavy fluctuations in food and raw material prices."
"Take Haiti, for example, which was previously self-sufficient in rice."
"In 1995 the International Monetary Fund forced that country to reduce its rice tariffs."
"State-subsidised rice from the USA flooded in, and local production collapsed."
"Today three quarters of all rice consumed in Haiti is imported from the USA."
"I hope that this report can give us tools to deal with the problems and challenges posed by the uncertain trade in raw materials."
"The matters we focus on in the report include support to the developing countries in diversifying their economies, so that they can break free from a situation in which they only export one or two raw materials and move towards more advanced production patterns involving more highly processed products."
"We also highlight the importance of flexibility in development policy."
"It must allow scope for these countries to develop possibilities and economic policy instruments, for example, to support the development of their domestic agriculture."
"We also demand that the European Commission review the finance scheme FLEX, the purpose of which is to stabilise prices of raw materials."
"We also address the equality dimension in raw materials trade, or rather the lack of one."
"It is immensely important that we always take account of the gender issue in the negotiation of international trade agreements."
"This report also takes account of fair trade."
"Fair trade can be used as a tool in supporting small-scale producers in developing countries and in stepping up pressure for the raising of social and environmental standards in these countries."
"We call on all the EU's institutions to apply the principle of fair trade in their public tenders and purchasing policies."
"We also take issue with the growing consumption of animal products, i.e. increasing demand for meat and dairy products, which is in turn boosting demand for grain to feed animals instead of human beings."
"A great many other matters are also covered."
"Finally I have to say that this work has exposed the true face of the EU."
"While on our side we have sought to address the needs and circumstances of the developing countries, European industry, with help from its representatives in the European Parliament, has endeavoured to switch the focus to the short-term commercial interest of business organisations in having stable access to cheap raw materials."
"I urge everyone to approve the amendments tabled by the Left, Socialist and Green Groups."
"Amendments 20 and 21 are particularly important."
"In that way we can balance the report so that we get a stronger development dimension."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for giving us the opportunity to discuss access to raw materials, which is an issue that is high on the European Union agenda, especially in the light of our competitiveness agenda."
"Let me first thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the report, which embraces numerous areas such as climate change, poverty alleviation and development."
"Development is indeed a key issue in this context."
"I will therefore briefly touch on development issues, before addressing our concerns and actions regarding the proliferation of measures restricting access to raw materials."
"The fight for poverty alleviation and development, as well as food security, is high on the Commission's agenda."
"You are well aware that the European Union is the world's largest donor of development funding."
"Also in the specific field of raw materials, the Commission has undertaken several development-oriented programmes: for instance, through FLEX, the Commission supports developing countries' national budgets, where there has been a drop in export-related fiscal revenue."
"The Commission also promotes the transparent management of tax revenues generated by the exploitation of raw materials and natural resources through several initiatives such as EITI, the Kimberley Process and the FLEGT programme."
"Let me also refer to our Everything But Arms programme, which grants duty-free access to imports of all products from least developed countries (except arms), allowing them to diversify their exports."
"Let me now turn to our key concern, which is from the trade perspective."
"It takes two to trade."
"We need to import and we need to export."
"It is therefore critical to ensure that access to raw materials in third countries is free from unjustified distortions such as quotas, export duties and export bans."
"Today, unfortunately, this is not the case."
"On the contrary, third countries' appetite to impose export restrictions is increasing."
"Our specific concerns are those imposed by some key emerging economies as part of their aggressive industrial policy objectives."
"Let me underline that we are not focusing on poorer developing economies but rather on large emerging economies."
"Measures imposed by these countries result in distorted competition at global level which damages European industry."
"Unfortunately, the size of the problem is growing."
"By now at least 20 countries have put in place measures affecting exports of importance to the European Union."
"We have counted over 450 restrictions affecting various raw materials."
"Most, if not all, European industrial sectors are concerned, directly or indirectly."
"What can be done?"
"The work carried out so far shows that there is no quick-fix solution even if the elimination of export restrictions is high on our agenda already, be it in bilateral free trade agreements or in the World Trade Organisation, but we will do more."
"First, it will be important to develop an overall strategy for access to raw materials."
"In this respect, the Commission is working on a communication which will include an important trade component."
"Any such strategy evidently should fully and coherently take up all policy areas, including critical issues such as food security, development and the environment."
"All means will have to be used to their maximum."
"A sustainable and coherent policy on access to raw materials would therefore combine: firstly, negotiations securing international commitments in the WTO and bilateral context; secondly, enforcement of WTO rules and existing agreements; and thirdly soft measures such as dialogue and alliance-building."
"While none of these elements is new, it is their combination and their coherent use which will determine their strength."
"This will be discussed at a conference with stakeholders later this year."
"Considering the importance of access to raw materials, the Commission welcomes the discussions in Parliament on this issue."
"The Commission particularly welcomes the amendments to the first draft of the report."
"The report now highlights more clearly the significance of this issue."
"It proposes ways to tackle this issue in a constructive manner, such as enforcement of agreements and negotiations with partner countries."
"We stand ready to fully cooperate with Parliament in designing and implementing our further strategy."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that you have made yourself available today, Mr Potočnik."
"Commissioner Mandelson, we note, has once again opted to travel to some important conference in another part of the world instead of discussing key issues for European industry policy with us in Parliament."
"Imagine my delight, then, at hearing you present the subject far better and with far greater clarity and vision than our Trade Commissioner could ever have done."
"I am very pleased with the outcome of our deliberations in committee, for I am afraid that the rapporteur, in his original draft, for all the good points he made about the developing countries, entirely lost sight of the interests of European industry."
"In the Committee on International Trade we inserted a new first part of the report dealing with the interests of our industry policy."
"The nature of those interests, indeed, has become crystal-clear."
"We must focus sharply on securing the supply of raw materials to European industry."
"As the Commissioner rightly said, we are experiencing major difficulties in this respect."
"In the WTO framework we urgently need better rules designed to outlaw, as far as possible, trade-distorting measures such as export duties."
"We need free access to raw materials in the world market."
"It is intolerable that countries such as China should misuse raw materials as a political tool."
"We must do everything possible, not only in multilateral negotiations but also in our bilateral negotiations, to safeguard genuine open access to markets in raw materials."
"The fact that the Commission gave way in the talks on Ukraine's accession to the WTO and accepted a degree of leeway for the imposition of export duties is intolerable and sets a bad example."
"Our acceptance of dual pricing in connection with Saudi Arabia's accession to the WTO, an arrangement that has caused severe difficulties for our European petrochemical industry, was also intolerable."
"Nor am I very hopeful when I see what is happening at the present time with regard to Russia's accession to the WTO, and I would like the Commission to take great care to ensure that no more trade-distorting measures are introduced."
"May I reiterate my sincere thanks to all my fellow committee members for this report."
"I hope that we do not change it too much in tomorrow's plenary vote."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur."
"The problems currently arising in access to raw materials are largely a result of a structural change in their respective markets which is related to changes in the international economy."
"The raw materials market used to develop in a cyclical manner, going from periods of extreme shortage to periods of scarcity, and sometimes achieving a balance."
"We now seem to be facing a new situation of structural shortage which is largely the result of a sudden increase in demand triggered by rapid progress in industrialisation and urbanisation in several emerging countries."
"It is clear that efforts must be made in the appropriate fora, particularly the World Trade Organisation, to achieve consensus with a view to facilitating access to raw materials."
"This must not allow us to lose sight of another essential issue, however: we now have a new situation in these markets which arises in both foodstuffs and energy."
"In the European Union, therefore, we major raw materials importers have to view this issue with special concern."
"On the one hand we have to consider the impact it may have throughout the world, since it could lead to excessive pressure on raw materials consumption with very negative environmental and economic and social organisation consequences in the developing countries, while on the other we also have to look at our own situation and understand our own difficulties."
"This raises two seemingly fundamental questions."
"One is linked to the need for us to review our own economic development model, because it is incompatible with a situation in which raw materials are over-exploited."
"The other suggests that we should lay greater stress on applied scientific research to ensure greater innovation, to promote the recycling of raw materials and to find new answers for the new problems this structural shortage is creating for us."
"(PL) Nature has distributed its riches - the raw materials under the ground, the foodstuffs and trees on the earth's surface and the fish in the waters - unevenly across the globe."
"Human needs are the same, but meeting those needs requires solidarity in the exploitation of resources and in their distribution through international trade."
"The Holm report has much to say on the subject."
"I wish to stress a few points, following on from Mr Caspary."
"First, rational exploitation of limited resources."
"I repeat: limited resources."
"Second, protection of raw materials against confiscation, against the neo-colonial expropriation of poor countries, especially in Africa."
"We have no transparency regarding the trade in such materials engaged in by China and certain other countries."
"Third, the purpose of trade in such raw materials should be the development of poor countries."
"That is our main aim."
"The benefits must go to the inhabitants, not just to representatives of the authorities or big international companies."
"Fourth, EU raw materials policy must ensure that the Union does not become a hostage, for example, to Russia in the case of gas, and perhaps in future to Brazil in the case of sugar."
"Fifth, all partners share absolute responsibility with regard to the exploitation of maritime resources."
"As we know, several species of fish are threatened with extinction, just like the forests of Asia and Amazonia."
"In conclusion, Madam President, the watchword for free and fair trade must be responsibility in the exploitation of limited natural resources, so that future generations can have access to the raw materials necessary for human existence."
"Similarly, poor countries must be helped to develop the technology required for the production of basic foodstuffs."
"And in that respect Europe can do a great deal."
"(BG) Madam President, Commissioner, bearing in mind the role played by trade in our globalizing world, we need to support the efforts to promote fair trade, and all initiatives which contribute to sustainable economic development."
"Prices of raw materials affect market developments and in a number of cases have an aggravating effect on economic development, particularly in countries where deposits of raw materials are scarce."
"This affects the overall market situation, and the availability of raw materials."
"The expected high oil and electricity prices can and should be dealt with through effective technologies in both extraction and processing of raw materials."
"This effectiveness and the implementation of innovations, as well as maintaining a strong research sector determine the level of success in improving the market situation and strength, in enhancing diversification and energy security."
"In terms of agricultural trade, attention should focus on relaxing the pressure on producers caused by the imbalance between farmgate purchase prices of agricultural produce and their retail price levels."
"This distorts the market but it also indicates that the market has its social cost."
"Madam President, it is a pleasure to speak on Mr Holm's report on trade in raw materials and commodities."
"Last month I had the privilege of attending, on behalf of Parliament, the UNCTAD XII Conference in Accra."
"From that conference there came a cry for help for the world's poor."
"Escalating food prices are increasingly leading to rioting on the streets, and we need a fresh approach if we are to deal with this situation."
"The new crisis threatens to kill more in a day than have died from terrorism in the six years since 9/11."
"Politicians and governments may not yet have noticed, but the world's poor are seeing their children increasingly go hungry."
"The impact will be particularly acute in Africa, where commodity prices have more than doubled in the last 12 months and continue to soar owing to speculation, shortages and changing patterns of production."
"The root causes are growing demand from East Asia and the supply consequences of a failure to invest in agriculture."
"Climate change, written in the language of floods, droughts and record-breaking temperatures, is only making the situation worse, particularly for the world's poorest."
"It is therefore my hope that we adopt this resolution."
"(EL) Madam President, access to raw materials is of truly vital importance for the European economy and competitiveness."
"This is especially so because the EU depends to a large extent on imports of raw materials from third countries."
"Pulling down the barriers that third countries have placed in the way of EU access to raw materials markets must be a priority."
"This is true of the current WTO negotiations and in those under way for bilateral free-trade agreements."
"Lastly, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that support mechanisms and a transfer of know-how to the developing countries are necessary in order to enable viable, transparent management of the use of raw materials and natural resources."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that the competitiveness of our European businesses depends to a large extent on the supply of raw materials."
"We therefore need an integrated strategy today to ensure access to world markets."
"This will help to secure international cooperation, legitimate competition, fair trade and respect for restrictions based on serious development incentives in less-developed countries."
"It will also help to promote investment in environmentally friendly technology research and development and in recycling."
"Our aim must be the sustainable development of the EU, as well as solidarity with the world's poorest countries."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done on this report."
"There are three key elements that I see."
"First of all there is global competition for the raw materials and commodities."
"We have to realise at European level that we have to be better placed to do bilateral agreements and bilateral deals if we want to succeed in getting access to these commodities."
"Obviously the issue of the world trade talks is very important with regard to the long-term developments, but further leverage can be gained through our economic partnerships with the developing world."
"I would also caution that the giving-up of certain rights under the world trade talks for short-term access to raw materials and commodities could be to the detriment of a lot of our industry in the European Union and in particular to our agriculture."
"Finally, as our previous colleague said, fairness is the most important consideration of all."
"We have to invest now in the developing-world countries to allow them to succeed - not just this year and next year because of the high price of oil and gas, but in 20 years' time."
"That should be linked to investment in their countries in education and health care for their people, to stop further problems all along the line."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their interventions."
"They have been quite clear on the challenges we face."
"It is also quite clear, on the one hand, that we have to ensure the balanced development of our work, thus focusing especially on the poorer countries and establishing the fairness that Mr Crowley talked about; on the other hand, we also have to secure fair trade rules for access by our industry to raw materials."
"It is a fact that the European Union is a net importer of raw materials and that it will remain so."
"We are now facing stronger competition on our supply markets, as well as rising prices owing to heightened competition from a number of emerging economies."
"At the same time, those emerging economies are raising barriers to access to their raw materials, thereby distorting competition."
"Fair access to raw materials under transparent conditions is therefore an essential part of the equation in our global competitiveness strategy."
"The Commission's intention in the years to come is to use all the available instruments to maintain a sustainable supply of raw materials for our industries."
"In doing so, it will pursue a comprehensive and balanced strategy."
"As Parliament rightly emphasises, that strategy must take into account not only the interests of our industries and our competitiveness, but also the interests of the poorer countries."
"As regards the development angle, we must, and will, make a distinction between, on the one hand, justified measures maintained by poorer developing countries, such as export taxes, which are indispensable for those countries' budgets and, on the other hand, measures imposed by emerging economies as part of their industrial policy and which distort competition on world markets."
"I appreciate Mr Assis' comment on R&D commitments, which also need to be increased in this connection."
"I would like to thank Parliament for supporting us on this policy."
"We will keep you informed on the further implementation of our strategy."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Commissioner Potočnik, we look forward to the communication from the Commission and the conference."
"It is good that you intend to take up the issues of food security, development and the environment."
"Francisco Assis, I entirely agree with you that we need to review our model of economic development."
"Zbigniew Zaleski, I agree that trade must not amount to a kind of neocolonial theft of raw materials from developing countries."
"I therefore call on Zbigniew Zaleski and everyone else to be sure to back Amendments 20 and 21."
"Please study them carefully."
"Look as well at Amendment 26, which deals with biofuels."
"In that, we call for environmental and social standards to be imposed in respect of biofuels."
"It is a major problem that more and more grain is used to produce meat, in other words we are feeding grain to animals, but at the same time more and more grain is being used to produce fuel for our cars."
"This is a call to the Commission - we want measures to reduce private motoring and meat consumption so that we have more grain to feed people!"
"In the report we demand urgent measures to deal with climate change."
"Trade must also bear its responsibility."
"We must reduce all unnecessary emissions and reduce transport."
"A considerable amount of trade involves products which could just as easily be produced locally."
"We need to facilitate trade in 'green goods' and smart environmental technology."
"If we do not do so and trade does not bear its responsibility, we shall soon have no raw materials left to trade with and we shall then have no food left to eat either."
"It is immensely important that we take our climate responsibility seriously!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday 20 May 2008."
"Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Locatelli, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council regulation setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking - C6-0446/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first and foremost, I wish to express my gratitude to Parliament and particularly to the rapporteur, Pia Locatelli, and also to Teresa Riera Madurell, who will be replacing her, for supporting our proposal for setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking."
"Let me also thank each of the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive support, as well as the Committee on Budgets for its opinion."
"The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking will have two founding members: the Industry Grouping and the Community."
"Private industry has established the Industry Grouping, and its members represent a major share of Europe's fuel cell and hydrogen companies, such as car manufacturers, energy providers, developers of fuel cells and developers of their applications."
"All sizes of companies are represented - from micro to multinationals."
"The cooperation between the Commission and industry during the preparation of the regulation has clearly shown the strong driving force of the industry concerned."
"The assurance from the public side to provide stable funding on a long-term basis will provide additional confidence."
"As a result, we can expect a commitment of considerable additional resources from the private sector."
"In addition to the two founding members of the Joint Undertaking, universities, research centres and other research organisations are presently establishing a Research Grouping that is expected to become the third member of the Joint Undertaking."
"Representation of the Research Grouping on the Joint Undertaking Governing Board was considered necessary owing to the importance of fundamental research to this Joint Technology Initiative (JTI)."
"In total, it has been estimated that the creation of this JTI will speed up, by up to five years, the delivery of robust hydrogen supply and fuel cell technologies, developed to the point of commercial take-off within the time-frame 2010-2020."
"I also want to mention its relevance to our efforts in the area of energy technology acceleration, as this JTI is a very interesting model for some of the industrial initiatives that we have proposed be set up under the Strategic Energy Technology Plan."
"The opinion of Parliament includes a number of very pertinent suggestions for amendments."
"One example is the underlining of the importance of breakthrough research."
"Fundamental research will be included in the R&D programme, and that will increase the probability of achieving progress and success."
"Another example is clarification of the participation of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in the activities of the Joint Undertaking."
"The JRC has wide competence in several areas that are of importance, and its strong future involvement will strengthen the Joint Undertaking's research."
"Both the Council and the Commission look forward to receiving your input and opinion, as everyone is eager to move ahead and start implementing this important initiative without delay."
"Mrs Locatelli should really have spoken now, being the rapporteur, but she had nominated Mrs Madurell as her replacement; however I do not yet see Mrs Madurell and we are very sorry that she is not here."
"I will therefore proceed directly to those speaking on behalf of the groups."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Locatelli, for her very thorough and detailed work on this report, which deals with one of the main strategic technologies for our energy future."
"I really welcome the initiative of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Technology Platform, the key player in achieving success."
"The concept of JTIs was introduced in the Seventh Framework Programme as a new mechanism to implement long-term, public-private partnership in research at European level."
"Up to now, four JTIs have been set up in the field of innovative medicines, embedded systems and so on. With this proposal, the fifth JTI will be set up in the field of fuel cells and hydrogen."
"Faced with challenges such as electricity security, energy dependency and the often discussed mitigation of climate change, the EU needs to boost the development and deployment of cleaner and more efficient energy technologies."
"Fuel cells and hydrogen technologies have the potential to contribute significantly towards these goals."
"The non-existence of a joint European strategy has until now disqualified Europe from keeping up with the Asian countries and the United States."
"As regards amendments, I support those which have been tabled in order to strengthen the proposal and to provide coherence with the other JTIs."
"From my own experience and communication with SMEs, I especially support amendments that put more emphasis on the innovative potential of SMEs and the specific barriers that they encounter, for example in reduced access to research infrastructure."
"They also need to stress the importance of breakthrough-oriented research."
"As was mentioned in the Implementation Plan, especially in the early stages research should form an important element of the activities of the JTIs."
"In my view, this joint initiative of the public and private sector is the right path to take in order to become more competitive with the USA and other countries which have a tradition and development strategy for hydrogen research."
"on behalf of the PSE group. - (RO) I would also like to congratulate the Rapporteur and emphasize the importance of this document."
"This initiative is extremely important for the research activity."
"Unfortunately, often funds are insufficient or sometimes inadequately used."
"The maximum contribution of the European Community to the administrative expenses of this joint undertaking will be 470 million euros."
"It is possible to provide new funds after 2013 as well, but only for the projects for which a financing agreement is signed by 31 December 2013."
"I would like to emphasize the fact that this joint undertaking is extremely useful because it implements and is part of the Framework Programme for Research especially in the field of energy and transport, including aeronautics."
"I believe this report is extremely important because it co-ordinately supports the research and technological development activities and this initiative will also support the implementation of research priorities in the field of communications and information technology regarding fuel cells and hydrogen, but it will also encourage and increase public and private investment in fuel cells and hydrogen research in the Member States and associated countries."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (BG) Europe needs to overcome climate change and ensure security of supply of natural resources."
"With prices of raw materials and finished goods constantly on the rise, this task is proving to be extremely difficult."
"There is a solution, and it lies with new technology which will bring a preventive decrease in green house gas emissions on the one hand, and a more efficient use and savings of raw materials, on the other."
"This is a way for Europe to be the leader in overcoming global warming and retaining its competitiveness on the global market of raw materials."
"This requires increased investment in research and new technology, taking into account the potential of each and every Member State."
"New technology, hydrogen technology and fuel cell development in particular, will play a key role in overcoming the shortage of energy resources, as well as in environmental protection and meeting the targets set in the Kyoto Protocol."
"We should consider, however, that these technologies demand the use of metals such as platinum, paladium, gold, which are integral in the design of the new devices and equipment."
"Only if we implement new, highly efficient and environmentally safe methods to extract and recover these metals, we can have the effective and sustainable development of hydrogen technology and fuel cell development."
"Putting a joint undertaking in place should integrate the efforts of all countries which have experience in both the direct development of hydrogen technology and fuel cells, and in developing technologies for the sustainable and environmentally-friendly extraction of the necessary raw materials."
"It is necessary to encourage these developments in new Member States which have extensive experience in those areas, such as Bulgaria, which has research teams that have been working on such projects for many years now, and have achieved considerable success."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, it is hard to disagree with an attempt to establish suitable rules for a joint undertaking in the field of fuel cells and hydrogen technology."
"Mrs Locatelli's interesting report describes this initiative as a promising example of a public-private partnership for the implementation of a joint technological initiative."
"Yet in the opinion I have before me, the Council confirms the enormous complexity of the technological challenge involved in the practical application of such cells."
"The experts are facing an immeasurably difficult task in finding avenues for research that would guarantee a successful outcome."
"Some scientists, for example, predict the emergence of significant limitations to the practical application of fuel cells."
"If we accept that hydrogen is only an energy carrier, we must remember that its practical application, in fuel cells for example, requires on each occasion the use of other energy sources for its production."
"If we overcome that difficulty, further difficulties lie in store, if only the need to find suitable technologies for storing and transporting hydrogen."
"I draw attention to this issue with a view to further legislative work on the text on which the European Parliament is delivering its opinion."
"Let me put it bluntly, and not as some marginal comment: my chief expert says this approach will not succeed."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for their comments."
"I would also like to say that in introducing the Joint Technology Initiatives we are truly starting out with a new concept."
"I sincerely hope that it works, because this new approach should be instrumental in bringing some new realities to Europe."
"What we are introducing is actually a move from financing projects to financing programmes, and stronger support in the private-public partnership, and I mean 'private-public' partnership, because it is clear that initiatives and strategic research agendas are coming from technology platforms which have formed the basis for these Joint Technology Initiatives."
"Working together is a must, and what I am seeing in these Joint Technology Initiatives is groupings actually coming together on a European Union scale."
"Some of the major competitors in Europe are coming together so that, in this pre-competitive phase, they are able to pool their knowledge and strengthen Europe on the global map."
"I would also like to say, in this context, that this specific technology initiative is extremely important because it relates to the energy sector, and every day we are reminded of the importance of that sector."
"One of the most important objectives of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) is to accelerate the development and implementation of low-carbon technologies."
"I know that you are working on your opinion on the SET Plan, and am very much looking forward to hearing your views."
"As I said earlier, The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen JTI is an interesting model for other areas and will certainly become part of the SET Plan, once it is be approved."
"Hopefully we will see the difference this makes in the future."
"One last thing I would like to mention, as I do not know whether the interpretation was correct, is that the European Commission will contribute up to EUR 470 million for the six years this Joint Technology Initiative is to be implemented and, of course, expects that figure to be doubled by the private sector, which will also contribute to this endeavour."
"Mrs Madurell is certainly not here, but I am sure that the rapporteur, Mrs Locatelli, will be in touch because what the Commisioner said is extremely important."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) Over the past fifty years the population of the world has doubled, while energy consumption has quadrupled."
"For this reason, there is no other option but to welcome the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking and provide all possible support for its establishment."
"I understand Mrs Haug's concerns about the financing of the Joint Undertaking, but financial issues cannot be allowed stand in the way of this initiative."
"The key words are innovation and change of lifestyle."
"This, however, costs money, but on the other hand it will bring returns."
"In modern economies, innovation accounts for 70-80% of annual GDP growth."
"Why should we invest in hydrogen?"
"Because it is an intermediate source of energy."
"'Supplies' cannot run out; it is the most abundant element in the universe."
"It can only be considered an alternative to fossil fuels, however, if we can produce it from renewable energy sources at a competitive price, without emitting carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in the process."
"In Canada and the USA, the importance of hydrogen was recognised as far back as 2002."
"Over there, several hundreds of thousands of 'eco-vehicles' are already on the road, and the number of filling stations with hydrogen pumps is steadily increasing."
"In the European Union, around eighteen thousand eco-friendly vehicles are in operation, while the number of hydrogen pumps available is not even worth mentioning."
"If we are to avoid the ultimate collapse, we cannot hold back support for this technology and fuel; we must take action."
"I would like to use this opportunity to invite my fellow Members to my Greenovation conference, scheduled to take place in Parliament next week, on the afternoon of 28 May."
"Following the discussions, participants will have the chance to take a ride in a hydrogen-powered bus or car."
"Community Tobacco Fund (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Berlato, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as regards the transfer of tobacco aid to the Community Tobacco Fund for the years 2008 and 2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 with regard to financing of the Community Tobacco Fund - C6-0062/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Commission proposal is basically to continue deducting 5% of the tobacco aid granted for the calendar years 2008 and 2009 and to use those funds to continue financing the Community Tobacco Fund, whose sole purpose is to finance information initiatives for improving European citizens' awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco consumption."
"First of all, I think it would be appropriate to highlight a few objective terms of reference."
"The transfer of CAP aid to the Fund is a rare and positive example of integration and cooperation between the agriculture and health policies of the European Union."
"Since the activities of the Fund are important for the citizens of the Union, and will continue to be important in the future, as the Commission has underlined, we consider that its continued financial support is necessary for 2007 and for 2009."
"The deduction from coupled aid granted to farmers has always been the sole source of financing of the Community Tobacco Fund."
"The financial basis of this deduction was substantially reduced with the reform of the tobacco CMO and by the decision of some Member States to opt for complete decoupling, thereby completely depriving the Fund of the income from those deductions."
"It is necessary, by further extending the period of application of the deduction and by increasing its percentage rate, to make sufficient resources available from the Fund to finance programmes without impacting further on the EU budget, at least until the end of the current forecasts, while at the same time seeking other ways of financing the Fund."
"One of the positive aspects of the Fund's financing mechanism is the provision for at least 25% of the total amount of approved projects to be co-financed by proven operators, thus guaranteeing the availability of increased funding."
"The Committee on Agriculture has frequently considered these questions and maintains its own line, which is to tighten restrictions on smoking and to improve people's awareness of its harmful effect on human health."
"On the other hand, we are fully aware, as stated in Parliament's legislative resolution of 10 March 2004, that European raw tobacco production, which is now low and concentrated in a few, specific areas of the Union, accounts for less than 4% of world production and has no impact on local consumption of tobacco products."
"Although this topic is not central to today's debate, it is worth remembering that the European Union is the world's leading importer of raw tobacco and relies for over 70% of its requirements on third countries - principally Brazil, Malawi, Argentina, Indonesia, Zimbabwe, India and China - to the advantage of tobaccos often produced under less closely regulated conditions than European tobacco."
"This also results in a trade deficit of over EUR 1.2 billion per annum."
"On the other hand, Member States where tobacco aid has been completely decoupled have seen, besides the cancellation of transfers to the Fund, the total abandonment of production, without any sustainable alternative in economic or employment terms."
"This has had very serious adverse effects on the rural areas concerned as a whole and has not led to any change in the local consumption of finished tobacco products."
"As regards the proposal to make a deduction in the aid for the calendar year 2008, and bearing in mind that the tobacco cultivation contracts for the 2008 harvest year were concluded some time ago, the Committee on Agriculture considers that approving that proposal could give rise to a whole series of legal actions or, at any event, to a dispute which would ultimately cause serious harm to farmers alone."
"Finally, the Committee on Agriculture considers that, by extending the deduction until the harvest year 2012 and increasing the percentage rate of the deduction for the Fund to 6%, there would be enough money to cover actions under the Community Tobacco Fund until the year 2013, and it calls on the Commission to prepare a multiannual programme which, suitably altered in accordance with the amendments proposed here, could draw on EUR 81 million without impacting further on the Union's budget."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Berlato."
"I was very encouraged by the enthusiasm with which you made your speech tonight."
"I also wish to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the report on the Community Tobacco Fund."
"In 2004 the Council adopted the tobacco reform that constrains partly coupled and partly decoupled payments for the tobacco producers in the period between 2006 and 2009."
"The reform allows a relatively long transitional period because the partly coupled aid can run until 2009."
"But we have seen - as you have rightly said - Member States that chose to decouple totally from 2006 when the reform entered into force."
"The 2004 reform also included the transfer of a percentage of the tobacco aid for the years 2006 and 2007 from the tobacco producers to the Tobacco Fund."
"The Commission proposal prolongs the transfer of a percentage from the tobacco aid to the Tobacco Fund until the calendar year 2009."
"I very much welcome the support for the transfer of part of the tobacco aid into the Community Tobacco Fund."
"Your report correctly stresses the major importance for the European public of the measures carried out by this fund, aimed at promoting information initiatives on the damage that tobacco can cause."
"However, your request to prolong the transitional period until 2012 poses a huge problem."
"Such an extension of the transitional partly coupled regime is totally against the philosophy of what the Commission will propose tomorrow in its communication on the 'health check', which is moving towards more decoupled payment, to give the farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants."
"So far as I have been informed, those Member States that decided from the very beginning to decouple totally the payment to tobacco producers did so because it was more profitable for the farmers to leave the sector - perhaps because of the quality of the tobacco, it was more difficult to get a decent price."
"It was also agreed in 2004 that 50% of the Community support to the tobacco sector would go into the rural development measures."
"This will start in the budget year 2011 and go, as an additional Community support, to tobacco-producing regions."
"It is important to note that it is earmarked for the tobacco-producing regions."
"On that basis, a yearly amount of EUR 484 million has already been included in the rural development programmes for the 2007-2013 period for those Member States that are covered by the tobacco reform."
"Therefore I am quite sure that it can come as no surprise that I cannot propose a prolongation of the transitional partly coupled regime, because of the agreement supported by all tobacco-producing Member States when this package on Mediterranean products was agreed in 2004."
"However, I am looking forward to a very animated, interesting discussion tonight."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, subsidising tobacco production while at the same time combating the smoking of tobacco products has been a subject of controversy for many years."
"However, the Community Tobacco Fund, which presently takes up 5% of tobacco aid, serves to finance research on countering the effects of smoking, propaganda campaigns and the training of tobacco producers with a view to conversion to other production."
"I am the draftsman of the Budget Committee's opinion on Mr Berlato's report."
"The continued financing of the Community Tobacco Fund for the next two years is most appropriate, but it is questionable that the reasons for its existence will disappear after that period, since we know people smoke and will go on smoking."
"They will smoke whether we in Europe produce tobacco or not."
"The problem will not disappear even if we stop subsidising tobacco producers."
"The fund must therefore continue to exist."
"The only thing that can be changed is the way it is financed."
"Madam President, I am glad we have the Commissioner here today, for I believe she is a very fair-minded person."
"Allow me to explain."
"First of all, let me point out to my colleague in the Committee on Budgets that we are against smoking and are in favour of a large-scale anti-smoking campaign."
"However, if people continue to smoke and there is a corresponding demand for tobacco, we do not need to import it from third countries."
"Let us produce it in Europe."
"I congratulate Mr Berlato on his report and fully endorse it."
"I request that funding should continue from the Community Tobacco Fund."
"We farmers have gladly accepted the 1% increase in the rate of deduction that goes into the anti-smoking public information fund, Commissioner, although this is money that is taken away from us."
"We gladly accept this."
"We ask of you, however, that the tobacco status quo should obtain until 2013."
"Commissioner, you are a very fair-minded person."
"Why should tobacco growers alone be discriminated against?"
"We therefore request that this should be revoked, and that the status quo should obtain until 2013."
"Furthermore, as you know, tobacco growers in all countries, especially in my own country, are the poorest of our farmers; they often come from the poorest, most degraded regions, where in many cases nothing else can be grown."
"If we stop this regime and discontinue the aid, these regions will fall prey to desertification and environmental degradation."
"I therefore request that the status quo continue to obtain in line with Mr Berlato's report, his amendments and my own."
"Knowing that you are a fair-minded person, Commissioner, I believe we can count on your support for our proposal."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I have the impression that the aim here is, as they say in Westphalia, to throw a sausage after a side of bacon, meaning to throw out a herring to catch a whale."
"In other words, the Tobacco Fund is being used in an attempt to safeguard the coupling of the tobacco premium until 2013."
"The Fund, which - as we all know - is also used to finance education on the harmful effects of smoking, was introduced here in Parliament to support the actual tobacco premiums, because there was strong opposition to smoking from a majority of MEPs, and many were asking how we could support tobacco-growing, given the dangers of smoking."
"I have always been a supporter of the tobacco premium, because I believe that the two things are unrelated, but then we should not be hypocritical and undertake to do something to combat smoking if we are actually pursuing a different aim, namely the preservation of the premium."
"The issue at stake here is not the preservation of the premium; it is essentially a matter of the coupled premium, the objective being to prevent decoupling."
"We always act as if decoupling would deprive tobacco-growers of the premium."
"We know that this is not true, and indeed we have already discussed the whole issue in connection with cotton."
"Businesses will continue to receive payments; the only difference is that they will no longer be obliged to grow tobacco, and I believe that makes good sense."
"I remember a trip to northern Greece with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development when we visited the poorest of the poor."
"We saw the impoverished regions, but they were not poor because of decoupling, which had not been introduced yet, but because the tobacco industry was not paying growers in those regions a fair price for their tobacco and was even taking advantage of the premiums paid at that time to push prices so low that tobacco-growers were left with nothing at all from their premiums."
"We found that incredible at the time, and we wondered why the growers in that region, who grew spice tobacco, which is used throughout the world as a speciality tobacco in cigarette blends, did not receive sufficient payment to be able to make a living from tobacco cultivation alone, regardless of premiums."
"If tobacco is no longer grown in some regions as a result of decoupling or in some countries where complete decoupling of tobacco aid has been effected, this does not mean that there are no alternatives in those regions but that growers cannot cover the cost of growing tobacco."
"What is therefore needed here is a showdown with the tobacco industry so that they start at long last to pay growers a decent price."
"I believe it would be better, Commissioner, to leave education about smoking to others, for we in the European Union have done enough educating, and to channel these funds into rural development and into diversification measures for these poor regions instead."
"Moreover, these resources should be topped up to create other jobs in these regions besides those in tobacco production."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, rarely do decisions debated in this House have such serious consequences for such a large number of people."
"The issue before us today is the existence or non-existence of tobacco producers in Europe."
"Tobacco production is the livelihood of around 120 000 farmers and, including seasonal workers, it employs almost 400 000 people in both old and new Member States."
"The case of Greece has already shown that the so-called reform of the tobacco sector in fact means its liquidation."
"It is a death sentence for 120 000 farms, mostly small family holdings."
"I know such tobacco farms in Poland, but we find them here too, on the outskirts of Strasbourg."
"We are talking about a catastrophe for people who have devoted their lives to the production of tobacco."
"In the name of what should they be deprived of their livelihood?"
"The liquidation of tobacco production will not stop people smoking."
"They will smoke cigarettes made from imported tobacco."
"This reform will help no one and harm many."
"I therefore fully support Mr Berlato's report, which rightly comes to the defence of tobacco producers, and add my voice to those of Mr Glavakis and Mr Cercas."
"Madam President, tobacco growers are being cruelly persecuted, as the anti-smoking campaign is tantamount to an anti-tobacco policy."
"As a result, tobacco grown in the EU is considered unhealthy, while imported tobacco is not."
"This is inconsistent, unscientific and unfair."
"The results of this policy are well known: despite the campaigns, smoking is on the increase, whereas production in the EU is in sharp decline."
"Jobs are being lost, tens of thousands of small and medium-sized tobacco growers are being ruined, yet tobacco imports have risen to more than EUR 1.2 billion a year."
"Tobacco growing in Greece has declined by 73%."
"Ever-increasing numbers of tobacco growers are unemployed."
"Whole areas are being abandoned because no alternative crops are grown there."
"We consider it essential to repeal the regulation transferring 50% of direct aid to the second pillar from 2010."
"All deductions from subsidies should be abolished immediately to allow tobacco growing to continue, since 70% of demand is met by imports."
"Subsidies should be linked to production; they should be an integral part of the guaranteed minimum prices corresponding to the production cost of each variety."
"As the Berlato report contains positive elements supporting all of this, we, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), will approve it."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, subsidised tobacco growing is a clear example of the double standards which characterise the EU and the European Parliament."
"The EU has proudly proclaimed that the fight against diseases must be prioritised and spends a few million Swedish kronor on information campaigns every year, while by the back door the EU subsidises unprofitable tobacco growers to the tune of several billion kronor per year."
"According to the report, the scheme for a gradual reduction in this support would be extended until 2013."
"The rapporteur seeks to wash his hands of the negative consequences of tobacco consumption."
"The simplistic argument is that, since EU tobacco production is so small, only 4%, the effect on final consumption is negligible."
"What kind of reasoning is that?"
"Is it intended to justify continued subsidies?"
"I think that EU tobacco production is 4% too high."
"Besides, European tobacco is so bad that only a fraction is sold on the European market."
"A third is burned."
"The special interests of the tobacco industry have prevailed for long enough."
"Our people need us to face up to our political responsibilities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the last puff has a bad taste."
"It is time to stub out double standards."
"I therefore urge you to vote against the report tomorrow."
"(NL) Tobacco kills about half a million European citizens a year."
"Even amongst non-smokers there are 19 000 deaths a year from passive smoking."
"How do I know that?"
"That is the message in the television adverts the European Union itself is having shown in all 27 Member States as part of a big anti-smoking campaign."
"Altogether we have earmarked EUR 18 million for it, but that sum is a drop in the ocean compared with the subsidies the European Union pays tobacco growers every year."
"This year Brussels is still spending EUR 320 million on them."
"Three years ago it was still nearly EUR 1 thousand million."
"Is it not very strange that we are trying to combat smoking and at the same time are funding tobacco production with European tax revenue?"
"Furthermore, this continued funding goes against the whole idea behind our agricultural policy reforms, which is that we have to abolish production subsidies."
"Mr President, the proposal by the European Commission to continue support to the Tobacco Fund in 2008 and 2009 has my full support, but the fund cannot be used as an excuse to continue tobacco subsidies in 2013."
"Although I have enormous respect for my fellow Members' arguments, I believe in this case that public health must come first."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would particularly like to compliment the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"This report achieves a twofold objective: it reinforces measures to combat smoking by extending the financing of the European Tobacco Fund whilst at the same time bringing the tobacco sector into line with the other CMOs which will naturally terminate with the 2012 financial year."
"However, the fight against smoking must not mean the end of tobacco growing in Europe, because Europe is the world's leading importer of raw tobacco and relies for over 75% of its requirements on third countries, to the benefit of tobaccos often produced without any guaranteed health controls."
"Any cancellation of the aid would lead merely to the end of production, to increased imports and would have no effect on smoking."
"(NL) It is difficult to say what is more absurd, that the European Union subsidies tobacco growing, or that Europe then uses part of the subsidies for a fund that discourages tobacco smoking."
"Totally hypocritical measures like that are precisely the reason why the EU has so little credibility with the public."
"The argument that the EU produces relatively little tobacco is beside the point."
"There is still one EU-subsidised cigarette in every packet."
"That cigarette is then in any case of such inferior quality that we do not want to smoke it in Europe and we dump it somewhere else."
"The tobacco subsidy must not be continued, as this Parliament wishes."
"Part of the subsidies must also not be used for anti-smoking campaigns as a fig leaf, as the Commission wishes."
"I have had enough of these subsidies."
"They must simply be abolished immediately."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berlato's report deals with a combination of health and agricultural issues."
"Raising the level of funding from 5% to 6%, together with the proposed extension of the system to the years 2009-2012, considerably increases the resources assigned to the Fund - by as much as EUR 81 million."
"Many farmers and organisations fully support the proposed regulation."
"Both Polish and European tobacco producers expect the adoption of the report to result in the extended operation of the Community Tobacco Fund, which is essential for public health, and in maintenance of the tobacco production sector for Europe's 100 000 tobacco growers."
"The proposed regulation makes it possible to maintain, without any additional budget expenditure, a system of subsidies that partly benefits the production of tobacco and thus avoids discrimination against tobacco growers compared with other agricultural sectors."
"It is essential, Commissioner, that we resume the very important debate on the future of tobacco production in Europe as from tomorrow, in connection with presentation of the health check."
"(PL) Mr President, today's debate is one in which the arguments of agricultural producers conflict with those of groups campaigning for the health of European society."
"But will European society be healthier for smoking tobacco of clearly inferior quality imported from third countries?"
"If we destroy our own production, we shall be importing not 70%, but 100%."
"We also have to consider whether discrimination against farmers who grow tobacco, rather than helping to develop our rural areas, will not lead, in certain regions of the European Union, to even greater economic collapse and the growth of unemployment."
"Obviously, we can then pump in financial aid for the unemployed, since we are so rich that we can afford to destroy our own agriculture for the benefit of agriculture in the Far East, which we are obliged to support in order to combat unemployment there."
"I fully support Mr Berlato's report."
"(NL) European farmers who grow tobacco should not receive a single cent from the EU for it."
"Obviously tobacco subsidies have been a huge source of revenue for farmers for many years, a sort of social security policy that did not deserve the name."
"However, tax revenue should not, on principle, be spent on unhealthy products."
"Hence there is only one choice as far as subsidies are concerned: abolish them."
"The proposal in the Berlato report is a ridiculous attempt to get tobacco subsidies extended until at least 2012."
"That should not happen, and there is another reason for this."
"Developing countries see it as totally unfair that European tobacco should be subsidised."
"It is unfair competition with poor farmers and it is directly counter to European Union development policy, a classic example of the way in which one policy area can cut into another."
"Encourage European farmers to grow crops that now bring in a high price, such as grain, which is badly needed."
"Show solidarity, though, and let the tobacco subsidies go up in smoke, for the sake of public health and for the sake of cohesion in European policy for the development of the poorest countries in the world. That is solidarity."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are certain facts which are undisputed."
"First, it is certain that complete decoupling lowers production."
"Second, even if we stop growing tobacco in Europe, it does not mean that the reduction in European tobacco cultivation will reduce the smoking population."
"Third, we are potentially condemning hundreds and thousands of people to hunger without achieving a concrete result."
"I therefore believe that, on the one hand, the aid to tobacco growers should be used to explain the harmful effects of smoking to consumers - and from this point of view the money should obviously come from the aid - and at the same time we should put tobacco growers in a position to slowly quit cultivation, allowing them the necessary time to withdraw from the whole sector."
"I therefore consider that we should vote in favour of the Berlato report."
"(PL) I wish to make three points in this discussion."
"First, the idea of decoupling payments for production is frequently repeated by the European Commission."
"It is an approach that obviously reduces Europe's agricultural production."
"Commissioner Fischer Boel repeated the idea once again today, this time with reference to tobacco production."
"Second, we have to remember that tobacco growing, in both old and new Member States, takes place on small family farms in the most poorly developed regions."
"Liquidation of this production will reduce the possibilities for development in these regions and threaten the existence of small farms."
"Third and last, it is true that tobacco growing is controversial, but restricting it in Europe means a growth in tobacco exports from third countries."
"Mr Berlato has told us that tobacco imports reached EUR 1.2 billion last year."
"I hope the European Commission will take these warnings into account in defining its position."
"(EL) Mr President, I applaud my fellow Members who have shown such sensitivity on the issue of smoking."
"I believe that all of us without exception are against smoking, but, my friends, let me point out an essential difference: smoking and tobacco growing are entirely separate."
"Let us provide as much money as we can, speak on this issue as much as possible, and take all the action we can to persuade our fellow Members and fellow citizens not to smoke."
"Given that people will smoke regardless, I cannot understand why we have to import tobacco rather than grow it here ourselves."
"Now let me appeal to you as environmentalists."
"Tobacco is a crop that requires little water, little fertiliser and few pesticides; it is grown in infertile soils by poor farmers."
"I am sure that the environmentalist in you and also your humanity, even in those of you who speak against smoking and link smoking with tobacco growing, will lead you to change your minds."
"Associating smoking with tobacco growing is like confusing our famous wine production with alcoholism."
"Should we stop producing wines because of alcoholism?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you to all of you that have contributed to this debate and thank you once again for supporting the prolongation of the transfer into the Tobacco Fund."
"I am of course aware that discussions on tobacco policies are a very sensitive issue and I can tell you that I experienced that recently during my visit to Greece in April."
"I must say clearly as well that the prolongation of the tobacco fund is not an invitation to reopen the tobacco reform from 2004, and I think you have to be aware that this reform is a done deal."
"And I think you have to take into account as well that this reform was supported by all the tobacco-producing Member States. Therefore, it would be a bit difficult to restart the whole discussion again."
"I think it is important as well to remember that we are not stopping subsidies to the tobacco producers."
"We are actually continuing to pay the highest direct payment or the highest subsidies, more than anyone else in the agricultural sector."
"No other crop is actually receiving that high a direct payment."
"So we will stick to the fact that we will decouple in 2009, and from 2011 we will transfer into the rural development policy."
"Therefore, instead of wasting or using a lot of time and lots of efforts against what was agreed in the Council in 2004, I think Member States and tobacco producers, the whole tobacco sector, should look into the rural development policy instead and see what the possibilities are, because lots of money will be available for restructuring, for trying a different business in the agricultural sector."
"With a bit of imagination - although I know that you cannot produce everything in these areas - I am sure that a solution could be found if there is cooperation between Member States, the tobacco sector and the tobacco producers, to try to find viable solutions for these areas, in the period after 2011 as well."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner and all those Members who have spoken."
"I would point out that, as far as the future of the European tobacco sector is concerned, a formal request was made recently to the Commission, signed by the Ministers of almost all the tobacco-producing Member States, including those countries which have opted for complete decoupling, and the new Member States, for the Commission to put forward a proposal for a regulation extending the current system of support for tobacco production until the year 2013."
"That matter must be addressed as part of the discussions currently in progress on the CAP 'health check'."
"I will conclude, Mr President, by inviting my fellow Members - who at first glance might appear to be less interested in a measure which only involves a deduction from aid to growers in five old Member States, which have maintained the aid partly coupled - to reflect on the fact that the use of those resources and the Fund's information initiatives will continue to be aimed at benefiting the health of all citizens of the Union."
"I would also like to point out that perhaps there is a fundamental misconception here: this report is not concerned with and takes no decision on prolonging aid payments to tobacco producers; it is merely a question of voting on a report which advocates prolonging the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund."
"As regards prolonging the aid payments, that is a decision to be taken later, but that is not the subject of this report which, as I said, is about prolonging the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund and not about prolonging aid payments to tobacco producers in the immediate and foreseeable future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 20 May 2008."
"The Evaluation of the PEACE Programme (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Bairbre de Brún, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the evaluation of the PEACE Programme and strategies for the future."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, Ms de Brún, let me start by thanking you very much for the excellent work on the evaluation of the PEACE programme and also strategies for the future."
"The Commission shares with you the opinion that the European Union's interventions in support of the peace process in Northern Ireland have contributed in bringing the two communities closer together and have helped the development of cross-community and cross-border linkages."
"The Commission also recognises that peace-building is a long-term and multi-dimensional process and we also recognise that peace-building requires a flexible approach and the willingness to allow for experimentation and the adoption of innovative measures."
"But perhaps the most important lesson learned from the PEACE programme is the effectiveness of the bottom-up approach."
"This has enabled people and organisations working on the ground to tackle the problems and issues faced by the communities at local level."
"It has brought people from both communities together and given them, very importantly, a sense of ownership of, and the responsibility for, the peace process."
"Targeting those most affected by the conflict is important, but the projects dealing with young people, our future, have been equally important in changing attitudes and perceptions."
"Last but not least we have learned that the projects in support of women are essential since the role of women in peace-building and promoting reconciliation is a key factor in bringing stability and durability to the process."
"The Commission also considers that the experience of the EU interventions in Northern Ireland and the peace-building initiatives should indeed be recorded with the objective of passing on good practice to other areas of the world, emerging from conflict or facing similar problems of social integration."
"I know that Northern Ireland is actively working on the establishment of a centre for conflict resolution and they have my support in taking this forward."
"Allow me also to mention the successful Northern Ireland workshop during the Open Days in October last year."
"Indeed, not only was the event fully booked but it generated a network which is currently being set up for sharing experience on peace and reconciliation."
"It will also be followed up by a workshop during this year's Open Days, in early October."
"I shall stop here."
"I thank you for your excellent report and shall now listen to Parliament's debate."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) When there are very unusual circumstances in Europe, we have to apply very unusual measures, and in this case a really tailor-made and innovative solution has been found, thanks to resources from the Regional Development Fund."
"We have really reached people's hearts with this, we have reached into their homes and we have been able to work in social organisations where trust is so important: people's trust in their surrounding areas, which, with the great tensions there were in Northern Ireland, was so desperately needed."
"In that connection, I agree entirely with Commissioner Hübner that this is a good example of a case where instruments like this, resources like this, need to be used, just as in similar situations, such as Cyprus."
"Mr Nicholson, the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has missed his plane, so I am speaking first."
"I should like to say that, as coordinator, I fully support the Peace III Programme, especially the role of the people and - as I have already said - the cross-border aspects."
"The fact that people in the rest of Ireland are affected, as well as the infrastructure, is very important."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, you cannot put a price on peace, but the series of PEACE programmes in Northern Ireland since 1995 have supported the peace process in Ireland with a goal of reinforcing a peaceful and stable society and promoting reconciliation in the region."
"I congratulate Bairbre de Brún on this own-initiative report, which describes the positive results and best practice gained from this EU programme."
"The peace-building aspect of the programme is crucial for the future of Northern Ireland and offers lessons for other EU Member States with a history of conflict."
"The PEACE II programme allowed for valuable exchanges of experience between areas - including Albania, Belarus, Moldavia, Serbia, Ukraine and Bosnia."
"I welcome the current discussion on the possibilities of creating a Europe-wide network of regions and cities that are coming out of conflict, that have experience in coming out of conflict or that are living with conflict and exclusion."
"Reconciliation is a long-term process and I support the continuation of the PEACE programme."
"Within the process it is important to involve local communities, and Mrs de Brún's report highlights the wide range of projects including childcare, after-school projects, enterprise parks and small business enterprise, in both the rural and urban areas."
"Many of the projects funded under PEACE were set up to serve local requirements."
"They also attracted a wide range of diverse participants to seek a common aim or benefit and help in developing models for public engagement in policy development."
"Women's groups played a very positive role in peace-building."
"I thank Mrs de Brún and I hope that all will support this constructive report."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Bairbre de Brún, on her excellent report, which highlights the significant contribution of the PEACE programme to fostering peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the border counties."
"It also outlines how lessons learned and best practice achieved should be shared with those who are engaged in other international peace-building work."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur accepted my amendment, which states that it is vital that peace-building programmes, in particular those involving community and voluntary groups, continue to be financially supported when the PEACE funds come to an end."
"Indeed, the report makes it clear that government departments on both sides of the border should ensure mainstream funding continues for this very important work, once EU funding finishes."
"It is crucial that we do not pull the plug on community and voluntary groups that are engaged in this valuable work."
"That would break trust with communities and would diminish much of the good work under way."
"Community and voluntary organisations need to be able to work to a strategic plan and not on a short-term basis where they cannot plan for the future."
"In this context, it is also important that those groups are not caught out in the funding gap between PEACE II and PEACE III."
"I have written to the Commission and received a response on this issue."
"Before I came down to the Chamber tonight, I once again had a look at the long list of community groups on both sides of the border who have received PEACE funds and who have been actively involved in peace-building, in reconciliation and in regeneration projects."
"The EU can be assured that PEACE money was well spent and that the added value of volunteer time and volunteer work has made the PEACE programme a model for value for money."
"We often speak in this House of bringing Europe closer to the citizens."
"The PEACE programme was, and is, a tangible mechanism to connect Europe with the citizens."
"As Commissioner Hübner has said here this evening, it shows the value of the bottom-up approach and also highlights the important role of women in peace-building."
"This is an example of the EU reaching out to its citizens, acting as a catalyst for change and, in this case, citizens responding fully and wholeheartedly."
"on behalf on the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would first like to say that I welcome this report."
"When Northern Ireland was divided by conflict and strife the leaders and the Institutions of the European Union gave special support and encouragement to the people of the North in helping them on the road to peace."
"As the rapporteur Bairbre de Brún stated, that support was worth EUR 1.65 billion and there is still another EUR 333 million to come."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Bairbre de Brún."
"It is a strange, however, that amongst the people who received the most advantage and support from the campaign to help give financial support, it is Sinn Féin that is against the Lisbon Treaty and against the European process."
"The leader of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, seldom makes any reference to this EUR 1.65 billion."
"If we listened to them, Ireland would not be in the European Union."
"We would not be in the system to receive money for the peace process in Europe."
"And I must say that it is this fact which most disappoints me this afternoon in Parliament."
"Mr President, this is a report of verbiage, not substance, just as much of the PEACE funding itself was spent upon froth."
"The irony, of course, of an IRA/Sinn Féin MEP being rapporteur on a report on peace will not be lost on thousands of people in Northern Ireland whom her wicked organisation made victims through its pernicious terrorist campaign."
"It is no surprise to me that she can produce a report talking about peace without a single blushing reference, without a scintilla of regret as to how we came to need peace: because, make no mistake about it, of her IRA's decades of terror."
"Nor am I surprised that she makes no mention of one of the gross failures of the PEACE programme, namely the inequality in distribution between the two communities in Northern Ireland, with the Protestant Unionist community not getting its fair share of funding."
"Not something, of course, likely to concern Miss de Brún."
"Finally, let me place on record that the relative peace we have today in Northern Ireland is primarily due not to some EU peace programme but to the remarkable tenacity, courage and sacrifice of our marvellous security forces, who faced down the IRA which robbed us of peace for so long."
"Mr President, the PEACE programme has contributed to the peace process in Northern Ireland not only in terms of financial assistance but also by helping to bring the two communities together."
"Its approach has been to work with civil society and NGOs to promote active citizenship. It has allowed the individuals involved to seek solutions to their own problems."
"This is an example of the Commission's contribution to peace-building and reconciliation, and it should be congratulated on this."
"The report refers to sharing the experience gained by PEACE with other regions facing similar problems."
"As a Member from Cyprus, I think it would be extremely interesting to put this experience into effect in the case of Cyprus."
"I call on the Government of Cyprus and on the Commission to examine this possibility as a component in the provisions of any political settlement."
"(EL) Mr President, the PEACE Programme has shown the contribution it can make towards peaceful coexistence and conciliation between the different communities in Northern Ireland."
"Given our assured support for the continuation of this programme in Ireland, allow me to underline the following."
"The programme is a shining example of the good practice that can and must be applied in other regions of the EU, such as Cyprus."
"The way in which the PEACE Programme is implemented and especially how it is managed by local partnerships and NGOs; the development of inter-community schemes; easier access to funding for schemes or groups unable be funded from other Community or national sources: all this provides valuable experience."
"It points to ways and means to be adopted more widely in programmes governed by the Structural Funds."
"Such an approach works upwards from the grass roots, particularly in programmes focusing on local development, and the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by highlighting the excellent results that have been achieved through PEACE I and PEACE II, most particularly for the beneficiaries of those programmes in Ireland - in Northern Ireland - to whom both dignity and hope have now been restored."
"That said, I should like to make two particular points, Commissioner, on which I hope you can obtain genuinely successful outcomes."
"Firstly, as Ms de Brún has urged in her report, the British and Irish Governments really need to get behind the decisions taken by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, so that temporary and complementary arrangements can be put in place through their joint efforts."
"Secondly, Commissioner, as you are in charge of the task force, you will not be surprised if I urge you to ensure that we take an integrated approach, in the interests of consistency among the various agencies involved, consistency among the different programmes and funds, and consistency between different geographical areas."
"Last but not least, I hope that the Irish example will provide a valuable lesson for other countries throughout the world."
"Mr President, why are we passing this resolution?"
"Is it a specific remedy to an identified problem?"
"Or are we rather passing it to make ourselves feel better, to feel that we have done our little bit for the peace process?"
"I ask that question with some regret."
"I am as big a supporter of the peace process in Northern Ireland as any Member of this Chamber and, indeed, possibly rather more than some."
"Being on one side Ulster Catholic, on the other, Scots Presbyterian, I have always felt that I have something of a personal stake in power sharing."
"But the peace process is not guaranteed by external subventions."
"On the contrary, there is a danger that this flow of money turns what was an enterprising and thrifty part of the world in to a subsidy junkie, dependent on handouts from elsewhere."
"Ask yourselves - I put this quite seriously - when you sign those cheques for those hundreds of millions of euros, whether you actually think you are buying stability and peace in that part of the world, or whether you are not just allowing yourselves to feel slightly better for a few minutes."
"The idea that political violence is caused by deprivation is simply not borne out in reality."
"It is one of the many ideas that derive from Karl Marx and, like a lot of his ideas, it sounds plausible on the page, but it turns out not to be true in reality."
"The most subsidised territory in the world, more than anywhere in Africa per capita, is Palestine, which is also one of the most violent."
"The truth is that, if we want to support the peace process in Northern Ireland, we have to create a genuine democracy there, where there is a genuine opposition and the ability to change your government."
"If you do that, we will not need the money."
"Mr President, I welcome this report from Bairbre de Brún, and I would like to congratulate all the people who made a contribution to the report, in particular the shadow rapporteur, Jim Nicholson, Marian Harkin and all the people involved."
"The Peace III Programme is up and running, with EUR 333 million going into an area, helping the whole infrastructure and Community development in Northern Ireland and in the border counties."
"I think the three PEACE programmes have made a huge contribution in bringing about peace in this area."
"I would like to congratulate all the people involved in getting it together, but also all of the political parties in Northern Ireland and the community groups who have worked together to make sure that the peace programme continues to work."
"I also welcome the task force that has been set up in Northern Ireland, but I think that a task force is also needed in the six border counties in the Republic to deal with infrastructure development in that area."
"It is unfortunate that the Irish Government has not done likewise in relation to those six counties."
"It is something that should be looked at because those counties also suffered over a period of 30 to 35 years."
"We need that kind of initiative in those six county areas."
"I would welcome the Irish Government putting that in place."
"Again, thank you to all those involved."
"(DE) Mr President, surely there is scarcely anyone here in Parliament who harbours any real doubts about the success of the PEACE programme in terms of both its tangible contribution to economic and social cohesion and its contribution to enhanced local involvement through active citizenship and the participation of civil society in peace-building."
"The report, drafted on the initiative of the Committee on Regional Development, rightly emphasises the valuable experience that has been amassed through this unique and highly innovative structural programme as well as highlighting the things that could be done better in future, the challenges that remain to be met and the conclusions that can be drawn."
"As someone who is closely involved with the regional policy of the EU, I am keenly aware of the need to develop cross-border activities and strongly support cooperation between local chambers of commerce, public institutions and voluntary organisations on both sides of national borders."
"I need hardly tell you that my group and I unreservedly endorse this report."
"Mr President, since nobody else is asking for the floor, I would just like to make a comment."
"I suppose I am not really surprised, but perhaps a little disappointed, to hear the comments by Mr Jim Allister here tonight."
"We are discussing the PEACE programme and not the conflict."
"Like all conflicts, this conflict's roots go deep and it did not start in recent times, and like all conflicts it is much more complicated than indicated by Mr Allister."
"But regardless of those who question the efficacy of the PEACE programme and indicate their disapproval of EU funding, there is no doubt that the PEACE funds acted as a catalyst and, as I said earlier, through voluntary effort and voluntary time achieved value for money."
"Perhaps the best thing to say is that there is an end to the conflict and that the PEACE funding played a role in helping to achieve this very positive outcome."
"Mr President, it is all very easy and very well for Miss Harkin to come to this House and to talk in the way she has talked."
"How many constituents has she buried, murdered by terrorists?"
"How many people have died in her constituency because the organisation that Miss de Brún represents decided they would die in pursuit of a political campaign?"
"The IRA murdered 2 000 of my constituents, so no one will lecture me in this House about the deep-seated feelings that I have, and no one will contradict me with justification for pointing out that the people that put so many of my constituents in their graves are the IRA, which Miss de Brún represents in this House."
"To now see them in the government of my country is stomach-churning, and to find that they are there because they murdered and as a buy-off so that they will not murder again makes it even worse."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to say that this debate has clearly confirmed the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland and that important lessons have been learned during this process."
"The Commission will continue its contribution to consolidating the reconciliation process and will also facilitate the sharing of the lessons learned from the experience of peace-building with all other areas facing similar problems."
"In these efforts, the support of the European Parliament will certainly matter very much."
"I would like to make two further comments:"
"To Jean Marie Beaupuy, the task force for Northern Ireland has been established to enhance and facilitate the participation of the people of Northern Ireland in all European Union policies and also to better coordinate and to build more coherence between different processes contributing to the consolidation of the peace and reconciliation process."
"The second comment is that in these efforts the Commission would also like to help people in Northern Ireland to reduce the existing dependency on the public sector, on state aid and on the reliance of support coming in the form of grants."
"The conference which was mentioned by Bairbre de Brún was also exactly aiming at contributing to this process of bringing more private investment - a more vibrant private sector - to life in this part of the island."
"Once again, thank you very much for all your comments."
"Rapporteur. -Mr President, I would like to thank those who spoke in the debate tonight."
"I listened carefully to them and to the points they raised."
"I am disappointed, however, by what Mr Allister had to say and I cannot agree with his allegations."
"I would like to praise the work the European Parliament and the Commission have done over the years in terms of the PEACE programme."
"I would like especially to thank Commissioner Hübner for the personal commitment she has shown from her first day in that post and for her regular visits to Northern Ireland."
"Commissioner Hübner and the previous Commissioners have been true friends to the peace process in Ireland and it is reassuring to see the continuing role the Commission will have through the task force that was set up by President Barroso."
"PEACE enabled a border community divided from the time of the partition to come together as a community."
"It brought young nationalists and unionists together to learn about each other's cultures."
"We especially acknowledge the important role women have in building peace and the important and valuable cross-community and cross-border work that has been done."
"My Report highlights the fact that it is the most marginalised people in society who benefited most from PEACE, which is just as it should be."
"Nevertheless, if there are groups which have not already used this opportunity to make an application under PEACE I and PEACE II they should be encouraged to participate."
"The next step is to ensure that the good work that PEACE has done doesn't stop and that future generations benefit from the valuable work that started with the PEACE programmes and from the wonderful support the European institutions have provided."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 20 May 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"), in writing. - (RO) The PEACE Programme represents not only a means of maintaining peace, but also an instrument favouring economic development and territorial cohesion."
"Its implementation by the regional governments and non-governmental organizations leads to the involvement of a wide range of communities, local organizations and marginalized groups in the process of governance and development."
"Moreover, financing regional projects through PEACE contributes to facilitating dialogue, reconciliation and agreements whose objective is to satisfy common interest and, consequently, avoid any type of conflict."
"Northern Ireland is an example of good practice for all the other Member States that have experienced conflicts or are dealing with problems threatening their peace."
"This is why I support the creation of a network of European regions and cities with a potential conflict risk and I believe that the promotion of local partnerships, best practice sharing and efficient cooperation between the regions and the intermediary Financing Bodies are essential factors for determining local communities to cooperate and work for maintaining peace."
"I also plead for implementing programmes similar to PEACE in Southeast Europe as well, especially in the Balkans, mainly since the events in recent years have been an alarm signal."
"Outermost regions (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Margie Sudre, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the strategy for the outermost regions: achievements and future prospects."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's assessment of the stronger partnership for the outermost regions is one-sided to say the least, and it fails to convey all the difficulties experienced on the ground."
"Nonetheless, reducing their accessibility deficit, making them more competitive and achieving regional integration remain appropriate goals that reflect the priorities of these regions."
"The familiar image of the Azores, the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Madeira, Martinique and Reunion as regions subsidised by Community or national funds, without consideration for the positive impact of such funding, is insufficiently offset by the genuine added value they contribute to the Union in environmental, cultural and geostrategic terms."
"The Structural Funds are still contributing to the development of the outermost regions."
"I hope, however, that the Commission is steadily tailoring its current and future policies more closely to the realities of those regions in order to address the permanent constraints they face."
"An over-systematic methodology for quantifying additional costs would be disproportionate and would not take account of the individual characteristics of each of the ORs."
"The ever-increasing importance attributed to the assessment of Community policies must not result in the creation of superfluous statistical tools."
"I regret the initial lack of interest - even if it was only initial - shown by DG Trade when negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)."
"I must urge the Commission, when it comes to reaching final agreements with the ACP countries, to continue seeking compromises that respect the interests of the ORs concerned and I must urge it too, in the interests of the wider neighbourhood, to give genuine substance to the Wider Neighbourhood Action Plan."
"With regard to transport, my report expresses concern about the inclusion of civil aviation in the European CO2 Emission Trading Scheme system."
"It is important not to jeopardise the efforts made to overcome the ORs' accessibility deficit."
"Community actions must be a catalyst for a spirit of enterprise to develop centres of excellence, driven by sectors - such as waste management, renewable energies, energy self-sufficiency and biodiversity - that fully exploit the advantages and know-how of the ORs."
"I welcome public consultation on the future of the EU's strategy for the ORs, but I believe that although the themes selected - climate change, demographic change and migration management, agriculture and maritime policy - certainly cannot be ignored, they do not cover all the major concerns of our regions."
"I regret, for example, that the scope of Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, which is the cornerstone of the Union's policy for assisting the ORs, has not been included on the agenda so as to give the debates the legal, institutional and political substance they merit."
"The importance of public services for economic, social and territorial cohesion in the outermost regions, the question of state aid, the maintenance of differentiated tax regimes, the persistence of unemployment and inequalities, ways of overcoming the narrowness of local markets, integration into the European research environment, effective participation by the ORs in European policies to promote innovation and overcome the digital divide, and funding arrangements for cooperation projects with neighbouring countries are all, in my view, subjects that need to be addressed now."
"In conclusion I would re-emphasise the aims of my report, namely to ensure the conditions for the economic development of the ORs and thus guarantee genuine prosperity for their populations, to strengthen their competitiveness and to convince these remote regions that the future of Europe also includes them."
"Thank you in advance for your support in tomorrow's vote."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first of all say that we appreciate this report very much."
"This is a very professional report and I would like to thank Margie Sudre not only for the report but also for her presence and strong involvement in the Conference of Outermost Regions that we held last week in Brussels."
"I would like also to extend my gratitude to the Regional Development Committee and also the Fisheries Committee, particularly its draftsman, Mr Guerreiro, for the contribution to the reflection on the future strategy for the outermost regions, and also to Mr Fernandes, Mr Marques and Mr Casaca."
"I would like to extend my gratitude for the contribution to the public consultation that we launched last September."
"This phase of consultation has just ended with the conference last week."
"What came out from this conference very strongly is the challenge of double integration of the outermost regions, and also the idea of the outermost regions as test beds with pilot projects, especially in areas like renewable energy."
"It was also very clear in the conference that outermost regions have a wealth of unique opportunities and that they represent a living force as well as a strength for the Union as a whole."
"On the report itself, let me stress that I fully share the importance Parliament attaches to the need to preserve a strategy specifically adapted to the characteristics and the assets of the outermost regions, and we are ready, in the Commission, to widen the scope of the strategy to new challenges."
"Clearly those identified by the Commission - climate change, demographic change and migration management, agriculture and the maritime policy - are not exclusive and we are open to other ideas."
"I can also agree with Mme Sudre when she calls for an improvement in the coordination between the Regional Fund and the European Development Fund."
"I also believe it important to further integrate the outermost regions into the European Research Area as well as promoting cooperation with neighbouring regions."
"In this regard, I believe that the reformed cohesion policy has clearly helped to strengthen the position of the outermost regions under the cooperation objective."
"The 'outermost region dimension', if I may call it so, has been safeguarded and intensified following the reform of many Community policies: not only the cohesion policy, but also agricultural and rural development, regional state aid frameworks, the European POSEI programmes or the EU maritime policy."
"I strongly believe that these policy developments correspond well to the needs of the outermost regions."
"With the September 2007 communication, we underlined the need to exploit all of the opportunities offered by the reforms of European policies during the period 2007-2013, and from my different and numerous visits to the outermost regions I can see that many initiatives have been taken in that direction, although I believe that these initiatives should be further strengthened and developed."
"Concerning the way in which the Commission conducted the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations as well as the Emission Trading Scheme discussions, allow me to say that the outermost regions have been an integral part of the discussions from the very start and the Commission has systematically informed and also involved the representatives of the outermost regions in the discussions."
"Having said this, let me also assure you that the Commission will continue to take account of the specific interests of the outermost regions in current, but also in future, negotiations of this nature."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. - (PT) The opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, the only parliamentary committee to decide to draft an opinion, includes a whole series of proposals to benefit the outermost regions' interests."
"These include: considering the area corresponding to their exclusive economic zones as an exclusive access zone; ensuring Community support for the renewal and modernisation of fishing fleets; creating a Community programme to support small-scale inshore fishing; providing Community support for scientific fisheries research and the protection and recovery of fish stocks; introducing socio-economic measures to compensate fishermen for the impact of measures to conserve fishery resources, and reinforcing and continuing Community support such as POSEI - Fisheries."
"Because we believe that these important Fisheries Committee proposals must be reflected in the resolution to be approved tomorrow in the plenary, we are re-tabling a set of eight amendments for which we seek your support."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the specific situation of the outermost regions most certainly deserves special attention by the European Union."
"There is no doubt that the European strategy for the outermost regions has had some positive effects to date."
"The reality is, however, that some structural problems remain, and these will require our attention in the future."
"We have to bear in mind that not all the problems of the outermost regions can be solved, some of them being sui generis problems, stemming from the fact that with the exception of French Guyana we are dealing mostly with remote territories composed of islands and we cannot change their specific geographic and structural characteristics."
"I would like to add a note of caution at this point against excessive centrally directed social engineering."
"In relation to the issues we have been discussing concerning the outermost regions, it is even more imperative to consider implementing the principle of subsidiarity."
"There is no doubt that the outermost regions require different conditions when it comes to the rules on public aid and the internal market."
"This should also be taken into consideration in European legislation, which must help to preserve the specific characteristics of these regions and mitigate the limiting factors."
"It is debatable, though, how effective the complicated European financial programmes can be in this instance."
"In my opinion, national and regional aid properly applied in relation to local conditions is a much more effective form of aid to the outermost regions."
"I believe that the European structural policy should instead be based on the principle that financial aid should be targeted primarily at the poorest regions, where it is needed the most, irrespective of whether it is an island, a mountain or a scarcely populated area."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commissioner and the Commission on this initiative, which surely offers a new opportunity in response to the problems of the outermost regions and their people."
"The opening of public consultation has fostered greater participation."
"I believe a great deal has been contributed already, including the meeting the Commissioner referred to, which was very productive."
"I would like to focus on the draft opinion, however, which is a balanced opinion that has allowed a consensus to be achieved."
"It is an opinion that shows some complementarity with the perspectives highlighted by the Commission when it refers to climate change, etc."
"I would like to refer first to the question of the Lisbon Strategy, which I believe is fundamental for providing a response to the outermost regions' problems in this new phase, to the need to adapt all policies and programmes to this situation, and also to the question of guaranteed funding."
"I would also like to say in conclusion that although the Committee on Fisheries' opinion certainly focuses on the essential aspects, there are some details that could be highlighted."
"The difficulty was to bring together a whole sector when the goal is a strategy for the outermost regions that encompasses all possible areas of development."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when our planet has become a little village - so easy is it to move from one side of the world to the other - we need to grasp what an opportunity these outermost regions represent for the European Union."
"As our rapporteur, Mrs Sudre, points out in various paragraphs of her report we possess tremendous assets in our outermost regions: in agriculture, fisheries, research, technology and tourism."
"With a total of 25 million km2 we have the largest sea area in the world."
"As the report says, therefore, we need to build on these assets so that our outermost regions can play a successful role in our shared future."
"My second point concerns the particular situation of urban areas - I speak here as Chair of the Urban Intergroup and I see a number of my fellow members of the Intergroup here this evening - because it is in urban areas that the problem of unemployment is concentrated, unemployment at three times the mainland European level."
"Migration is also focused on urban areas and it is there, too, that population changes have the greatest impact."
"Commissioner, what you have here is an exceptional opportunity to impose an integrated approach, embracing not only the various European funds but also different policies and different government, regional and local projects."
"If that integrated approach is not developed, we shall not be able to be effective in the outermost regions or to make best use of the assets they possess."
"I thank you in advance, Commissioner, for using our European rules to ensure that the integrated approach will contribute to the success of all the measures that we put in place."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the UEN Group I would like to thank Mrs Sudre for taking up this subject."
"European solidarity requires us to take account of the special situation of the outermost regions."
"It is our duty, indeed our moral obligation, to concern ourselves with the economic and social cohesion of these regions."
"The territorial cohesion referred to in the Treaty of Lisbon - though not intended in a literal, geographical sense - must also have a dimension that includes the Union's most distant regions."
"What should be stressed is the need for closer partnership - meaning better access, greater competitiveness and the improvement of regional integration."
"We must not forget that the targets of all these actions are the inhabitants of the overseas territories, for whom the important issues are sea and air transport, unemployment, tourism, fishing, a proper level of education and health care, and general broadband access to the internet."
"Nor should we forget that these regions are unfortunately prone to natural disasters."
"The outermost regions have their advantages, but they also have problems."
"Mrs Sudre's report brings them a lot closer to us."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) We consider the report to be positive, though it includes some points that we disagree with."
"We support the adoption of proposals that we presented in the Regional Development Committee in favour of the outermost regions, an example of which is the argument that the specific characteristics of the outermost regions call for a strategy based on policies and measures that are not dependent on transitional criteria or circumstantial wealth trends, are adapted to the different needs of each of those regions and help to offer solutions to the permanent constraints which they face."
"It stresses the importance of public services for economic, social and territorial cohesion in the outermost regions in such areas as air and sea transport, postal services, energy and communications, not forgetting broadband Internet access or the urgent adoption of measures aimed at combating endemic unemployment, poverty and unequal income distribution in these regions, which have some of the worst rates in the European Union."
"We consider that some aspects could and should be clarified and reinforced, however."
"Community support measures for the outermost regions, for example, must be permanent and must be adequately funded, given that the constraints which they face are also permanent."
"In addition, to ensure that measures in favour of these regions and the clarification of their status are more coherent and effective, not only must their specific outermost nature be taken into account across the board in the various Community policies, but also an adequately funded Community programme providing support to these regions must be set up and must encompass all existing measures."
"Hence our proposed amendments."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this good own-initiative report produced by Mrs Sudre pursues two basic aims, namely to evaluate the conclusions and recommendations contained in the communication from the Commission and to provide a basis - and I believe it provides an excellent basis - for discussion of the prospects for our outermost regions."
"Even if the rapporteur takes the view that the Commission's review paints an excessively rosy picture, or at least a partial picture, we should nevertheless be proud that European aid has allowed such advances to be made in our outermost regions."
"On the one hand, that does not in any way imply a reduction of assistance to these regions, the provision of which is, of course, a legal obligation under the EC Treaty."
"On the other hand, we know that nurturing the particular assets of the outermost regions is the only suitable way to ensure that these regions generate their own sustainable development."
"As the rapporteur rightly summed it up, this is not only a matter of preserving, safeguarding and protecting but rather of attracting, generating appeal and continuing to cooperate closely."
"The report rightly urges, for example, that the discussion on the future of the support strategy for the outermost regions should not only focus on challenges such as climate change, demographic change, migration management, agriculture and maritime policy but should also take account of the need to adopt positions in respect of other Community policies."
"The new generation of European programmes must also mark the start of a necessary process of diversifying the economies of the outermost regions and must not be confined to merely maintaining the present state of development, which has largely been achieved with the aid of the EU."
"In the light of these considerations we should give the report our unqualified support."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I reiterate the thanks to Mrs Sudre for her work on this report and for achieving a majority consensus in the Committee on Regional Development on the policy for the outermost regions."
"The policy must have three fundamental facets: it must increase accessibility, improve competitiveness and strength regional integration."
"The contribution of the Structural Funds to the development of these regions has been important and will continue to be very important in the future for maintaining the level of cohesion achieved and for reducing disparities further."
"It is therefore necessary for the Commission to show greater flexibility."
"It should facilitate the use of ERDF Funding for the outermost regions by ensuring that its scope is sufficiently wide for the Fund to be fully used."
"Another fundamental challenge is improving accessibility and, for that reason, it is important that the outermost regions receive differential treatment with regard to transport."
"The fourth Cohesion Fund report faces up to the new challenges and we certainly hope that the Commission takes into account that these challenges are also important in the outermost regions."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, an important issue that has not received sufficient attention from the Commission is support for those island regions in the EU that are not among those referred to in the Treaty but still have much in common with them."
"Island Member States within the Union must be treated on equal terms with outermost regions."
"This is necessary according to the principle of equal treatment, because island Member States and island regions of Member States to some degree face the same severe territorial and geographical disadvantages as outermost regions."
"Small island Member States and island regions of Member States must therefore receive the same treatment as outermost regions; they must be subject to the same preferential strategy as those regions."
"For example, they must receive a separate state aid package so that they form a bridge in the EU with regions such as the Eastern Mediterranean."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, although Mrs Sudre's report may seem irrelevant to many European countries, since very few of them have outermost regions as remote as, for example, the Azores, Madeira etc., her approach has nevertheless caught my interest."
"I found that the report could inspire a similar policy for countries with island regions, especially archipelagos and also mountainous areas, like my country, Greece."
"The geocultural nature of these regions is a unique resource as well as a disadvantage."
"I therefore congratulate Mrs Sudre on her work, as she has given me the impetus to table some proposals myself regarding these regions."
"I propose, then, that measures should be taken to make use of the geocultural characteristics of islands and mountainous regions."
"There must be a development strategy to maintain and strengthen the principle of territorial cohesion."
"A system of statistical indicators should be developed to allow better evaluation of the differences between island and mainland territory."
"There should also be greater flexibility in the application of European and national aid policies for productive activities on the islands."
"The following issues should be addressed: equal access to the internal market and the establishment of a practical aid scheme for the islands; the impact of climate change on the islands, especially the aggravation of existing problems such as drought; easier transport connections between island and mountainous regions and the mainland."
"Lastly, special priority should be given to securing the energy needs of the islands by developing and implementing power generation projects based on new technologies and renewable energy sources."
"Broadband connections should be set up, and the viability of island and mountain tourism should be reinforced."
"For all these reasons, I once again congratulate Mrs Sudre."
"I express my wholehearted support for the report in the belief that at some point the Commission will prepare a similar report on the regions I have mentioned."
"(ES) Mr President, some of the speeches we have heard this afternoon do not seem to take into account that the reality is different in the outermost regions."
"It is not that they are poor regions."
"We are talking about small insular and very isolated territories located thousands of kilometres away from the territory of the European Union, populated by a total of four a half million people."
"The European Union could abandon these territories to their fate, condemn their people to poverty and force them to emigrate to European Union countries, which would mean accepting another 4.5 million immigrants."
"Fortunately, the European Commission understands the situation of these territories and created a special regime a long time ago."
"The Commission is now consulting us."
"Mrs Sudre has prepared a valuable report in response to this consultation, in which she emphasises the importance, for example, of maintaining the ORs Unit and makes very specific proposals to maintain public services, promote innovation and overcome the digital divide."
"I believe that Parliament should approve Mrs Sudre's report for the reasons she has put forward."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on which the House will vote tomorrow rightly reminds us that the specificities of the outermost regions are also among their strengths."
"Alongside the handicaps that hold them back, they also have undeniable advantages and we urgently need to build on those advantages so that the ORs can develop in a real and sustainable way in the future."
"Bringing fresh impetus to our islands also implies growth: it implies putting high-quality agricultural production - which contributes to diversity of agricultural output at EU level - on a sustainable footing."
"It implies promoting the rapid development of a very real tourist attraction based on the wealth of our various landscapes and our cultural heritage."
"It also implies taking advantage of the geographical position of the ORs, particularly in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, encouraging closer cooperation with neighbouring third countries and developing our islands - precisely because they are islands - as centres of excellence for scientific research, notably in maritime studies, climatology and environmental studies."
"The only way of achieving these aims, however, is within the specific regulatory framework of the current Article 299(2) of the Treaty, and the spirit of that article must inform the detailed application of European public policy, particularly in the energy and transport sectors but also in relation to international trade policies, where it is vital that the interests of the ORs are taken into account in the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements."
"The outermost regions are genuinely and unfailingly proactive, but the corollary of that is a need to be treated fairly - which implies differentiation."
"Let us not doubt that the Commission will take all this into account in preparing its approach."
"(NL) The outermost regions are in a special position."
"Many of them are remote small islands, and I think Mrs Sudre has found a good balance by identifying their specific character and tailoring the instruments to them well."
"As a Dutch MEP, I should like to report on developments in the Kingdom of the Netherlands."
"We have three of the small islands, Sawa, St Maarten and Bonaire, that are going to change over to the other status and so will also become outermost regions."
"However, I do not think that will happen so quickly that the inhabitants will be able to vote on it before the 2009 elections."
"Under the new Lisbon Treaty, we can accept them more quickly."
"We do not need to amend the Treaty to do so."
"Perhaps Mrs Hübner can say whether the Commission is completely ready for these three islands with a total population of 19 000 to be accepted by us as a whole."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, besides congratulating our colleague Mrs Sudre on her excellent report, I would like to make three points on the European Union's future strategy for the outermost regions."
"The first point is to congratulate the European Commission for fostering participation in the debate on the record of European policy for the ORs and the future strategy to be applied."
"I also applaud the on-line public consultation and last week's major conference promoted by the European Commission on this issue."
"The second point is to say that a European strategy for the ORs is as necessary in the future as it has been to date."
"There is a risk of believing that the economic and social development achieved in the meantime by the ORs makes European action less necessary."
"We must always be aware, however, that the very specific situation of the outermost regions is permanent and will continue to require a differentiated European response which is appropriate to that very specific situation."
"The third and final point is to say how important it is for everything to be done to implement the Lisbon Strategy in the ORs too, its application in such regions being more problematic because of their very specific characteristics."
"I would therefore recommend to Mrs Hübner that a study promoted by the European Commission be carried out with a view to identifying the difficulties the outermost regions face in implementing the Lisbon Strategy and specific ways of overcoming them."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to commend the quality of Mrs Sudre's report."
"We cannot fail to acknowledge, 10 years after the Amsterdam Treaty came into force, that EU policy under Article 299(2) has led to real progress."
"Today, however, it is time to move into a new phase based on a switch of approach in relations between the EU and the outermost regions."
"This will require the EU to take greater account of the advantages that the ORs possess, along the lines envisaged at last week's seminar."
"In my opinion, as well as making up lost ground, the new strategy should focus on development - on forms of development clearly determined by the concept of realising our potential."
"This applies equally in relation to scientific research, marine resources, biodiversity, European social policy, climate change and the unrivalled contribution that the ORs make in terms of cultural diversity."
"I have tabled a number of amendments accordingly and I hope they will achieve their aim."
"Giving substance to the new approach means giving the ORs the means to become genuine partners for Europe and that is where we need a fresh perspective: to envisage a two-way partnership from which everyone will benefit."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, very briefly in reply to what Mr van Nistelrooij asked, yes, we have been working with the Dutch Government for the last year-and-a-half on this."
"Fortunately the changes which were permitted by the Treaty have been introduced, so we hope that one day we will have the three new territories."
"With regard to the comments made, let me first of all say that, in line with the request formulated by the European Council in December, the Commission will be producing a communication this autumn that will take the outermost region strategy forward with, I hope, decisiveness and pragmatism."
"That is our approach to address both new challenges, but first of all to facilitate grasping all the opportunities."
"Mme Sudre, I see your report as helping to build a bridge between the present and future strategies for the outermost regions and that is a very important role of this report."
"I also very much believe that the right way forward is indeed first of all to build on the assets of the outermost regions, That was stressed by several Members."
"Let me also mention in this context our future Green Paper on territorial cohesion, which will be an essential feature of the French presidency."
"The outermost regions have a strong role to play in this process of preparing the territorial dimension of the cohesion policy because the outermost regions truly personify our efforts to bridge the territorial divides inside Europe."
"That is why I would welcome their strong involvement in the public consultation related to the Green Paper on territorial cohesion."
"On the last issue, let me simply reassure you that the Commission will continue to promote a coordinated and integrated approach and will seek to achieve synergies between different Community policies affecting the outermost regions."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, obviously I want to thank all the speakers who have contributed to the debate, and I would also like to reiterate my thanks to the Commission for its initiative last week on future strategy for the ORs."
"I should like to reply to some of the points raised by my fellow Members, and I am grateful to them for their warm reception of this report."
"In answer to Mr Guerreiro, the support that he wants to see for renewal and research in relation to fisheries and the increase in aid is all already covered by the European Fisheries Fund."
"It already forms part of the policies to which the EU, and specifically the Commission and the Fisheries Committee, are committed, whereas this report is concerned with regional development policy."
"That is why, while taking account of the tremendous importance of fisheries for our development, my report does not give it the extensive space that Mr Guerreiro would have wished."
"Let me remind him that what we are talking about here is regional development."
"Mr Medina Ortega has already replied to our Greek colleagues who called for the same policy to be applied to all islands, and has explained the difference that is created by distances of many thousands of kilometres from the continent of Europe."
"However much progress we achieve, we will still be thousands of kilometres away."
"And however well I understand the problems experienced by all island dwellers, we clearly cannot apply the same derogations and the same rules to islands that are only a few hours away by boat or a few minutes by plane."
"This is certainly not a matter of failing to consider the situation of islands but - let me repeat - there is a huge difference between your islands, with their proximity to the continent, and ours that are so very distant."
"Mr Guerreiro, you spoke a second time to urge that our approach should not be based on transient criteria."
"Obviously there is nothing transient about our situation: that is quite permanent, but we are not asking for a permanent guarantee of aid at the same level in perpetuity, because our hope is to catch up with the average in the rest of the Community."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 20 May 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - This report gives a good overview of the problems that the Azores, the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion, Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthelemy are facing as geographically distant regions of the European Union, but it also points out the disparities in the treatment of different overseas territories of the Member States."
"There are still several regions under the sovereignty of Member States that do not share the same status as the outermost regions."
"For example the citizens of the British Virgin Islands or Greenland are citizens of the European Union, but European Parliamentary elections are not held in those regions, while the citizens of Aruba are citizens of the European Union who happen to be entitled to vote in the European Parliamentary elections."
"But even more confusing is the fact that none of the aforementioned territories is actually a part of the European Union."
"It is my firm belief that the European Union's relationship with the Member States' overseas territories and citizens of all those territories should become uniform, bearing in mind the equal treatment of the citizens of the European Union."
"EU consumer policy strategy 2007-2013 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Lasse Lehtinen, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the EU Consumer Policy strategy 2007-2013."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the report before us has undergone a thorough reading in committee, for which I thank my colleagues and above all the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups."
"In a spirit of consensus we have noted the Commission's laudable efforts to highlight consumer issues in all areas of policy."
"This continent will not be able to compete in global markets unless it can compete in its own internal market."
"The 27 national mini-markets must be combined to constitute the largest retail market in the world."
"A viable internal market requires action to boost consumer confidence."
"Strong and independent consumer organisations have an important role in this."
"Among the options for increasing confidence there is one which has stood out more than others in our discussions and which also caused the only disagreements worth mentioning."
"It is about the possibility of consumers having the tools to pursue compensation if something goes wrong."
"The view is expressed in this report that it is indispensable for consumers to have a cross-border collective redress system in cases where there is a dispute."
"Commissioner Kuneva has already promised to start considering what sort of system of collective redress might work in Europe."
"At least there seems to be broad consensus among us in Europe on what sort of system it should not be."
"It should not have any fundamental similarity with the American collective redress system, which mainly benefits lawyers, not consumers."
"In Europe we have to aim for a system where claims for compensation are directly linked to actual damage caused."
"This way, how justice is dispensed would not so much focus on the penalty but on obtaining justice for the consumer."
"Collective redress systems would therefore not give consumers new rights, but would ensure that their present rights can be exploited to the full."
"The conservatives as a group have been unwilling to take forward the idea of collective redress."
"The reason suggested is that the Commission has already promised to start drafting proposals on it."
"Parliament, however, is the political decision-maker elected by the people of Europe, and we must make its majority will evident."
"We have both the authorisation and an obligation to think about new and detailed solutions to issues the public see as problematic and propose them to the Commission."
"I have proposed that the Commission looks into whether it would be useful to establish a post of Consumer Ombudsman reporting to the Commission, who would specifically deal with cross-border cases."
"This high official could act as a gatekeeper, a sort of selective authority, as is the case in national contexts when means of legal redress are being implemented."
"Hopefully, the report and the compromises contained in it will receive the widest possible support."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for supporting the objectives and actions of our Consumer Policy Strategy for the years 2007-2013 and of course for the great support and work of the rapporteur."
"I welcome the view of Parliament on the necessity to transform the 27 national mini-markets into a pan-European retail market - the largest in the world."
"To achieve this, we need to increase the confidence of consumers to shop across borders."
"We often say that trust is the currency of the modern economy."
"I believe that, through our endeavours and substantial efforts, helped by the set of our strategy, we could, step by step, achieve this goal."
"In this context, I also very much appreciate the support given to the proposed framework directive on consumer contractual rights, which is the tool for achieving the goal."
"I am particularly pleased with the agreement of Parliament on the need for targeted full harmonisation where bottlenecks to the functioning of the internal market are identified."
"On the Consumer Markets Scoreboard, I am grateful for the welcome given by the European Parliament to this initiative and look forward to your full support later this year."
"The Scoreboard is central to the aim of the strategy of better understanding how the internal market is working for our consumers - to measure the outcome of the internal market for consumers."
"When the Scoreboard is fully developed, we will really be able to deliver better regulation and evidence-based policy-making."
"Equally important, we will demonstrate to our citizens that we understand and can respond to their day-to-day concerns."
"You raised the question of redress."
"I would like to thank you for your support for the Consumer Policy Strategy's focus on redress and enforcement."
"Redress, together with enforcement, is a key part of this Strategy."
"Like you, I strongly believe that, in order to make the internal market work, European consumers must be confident that they can enforce their rights and obtain redress across the whole European Union."
"I also believe that a complementarity of means of redress - judicial and non-judicial, both individual and collective - would allow the most efficient and appropriate treatment of consumer disputes."
"This would benefit both consumers and reputable businesses alike."
"Personally, I think that collective redress - both judicial and non-judicial - could be an effective means for strengthening the redress framework that we have already set up for European consumers."
"We have done this through the encouragement of ADR - alternative dispute resolution - mechanisms, the establishment of a European cross-border small claims procedure and the newly adopted Directive on Mediation."
"Of course any future action in this area will need to be assessed carefully."
"As you know, I have launched two studies aimed at further exploring the issue of collective redress."
"The first one will examine the effectiveness and efficiency of existing collective redress mechanisms; it will assess whether consumers suffer a detriment in those Member States where collective redress is not available and examine the existence of negative effects for the single market."
"The second study will provide information on the problems faced by consumers in obtaining redress for mass claims and will analyse the economic consequences of such problems for consumers, competitors and the relevant market."
"I plan to use the results of these studies and the information collected from stakeholders and Member States for preparing a communication to be adopted by the Commission by the end of 2008."
"The aim of this communication will be to consult publicly and widely on the options available in the field of consumer collective redress."
"At the same time, I am evaluating how the Directive on Injunctions was implemented by the Member States and the impact that it has had on the enforcement of consumer rights in the EU."
"My conclusions will be set out in a report that should also be adopted by the Commission at the end of this year."
"Again, thank you to Parliament for sharing the vision of the new, market-based consumer policy - one where informed and empowered consumers confidently look for, and benefit from, the best offers in terms of price and quality in the largest retail market in the world."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission communication, as well as the report of Mr Lehtinen as both are overall very balanced pieces of work."
"Moreover, they rightly bring out an important notion that must be addressed at EU level - consumer policy is and must be part of the internal market."
"This leads me to what the Committee on Economic Affairs has rightly brought into the report: completing the internal market is in itself great consumer policy."
"EU-wide competition brings prices down and increases quality and consumer choice."
"The EU-wide access to consumers to these choices must be asserted."
"In an internal market, consumers are drivers of the market economy and can, through their choices, protect their own interests."
"Therefore, the consistent implementation of existing directives regarding the internal market is of paramount importance."
"The Committee on Economic Affairs' opinion correctly highlights two areas that are of particular importance in this respect."
"First, financial services: a real internal market in banking, loans, insurance etc. is needed to empower European consumers."
"This is especially pressing as democratic developments are making best possible investment services increasingly relevant to all."
"Big hurdles remain to be overcome here."
"Second, e-commerce."
"This is linked to functioning financial markets and conditioned by the development of payment systems, but it is also important to practically all aspects of the internal market as the internet offers a real European marketplace."
"So we must make sure that European e-commerce really functions and consumers have right choices there."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - Mr President, in the Committee on Legal Affairs we agree with you, Commissioner: let us get rid of these 27 mini-markets; but, in order to do that, you need a much more common legal framework."
"I think our starting point that would help us get there is if we saw all elements of the Commission who are involved with the internal market working also coherently together."
"The one issue that has long interested us, and we felt that perhaps there was not sufficient mention of, was the contract law project and the common frame of reference."
"We do not want to feel that this is being forgotten and everybody is moving on to the next thing which we support you in, in terms of collective redress, but let us also devote our efforts still towards the common frame of reference."
"We would like to have seen more emphasis on ADR forms of redress, particularly in the on-line world which is something we, as a committee, have long supported."
"With collective redress, yes, we are happy that you look at it and we go forward in that area, but please do not let us end up where we have with contract law, bedevilled with questions over legal base and other issues."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (SV) Mr President, let me say a big thank you to the Commissioner, Meglena Kuneva, and rapporteur Lasse Lehtinen."
"I welcome the strategy and am very glad that consumers are being treated as an important group to look after."
"We know that we shall never get a flourishing internal market unless we have satisfied and secure consumers."
"But I share the rapporteur's view that the strategy calls for continuous follow-up if it is really to develop to the consumers' advantage."
"As rapporteur for the strategy in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, however, I am disappointed that the main reporting committee did not take account of more than one of our 13 amendments."
"They contain many important and worthwhile proposals."
"We wanted to see a clearer gender perspective."
"Consumer policy is definitely not gender-neutral."
"Gender should be taken into account just as children, the elderly and the disabled are taken into account."
"I hope that this can be taken up again in the next review."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, my thanks to Mr Lehtinen and to the shadow rapporteurs for the good cooperation over the last few months."
"This report introduces some very positive elements in the area of consumer policy moving forward."
"Consumers can only exercise their rights if they are aware of those rights, and empowerment of consumers in the EU is a central element of this report, and this will be achieved through education and awareness campaigns."
"Special focus will be given to equip consumers with the skills and tools needed to increase their confidence in the digital environment."
"The report commends the Commission's efforts to strengthen cooperation in the area of product safety and at international level, in particular with Chinese and US authorities."
"Continued dialogue and information-sharing on product safety is in the interest of all parties and is central to building consumer confidence."
"In relation to consumer redress, together with my PPE-DE colleagues I strongly support easy and effective access to redress for all consumers in the EU."
"We know that non-judicial forms of redress are the preferred solution of most consumers as they serve consumers' interests most rapidly at the lowest possible cost."
"As I have stated since the outset of discussions, I do not support calls for legislative action to introduce an ill-thought-out system of collective redress in the EU."
"The Commission is currently preparing various studies on existing systems of consumer redress in the Member States and rather than pre-empt the results of the Commission studies I, together with my PPE-DE colleagues, call for a strong role for Parliament and the Member States in assessing the results of the studies before deciding upon further action."
"It is not in consumers' interests to hastily introduce a system of collective redress which would be both costly and ineffective."
"In all other respects I support the report."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, may I express my thanks to Mr Lehtinen for the really good draft report he has given us, which provides us with a very sound basis for our discussions."
"I should like to highlight three very important points from this report."
"The first is the need to ensure that a leading role is played by instruments which we already possess in the European Union for the promotion of safety and prevention."
"This is why it is very important that the RAPEX system should be further improved so that it can serve the interests of consumers even more effectively."
"The second very important point is that Solvit, which is such a key instrument, should be nurtured and improved."
"There is still a very considerable information gap among consumers, too many of whom have never heard of Solvit and do not know that it could resolve a good few problems for them."
"That is also very important."
"I am also very gratified that the European Commission is to examine the EE symbol again."
"Many people believe that the EE symbol is a safety mark, but unfortunately it is not."
"We should ensure, together with you and Commissioner Verheugen, that the rules governing this symbol are formulated so as to enable us to assure the public in future that they can rely on the safety of products bearing the EE mark."
"That is a very important aim."
"The last and most important point, however, in the view of my group is the system of collective redress that we in the Socialist Group are advocating."
"The entire statute book serves no purpose if consumers cannot assert their enshrined rights, be it because there is a cross-border dimension which makes the law very difficult to enforce or because there are many small claims for minor losses, although these can certainly suck people dry over time."
"It is absolutely essential that we not only encourage the European Commission to examine and develop such a system but actually urge it to do so and to present us with an appropriate piece of draft legislation as soon as possible so that we can really give consumers due security and protection."
"I very much regret that the PPE-DE Group has not seen fit to advocate this system with the vigour and commitment that are needed to give consumers and the public at large real confidence in the European Union and the internal market, for such confidence comes from knowing that they are properly protected when they go shopping in Europe."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, may I begin by congratulating Lasse Lehtinen on this good and balanced draft report."
"We are in agreement on very many points. One reason for this has been the very good preliminary work of the Commission in this case."
"There are few contentious points."
"Consumer strategy will be one of the main topics of discussion during the next stage in the development of the internal market."
"At the heart of the three main challenges facing the European Union, namely growth, employment and the recognition and satisfaction of people's needs, are 490 million consumers."
"The internal market has the potential to become the world's largest retail market."
"This is why the ALDE Group supports the Commission's targeted efforts to create one large retail market out of 27 mini-markets."
"We also welcome the way in which the draft reinforces the horizontal element of consumer policy as well as its proposal for the appointment of what it calls consumer-liaison officers."
"In this context I should make special mention of the proposed strengthening of the European Consumer Centres and the particular attention given to the needs of children and elderly people."
"May I also say something on the subject of collective redress, with which we have a problem."
"We have had little information and much dogma."
"I believe it would be premature, Meglena, to say that you will have the solid backing of Parliament on this matter."
"We have just heard from the PPE-DE Group that it will not back you."
"I believe the PPE-DE is failing to recognise the real problems."
"There is a scatter-gun type of damage that affects many consumers in more than one country."
"It is legitimate for the Commission to give some thought to this whole matter and examine it in a study."
"On the other hand we have PSE dogma, which craves this instrument at all costs as a political tool, regardless of the real problems - and the real problems are manifold."
"There is, for example, the problem of the legal basis."
"Where in the Treaty does it say that we here in the Commission and Parliament are entitled to interfere with the Member States' codes of civil and criminal procedure?"
"What did Diana Wallis just tell us on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs?"
"The problem of contract law is still unresolved."
"The question of opting in or opting out, the role of the Ombudsman - there are many problems to resolve."
"It is simply not enough to say we do not want the US system."
"The Americans also had the best of intentions when they first created their system."
"It goes without saying that they did not intentionally create a bad system at the outset."
"For these reasons we should maintain an agnostic, critical position."
"We should wait for the study, take its findings seriously and then engage in an informed, non-dogmatic and responsible discussion, as befits this Parliament."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Lehtinen's report deals with the major issues of pro-quality strategy for the coming years."
"That strategy is important for the citizens of the Union, and I want to stress some of the problems involved."
"In the creation of national and EU law there should be greater input from consumer organisations, which are encountering difficulties in pursuing their activities and obtaining funding in certain countries."
"The Union should provide more substantive and financial assistance to those organisations."
"The collective redress systems applicable in certain countries should be used against dishonest market players, and a collective redress system should be introduced at European level."
"European consumer centres in the individual countries, as well as consumer organisations and consumer rights spokesmen, should step up information and education activities aimed at special protection for the most vulnerable consumers."
"Protection can be made more effective through the involvement of the Solvit and RAPEX consumer centres."
"We support this report."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President."
"Support for consumers' rights is often weak and so needs to be strengthened."
"I therefore thank the rapporteur and members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, who have succeeded in strengthening support for those consumer groups which most need protection: children and the elderly."
"Strong consumer support calls for active consumer organisations."
"Individuals are not strong when they stand alone."
"It is through these organisations that consumers gain strength and acquire more knowledge and information."
"These organisations therefore need reliable and secure financing."
"But the insecurity which currently prevails in purchases across national borders needs to be resolved by creating the possibility for group actions to be brought against firms which break the law."
"The greatest problem for consumers today is that it is difficult to get a dispute between different countries heard because there are no instances to resolve such cross-border disputes."
"The EU must first develop instances to resolve disputes, not create more EU legislation."
"I think the proposal to appoint an EU consumer ombudsman is highly dubious."
"Why introduce more services to be financed at EU level, thereby risking a cut in appropriations for consumers organisations?"
"Consumers will not gain anything from that."
"In conclusion, I regret that the amendments from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - as usual, I have to say - were voted down in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"They were worthy of a better fate."
"Mr President, it is a pleasure to take the floor for the first time and within an area of responsibility in which I look forward to working."
"It is of course positive that through this report the European Parliament is taking the initiative to secure the rights of consumers."
"However, I fear that, bit by bit, this legislation will simply amount to patching things up."
"There will be patches that cover up the fact that the EU is organised in such a way that consideration for the free mobility of goods, capital and services will always take precedence over consideration for consumers and other 'soft' areas."
"I believe that today's debate reflects this."
"I would like to give two very specific examples of ways in which we must secure the rights of consumers."
"It is vital that we secure the consumer's right to complain in their own country and in their own language, and it is vital that food products and other goods that could constitute a health risk can be subject to checks in the event of import into the individual countries."
"The individual countries should be allowed to carry out checks and demand a higher standard than that laid down in EU regulations, out of consideration for the environment and the health of consumers."
"The EU's consumer health strategy must be based on the principle of caution instead of an ideological school of thought that merely serves to allow all goods to move completely freely across borders."
"This can be done by securing the right to complain and contact legal bodies locally, as well as by allowing the import of goods to be stopped if there are health-related reasons for doing so."
"(SK) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report rightly assesses the positive effect of the euro in terms of reducing the cost of financial operations."
"Consumers have found it easier to compare prices in cross-border contracts and have also welcomed the increased retail potential in the internal market."
"I agree that the new Member States should be encouraged to continue their reforms and that they should be able to adopt the euro as soon as they fulfil the Maastricht criteria, in order to take full advantage of a common currency in the internal market."
"The European Parliament will soon have an opportunity to test this proposal in practice when it debates the enlargement of the euro zone to include the Slovak Republic."
"Slovakia has, with considerable effort and well ahead of target, fulfilled the Maastricht convergence criteria."
"I reject the attitude of some colleagues who are now hammering us with a vague and fuzzy counter-argument about the permanent sustainability of these criteria."
"That could go on indefinitely."
"Mr President, in the internal market consumers and providers, as well as goods and services, should be able to move freely."
"Consumers must not be less protected in other Member States than at home if we want to ensure and enhance cross-border activities."
"Therefore, I welcome the horizontal approach in the consumer policy and the better protection it will lead to."
"It means empowered consumers and strong consumer protection as well as a business-friendly internal market legislation."
"However, we are concerned about the hasty approach concerning collective redress."
"It is too early for Parliament to take a position."
"We need thorough studies of the existing systems in the Member States and an assessment of the need of a European collective redress system."
"We do not have enough knowledge at this stage of the consequences in terms of risk abuse, higher costs for consumers and businesses and more regulation."
"I do not believe that anyone supports the introduction of a European system in the EU knowing all the drawbacks and disproportionate consequences it would bring."
"For now, we encourage other means of redress which are more rapid and at lower costs and leave the regulation to the Member States to be decided nationally."
"Existing instruments and non-legislative tools can be used at EU level."
"We call on the Commission to carry out the study and present its results to Parliament and the Member States."
"Why go further than what is needed in order to achieve the objectives of the Treaty?"
"Why take away the possibility of choice for Member States keeping different dispute-solving mechanisms?"
"There are many questions to be answered."
"There is no clear indication so far that an EU-collective redress system brings added value to the internal market and its consumers and businesses."
"The EU should not legislate without strong reasons."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by congratulating Lasse Lehtinen on the excellent work he has done and on his capacity for listening."
"His report sets out to improve a Commission strategy that is already based on the principles of protecting and empowering consumers."
"I support the horizontal approach advocated by the rapporteur as a means of reconciling the protection of consumers - and especially the most vulnerable consumers - with an efficient internal market."
"Likewise, it is essential that consumer organisations should be given a greater role in preparing legislative proposals."
"In relation to product safety, the Commission not only needs to pursue its market surveillance efforts; it also needs to act quickly to establish principles for a CE marking system that will offer a genuine guarantee of quality, traceability and safety."
"Lastly, it is essential to improve access to redress by proposing a European system of collective redress that will allow consumers to exercise their rights in full where there is proven harm, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls of the US system."
"Voting in favour of these things can only strengthen public confidence in a European market model that is both open and protective."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's consumer strategy encompasses various thematic areas, in which we very largely support its position."
"We support you too, Mrs Kuneva, in your personal commitment to the completion of the single market and your particular focus on consumers and their role in the internal market."
"There are various areas of common ground."
"Reference has already been made to the aim of strengthening the European Consumer Centres and the Solvit system."
"That aim enjoys cross-party support."
"We also acknowledge the need for a horizontal approach to consumer policy but regret the weak emphasis on the law of contract."
"We must take care that contract law does not cause our proposals to fray at the edges so that we end up with patchwork legislation."
"This evening's vote in committee showed that consumers trust the law if they are fairly sure that they know it."
"If time limits vary from one jurisdiction to another, consumer confidence will wane quite considerably."
"We therefore need the common reference framework, because we need uniform standards in order to build consumer confidence."
"The same applies to collective redress."
"We have heard that various groups have adopted diverse positions."
"The position of the PPE-DE Group is quite clear: we concur with the analysis that there are certain weak points where consumer interests are less well protected, especially with regard to cross-border transactions."
"We look in vain, however, for an analysis of the reasons why these weak points exist, and no one in the chamber this evening has offered any explanation."
"We have been promised studies."
"We shall read them very carefully, page by page."
"If these studies only analyse the legal position, however, and not the differences between the Member States in terms of the enforcement of their own laws, these studies will bring us no further forward at the end of the day."
"May I therefore say to you, Mrs Kuneva, that we are wide open to real progress and take a very constructive attitude to the enforcement of existing rights but that these consumer rights cannot be more effectively enforced unless they ultimately work properly in practice."
"In Germany we have the Capital Investors' Test Cases Act, under which numerous shareholders have brought a group action against Deutsche Telekom; it has become evident in the course of these proceedings that the theory and practice of collective redress are often poles apart."
"(RO) It is obvious that consumers who are well-informed about their rights can reach a high level of satisfaction and defend their interests."
"Nevertheless, besides knowledge, citizens also need an instrument available in order to request compensations when their rights are infringed."
"For this reason, we believe that group actions are necessary and welcome in a form efficient for the consumer and balanced for the market."
"Continuing and strengthening the process of the internal market supervision is just as necessary."
"We believe the existent opinion barometer is very useful and will support its financing in the budget for 2009 as well, yet requesting more emphasis on recording and comparing the priced of goods and services traded in the 27 Member States."
"Last but not least, we should not forget that the consumers' rights should also function in the field of services, including the financial services and the services in the digital environment, where the degree of risk is much higher and it is much more difficult to prove the infringement of rights."
"Mr President, I want to thank Lasse Lehtinen for a very comprehensive report, which contains an enormous amount of extremely significant ideas."
"As the Commissioner said earlier, to enable consumers to become better informed and more confident and to exercise that critical choice, we want innovative and safe products and services."
"All of those things will come from support for consumers and enhancing their rights."
"I say this to Lasse particularly because I am disappointed that he has allowed all this good work to be overshadowed by one single issue."
"The problem with this issue about collective redress is that our colleagues in the Socialist Group seem to have already jumped to a conclusion that they want some new European legislation."
"I was delighted to hear you confirm, Commissioner, that you have two studies - not just one - looking at this issue in depth."
"We on this side of the House want to await the report before we jump to conclusions, but it appears that our colleagues on the Socialist side think that this is already a great thing and that, because we do not support it, we are some anti-consumer."
"You only have to read some of the press releases - the colourful releases, the red-coloured releases - that have come out on that side of the House."
"I just want to reject emphatically the fact that this side of the House is against consumer rights because we are not committing an advance to a proposal for which we do not even have the information."
"I say this to all our colleagues here: wrapping yourself in red tape and potentially adding great cost to consumers is not pro-consumer."
"Let us wait and see the conclusions."
"I say to Alexander Lambsdorff that he has allowed himself to be hijacked by this, but all he has to do tomorrow for us to unanimously support Lasse Lehtinen's report, is to vote for our Amendments 5 and 6, which keep the door firmly open."
"We will wait for Mrs Kuneva's report and we will look at it and study it with an open mind, but, in the mean time, we will continue to be the great champions for consumers in the internal markets, for their effective rights that will be delivered by the existing legislation we have at the moment."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lehtinen report quite rightly considers that the needs of consumer protection can be satisfied by legislation only if it is better and simpler, and that a more coherent legal framework for consumer rights is needed."
"I therefore call upon the Commission and the Member States to provide adequate funding for strong and independent consumer organisations."
"Such funding is absolutely essential for progress to be made in constructing a true internal market for consumers."
"Collective redress, meanwhile, deserves the closest attention and my support, given the positive experience recorded in various Member States."
"I would also like to say, as Mr Lehtinen stresses, that a strong consumer protection system will also benefit competitive producers and sellers, creating incentives for businesses to produce and sell more durable goods, resulting in more sustainable growth."
"The report goes further than this, however, and I applaud Mr Lehtinen when he states that consumer protection should be an integral part of the planning and design of products and services."
"Finally, I would like to say that I share his conclusion that effective and improved consumer protection is necessary in order to achieve a better functioning internal market."
"I would like to thank him and say that I believe we now have the best conditions for a good strategic understanding with Mrs Kuneva in this area."
"(PL) Mr President, there is no need to stress the importance of customer satisfaction for businesses."
"Each of us as a consumer knows that dishonest business practices - deliberately misleading information or unsatisfactory after-sales service - effectively makes us disinclined to purchase any more goods or services from the company concerned."
"It is important, however, that consumers should always have the possibility of real choice, of changing the service provider or seller."
"Without a doubt, such choice creates a competitive market in which it does not pay market players to discourage consumers."
"In a competitive market the entrepreneur knows that he risks losing his market position, and with it his profits and prospects of further development."
"I believe the European Union internal market has such potential."
"I am pleased that the possibility of creating the internal market exists, that it exists thanks to consumers, and that that fact has been noticed."
"Obviously, I am not saying we are already operating in such a market."
"Consumers still lack the knowledge needed in order to seek out the most advantageous offers, and some entrepreneurs withhold that information from them."
"Moreover, service providers themselves often take insufficient account of consumers' interests."
"It is therefore important to ensure that consumers' rights are respected, that they have the right to full, intelligible, simple and easily comparable information, and that that right is respected by companies and law-makers."
"It is no less important that consumers should be informed about their rights and made aware of the tools that exist to help them in taking decisions in a free market."
"In this respect, consumer organisations have a large part to play."
"Nor should we forget that the defence of consumers' rights, and the possibility of effectively enforcing them, are immensely important for the proper functioning of the market."
"As the rapporteur points out, however, defence of the consumer must not serve as an excuse for market protectionism."
"Our task is to strike the right balance in consumer protection so as not to create a barrier to business development."
"(SK) I welcome the Commission's report on the EU consumer policy strategy and I also appreciate your efforts, Commissioner Kuneva, to promote a consumer culture based on consumer awareness and better access to information."
"I believe that strong and independent consumer organisations are the backbone of an effective consumer policy and I am happy that Mr Lehtinen's report included the changes I proposed in article 7, where Parliament calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide sufficient finance for consumer organisations."
"This concerns primarily financial support for intensive training programs aimed at those working in consumer organisations."
"Consumer organisations are best informed about consumers' needs and should therefore be consulted on all areas of consumer policy that will affect consumers."
"I fully support the two amendments proposed by my political group, the PPE-DE, to Article 40 of the report dealing with collective redress."
"Only if such a need is identified by the impact study should the Commission propose a European framework, which would give all consumers in all the Member States easy access to various redress mechanisms in cross-border complaints."
"(RO) In the context of the European Union consumer protection strategy, I would like to mention the importance of quality of services and products."
"If consumers are already used to resorting to consumer protection offices in relation to products, this does not happen when it comes to services."
"Many times, consumers sign contracts for the supply of services without reading the contractual provisions carefully and if they do read them carefully they believe they cannot propose any amendments thereof."
"In fact, they do not have the same power of negotiation the suppliers of services have, although some observations from consumers could improve the content of contracts and increase their confidence."
"I would like to draw attention to the need to protect tourists and passengers as regards compliance with their rights which, unfortunately, many of them do not know and claim."
"Special attention should be given to electronic services as well."
"The consumers' confidence in digital services is essential for the European Union's competitiveness and, especially, for the development of economy based on knowledge."
"In conclusion, I would like to mention the fact that we also have to speak about the quality of public services and, in this context, about consumer protection."
"(RO) First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Lehtinen for the consistent report."
"Nevertheless, I would like to make an observation regarding Paragraph 35 of the report."
"This paragraph refers to the creation of a European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman's office."
"This proposal seems to be a very complicated and not very efficient procedure to me."
"First of all, the creation of such a position requires financial resources."
"We would have a redistribution of funds between the European consumer protection centres and the potential new Ombudsman."
"Secondly, bureaucracy would increase at the level of the European Union."
"Last but not least, we would have an overlapping of the newly-created Ombudsman's tasks and the European consumer protection centres."
"I don't believe that a new instrument would bring more efficiency in solving the complaints filed by European consumers."
"But I do think that an efficient and thorough implementation of the legislation would reduce the dissatisfaction related to the internal market operation."
"In conclusion, I request the European Commission representatives to take into consideration Paragraph 7, by which we request the allocation of adequate funds to the consumer organizations across the European Union."
"(CS) Mr President, globalisation of our market requires strong, clear and easily enforceable consumer rights and I am happy to see the Commission making very successful efforts in this area."
"In my report last year I pointed out that consumer confidence in e-commerce would be enhanced by sample consumer contracts and by better mechanisms for dealing with complaints, as well as by the European trustmark and the consumer charter."
"However, I do not think that a European Consumer Ombudsman will help us a great deal."
"We need instead to increase financial support for the existing consumer organisations and supervisory bodies in the Member States, because they are the bodies that are increasingly identifying the unsafe products from Asia, namely toys, children's shoes and sports equipment."
"The citizens expect us to come up with a more successful means of dealing with cross-border complaints, as has already been said here many times."
"That is further justification for harmonising the rules in the Member States."
"However, collective redress is problematic; it may be good for the lawyers, but it is often very costly for consumers or providers."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's intention to assess the results of the German or British model first and only then to consider the possible way forward, not being pushed into a blind alley by the Socialists."
"I would like to express my appreciation of the work done by our rapporteur and that of the Commission on the reform of the consumer policy."
"(DE) Mr President, I intend to make my fellow Member Malcolm Harbour happy tomorrow by wearing my red suit to show him that the red corner really does know what it wants."
"That, in fact, is the difference between what we on the Left are seeking and what those on the Right are up to, namely creating a big blue smokescreen to hide the fact that they do not actually want consumer protection at all but are committed first and foremost to the defence of industrial interests."
"It is only right that this should be made clear for once."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I understood I have only two minutes, but I wish this talk could be much longer."
"I very much hope that I will continue with all of you, whenever you have time and interest, to discuss together consumer issues."
"I would be more than delighted, because I receive a lot of incentives - even in this late session."
"I would like to make my political commitment, that I will continue to tackle the issues with sustainable development, working on CEE and GPSD (the General Product Safety Directive) and they how could they be complementary to each other."
"Of course I will continue with the digital guide, which was one of the very first talks which I had with Ms Roithová."
"I am, of course, working together with my fellow commissioners; this portfolio is becoming more and more wide-ranging and evolving other portfolios, but I believe that this is part of the beauty of this portfolio."
"So, there are many things."
"Let me agree with all of you in saying that if we would like to have a complete internal market, we need to stress the rights of consumers."
"This is really the only way to fulfil and to square the second phase of the internal market."
"I believe that if we are making good progress with our scoreboard, this scoreboard will be part of the internal market's bigger picture, and then we will have already quite a full understanding of how the European internal market is going on."
"I was specially touched by Mrs Dahl - I am sorry that she is no longer in the plenary - who said that this was the first time that she had taken the floor."
"But, referring to the so-called race to the bottom, if we have common rules everywhere in the European Union and not just protecting, in the best way, the national consumer, I think that we should not pick the winners, except one: if the winner is the consumer."
"We started, years ago, making a good environment for business, and this was the right thing."
"But if you want to develop European business, business needs consumers, and we cannot deny that consumers need the same tackling of bottlenecks, so that they can feel comfortable everywhere, as a Swede living in Brussels, for example - we need to have the same rights, we need to have the same rights when we are shopping and enjoying e-commerce and other distance selling."
"Let me focus for a while on collective redress."
"I carefully listened to all of you."
"Let me mention that, in our 10 benchmarks, which we distributed, discussed and received more than 300 opinions about, half of these collective redress benchmarks were related not to having punitive damages compensated and not to being an expensive procedure."
"So at least five of these benchmarks are related and address the issue of not having additional costs."
"I believe that the best thing is to open our minds and not to make dogma, and this is my plea for support in this aspect."
"So I would also like to tell you that what we are preparing is communication: this is why we do not have a study on economic, social and environmental impact, as is done for all our legislative proposals."
"But we are doing something much more in preparation, and this is to have two really very thorough studies, comparative studies."
"Let me invite you: before the end of the month we will have three big stakeholders' conferences: with businesses, with consumers and with academics, and our services will provide four places in the workshops for European Parliament representatives."
"All the outcomes of these three events will be absolutely public, put on our websites and communicated in the best manner, and of course I am around and always open to continue to discuss your hopes and your fears."
"I would like to end by thanking you and saying that maybe for the first time, almost nobody mentioned that Europe is going to do a class action."
"I believe that this is a positive sign."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank all my colleagues who spoke here tonight and, of course, Commissioner Kuneva for her constructive attitude that we have become familiar with since she came into office."
"I have a couple of remarks."
"Mrs Kauppi mentioned financial services."
"The growing area of cross-border banking, insurance sales and wealth management which has some very sophisticated instruments is a growing problem."
"The rules still confuse consumers even at a national level."
"So I think that in this area we need a cross-border collective redress system as well, because it will make financial institutions more responsible and careful when they explain the rights and risks to the customer."
"We all know the sad figures that tell us how citizens in Member States are afraid of buying goods and services across borders, which is completely due to a lack of confidence."
"But I trust that, when we proceed in the good mood in which we have discussed this report among ourselves and with the Commission, we can only succeed in building more confidence among European consumers."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 20 May 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - We welcome the ongoing efforts to further incorporate the level of consumers' awareness as the necessary basis for the effective implementation of the existing consumer protection legal framework, especially with regard to the most vulnerable groups of the population."
"Not only is there a need for a more comprehensive legal framework for consumers' rights, but also we ought genuinely to take into consideration consumers' interests when completing the internal market standardisation."
"It is obvious that a stronger, unique consumer protection system effective all over the Union is in the interest of all citizens."
"The completion of the internal market is an opportunity to implement harmonisation measures so as to target the problems faced by consumers in their everyday life."
"Specific attention should therefore be given to sectors related to the new digital environment."
"A good consumer is a consumer aware of his or her rights and how rightfully to enforce them."
"We ought to develop in the Community a genuine consumer culture as part of our education system and to systematically involve consumer organizations in the consultations and the dialogue with industry."
"We welcome therefore the call to establish a special European Consumer Ombudsman in the European Ombudsman's office on a country-by-country basis."
"in writing. - (FR) I warmly welcome Mr Lehtinen's report, which puts consumer protection at the heart of efforts to complete the internal market."
"The report points out that a high level of protection for all consumers in the European Union can be achieved only through a horizontal approach - in other words with the help of sector-based directives aimed at harmonising national laws - and it also underscores the need to strengthen confidence among those same consumers."
"That depends particularly on ensuring the safety of all products in circulation and the security of all transactions both in the realm of cross-border trade in services and in electronic commerce."
"I am also pleased that the report proposes research into the implementation at European level of rapid and effective means of redress for consumers."
"The establishment of non-judicial systems of dispute resolution would be one means of meeting expectations in this regard, as would the adaptation of certain forms of redress such as collective action - which already exist in certain Member States - to the Community legal context."
"At the same time, I believe it would be useful to explore in greater depth, and in the light of different national experiences, the advantages and the limitations of such arrangements."
", in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to see that the European Commission has made the protection of Europe's consumers one of its priorities with its proposed EU Consumer Policy strategy for 2007-2013."
"I should also like to thank my Finnish Socialist colleague Lasse Lehtinen for his excellent work and the significant contributions he makes in his report."
"I welcome his vision of a horizontal approach at European level, for it is essential that the interests of consumers should be taken into account in all the Union's policies."
"At the same time I support his wish to give consumer associations a greater role in drafting European rules, and his proposal to improve protection for the most vulnerable consumers, particularly young and elderly people, through more information campaigns aimed specifically at them."
"I also strongly support the introduction of a European system of collective redress that would enable consumers in different Member States to take their complaints jointly to the courts and seek redress, while avoiding the pitfalls of the US model."
"So I hope that, despite opposition on the conservative side, this House will vote in favour of a European 'class action' system."
", in writing. - (FI) I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehtinen, for the work he has done in compiling this report."
"One of the most important objectives of the consumer policy strategy proposed by the Commission is to make consumer protection the focus of the EU internal market."
"I would like to stress that this is the very means by which we will be able to establish the best possible conditions for our consumers, and take an important step closer to attaining the objectives of the European Union."
"How can we achieve this?"
"Consumers must have access to accurate information on which to base their decisions."
"An informed consumer is also a more active consumer!"
"An internal market which is working well must provide the EU's citizens with good options as well as reasonable prices and the opportunity to purchase high-quality goods and services."
"Another important issue is class actions, which cannot be brought in Estonia, unlike some of the countries which are our neighbours."
"I do not believe, however, that this has been to the benefit of our consumers."
"Quite the reverse."
"It is important to learn from the experiences of others: claims for damages must be related to the actual harm suffered."
"Similarly it is important for consumers to be able to rely on their rights; they should not have to waive them because they do not have the resources to take the providers of goods or services in other countries to court."
"Our clear wording protects the consumers' interests in that regard and I believe that the need for class actions has become a key cross-border issue."

"Employment Policy Guidelines for Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States PART V - C6-0031/2008 -."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's December 2007 Strategic Report has sent a very positive message, which received the support of the European Council at its spring meeting in March 2008."
"The results of the Lisbon Strategy, in its 2005 renewed form, are already visible now at the end of the first three-year cycle."
"Economic growth and employment growth are impressive."
"Many indicators point to the fact that the structural reforms have started to produce results."
"Although all the Member States have been implementing reforms since 2005, some are doing better than others."
"A degree of fatigue in this area has become noticeable during the last year."
"However, Europe must not stop or slow down the pace."
"On the contrary, it is necessary to continue with reform implementation, preferably with even more gusto."
"This is the idea behind the Commission's proposal on maintaining the key Integrated Guidelines - including the key employment guidelines - in their existing form until 2010."
"The Commission strongly believes that these key guidelines provide a proper framework for the present-day tasks of the European labour market, and that they serve their purpose."
"The European Council endorsed this at its spring meeting by opting for a general approach based on stability."
"Member States must be given the opportunity to finish the reforms they have begun, and they should also be given a timeframe within which the results of the reforms should show."
"The Commission also found that it was necessary to propose changes, with emphasis on certain important tasks that would be tackled in the near fu climate change, energy, social dimension and flexicurity."
"The Commission also expressed its wish to put more stress on the need for greater inclusion and more stringent implementation."
"As a result, the agreed goals and reference levels were included in the wording of the key guidelines."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Please allow me first and foremost to thank the Members with whom I have been able to collaborate on this report for their excellent cooperation."
"It is my belief that a few too many amendments have been made to details in the report, but nevertheless, Commissioner, the message must be clear: this European Parliament will not accept 'business as usual' on the European Employment Strategy."
"It is true that a great deal of work has yet to be done in the Member States in order to apply the guidelines in practice, but it is also true that the guidelines must be adapted in order to remedy a number of material shortcomings."
"I should like to mention three essentials."
"First of all, the Employment Strategy must be given a much stronger social dimension."
"There are still too many groups in society that do not share in the benefits of growth and jobs."
"Disabled people, migrants and semi- and unskilled workers are still all too often left to their fate, whilst we need everyone in society and everyone in the labour market."
"For that reason, the Employment Strategy must also promote active social integration in order to combat poverty and social exclusion by offering a decent income and quality services together with an active policy of job-search assistance and training."
"Secondly: the quality of the work."
"Clearly, more jobs have been created, but for that reason they have not always been better jobs."
"Too many people remain tied against their will to precarious contracts, temporary jobs, involuntary part-time work or jobs that often guarantee them only an insufficient income."
"For that reason, the emphasis must be laid more upon the quality of jobs, on opportunities to progress into permanent jobs with a reliable income."
"The training efforts must be drastically increased and, above all, all workers, regardless of employment status, must be granted social rights."
"Flexibility is not the only thing required in the labour market; the workers also need more security."
"Thirdly: the gender perspective."
"Women have made a huge advance in the labour market, yet they are still far from achieving equal opportunities."
"The wage gap is still unacceptably wide."
"Women do not have the same access to training, nor the same opportunities to establish a business."
"Those who want to return to work after a career break find it increasingly difficult."
"Overcoming difficulties in order to reconcile a career and family life too often remains problem for women only, and they also often feel the consequences on their income during their retirement."
"It is for this reason that the Employment Strategy must devote particular attention to the gender perspective, in order to eliminate all inequalities between men and women."
"Finally, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commitment of the Member States and the European Union to solid social legislation will make or break the Employment Strategy as a method."
"I hope, therefore, that all the Member States of the European Union will transpose and apply the European legislation consistently, and I also hope, Commissioner, that the Commission will soon - within a few months, maybe even within a few weeks - present us with an ambitious social agenda."
"I hope that both the June meeting of the Council and the Commissioner and Commission will listen to our message."
"Incidentally, it is regrettable, Mr President, that not a single representative of the Council Presidency is here, because this message is in fact primarily targeted at the June Council meeting, which must take definitive decisions on the Employment Strategy."
"I hope that someone will manage to convey Parliament's message to them by then."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, first I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Anne Van Lancker, and to the members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the high standard of consultation we engaged in together to come up with this text, which sums up our shared convictions and the way we would like to see the Employment Guidelines change."
"Growth in jobs in Europe, in accordance with the Lisbon strategy, should from now on be pursued taking account of three major recent or current changes."
"These are the globalisation of the economy, which forces Europe to be incisive from an economic point of view and from the point of view of developing employment; flexicurity, which is absolutely necessary for the development of our companies and therefore of employment; and, of course the construction of a social Europe."
"To achieve this, we introduced three particular highlights into this update of the Employment Guidelines."
"On the one hand, there is the very necessary fight to stop people leaving education systems without any qualifications."
"Leaving education without qualifications means not being equipped for integration into a job and therefore not having the resources for social integration."
"That is our first duty and we really need to work hard at it."
"The second point we need to be very concerned about is maintaining and developing lifelong learning, which is the only way of guaranteeing ongoing employability and mobility of employees."
"The third point concerns validation of acquired experience, which really enables employees to progress their careers, and also enables companies to adapt effectively to new requirements."
"We reached agreement on all these points, and I therefore thank the members of the PPE-DE Group for their support in today's vote."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, when Anne Van Lancker began working on the European Parliament's response, she planned to concentrate on a few important points, since we knew that both the Commission and the Council would propose that the guidelines should not be amended at all."
"Our tactic was to concentrate on a small number of points in the hope that they might listen to at least some of what we had to say."
"It was not to be."
"Although the basic approach is the same, we now have masses of amendments instead of just a few."
"I think that it would have been better to concentrate on what Mrs Van Lancker said - that we clearly integrate the social dimension, a policy for all those who are outside the labour market and have no share in prosperity."
"Despite a favourable employment trend, we note that a great many of the new jobs are insecure and do not provide a living."
"The employment offers no security."
"And the discussion we have had on flexicurity should be reflected more clearly in the guidelines since it has been debated for several years."
"The same applies to the equality issues."
"The fact that the Council is not here, I think regrettably, is because the Council will not listen to anything Parliament has to say."
"They will do exactly as they have previously decided."
"I think that we in the European Parliament must give serious consideration in the next three-year review to changing our tactic and the way we work so that Parliament has a real influence on how the guidelines are to look in the future."
"Congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, on preparing this significant report."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for her helpful cooperation and understanding in the acceptance of amendments."
"I consider this document to have the right balance and I hope it will find the support of the majority in tomorrow's vote."
"I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the Commission Communication to the Council contains an extremely welcome proposal that would encourage the development of the market and increase employment."
"This is the freedom of knowledge, which would be added to the four fundamental freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital."
"This fifth freedom should help speed up the EU's transition to a modern, creative knowledge economy."
"It would in turn strengthen the knowledge triangle of scientific research, education and innovation within the EU."
"The initiative proposed by the Commission is no doubt a very good one."
"However, no one would argue against the importance of the original four freedoms in increasing employment."
"Nevertheless, it happens that some Member States fail to adhere to EU policy and even breach the legal norms."
"In pursuing protective policy, they prevent the free movement of capital and persons and jeopardise the development not only of their own countries, but of the EU as a whole."
"In my view, the free movement of services will not guarantee the freedom of development of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Let us not forget Winston Churchill's observation that if you destroy a free market, you create a black market."
"The Commission and the Member States should realise that we can achieve much more together than by going our separate ways."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the group of the Greens/ European Free Alliance warmly welcome Mrs Van Lancker's report because it would be fatal if the Council were to announce full-bodied reforms in employment policy guidelines for 2008 and then say: actually, we don't want a reform!"
"Commissioner, you are absolutely right when you say that reform fatigue seems to have occurred at the Commission and also particularly in the Council."
"The Van Lancker report, however, clearly sets the right priorities."
"I should particularly like to emphasise the setting of new priorities in social integration."
"It is vital that the message goes out from here that we cannot forget the people outside and that they are important to us."
"Secondly, we Greens have made a considerable contribution to ensuring that this Parliament report has a substantial gender mainstreaming dimension - consistently - and that family policy is not completely sold out as gender mainstreaming policy."
"Gender mainstreaming is broader and concerns women - not men and women, as is the case in family policy."
"We Greens, however, will continue to take a discerning look at the flexicurity sector until social protection is guaranteed."
"I should once again like to point out that we need reform and not stalemate."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the common employment policy for Member States is undergoing a test."
"It is increasingly throwing up employment growth programmes for various age groups, taking account of their specific needs and potential and the threat of problems with finding work."
"Under the Lisbon Strategy, these programmes above all envisage investment in people and in their education, and better chances in the job market."
"A rise in employment by 3.6 million people in 2007 and an anticipated rise in employment by 4.5 million in 2008-2009 is the perceptible result of this policy."
"This means that promoting an approach to work that matches the human life cycle, concern for young people not completing their education and for adapting work conditions to family needs, and especially to parental duties, eliminating discrimination in the workplace, particularly in the scope of access to training and other forms of skill refinement, and gradually restricting occupational activity among older people should in future constitute the basis for action in this sphere."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I too join the ranks of those who wish to thank the rapporteur for her work, for the report that stresses the importance of one of the pillars of the European Community, namely the European social model."
"I welcome the fact that the report accentuates issues such as enhancing social integration, combating poverty and emphasising social inclusion in employment policies."
"The rapporteur also rightly accentuates the need to promote gender equality at work."
"These positive aspects notwithstanding, the way our political group sees it, the draft resolution puts more emphasis on the principle of flexibility than on true provision of good job opportunities and the right to quality work."
"I sympathise with the rapporteur."
"It is difficult to find a compromise solution between these two options."
"I regret that the committee adopted only one of the many motions tabled by our political group, and under these circumstances I have to say that in spite of all the compromise solutions that were adopted we will not be able to support the final report."
"In spite of that, I must say that I was honoured to work with the rapporteur."
"The future, the outcome of the flexibility concept, the new social experience and the citizens of the European Union will all decide, in the end, which of us is closer to the truth in searching for, and implementing, the social Europe project."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the conclusion of this strategic report on the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs is that the Lisbon Strategy is working."
"However, the rapporteur draws attention to the fact that the Strategy for Jobs is not delivering for all citizens."
"Six million young people in the EU leave school early and 16% of the total EU population are poor or at risk of poverty."
"This is a key challenge but, unfortunately, in the list of people that are at risk we have again lost the opportunity to include carers."
"Carers are the largest workforce in Europe."
"They are not people out of work but people working harder than many people who are in the labour force."
"When I brought up the issue of carers in committee, I was told that carers - people caring for our older people, people with disabilities and children - are people on career breaks."
"To call caring a 'career break' is to show ignorance of what carers do and the value of what they do."
"Please, Commissioner, bring carers into focus and support them."
"Carers are the key to how we manage our ageing European population in terms of meeting the needs of our older citizens and stabilising our birth rates."
"So make carers a priority."
"Hopefully in this Parliament we will also specifically look at the issue of carers."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, while we are pleased about the 6.5 million new jobs that have been created in the last two years, we should not remain silent about the fact that 4 out of 10 employees have in the meantime been living in precarious employment relationships."
"In many countries temporary employment agencies are rising in rank to become the largest employers."
"Increasing globalisation and the relocation of production to countries with lower wages brings massive job losses."
"Temporary jobs can only partly compensate for this."
"Meanwhile, 78 million Europeans have to live on the poverty line with temporary work, 1-euro jobs and mini-jobs."
"You cannot, however, feed a family on a McJob."
"Even the erstwhile employment guarantor, a good education, is rarely any help nowadays."
"Gross wages have fallen by almost 5% within three years in Germany, for instance, whereas the cost of living has risen massively since the introduction of the euro."
"While we can be pleased about a net increase in employment figures in the light of these facts, it is in my view a mockery for every individual among the millions of unemployed and anyone who, despite doing honest work, has to live in poverty."
"(DE) Mr President, because of globalisation our living and working conditions are changing so rapidly that many citizens are losing track of things."
"They feel swamped and insecure."
"The guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs need to be clearly visible to them: competitive jobs, equal opportunities and social cohesion."
"The flexicurity concept is still not sufficiently understood."
"Not only do employees have to become more flexible in their own interests in order to improve their employability, but enterprises also have to become more flexible by developing new marketing strategies and innovative products and capturing market niches, among other things."
"At the same time, employees need efficient social security systems to ensure that they are integrated rather than excluded."
"Their work should be rewarded appropriately according to the sector and region by agreements between the social partners, not by government intervention."
"The aim of European employment policy is both to provide more people with jobs and to create higher quality jobs."
"At the same time there has to be investment in education and training in order to ensure that the concept of lifelong learning is genuinely sustained and includes underperformers."
"It must be made clear that both the ESF as well as the European Regional Development Fund and the new Globalisation adjustment Fund must directly benefit those threatened or affected by unemployment."
"They should be better prepared for change and be able to enter new spheres of work."
"We shall also be measured by whether we have managed to keep older employees in work processes for longer, instead of shunting them into early retirement."
"They are highly motivated, able to work under pressure and have know-how aplenty."
"Best practices should demonstrate how young and old cooperate through teamwork and how both sides benefit."
"The guidelines for employment policy in this very good report will be accepted above all if the subsidiarity principle is consistently maintained."
"Mrs Van Lancker is right: the Member States have to prove that they are taking part in this, and then confidence in our social market model will increase."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs. Van Lancker, for her work and emphasize the importance of this report."
"Special attention should be given to the fact that, at present, 78 million citizens of the European Union are poor or exposed to the risk of poverty, and 6 million young people leave school."
"We, as European socialists, want to provide equal chances to all citizens for a decent living, for strengthening social cohesion."
"The implementation of these guidelines will contribute to the increase in the number of safer and better paid jobs, to guaranteeing adequate social protection by access to quality social services, promoting active social integration for all the European Union citizens for the purpose of fighting poverty and social exclusion."
"In this context, I would like to emphasize the care we should provide to the disabled and elderly people for access to the labour market, as well as for eliminating all discrimination between women and men in relation to pay."
"I believe this report is an important instrument for achieving the new Lisbon Strategy objectives and will contribute to strengthening the social dimension of the Lisbon Treaty also ratified by Romania."
"I will support and vote on this report."
"(ET) Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, the guidelines for economic growth and employment for the next three years will be debated at the Spring European Summit."
"The Lisbon Agenda has started to bear fruit."
"This is a good thing, although we have probably focused too little on social inclusion in its activity."
"The Lisbon Agenda has indeed created new jobs, although not always the best kind."
"It is not enough to set courageous targets - education is needed, as is tailoring of school systems and increases in their capabilities, making them respond to the needs of the knowledge-based economy and society."
"It is very important to promote a family-friendly approach to work."
"The Lisbon Agenda requires a strengthening of social measures."
"Attention should not be placed just on flexibility of labour relations, but on protected flexibility."
"Only a balance between flexibility and protection can improve employment and social protection."
"We must work to ensure that positive developments in economic, employment and social policy complement each other."
"Allow me also to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"(DE) Mr President, the Commission refers to the fact that as a result of employment policies agreed with the Member States in the last two years, 6.5 million jobs have been created."
"This sounds good, particularly for those who want to adapt the European Union increasingly to global competition, but it is not as good for those who have taken these jobs but for the most part can barely make a living from them."
"The report on poverty published in Germany yesterday has also clearly shown that more and more employees need benefits on top of their earned income in order not to slide into poverty and that the disparity between those on high incomes and those who draw as good as no income is becoming ever larger."
"It is therefore urgently necessary for the European Union's employment strategy to become much more strongly and practically involved in combating social exclusion and poverty, creating good jobs, increasing income and providing social protection for the employed."
"This practical involvement, however, is not consciously forthcoming, for whatever reasons."
"The European Union should ultimately be focusing its attention on the concept of good jobs, an idea that the EU's Employment Ministers were propagating even a year ago in order to move a step further forward here."
"The flexicurity concept is not sufficient in this context."
"Mr President, if the Lisbon Strategy is beginning to work, why has part-time work risen from 16.2% to 18.1% over the last few years?"
"Why has the share of people with involuntary fixed-term contracts and no long-term security reached over 6.5%?"
"The rapporteur admits that EU unemployment reached 8.9% in 2005."
"It is due to fall to 7.1% this year, but will it?"
"In the UK, unemployment is only about 5.8%."
"Combating unemployment does not need a policy."
"It needs a shot in the arm."
"Talking of which, was the hypodermic system invented by a commission or a parliament or a committee?"
"No, it was not."
"Someone had a bright idea, and good ideas always spread."
"For good ideas, read best practice, and best practices are for sharing."
"Look at the UK's superior employment figures noted just now."
"They are better because our best practices include maintaining our opt-outs from the useless Working Time Directive and not taking the euro but continuing to trade worldwide outside the EU more than any other Member State."
"There is my shot in the arm."
"Will you take it?"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my speech with an observation that I take pleasure and satisfaction in relating."
"The renewed Lisbon Strategy is beginning to show results, and what is particularly pleasing is that in the European Union there is a steady increase in the number of people who are in work."
"At this point, however, I must take issue to a certain extent with the opinion of the rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, that the quality of the newly created jobs might arouse disquiet."
"Of course, we should do all we can to ensure that the jobs on offer in the European Union are of the highest quality, but I feel that any work is better than unemployment, which is degrading and sustains a feeling that one has no personal worth."
"This is particularly the case with young people, among whom the level of unemployment continues to be high, as a result of which their future should become a priority task in the next few years."
"One effective instrument for increasing the availability of jobs, which is particularly important for young Europeans, is the concept of combining flexibility and security in the job market, referred to as 'flexicurity'."
"There is no single universal model of flexicurity and so this concept should be put into effect taking account of the specific circumstances and traditions that prevail in the different Member States."
"This is in fact the direction proposed in the amendments put forward by my political group."
"There are, however, two elements in this concept that are as good as universal, and at the same time, as I see it, crucial."
"The first of these is investment in education, and especially in a high level of continuing education, which enables employees to adjust their skills to rapidly changing economic and job market trends."
"Secondly, we have a bolder use of 'non-standard' forms of employment, which particularly enable young people preparing to launch themselves into their working lives both to obtain practical skills and to cover the costs of their vocational education."
"(CS) First of all, I would like to express my admiration for Mrs Anne Van Lancker, who did not collapse under the weight of amendments and did not allow her report to be watered down."
"I would probably be even more critical because I am of the opinion that the renewed Lisbon Strategy contributes very little."
"The unemployment rate is not falling significantly; the jobs created are not high-quality jobs; we tolerate people in the EU Member States suffering from in-work poverty."
"All this means that something is clearly not right here."
"Not even the Green Paper gives answers to the questions we are asked by workers and trade unions."
"All we have to do, though, is to look up the relevant International Labour Organisation Conventions."
"We should remember that, with few exceptions, almost all the Member States have ratified the most important of them."
"The unease with which European trade unions have received the latest judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Viking - Laval - Rüffert cases is understandable."
"My advice is to offer fewer pages and more respect for what has been achieved in the past decades, especially in the developed countries of the European Union."
"(SV) Mr President, this report is imbued with the spirit of the values which should govern a free labour market."
"But there is one big drawback: it is wrong to draw up such rules at EU level."
"It will then become part of the EU's common regulatory system, the acquis communautaire - it will be enshrined in Holy Writ."
"The possibility of future reforms will disappear throughout Europe."
"If, in the 1970s, Germany and France had forced through a common employment policy for the Community, based on the political concepts which prevailed at the time, Europe's economy would now be in decline."
"The current buzzword, flexicurity, recurs constantly in the report."
"That is because no common employment policy was formulated, which in turn is why Denmark was able to develop something which now looks very promising."
"The report would benefit by being reduced to a single sentence: 'The European Parliament recommends that the Member States take a look at the Danish flexicurity model in order to see whether they have something to learn from it.'"
"Period."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the figures on employment trends are in fact very positive and we would have to go back to the 1980s to find similar values."
"Nevertheless, we need to be aware that not all European regions have shown equally encouraging results; the news on the quality of employment is not the best either."
"I am aware that, when talking about social policy there is always the tendency to set priorities, and this is no easy task - the temptation is to regard everything as a priority."
"Experience shows, though, that when everything is a priority the result is that nothing is a priority."
"I should therefore like to encourage all of us to try to ensure that we are able to include the defining of roles, responsibilities and clear and quantifiable objectives in these social issues, specifically in terms of employment policy."
"As a contribution, I would say that for me there is one very clear priority bound up with putting a halt to early school leaving, which nowadays affects 15% of young people between the ages of 18 and 24."
"That is, more than 6 million young people."
"The early school leaving scenario is particularly serious in view of the expected demographic evolution in Europe, which by 2030 will have 18 million fewer children and young people and 52% more people aged over 65."
"I find it unacceptable that this precious, shrinking population of young people, upon which social security systems depend, should not be well educated and prepared, to the highest level, to deal successfully with the new labour market challenges."
"We all know that the least educated are the most vulnerable to unemployment and social exclusion within the information society and obviously run the risk of finding themselves socially excluded."
"Like our rapporteur, Mrs Van Lancker, whom I congratulate, I firmly believe that the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy must be strengthened particularly through a greater emphasis on the issue of inclusion."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the main virtues of the work that has been done are the basic consensus on the diagnosis of the situation and the treatments that need to be applied at national level in order to achieve the employment objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Union needs to be extremely strong economically in order to make political progress without renouncing the social model that is in its genes."
"The best social policy is to allow people to integrate and make progress through employment."
"These eight guidelines give us the roadmap for the reforms that need to be tackled by 2010, and are more than sufficient for launching national reform programmes."
"However, there are some very decisive elements on which we need to work in a particular way."
"The first is achieving a level of mobility that opens up employment opportunities, essentially for young people."
"In order to do this, it is absolutely vital that we guarantee an effective system of equivalence of qualifications, not only in terms of degrees and diplomas, but in terms of training for employees throughout their working lives."
"The second is modernising the employment rules in order to move towards gradual and flexible retirement."
"This would avoid the decline in employment income and future situations of poverty."
"The third is to improve the linguistic competence of the population in general, because globalisation has its rules, ladies and gentlemen."
"Whoever adapts, wins."
"The rest lose."
"If we want greater productivity, quality jobs and greater skills, we need to continue to drive forward the reforms mentioned in the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is true that there have been achievements, but if the outstanding reforms are neglected, everything will collapse."
"That is why the implementation through dialogue of initiatives such as 'flexicurity' is essential."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Strategy has achieved the objective of increasing employment in Europe, but not everyone has benefited: the path for young people, women and marginal social groups remains difficult."
"The quality of employment has not improved either: the number of fixed-term contracts has increased and greater flexibility has not been matched by job security."
"This is why the social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy must be strengthened, supporting lifelong learning and skills recognition."
"Welfare systems that provide income support and facilitate mobility within the job market must be defined, with the proper shock absorbers, and the work/life balance goals must be achieved."
"The draft resolution is a step in this direction, which is why we are supporting it."
"(PL) Mr President, I agree with the statement that the revived Lisbon Strategy has brought a greater number of jobs, but not necessarily better-quality jobs."
"The need to combat poverty and social exclusion should always be taken into account in any EU strategy."
"I do not, however, share the view that adopting common social standards at EU level will be a panacea for our problems."
"Employment and social policy falls within the scope of Member States' rights, and all actions by the EU in this sphere must be compliant with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Establishing and introducing strategies based on specific models such as flexicurity will differ at national level."
"I would like to emphasise the danger that accompanies a one-dimensional approach on this matter, while at the same time favouring the creation of a platform at EU level for the purpose of exchanging information and best practice."
"It is my view that no specific employment policy strategy will bring complete success without the total levelling of all existing barriers to the free flow of labour as a sure means of stimulating economic growth and promoting employment."
"(RO) I congratulate Anne Van Lancker for the report."
"Personally, I am worried about the quality of jobs."
"We have 78 million people at the limit of the poverty threshold also because Member States have inequalities in relation to the pay for employees."
"I know what discrimination problems many Romanians working legally in other European Union Member States are dealing with and that they are forced to accept work below their qualification and lower salaries than their colleagues, citizens of the given countries."
"Unfortunately, at the European Union level, we have no mechanism for assessing the quality of jobs and we need one."
"I strongly believe that the principle of the correct pay is an incentive for the supply of quality services and I am completely against the existent tendencies to underpay the employees and the free movement of labour should not be restricted in any way in the European Union."
"(CS) In reality, there are only two ways to solve the unemployment issue: one is for the people to go where the work is, and the other is for the work to go where the people are."
"I think that the latter option is more sensible because none of the means used in option one (shared work, flexible contractual arrangements, more flexible working hours, etc.) has brought the desired results."
"In my opinion, option two offers more potential and is quite suitable for the European Union."
"One of the possibilities is the creation of a European public sector so that the European Union begins to function as an entity that creates job opportunities."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to applaud the remarkable job done by my colleague Mrs Morin, who has spoken up for the positions of our political group."
"At the risk of going off on a tangent, I would like to ask about the role of the social partners, which seem conspicuous by their absence from this report."
"We are working according to Article 128, which means we are going to make recommendations to the Member States, but I believe the time has come to move towards greater action."
"Commissioner, what are your feelings about the application of Article 139 of the Treaty, which provides for precisely this possibility, that of the social partners creating Community level employment law?"
"How can we have an employment policy without coordination of social law?"
"I think that in application of Article 138, Commissioner, it is up to you to promote the social partners; we need to involve them in the creation of proper European social legislation."
"(LT) The first stage of implementation of the objectives of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs has already yielded considerable results: in 2007 3.5 billion posts were created in the EU and the level of unemployment in the period 2005-2007 dropped by 1.6%."
"However, this is just one side of the story."
"In the EU today as many as 14 million working people are living in poverty."
"In addition, the number of people forced to work under temporary contracts or part time has constantly increased."
"Young people in the EU are facing very serious problems too - around 6 million young people leave school early and the employment rate among young people is less than half that in the EU in general."
"I would like to point out that the speed and efficiency of implementation of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs differs greatly in the various Member States."
"I urge the Commission to ensure the consistent implementation of the European Employment Strategy and lifelong learning objectives set out in the EU Youth Programme, the EU Gender Equality Agreement and the EU Disability Action Plan 2006-2007."
"(EL) Mr President, may I now draw attention to two services that need to be strengthened throughout Europe."
"One of them is the advice, information and guidance given to young people and employees of every age to enable them to find suitable employment, education and lifelong learning."
"The other service that should be strengthened throughout Europe in order to promote dignified working conditions is the labour inspectorate."
"Labour inspectorates will be able to deal with unregistered labour, which is the scourge of legitimate employment."
"Employment as well as entrepreneurship and cooperation with the social partners represent perhaps our best hope in the years up to 2010."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the current economic situation in the European Union is improving."
"We are seeing a rise in GDP, new jobs are appearing, the level of employment is rising and the level of unemployment is falling."
"To keep this process going, we need to strengthen social integration, and especially, firstly, to help young people in particular - those just entering the labour market - to find work."
"Secondly, we should make it easier for people in difficult material circumstances to find work; and thirdly, we should give the long-term unemployed a chance."
"These are areas in which more effective support and action on the part of the European Union are needed."
"It is important to adapt the education and training system so that it meets the requirements of the Lisbon Strategy and facilitates economic development, which will in turn have the effect of creating more jobs."
"(DE) Mr President, I believe that small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular play a major role in employment."
"After all, two thirds of our employees work in small- and medium-sized enterprises, which generate 50% of gross national income."
"Therefore, in drawing up our strategies, we should be focusing on promoting continuing vocational training in small- and medium-sized enterprises and creating new opportunities for writing off emerging costs and ensuring that higher net wages will ultimately become possible for our employees."
"Ultimately, we should also create the infrastructure to enable our employees to enjoy job security."
"The European Union could provide a best practice model here."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, strict Parliament rules do not allow me to reply to your speeches in detail."
"However, allow me to thank you for the substantial debate, which analysed many aspects of the labour market and of the European Employment Strategy, and allow me to talk about just a few fundamental issues."
"Firstly, the European Employment Strategy has brought tangible results."
"The current statistics on unemployment and employment are much better than they have been since the 1980s, which is a clear success."
"In your debate you often expressed your worries concerning quality jobs."
"I want to point out that the concept of more jobs and more quality jobs is a part of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment."
"What is the result?"
"Of the millions of new jobs, more than half are full-time jobs and there can be no question marks over their quality."
"Many of the remaining jobs are part-time jobs or fixed-term jobs."
"In my opinion, the hypothesis that none of the fixed-term and part-time jobs is a high-quality job does not hold water."
"It is not tenable."
"Many of these jobs are quality jobs."
"However, there is no doubt that some of these jobs are not quality jobs and this is one of the areas that we must sort out."
"My personal view is that the problem of the working poor, that is, the people who continue to be poor despite having a job, is very worrying and we have to pay more attention to it."
"According to the available data, the working poor account for approximately 8% of the working population, which is a considerable amount."
"We are talking about millions of people and this is a very pressing issue."
"Another issue you debated is the link between employment policies and social inclusion."
"Let me point out that Guideline No 19 puts emphasis on an inclusive labour market and on promoting the inclusion of disadvantaged people in the labour market."
"This is because the Commission recommended in the Strategy that substantial changes should not be made to these Guidelines."
"This is because they have proved to be successful and because it has become clear that in order to ensure good governance, a better balance between European and national level (indeed, most Member States expressed such views), it would be best not to expand the Guidelines."
"On the other hand, it is clear that the text is not cast in stone, that it will continue to develop and that the topics you mentioned are undoubtedly the topics that will require an appropriate response in accordance with future developments."
"I would like to answer another question concerning the application of Article 139 of the Treaty."
"Paradoxically, the collective agreement in the maritime sector will be signed today, and it has already been decided to introduce this collective agreement into European legislation through Article 139."
"In other words, this is a concrete step showing that this article has not been neglected."
"By the way, I see the maritime sector agreement as an extremely important step forward because this is a very complex and highly international sector, and the social partners have managed to achieve a significant amount."
"Of course there were other topics in the debate: the issue of education, the significant number of early school leavers, lifelong learning."
"All these topics are important and to a certain extent will be included in the new social agenda."
"Regarding inclusion, I would like to draw your attention to the Commission communication on active inclusion, which is one of the documents outlining the Commission's strategy in this area."
"Let me stress that although the labour market is the basis for active inclusion, it does not extend to all areas where the application of a coherent inclusion policy is needed."
"Since there are clearly many people who are outside the labour market for natural reasons, such as pensioners or people who find themselves in various unusual circumstances, the inclusion policy must cover more than just the labour market."
"The European labour market strategy clearly has to take this aspect into account."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you once more for the debate, which, in my opinion, covered most of the important topics concerning the European labour market."
"I think that they make a significant contribution to the process of finding a better and more effective balance between the European Employment Strategy and the activities of the individual Member States."
"As I said before, there were many very interesting comments made in the course of the debate but Parliament's rules make it impossible for me to respond to all of them, which is why I responded to only a few."
"rapporteur. - (NL) First and foremost, I should like to thank my fellow Members most warmly for their contribution to this debate."
"I think it is clear that many of you have placed emphasis upon equal opportunities, social inclusion and the quality of work, and I consider that very important."
"I am sorry if I have disappointed some of you by not having included even more of your amendments, but I truly wanted to avoid this report becoming a Christmas tree laden with too much tinsel and too many baubles."
"One more thing, in response to a comment made by Mr Andersson, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I sincerely hope that the submission of this report is not in vain, because, although Article 128 of the Treaty grants this Parliament the right to be consulted, in practice this right is at risk of being undermined."
"I realise, Commissioner, that it is important for the Council to be able to take a decision early in the year, so that the National Reform Plans can be developed with the social partners."
"It strikes me as essential, therefore, that, if Parliament is to be able to continue playing its role, the European Commission suggest proposals earlier in the year, so that the three institutions can fully exercise their role in the process, as provided for in the Treaty."
"Once more, I should like to thank all my fellow Members, and let us hope that the Council is still keeping its ear to the ground."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) According to the latest European Commission reports, 16% of EU citizens are threatened by poverty, and in 8% of such cases this is despite full-time employment."
"Poverty threatens 13% of adult Poles, including those in full time employment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the region of Małopolska, which I represent in the European Parliament, has the lowest level of unemployment in Poland, currently standing at 8%; this does not guarantee a secure standard of living, however, as galloping food and energy prices are pushing many families to the brink of poverty."
"In the neighbouring Świętokrzyskie province, which I also represent in the EP, the situation is verging on the dramatic, with double the unemployment seen in Małopolska."
"Taking just these two provinces as an example, we can observe a growing level of social inequality."
"As Mrs Van Lancker correctly comments in her report on employment guidelines, in the European Union we are faced with a situation in which more than 14 million working people are living in poverty."
"This number could rise very rapidly if we do not modify the Lisbon Strategy to create more and better-quality jobs in the EU."
"This problem concerns the new Member States in particular, where differences in the affluence of citizens are greatest compared to the rest of the Member States."
"in writing. - (PL) Growth and employment are key elements in the Lisbon Strategy."
"The building of a competitive and innovative Europe is linked to changes in the labour market."
"Our companies need workers who are capable of responding to new challenges and the demand for change."
"Of course, I agree that employment should provide stability, security and assurance with regard to what tomorrow will bring."
"At the same time, relations between the employer and the employee should be sufficiently flexible to allow entrepreneurs to make the changes with which they are faced owing to the market situation."
"This is why it is so important for entrepreneurs and employees to ensure that they upgrade their abilities, enhance their skills and improve professionally."
"This is in the interests of businesses, which will acquire skilled and highly motivated employees."
"It is also in the interests of the employees themselves, who, because of their greater competence, will acquire a stronger position at work and, in the event of a need for change, the assurance that, thanks to their skills, they will not have any problems finding their feet in the labour market."
"Finally, I would like to draw attention to the element of mobility in the European market."
"As we know, many Member States are still maintaining restrictions on the employment of citizens from the new Member States."
"This is despite warning from representatives of the business world that there is a shortage of labour in many sectors of the economy."
"As long as restrictions in the European labour market remain in place, the freedom of movement of employees and freedom of movement of services in Europe will only go half-way towards determining the success of our economies."
", in writing. - (RO) The revised Lisbon Strategy has led to positive results."
"Nevertheless, we should examine those fields where it is still necessary to increase the number of actions taken at Community level in order to achieve the employment objective."
"I refer particularly to the problems young people meet during their qualification and entry on the labour market."
"6 million young people across the European Union leave the educational system before they turn 18."
"The fact that, out of the total number of unemployed persons in the European Union, over 40% are young people is just as serious."
"Moreover, most of the young people who manage to enter the labour market benefit of less favourable employment conditions, such as part-time, limited employment or employment based on a contract of supply of services."
"By the legislative guidelines for the employment policy, we have to provide more solutions regarding the programmes and funds the European Union establishes for supporting the action of Member States in this field."
", in writing. - (HU) The Employment Directive provided the Member States of the enlarged European Union with long-term guidelines, and with goals and instruments for enhancing competitiveness and increasing employment in the second cycle of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It has since become clear that an economy cannot be competitive and efficient in a world that has to live with competition, and cannot advance more rapidly than the rest, if it has lost its way in the social desert and is attempting to achieve this while surrounded by people at risk of social exclusion."
"A life of dignity requires decent work; this in turn requires a potential labour force that is appropriately qualified and capable of updating its skills, a labour force that is healthy and protected from discrimination."
"In 2006, the acknowledged needs of the new Member States made it necessary to revise the directive."
"This time the emphasis was placed on people facing particular disadvantages in the labour market, the hopeless labour market situation of older women, the isolation of specific languages, and issues relating to the employment of Roma people."
"Over the past two years, the number of jobs has risen, employment ratios have improved, and the turbulent employment indicators have also settled down."
"The increase in jobs of the classic sort - full-time, contractually protected employment in a workplace - has been relatively slow, while there has been a massive increase in part-time, seasonal work and work carried out on the basis of supply contracts."
"In this changed situation, we do not dispute that the era of dogmatic labour legislation is over."
"Extensive and intensive economic development needs flexible legislative provisions that prevent relativism in labour law and the devaluation of social partnership and collective bargaining agreements."
"Progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU (the transposition of Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC)."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank the other groups for their cooperation, particularly some of the shadows."
"I believe that working together we have achieved a good report."
"I have looked in this report at the transposition and implementation of the current directives, in other words the Employment Directive and the Race Directive."
"I have concentrated more on the Employment Directive, because race was covered by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in a very good report last year."
"Transposition and implementation is patchy across the EU, especially with the Employment Directive, although there are problems with the Race Directive as well."
"There is also a lack of information given to citizens about possible remedies in case of discrimination."
"The Commission, Member States, trade unions, as well as governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, must do all in their power to improve awareness of rights under these directives and Member States must adequately resource independent bodies to promote equality and encourage Member States to ensure the remit of those bodies covers all forms of discrimination."
"Too often the individual victims of discrimination are the ones who are left to challenge discrimination on their own, without the back-up of advocacy support or indeed the legal wherewithal to take legal proceedings, and that has to change."
"Member States should ensure that victims of discrimination are automatically assured and assisted in legal proceedings."
"Although I welcome the statistics that the Commission has already gathered on discrimination, I believe we need more data and a common standard for collecting that data."
"I welcome the Commission's interest in multiple discrimination and that is one of the reasons why I call in my report for comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation."
"We must get away from the piecemeal approach."
"There can be no hierarchy of discrimination."
"A new directive must cover discrimination and access to goods and services on all grounds that have not been covered as yet under Article 13 legislation."
"It should cover disability, age, religion or belief and sexual orientation."
"Race and gender are already covered, as is employment."
"I regret that although Commissioner Špidla has committed himself to this and the Commission made the commitment to a horizontal directive in its work programme for 2008 - and I commend Commissioner Špidla particularly for this - there appears to be some backtracking on this within the Commission."
"Can the Commission tell us at what stage are the impact assessments, what they cover, and when they will be released?"
"As I understand it, they are now saying that they might only bring forward legislation on disability and nothing else."
"That is not acceptable, hence our amendment."
"I have campaigned for years for Article 13 legislation on grounds of disability and on grounds of age, but I am now convinced that we must not leave anyone behind. Anti-discrimination and human rights are the basis of the European Union and every EU citizen must be treated equally."
"I urge you to vote for my report and more importantly for a comprehensive directive on anti-discrimination so we can give a signal to those in the Commission who do not agree with this, and the Member States, that we are committed as a Parliament at least to ending discrimination once and for all, and end the ridiculous idea that it is alright to discriminate against any one section of our society."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Lynne for her detailed and topical report."
"The Commission fully agrees with its content."
"The Commission supports unequivocally the calls for the complete transposition of Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC."
"As you know, the Commission has initiated a number of legal proceedings involving some Member States because of non-compliance with legislation, and it will not hesitate to make use of its competences to ensure that EU legislation is rigorously complied with in the future, and to achieve a fast and systematic improvement in cases where this legislation has not yet been implemented."
"The Commission also acknowledges that monitoring of the implementation of both Directives must be improved."
"Therefore, the Commission is currently working on programmes to improve the recording of cases of discrimination."
"The truly important issue is the real impact on individuals, not just an abstract image of how things might work."
"The report also rightly underlines the fundamental role of the institutions in supporting equal treatment: they play a key role in monitoring, providing support for victims and improving awareness of rights."
"I would like to stress the crucial importance of the non-governmental sector in this area."
"The Commission supports an expansion of the role of the institutions and the role of the non-governmental sector in such a way that would cover discrimination on grounds other than ethnic origin and gender."
"As stated in the Commission's Work Programme for 2008, I intend to table an amendment based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty, which would extend the existing protection against discrimination to areas outside the labour market."
"This will be included in the broader programme for opportunities, attitudes and solidarity that is due to be adopted at the end of June."
"Lively political discussions are taking place about the need for further anti-discrimination legislation at EU level."
"Let us be clear: these discussions are not about whether or not to combat discrimination but rather about how to do it in the most effective manner."
"Considering the political sensitivity of this issue and the far from forthcoming attitude of some Member States, the ground must be prepared very carefully."
"During the seminar of 29 April, held ahead of the launch of the renewed social agenda, we agreed that we needed more in-depth analyses before making a decision on the best course of action."
"Whatever the Commission's decision in the next few weeks, it will be a decision based on a detailed analysis."
"It will take into account all aspects of multiple discrimination and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Most importantly, it will be designed to bring real benefits to those who need it."
"In conclusion, I would like to mention that as a follow-up to the European Year of Equal Opportunities, the Commission plans to present a communication adopting concrete measures to improve protection against discrimination in the European Union."
"Together with this communication, the Commission will also publish a report on how EU policies contribute to improving the situation of the Roma people."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs as well as on behalf of my political group, for her excellent work and this excellent report."
"Unfortunately, discrimination still remains one of the most significant and widespread human rights problems in the European Union."
"As to anti-discrimination directives already in force, I would like to stress that they provide for only minimum standards."
"It is a shameful situation that a number of Member States have not transposed and implemented even those minimum standards."
"We think the European Commission should use the infringement procedure against such Member States more actively."
"Everyone in the Union must be sure that he or she cannot be discriminated against and that he or she has effective legal tools in order to fight against discrimination."
"The Member States and the Commission should also actively support awareness-raising and training for combating discrimination."
"Another problem, as we have just heard today, makes me even more anxious."
"It is that we really need a comprehensive legal framework for combating discrimination."
"As far as I understood from the statement of the Commissioner, we cannot be sure just now that the work programme declared by the Commission for 2008, which we have welcomed very much, with the proposal for a directive implementing the principle of equal treatment outside employment on all grounds, will provide this."
"For me it would be a real shock if the Commission excluded some grounds from the scope of protection."
"It would mean that we can easily give up our values and, as soon as the Year of Equal Opportunities is over, we again feel free to treat Europeans differently."
"We cannot allow this."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, opposing discrimination is a fundamental human value; in this regard there is no difference of opinion among us."
"The European People's Party attaches particular importance to anti-discrimination policy."
"It is our belief that Member States have an incontrovertible and unavoidable responsibility to ensure that not a single citizen of the European Union faces discrimination."
"The Group is also aware that not all problems, unfortunately, can be resolved by means of legislation."
"In order gradually to put an end to discrimination, we need an appropriate political culture, we need tolerance in daily life, in the workplace, in public life, in communications, from national to local level, and we need the whole of civil society to pull together."
"As practice has shown, implementing the European directives on discrimination is no easy task."
"Half of the Member States have not managed to transpose the directives adequately into their national legislation or apply them appropriately."
"It is a fact that a real gap exists in European legislation between Article 13 of the EC Treaty and the existing directives."
"This means that not all 'protected' groups, in other words those referred to in Article 13, are guaranteed equal rights under European law with regard to access to goods and services."
"To bridge this gap, however, the European People's Party does not believe the solution lies in adopting a comprehensive directive that would be difficult to implement and inefficient."
"Instead, it feels that a European directive is needed as a matter of urgency to help in a non-hierarchical manner to end discrimination against the 84 million disabled people who live in Europe, so that people living with a disability can enjoy the same rights throughout the EU."
"Bearing in mind the fact that the average lifespan of the population is increasing and age-related chronic illness often results in damage to a person's health, the number of people living with a disability is set to increase in future."
"We are convinced that this approach will provide more effective, practical help to people living with a disability."
"The Group would therefore support an initiative of the European Commission with this aim."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Mrs Lynne's excellent report is based on the responsibility that derives from the presence in our midst of the phenomenon of negative discrimination."
"Not only has it not disappeared from the Europe of Excellence; according to the Eurobarometer survey it is on the increase, and Europe's citizens can sense this."
"I would also like to add that enlargement has brought with it a rise in new forms of discrimination threat, such as those facing multiply disadvantaged people; discrimination against the Roma is becoming increasingly violent nowadays."
"The majority of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted in favour of adopting a horizontal directive."
"We all remember the traces of mistrust in Parliament towards the newly formed Commission, a mistrust that became the majority opinion due to one nominee's avowed views on discrimination."
"The Commission at that time promised that it would take action on the basis of the authority conferred on it under Article 13 of the EC Treaty to introduce legislation against all forms of discrimination and establish a legal basis for dealing with infringements."
"It is also a matter of urgency for the Commission to assess the transposition of existing European Union legislation by Member States, and also to initiate infringement procedures for non-transposition of the existing directives."
"As far as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is concerned, it is unacceptable for any sort of hierarchy to be established, whether in the EC Treaty or in the prohibitions relating to discrimination that are to be listed in the amendment to the Lisbon Treaty."
"The question of who suffers the most - people living with a disability, gay people or older people - is not one we are prepared to address."
"As far as we are concerned, the proposal in Mrs Lynne's report is a potential legal solution; in other words we await a general, horizontal directive from the Commission, although of course this does not rule out, indeed will make necessary, the formulation of specific provisions for different sectors and other cases."
"It is my belief that this is also in accord with the views of European citizens who are, or may become, victims of discrimination."
"Thank you very much."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lynne, your work and your commitment on this key dossier have been remarkable."
"I was one of the first people from our group to witness this within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and I thank you warmly."
"A protective law only works if it is effectively applied."
"That is why, Mrs Lynne, I share your concern about the poor implementation of directives prohibiting discrimination in certain Member States."
"These situations are unacceptable and should be the subject of forceful, deliberate action by the Commission."
"No indulgence can be tolerated in this area."
"A protective law is also worthless unless it can actually be used by those it is designed to protect."
"That is why I believe, as you do, that we need to make sure that the victims of discrimination do indeed have access to information and to the means for defending themselves."
"That is the responsibility of the Member States, and there again, negligence should not be tolerated."
"However, although your report represents a key step, this is mainly because of the comprehensive approach to discrimination you speak up for."
"I unreservedly support your request for a comprehensive directive to combat all forms of discrimination."
"Like you, I am convinced that a unified approach is essential, taking account of all grounds for discrimination."
"Article 13 is not a call for lack of action or for uncoordinated action, but an invitation to act."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, put away your fears and theoretical debates."
"Proposing a comprehensive directive is a necessity and is plain common sense."
"There is a large majority of us here that believes this and is asking you, Commissioner, to listen."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, we too welcome the Lynne report and fully support the commitment to a comprehensive directive and see this as part of the cultural shift that Mrs Bauer referred to."
"But we can hear the eggshells cracking as the Commission tries to edge forward on this and we urge the Commission to be really brave and really lead on this issue."
"For us we think it is important to have comprehensive legislation."
"For example, it would remove some of the loopholes by which racists and xenophobes try and exploit religious discrimination in order to cover their racist attitudes."
"It is important that we get rid of some of those arbitrary cut-off points, for screening and health care for example, on grounds of age rather than evidence-based."
"And we can fully support the rapporteur in her desire for a proactive approach in people being made aware of their rights and being able to access them."
"Through the need for effective legal aid and strong independent bodies."
"We therefore welcome this report and support it in its current form."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Lynne on a very hands-on report on this important subject."
"I am, however, a little taken aback at the language in which it is expressed, which reminds me a little of the language of totalitarianism."
"Had I not known that the rapporteur was a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Demonstrate for Europe, I would have thought that this report had been drawn up by someone from the Communist side."
"In my view it is dangerous to go into detail, as has been done here, and to spell out which types of discrimination should not be allowed, and how we should behave; there should simply be no discrimination."
"Mankind established all of its orders and prohibitions in the Ten Commandments, and they are spelled out there in succinct form: thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery."
"We should just say: thou shalt not discriminate, and leave the rest to the sensitivity and competence of human groups and Member States."
"I do, however, consider this report acceptable, assuming that Amendment 7 by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is accepted."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, Liz Lynnes's report highlights the need for a comprehensive, legislative framework which would prevent discrimination outside of the workplace and which would include a wide range of subjects."
"Millions of people are discriminated against - the elderly as well as other groups - everyday in the European Union as they try to access health, education and transport services or try to buy insurance or apply for a loan."
"These same groups had difficulties as regards employment before the introduction of stronger legislation at the European level."
"Effective legislation at European Union level changed employers' attitudes."
"It was a European directive which forced Member States to try to end discrimination in employment - although there is still a lot work to be done yet."
"Comprehensive legislation must be undertaken at a European level in order to strengthen people's rights in terms of goods and services."
"I would like to praise the rapporteur for her report and I would like to ask my fellow members to vote against amendments which weaken the protection of human rights."
"Mr President, for the past nine years I have sat in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs alongside my most distinguished UK West Midlands colleague, the current rapporteur Elizabeth Lynne."
"Almost without exception we have found ourselves in agreement on pretty well every issue without any need to negotiate compromise amendments because we already had a close meeting of minds."
"I suppose to any rule there has to be an exception and to my intense surprise, this report is just that."
"It is frankly most disappointing that in our view political posturing seems to have got in the way of addressing the real problem."
"May I say straight away, before some others on the left get up to their usual distortions, that all of us on the centre-right abhor discrimination in all its forms."
"All of us on the centre-right want to find practical ways of helping to stamp it out, and indeed would support, in principle, a specific directive to help people with disabilities as currently being considered by the Commission."
"But we are very clear that a 'comprehensive and broad' EU directive against discrimination which is essentially an open-ended invitation to the Commission to produce yet more 'one-size fits all' EU legislation in what is a very sensitive area will do little to address current difficulties and could even be counterproductive."
"We have tabled our own amendments to reinforce this point."
"Whilst some aspects of ongoing discrimination may indeed still be a problem, to suggest that more general EU legislation is somehow a solution is, in our view, way off the mark."
"Existing EU laws on discrimination continue to prove difficult to implement in practice."
"There needs to be better implementation of existing laws and better understanding of the problems in implementation before we go down the road of yet more EU directives."
"As one UK organisation put it most succinctly last week, most discrimination is not going to be solved by extra legislation."
"Time would be much better spent on multicultural, multifaith events that change perceptions."
"We agree with this."
"May I thank the Commission for his thoughtful opening remarks and say how much we look forward to the Commission response in due course."
"Mr President, I think Philip Bushill-Matthews' criticism underlines just how good Elizabeth Lynne's report is!"
"I think she is to be congratulated."
"She has done a very good job of underlining the poor level of implementation and transposition of the two directives adopted back in the year 2000 on risk and discrimination in employment."
"But back then, Commissioner, you and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs here recognised that discrimination does not stop at the office or factory wall."
"We recognised then the need to act more broadly to introduce a horizontal directive to combat all forms of discrimination throughout the whole of society."
"You publicly stated that you supported that idea; your President, President Barroso, publicly committed himself to such a horizontal directive."
"We are therefore very disturbed to hear that back-pedalling is going on inside the Commission, reconsideration, perhaps a focus only on disability."
"I am hearing that three possible options are being considered in the Commission at the moment: the horizontal directive, which is still alive; secondly, a specific directive on disability or, the third possibility, a directive on disability and one other form of discrimination."
"Where the logic is in that final option I just do not know."
"We need a strong advocate right now, Commissioner, for that horizontal directive that you committed yourself to."
"As Elizabeth Lynne said, there can be no hierarchy of forms of discrimination within the European Union."
"All European Union citizens are equal and need to be dealt with as such."
"We cannot tolerate any discrimination on any grounds against any section of our Community."
"I heard it said at a meeting last week in Brussels, and you hinted at it yourself today, Commissioner, and Philip Bushill-Matthews did so just now, that we should not act because infringement proceedings have been launched against a number of Member States for failure to comply with the earlier directives."
"We cannot take that line of argument."
"We cannot allow Member States to force us to act at the speed of the slowest in terms of implementation and then enforcement."
"You, Commissioner, have the right of initiative."
"You need to exercise that right."
"We need to act rigorously."
"You need to act rigorously to ensure full compliance and not allow Member States to enter into a conspiracy that would cause us to move at the speed of the slowest."
"We also need to focus clear attention on the need for remedies and enforcement, strong remedies to make sure that Member States do indeed comply fully with those directives agreed back in the year 2000."
"I fully commend Elizabeth Lynne's report."
"I would like to pause for a moment to welcome, on behalf of all of us here in Parliament, the various visitor groups in the gallery."
"Let us continue with the debate."
"Mr President, in 2004, this European Commission got the green light of the European Parliament only upon the solemn promise to be the champion of fundamental rights."
"But paying lip-service to equality is not good enough."
"EU citizens must get the legal instruments to defend their rights in court."
"Now, the European Commission is frantically looking for excuses to avoid a general ban on discrimination, such as that more study is needed - as if we cannot all see that there is discrimination all around - or that there is no consensus in the Council - well, that never stopped the European Commission from pushing its proposals in other areas such as energy policy."
"And let us not forget that discrimination is already forbidden on the basis of the Treaties, but if we do not legislate the courts will do it for us."
"So I expect the European Commission to take its own responsibility and stand for the rights of European citizens, because if the horizontal directive must fail, then let it fail in Council and not in the Commission."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs in 't Veld has said it clearly and I can only point out once again: we need the framework directive in order to grant everyone the same protection against discrimination."
"It is not acceptable that homosexuals or the elderly, for example, are allowed fewer human rights than people from a migrant background."
"We must end this situation as a matter of real urgency."
"Moreover, I can but remind you once again that Mr Barroso himself promised here - when he was canvassing for Parliament's approval of the Commission - to launch this framework directive."
"As a German I have to say that I find the conduct of the German Government cynical."
"There is a law in Germany that protects all attributes equally, but the government is leading a campaign here at European level against the framework directive without any plausible reasons."
"In my view this is sheer populism at the expense of human rights."
"(NL) Mr President, the fight against discrimination, whether on the basis of religion, gender or disability, is one of the pillars on which the European stands."
"That policy is laid down in all of our Treaties and in legislation."
"With regard to the fight against direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of gender, that policy has proved a complete success in the European Union."
"We can now test the situation against the directives and treaties and subsequently establish that, despite having the most complex legislative process in the world, the policy is not functioning well."
"You then have a choice of two courses."
"The course of the opposition is for us to introduce a new, broadly based strategy and solve the problems in that way."
"I do not think that it can be done this way."
"This was evidenced by the legislation of 2000, under which infringement procedures were instituted against 10 Member States, including the Netherlands, owing to lack of clarity in the functioning of certain provisions in their legislation on equal treatment."
"New, broadly based legislation will not help either, therefore, meaning that it will all continue to be just talk."
"We should therefore increasingly focus upon mentality and on action programmes, and ensure that discrimination, even indirect discrimination, no longer takes place."
"We must ensure that implementation improves, and then we shall also have to find a solution to the problems that can be formulated clearly, namely those of persons with disabilities."
"I wholeheartedly endorse the plea of Mrs Bauer and that of a number of Members from our group, therefore, and hope that our splendid legislative framework is now actually going to be put into practice. Thank you very much."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Lynne for her report; it comes just at the right time."
"A word to all Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: wage discrimination against women has been included in the Treaty for the last 40 years, yet, nothing has essentially changed."
"If you in the PPE-DE Group wish to abide by your rejection of a horizontal directive, it is very clear to me that your values and principles relate to fine words and celebrations in the European Union."
"You do not want equal treatment at all!"
"You accept discrimination against gays and lesbians, for example."
"You want this to be a political culture."
"No, that will not do for me!"
"Equal opportunities encompass all the criteria of Article 13, and multiple discrimination ultimately has to be included, too."
"Anti-discrimination policy can only be credible if it itself does not discriminate further."
"There has been a flood of proceedings and actions in the European Union."
"This was all propaganda aimed at avoiding certain minimum standards."
"The Member States that have stopped short of this just have to make haste."
"Infringement procedures have been initiated, even against my own country, Germany."
"I now appeal to the Commission, to each individual Commissioner, to state clearly that they are in favour of a clear horizontal directive and putting paid to a hierarchic arrangement of human rights in the European Union."
"We have to implement our EU policy in accordance with the Treaty."
"Article 13 is part of the Treaty and must therefore encompass all this, as stated in the Lynne report."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Lynne for her work."
"Parliament is about to call again for a horizontal directive."
"It will be the ninth time, Commissioner Špidla, that it has done this."
"Since Parliament is requesting exactly this step for the ninth time, we would have expected greater clarity in the Chamber from the Commission today, partly because this represents a commitment from President Barroso, and partly because we believe in the impact assessment process which is under way."
"Frankly, this idea of some Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats opposing a horizontal directive is incomprehensible."
"In the past, the left was justifiably criticised for wanting to divide society into corporations and corporate representation."
"It seems, however, that this is just what you are trying to do now: the disabled, yes, because this is more politically correct; other forms of discrimination, no, let us wait."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is not here, but the left is also sometimes fond of saying that it takes more than laws to change attitudes."
"This time around, we are hearing it from members of the PPE-DE Group."
"Let us talk about individual rights and about how we must not play one corporation, one minority off against another, but ensure non-discrimination for all citizens."
"This makes sense, and this is what we are asking you to do."
"Quite frankly we do not need measures biased more towards one category than another."
"EU citizens do not need this."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed on one thing: we are against any form of discrimination."
"I should like to clarify this right at the outset."
"However, there are different approaches to reaching this objective."
"I am of the opinion that protection against discrimination cannot conclusively be better regulated at European level than at national level."
"Here, too, we are expected to comply with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Many areas of life are currently regulated by EU anti-discrimination regulations."
"Four anti-discrimination directives have been adopted in recent years: the Race Directive, the Employment Directive, the Equal Treatment Directive and the Gender Directive."
"A multitude of infringement proceedings are currently in progress against Member States on account of problems in transposing the Treaty."
"Strictly speaking, they are even now in progress against 20 countries, that is three quarters of the EU Member States."
"It appears there is considerable legal uncertainty here."
"A new, broad and over-simplifying approach in the form of a framework directive is the wrong response to the legal uncertainties that exist here."
"The current problems first have to be examined before the Commission proposes new directives."
"Otherwise, the result otherwise will be more bureaucracy, more costs to citizens and less legal clarity, which benefits no one, particularly not the fight against discrimination. For this reason I, like my group, am against the articles in the Lynne report that call for a framework directive, a horizontal directive."
"If the other groups assert themselves, however, and the demand for a framework directive persists, I see myself being forced to vote against the report, not because I am against protecting against discrimination, but because a framework directive at European level is the wrong way, in my opinion."
"In the field of disability, all Member States as well as the European Community have signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"Here we must and shall fulfil our obligations."
"We shall not, however, help anyone by adopting yet another unclear and wishy-washy framework directive."
"Mr President, when I was this Parliament's co-rapporteur for the Race Directive in 2000, the then Portuguese Presidency promised us there would be no hierarchy of discrimination and that further legislation would follow."
"On 26 October 2004 President Barroso promised in this Parliament and during this Commission's term of office a framework directive on - I quote - 'all forms of discrimination'."
"That promise was repeated in their annual policy strategy for 2008."
"Now is the time to deliver."
"I would say that it is no excuse that Member States in some cases deliberately drag their feet on implementation of employment non-discrimination, but it is an excuse, and the Commission must not allow the slowest to dictate the speed of the rest."
"Two weeks ago I met with Federal Minister Zypries in Germany and Minister Follett in Britain."
"They are willing to talk."
"Give them something to talk about!"
"I am proud that we collected 1.3 million signatures for disability legislation."
"But as this Parliament's president of the Disability Intergroup, I place on record my support for a horizontal directive."
"You will not divide and rule."
"Finally, it is no good for the Conservatives to say that they abhor discrimination on the grounds of religion, age or sexual orientation, but then to vote against legislation on these grounds, denying equal rights to Europeans, gay, young and old and to religious minorities."
"And Business Europe should be ashamed of saying in its submission to the Commission consultation dated 12 October 2007, I quote: 'Business Europe believes there is no evidence of discrimination on any of the grounds covered by Article 13'."
"The Commission's own Business Test Panel showed 89% of the 293 companies surveyed said they wanted EU legislation for equal protection. They want it;"
"Parliament will vote for it; Europe needs it."
"(Applause from the centre and left)"
"(DE) Mr President, I thank Mrs Lynne for spending time on the subject of anti-discrimination and I am completely on her side up to a certain point."
"However, dear Mrs Lynne, Mrs Schroedter, Mrs Gröner and Mrs in 't Veld, you mean well, but you are not doing yourselves any favours in the end if you are now calling for another directive against discrimination that goes beyond what we already have in Europe."
"I say this quite deliberately and quite bluntly here as a homosexual: you are not doing the people you want to protect any favours."
"There will ultimately be a far-reaching anti-discrimination regulation against the people whom you want to protect here."
"How can this be?"
"If we extend anti-discrimination to access to goods and services and to a shifting of the burden of proof, we will create a climate of concealed discrimination."
"Very few employers will be openly willing to discuss discrimination."
"Job applicants who represent a potential risk, perhaps because of their passport photograph, will no longer be contacted by the employer in case of doubt."
"We are not doing people any favours in the end."
"We ought instead to be worrying about the fact that the anti-discrimination directive we have today is being changed and watching to see how it pans out."
"If we generate a tangled mass of bureaucracy and lawsuits as well as legal uncertainty, the acceptance of anti-discrimination regulations will decline among people in the European Union."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have so much time that I hope I can use it properly, accustomed as I am to speaking for only a minute."
"I heard my colleague Mr Bushill-Matthews say that he always finds himself in agreement with Mrs Lynne, and that to any rule there has to be an exception, but that this time his position is completely different."
"I must say to my dear friend Mr Bushill-Matthews that we too always find ourselves in agreement, but this time, without wishing to betray our traditional convergence on all decisions, I have to say that you are faced with an exception, because I am absolutely in favour of the proposal for a horizontal directive referred to the Commission by Mrs Lynne."
"How could I not be in favour when for the past 40 years I have seen citizens in Italy, where I live, being discriminated against on the grounds of their age, elderly people being deprived of their rights simply because they are elderly?"
"I am particularly referring to the fact that there is a law in Italy which says that the disabled, if they are young, are entitled to benefits, whereas if they are elderly, and have the same disabilities, they are not entitled to these benefits."
"I do not see how we can wait for years before we have the legal possibility, as Mrs in't Veld explained, of using the courts to enforce respect for the rights that Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam grants to all citizens of the European Union."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, European unity is based not only on the economy but also on many important values."
"These values include the inviolability of human dignity, liberty, responsibility, solidarity, diversity, and the observance of the principle of freedom from discrimination."
"They also include tolerance and mutual respect."
"Alongside the statements of policy, it is important that these principles should be laid down in law in such a way as to ensure that distinctions can no longer be made on a discriminatory basis, and that people are comprehensively protected."
"The European project will only be viable if we are able to ensure that disadvantaged groups in society are able to exercise their rights."
"Comprehensive integration of these groups is in our common interest, and we must take appropriate measures to ensure that it happens."
"It is thus in the interests of every Member State to ensure that all of the provisions of EC Directives 2000/43 and 2000/78 are transposed accurately and effectively in their entirety and implemented appropriately in practice, so that the transposition of the directives into national law will genuinely benefit disadvantaged groups."
"The legislation is only of value if it is also implemented in practice."
"Monitoring implementation of the legislation is an especially important task, and one that needs to be given particular attention at both Member State and Community level."
"We need to devise inspection mechanisms that will enable us to conduct impact studies."
"We must involve non-governmental organisations that can provide concrete feedback, and engage in social dialogue with them."
"I am convinced that Mr Barroso believed what he said in 2004, at the start of his term in office."
"May he continue to do so."
"Mr President, I wish to comment on two aspects of this excellent report by Elizabeth Lynne."
"I fully support the call to Member States and other relevant actors to collect, compile and publish comprehensive, accurate, comparable, reliable and separate statistics on discrimination and then to publish these statistics in a way that is easily understood by the public."
"In that way, I believe citizens can see for themselves the need for change."
"I fully support the call for a comprehensive, wide-ranging directive."
"This is an area where the EU can achieve strategic change when the legislation is implemented."
"Finally, with reference to the Lisbon Treaty, I was very pleased to hear the comments of the Slovenian presidency last week on the 2008 work programme with regard to their response for the 'One Million Signatures for Disability' campaign."
"This indicates that the presidency, and hopefully the Commission, are listening to the citizens and taking their concerns on board."
"This is a very hopeful sign for the Citizens' Initiative as contained in the Lisbon Treaty, but again I wish to put on record my strong support for a comprehensive directive."
"There can be no hierarchy of discrimination."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the work accomplished by Mrs Lynne."
"I must say that this debate comes at an interesting time for Europe."
"I would like the Commission and yourself, Commissioner, to have the full awareness that you seem to be lacking at the moment."
"This issue does not just concern progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in terms of employment and working conditions; the central issue is the need for a horizontal directive on equal treatment which covers all grounds for discrimination."
"A climate of intolerance and hostility is emerging in Europe."
"This is already giving rise to ethnic discrimination - just look at immigration and the Roma."
"Heaven help us if we turn a blind eye."
"This is why there is an urgent need for a comprehensive directive covering all discrimination in order to complete the anti-discrimination package under Article 13 of the Treaty."
"It will also help to improve the level of cross-cultural encounters in Europe; such encounters improve the quality of culture and are cogent, and are urgently needed now."
"This is why I say to you, Commissioner, and to the Commission, show a bit more political courage, because so far there has been absolutely none!"
"(PL) Mr President, employment is one of the main factors in social integration."
"Nevertheless, unemployment among numerous groups, especially women, disabled people, ethnic minorities, migrants, the elderly and young people entering the labour market, remains at an unacceptably high level."
"The fact that in some Member States substantial defects may be seen in the transposition and implementation of Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC, and a lack of information aimed at EU citizens concerning the possibility of taking legal steps in the event of discrimination, are cause for concern."
"It is important for the governments of the Member States to take down the barriers arising from discrimination in labour market recruitment processes as soon as possible."
"Public agencies have a key role to play in promoting equality and non-discrimination, since, pursuant to Article 13 of the EC Treaty, Member States should ensure full, proper and effective transposition and appropriate implementation of these directives, so that the battle against discrimination in the European Union is of the nature of actions that are coordinated and compliant with a consolidated approach to combating discrimination."
"(BG) Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, the adoption and implementation of comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the European Union Member States is a tangible achievement and it is indicative of how sensitive a society is respecting the principles of equal treatment of all citizens, regardless of their ethnic origin, faith, gender, age, health or financial condition."
"I support the appeal which Mrs. Lynne makes in her report to adopt a comprehensive directive free of any hierarchy of anti-discrimination principles."
"We should, however, take note that in Europe discrimination against individuals who belong to ethnic or religious minorities remains the most frequent form of infringement against their fundamental right to be treated equally like the rest of the citizens from majority groups."
"In certain Member States hatred speech, islamophobia and other forms of xenophobia, fueled by stereotypes, prejudice and cliches from the past drive a latent discrimination attitude toward ethnic or religious minorities."
"That is why the European Parliament shown make a point of drawing the attention of the Commission and the Member States...."
"(Metin Kazak was interrupted by the President)"
"(DE) Mr President, we are all very much in agreement that every conceivable measure has to be taken against discrimination."
"Therefore, the European Parliament has also repeatedly declared itself in favour of adopting a new directive."
"There are already four such directives and one is virtually complete at draft stage."
"This means we are covering a very broad spectrum in anti-discrimination measures."
"These measures will now finally be implemented."
"There are 28 infringement proceedings, which means the appeal is going out to the Member States ultimately to implement what has been decided here in this House."
"I am against taking a second step immediately before the first has been taken, namely adopting another new directive with a wealth of new barriers where equality authorities are being demanded."
"This again means more bureaucracy."
"The fact that NGOs must by law be included in all legislation does not get us any further forward with consultation etc."
"If we advocate anti-discrimination, then we have to argue in favour of implementing what is currently the law once and for all in the Member States."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to comment on unacceptable discrimination against pregnant women, especially in view of the demographic collapse in Europe."
"Despite legal prohibitions, employers are demanding that young women applying for jobs present medical confirmation that they are not pregnant."
"If they fail to produce such a certificate, their chances of obtaining work vanish."
"This is a difficult but necessary field of action for the work inspectorate."
"Families with many children also experience discrimination."
"The average income per person in such families is usually significantly lower than in the families of single mothers."
"On the other hand, family benefits and social assistance are usually less in their case, and taxes are higher."
"Normally, when people speak of discrimination, they do not address these problems."
"(RO) Waiting for a horizontal directive, we can see that we have a European and a national legislation against discrimination, numerous political commitments, as well as specific institutional mechanisms."
"Despite this optimistic appearance, the degree of transposition, the implementation and the efficiency of adopted measures are still very low in many Member States."
"For achieving equality between men and women, a correctly paid job is essential."
"Thus, we propose that the Commission initiate an integrated plan of positive actions for the labour market in order to reduce the artificial gender division on the labour market and the structural pay gaps that still exist between the branches deemed feminine and those deemed masculine."
"In this plan, introducing the gender dimension into the drafting of the European, national and local budgets represents an essential instrument for reducing structural gaps and implementing the principle of equal pay for equal work."
"Mr President, when the rapporteur spoke she said that every EU citizen must be treated equally."
"Sadly, the rapporteur herself seems not to believe that."
"If she did, then this report would cry out against the fact that this EU, through a derogation, authorises discrimination on religious grounds in my constituency of Northern Ireland; specifically discrimination against Protestants who want to join the Police Service in Northern Ireland."
"Yes, in this EU there is express religious discrimination, sanctioned in that way."
"So when I listen to the high-sounding affirmations against discrimination I think of many young Protestant constituents who wanted to join the police, scored higher than Roman Catholic applicants, but who saw those people appointed over their heads because discrimination is statutory, provided for in legislation."
"So, until we get horizontal application against discrimination..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ET) Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, equality in the eyes of the law and protection against discrimination is everyone's human right - that much is asserted in the constitutions of our Member States, all of the Member States."
"Nevertheless our citizens are not exempt from discrimination."
"For example, generic equality of rights in employment is regulated under Community law; we have, however, placed a lesser emphasis on compliance with its implementation."
"How else can we explain Eurostat's annual public studies which show large discrepancies between men's and women's pay in the Member States?"
"In my home country, Estonia, the gap is 27% to women's disadvantage."
"This is where it stood over ten years ago, and where it still stands today."
"Ensuring protection of this right is just as important as judicial regulation of the matter."
"We must deal with this point and if necessary institute legal proceedings for violation."
"What our citizens need is legal certainty."
"Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs Lynne on this directive because, in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which aims to promote mutual understanding and celebrate Europe's diversity, I am shocked and dismayed at the levels of existing discrimination - not just in race but in disabilities, gender, sexual orientation and ageing."
"Discrimination is not just a problem in the labour market but also in housing, education, public and private services and even in religious matters."
"I am particularly concerned about the difference in levels of integration of minorities within various Member States as indicated by the Migrant Policy Index."
"This shows the failure of the implementation and enforcement of the minimum standards in anti-discrimination that we have sought to make EU-wide."
"I call upon the Commission to take up this matter, not just with the Member States, but also to take stronger action within the EU institutions."
"Finally, prior to the European elections, I would like to ask how this House is trying to set an example to the rest of Europe on anti-discrimination."
"Still only 30% of the MEPs are women and only 9 MEPs are non-white."
"(DE) Mr President, what is effective against discrimination and supports the protection of people with disabilities?"
"Awareness-raising campaigns, information, action, but not the centralising of legal issues through new EU legislation."
"A paper tiger instead of a comprehensive horizontal directive perhaps?"
"It is important to implement the four existing directives."
"Only in Germany have training courses that were required as part of the general Equality Act cost over EUR 1.7 billion a year."
"I think the Civil Rights Act is right."
"It provides regulations for firms with 15 employees or more and a high administrative and financial cost is avoided - an SME protection clause is appropriate."
"Moreover, I think it is important that our doubts, which Mrs Lynne was unfortunately still not able to dispel because she has not taken our amendments into account, are becoming clear: we cannot vote in favour of this report, which states that public money should be used to support victims of discrimination."
"Mrs Lynne should have listened to us here, but unfortunately she did not do so."
"(CS) I would like to mention two issues."
"The first one is transport."
"Approximately one third of the EU population suffer from mobility problems."
"In order to give people equal opportunities regarding access to information, work and so on, significant efforts are needed to introduce a barrier-free transport standard."
"The other issue concerns mentally handicapped people."
"I think it would be useful to review the White Paper on mental health protection, because a vast number of people in the European Union suffer from stress, which also represents a disadvantage for people adapting to situations on the labour market."
"On a point of order, Mr President, I recognise that I have not been called to speak, but what Mr Allister said about discrimination against Protestants in the police force in Northern Ireland is totally untrue."
"The force is 90% a Protestant organisation ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the debate showed the significance of combating discrimination."
"The first issue on which practically everyone agreed is the need for more effective implementation of the legislation in all the Member States."
"As the debate showed, the Commission is very rigorous in this regard and does not hesitate to initiate infraction proceedings against those countries that have not implemented the legislation in full."
"However, simple numerical statistics do not give the full picture since these numbers include various types of infraction proceedings, from technical and organisational proceedings to those dealing with the scope of protection."
"At any rate, I can safely say that all countries with which we are engaged in a debate are ready, and that there can be no doubt about their willingness to fully implement the anti-discrimination Directives."
"The next issue is the question of further progress with regard to legislation."
"I stated clearly that the Commission has reached the final stage in deciding on what conclusive action to take."
"This stage will end by June this year and we will present the relevant proposals."
"The debate now taking place in Parliament is certainly an important source in the decision-making process."
"Allow me also to touch on two speeches that contrasted with the more general debate by introducing a slightly unusual argument."
"One of them was the information that an anti-discrimination course in the Federal Republic of Germany cost EUR 1.7 billion."
"I do not contest this figure."
"I think that it might be quite interesting to compare it with the cost of tax legislation courses, for example."
"We might find out that similar transitional costs usually accompany legislative changes."
"In other words, purely financial arguments cannot give the full picture."
"The other speech concerned the issue of policing in Northern Ireland."
"I can only say that, according to the information available to me, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has launched positive action to deal with the problem mentioned by Mr Allister."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the time allocated to us does not make it possible to continue this in-depth and very interesting debate."
"Suffice to say that we have entered an important decision-making phase and that your debate is part of this decision-making process."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I should like to thank colleagues very much for their remarks."
"I am delighted that we appear to have the support of the majority of this House for a comprehensive directive."
"I hope the vote later today will prove that."
"I would also like to pay tribute again to Commissioner Špidla because I know it was his actual initiative to bring forward a comprehensive directive and call for the comprehensive directive within the work programme."
"I am only sorry that his view does not seem to be winning the argument with the rest of the Commission."
"And let us hope that, by passing the call for a comprehensive directive, we will give more power to him to actually argue the case."
"I did ask Commissioner Špidla for the impact assessments to be released."
"I know they have been done already."
"I am a little fearful since I have heard reports that there have been different impact assessments and those are being changed slightly as we speak to favour one view in the Commission rather than another."
"I would like some sort of clarification on that to see if the rumours that I have heard are true."
"I am very pleased that other Members have supported your call within the work programme for that comprehensive directive."
"Specific issues relating to all the areas - disability, age, religion or belief, and sexual orientation - can, I believe, be covered in one comprehensive directive."
"Education is not the way forward."
"We have tried that."
"For those Members who have been talking about education: it does not work."
"We are talking as well about access to goods and services, not about employment."
"I know that all of the German delegations have problems with that because the employment directive has been gold-plated by the German Government."
"So leave that one aside."
"There are different Member States who have different problems: disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or belief."
"Some Member States cover some of them, others cover others and that is why it is important to get it right and have a comprehensive directive and not leave anyone behind."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) I would like to voice my appreciation of the work carried out by the rapporteur on a subject that I consider to be of enormous importance for the development of fairer and more effective European anti-discrimination policies."
"The principle of non-discrimination is in fact one of the core values that has always formed the basis for European integration and must therefore be properly protected, so that European citizens, particularly those in the most disadvantaged categories, such as disabled people, are effectively protected against any form of discrimination."
"Non-discrimination is fundamental in employment, but is necessary and preferable in any sector of public life (such as education or social services) because it can greatly aid social inclusion and development of the potential of all European citizens."
"I would like to conclude by voicing my support for the swift adoption of a complete and effective framework directive on non-discrimination, enabling Member States to join forces in this area and to adopt coherent and effective policies aimed at allowing citizens to feel truly protected by clear and comprehensive legislation at a European and national level."
"in writing. - (PL) As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I entirely support Mrs Lynne's report."
"I have no doubt that the international law in force and our own EU adjudications are - from a formal aspect - desirable and good solutions."
"I therefore regret that their entry into force is continually coming up against numerous obstacles, even in our Europe, which would appear to be more democratic and less discriminatory."
"It is astounding that we might need to call on EU Member States to treat the provisions of Directive 2000/78/EC with full respect and to carry out constant and systematic monitoring of progress in the elimination of all forms of discrimination from political, social and economic life."
"This is of particular importance for the citizens of my country, Poland, who, enjoying the benefits of the common market and freedom of personal movement, live and work in many EU countries."
"I am very sorry to have to say that there is increasing evidence of discrimination against my fellow countrymen solely on the grounds of their nationality."
"Disturbing information of this kind is increasingly coming to light from Germany, Great Britain and Ireland."
"It would be a paradox if the European Parliament were to become so heavily and effectively involved in combating manifestations of discrimination in the world yet were unable to cope with respect for human rights at home - that is, in the EU Member States."
"All EU citizens surely deserve equal and non-discriminatory treatment!"
", in writing. - (FI) The matter here is equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the European Union."
"Equal opportunities and non-discrimination at work are basic principles of employment, and the Member States should not have any problems complying with them."
"According to Mrs Lynne's report, however, the directives are not being implemented effectively or correctly."
"The problem is a serious one because, as Mrs Lynne's report states, combating discrimination and human rights are priorities in the EU under Article 13 of the EC Treaty."
"An example case in Finland concerned a woman who was not eligible to receive unemployment security after she had finished caring for her disabled son."
"It is wrong that care work done at home is not properly appreciated and that the rules allow this sort of discrimination."
"With this case in mind, I support point 36 in Mrs Lynne's report, which says that the scope of the principles of equality and non-discrimination should be broad and extend to social security."
"I am also in favour of Mrs Lynne's call for the European Parliament to recommend the Member States to put more resources into and empower institutions which work to promote these principles."
"I also support her call for the status of NGOs to be firmed up, so that they too can address existing problems in the Member States more effectively and efficiently."
"in writing. - (HU) It is certainly relevant that Mrs Lynne's report on equal opportunities is on the agenda for debate today."
"Just recently, on 17 May, we expressed our solidarity with transsexual, bisexual and gay people."
"On special days or occasions it is often the case that people look back at the past."
"Unfortunately, as the report shows, we still have a great deal to do as regards equal opportunities."
"Unemployment is still unacceptably high among women, migrants, people living with a disability, ethnic minorities, and those with very specific or unrecognised skills."
"In the field of employment, I therefore recommend introducing a European equal opportunities monitoring system that could provide support in the form of tax advantages and/or PR opportunities for employers that give prominence to creating equal opportunities."
"It would also set up a 'blacklist' of employers failing to meet the criteria at all."
"This would have a motivating effect on companies while at the same time giving job seekers new perspectives and clarity."
"Unfortunately, extremist and populist politics continue to spread in central and eastern Europe, but sometimes the picture we get from western Europe is a sad one too."
"Negative discrimination against Roma people is on the increase, and extremist forces are demolishing Roma dwellings."
"It is here that the great need for a European Roma Strategy, as proposed by the socialists, and the need for urgent action at European level are most apparent."
"Legislation in the Member States provides differing levels of protection against discrimination."
"There is often no uniform method of implementing the legislation, with the result that implementation is unsatisfactory."
"Efforts to implement the legislation need to be coordinated, taking into account the horizontal perspective of the European Union, national and local authorities, and ensuring general compliance."
"Prior to adopting legislation, it would also be important to carry out the social impact study and annual evaluation of implementation by Member States."
"in writing. - (ET) Non-discrimination and human rights are basic values of the European Union."
"They form the foundation on which we seek to build a common future and there can be no compromise in their regard."
"That much is clearly stated in Article 13, which must serve as a guide on any issues relating to European citizens."
"Protection against discrimination on grounds of age, sexual orientation, religious belief or disability is absent today in areas such as social welfare, goods and services, health care and education."
"Unfortunately there is no EU legislation in those areas."
"If non-discrimination and human rights are of prime importance to us, then there can be no doubt that we need a single, horizontal directive which puts an end to the hierarchy of rights."
"To the situation in which discrimination is outlawed in one area but allowed in another."
"To the situation in which race and disability are substantially more protected than the other areas set out in Article 13."
"In the light of this report I call on the Commission not to back down from its promise and to draft a comprehensive directive to combat discrimination under Article 13 of the EC Treaty."
"In an unprecedented move, many European non-profit-making bodies have spoken in favour of a horizontal directive to provide this protection; similarly there are several umbrella organisations active in various fields in Brussels such as the European Women's Lobby, AGE and several others."
"A horizontal directive on non-discrimination covering social welfare, goods and services, health care and education is the only way to promote human rights protection in the European Union."
"There is more than enough evidence of discrimination in all fields."
"The Commission must not close its eyes and recreate a hierarchy between rights in the European Union."
", in writing. - (HU) As President of the Intergroup for National Minorities, I welcome Mrs Lynne's report, which takes stock of what has already been achieved with regard to freedom from discrimination, and outlines what needs to be done."
"Community legislation on freedom from discrimination is especially important because protecting the individual is not enough."
"People do not suffer discrimination as individuals, but as members of a group: for example, because they belong to an ethnic minority, because they are old, because they are women, because they have a disability, because they belong to a sexual minority, or because they are Roma."
"For this reason, the only way of effectively protecting individuals belonging to the various minority groups is by protecting the whole group."
"The report rightly points out that the two existing directives only lay down minimum requirements, and so we need to take matters further towards developing a Community-level policy against negative discrimination and a horizontal anti-discrimination directive."
"Likewise very important is the item in the report calling on the Commission to work towards establishing a common, EU-wide definition of the term 'positive action'."
"The report also draws particular attention to the need for specific social protection for minority communities, and especially the Roma community."
"In this context I would like to remind you of Article 25 of the Ždanoka report, also on this topic, which points out the importance of participation by traditional national minorities in policy-making."
"According to this article, national minorities need a framework policy standard enabling them to participate effectively in decision-making processes concerning their identity by means of various forms of self-government or autonomy."
"An Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Piecyk, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on an integrated maritime policy for the European Union."
"Madam President, I am pleased that you are in the chair for a second time for a debate on maritime policy."
"You were also there a year ago."
"Commissioner, let us start with the good news."
"This evening the first European Maritime Day event will be taking place in St James's Church in Lübeck."
"This church houses the international memorial for civil maritime navigation."
"Commissioner Barrot opened it last year."
"Captains will be discussing their living and working conditions there this evening."
"The pastors have been relying upon the Presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to actually declare 20 May European Maritime Day this afternoon."
"This is a reason to rejoice and it should cause Europe to pay more attention to its seas."
"Only those who believe that a day such as this is also in fact maritime policy are indeed mistaken; a Maritime Day such as this should not degenerate into mere symbolism."
"That means it must be part of a political framework."
"Policy is required - for social matters, maritime safety and climate protection."
"Let us take living and working conditions on board ships: it is an evil anachronism that a whole range of social and employment protection regulations do not apply to seafarers."
"This has to change and the Commission also sees that it has to change."
"We await their initiatives here."
"The International Labour Organization adopted the Maritime Labour Convention in 2006."
"Three States have so far ratified it: the Bahamas, Liberia and the Marshall Islands."
"Where do Europeans actually stand here?"
"If the Council wants to improve navigational and maritime safety, it simply has to do one thing: finally adopt the Erika III package."
"It is a bit much that the Council is dealing with this issue of maritime safety in such a dilatory manner."
"In the meantime, more than 12 months have elapsed since first reading in Parliament and so far we still do not have single united standpoint."
"The Erika and Prestige disasters should in fact be sufficient warning and reminder to take action at long last."
"The climate protection package, put forward by Commission President Barroso in January refers to the possibility of perhaps including maritime transport in emissions trading."
"This is too lax; it is not enough."
"In my view maritime policy has to achieve at least four things regarding climate protection: inclusion of maritime transport in emissions trading - now, not whenever; a radical reduction in pollutant emissions - CO2, SO2 and NOX; and use of regenerative energies such as wind and solar energy."
"In the ports there has to be an end to ships' engines producing their own energy to the detriment of people and nature."
"Conversely, we also need to supply energy from land, so ships in port must be connected up to a power outlet."
"In the North Sea and Baltic Sea we have dozens of old munitions from past wars."
"Formidable hazards arise from these."
"We therefore need a plan of action to identify and remove this old, harmful waste."
"In recent months we have learnt that pirates have carried out attacks on Europeans and European ships off the African coast."
"We therefore need clear international regulations and a support system on the high seas and we must protect not only the coasts from the seas, but also the seas from the coasts."
"The greatest hazard for the seas still comes from the land: 80% of all emissions of pollutants are caused by agriculture or industry."
"In order to find a remedy, European law must ultimately be applied and enforced here, too."
"When we declare 20 May European Maritime Day after the vote this afternoon, I hope that we will be able to say on 20 May next year: we have achieved a great deal in the meantime."
"You see how it was a precision landing."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I find it quite appropriate that we are holding the debate during the first celebration of European Maritime Day."
"It is, after all, a Member of Parliament, Ms Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, who first suggested the idea to President Barroso in the context of preparations for the Green Paper on a future maritime policy for the European Union."
"It is also thanks to Parliament, and, in particular, President Pöttering, who will be hosting the signing of a joint tripartite declaration, establishing European Maritime Day, later today."
"This celebration demonstrates how far we have come in developing, not only the integrated maritime policy, but a new vision for Europe's oceans and seas."
"It also shows how involved all European institutions have been every step of the way."
"In fact, the Parliament has been a key player in developing the new integrated maritime policy both by organising a number of conferences where fruitful discussion and searching debate has been held, and by producing reports which guide us in our work and provide specific direction for the implementation of maritime policy."
"Let me express my grateful and heartfelt thanks and appreciation to rapporteur Willi Piecyk for having coordinated the keen interest of the various committees and for having produced this impressive report."
"Let me also thank the different committee rapporteurs and the many other distinguished Members of Parliament who have been particularly involved, throughout the last two years, in building the Parliament's contribution to this emerging European policy."
"To these, I apologise for not being able to refer to them by name as I wished."
"Allow me, if you will, to turn to the report itself."
"While the report does not include any new proposals, it nevertheless concentrates on certain demands made in Parliament in July 2007 which assisted us in determining the way forward, and will inspire us now for the continued implementation of the maritime policy."
"On some of the sectoral issues, the Commission welcomes the continued emphasis placed by Parliament on the environmental dimension of maritime policy, and on the challenges of climate change in particular, and looks forward to the adoption of a strategy for adaptation to climate change in 2008 which will address these concerns."
"The Commission also welcomes the recognition by the European Parliament of the importance of maritime transport to the European economy and Parliament's support for a common maritime transport area, for the development of the motorways of the sea and short sea shipping: all projects which the Commission is pushing forward."
"In terms of research, the Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the development of a comprehensive marine research strategy which will be a cornerstone of maritime policy, and should be ready for adoption by mid-2008."
"The Commission welcomes the positive attitude of the report towards the need to ensure sustainability in the field of fisheries."
"We have taken a number of steps in this direction since the adoption of the 'Blue Paper' such as the adoption of a communication on the ecosystem approach in April 2008, and two proposals on discards, which will be ready by the end of this year."
"In addition to specific mention of issues including the environment, maritime transport, research and innovation, social aspects, fisheries and energy, the Commission welcomes the particular importance attributed to the regional aspect of maritime policy through the exceptional maritime dimension conferred on the EU by its vast coastline, its islands and its outermost regions, and fully concurs with the view that maritime policy should take into account the various specific features of the Member States and maritime regions, including coastal regions, islands and outermost regions."
"Honourable Members, we are still in the early stages of the implementation of maritime policy, but with the continued assistance of Parliament, we will strive for increased measures in that implementation."
"In conclusion, may I once again congratulate the European Parliament and the concerned rapporteurs for their excellent work."
"We look forward to continuing our close dialogue with you in the months ahead in the interest of implementing the integrated maritime policy for the Union, and also count on your support to engage, in particular, the European maritime regions during Maritime Day 2009."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we congratulate the European Commission on its communication on an integrated maritime policy for the European Union and on the proposal for an action plan establishing the first steps aimed at implementing that policy."
"There have certainly been some backward steps between the Green Paper and the current Blue Book, in particular as regards sea-use planning, coastal protection, the European flag and the European Representative to the International Maritime Organization, but progress has unquestionably been made, specifically on the social dimension, investment, innovation and maritime clusters and maritime transport."
"The overall balance is positive."
"Whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity, we must now put into practice an effective integrated maritime policy that ensures that there is coordination between the various sectoral policies, that produces the expected synergies and real added value."
"Only in this way can the policy be a significant instrument to face the challenges of sustainable development, competitiveness and economic and social cohesion in Europe."
"Above all, the Committee on Regional Development hopes that the integrated maritime policy will have a very positive impact on the development and protection of the EU's coastal regions, islands and outermost regions."
"I shall be very brief, but I would like to highlight the value of incorporating the proposals made by the Committee on Fisheries, which stress that the key objective of the integrated maritime policy for the European Union in the field of fisheries should be to promote the modernisation and sustainable development of the industry, safeguarding its socio-economic viability and the sustainability of resources and guaranteeing food sovereignty and food security, the supply of fish to the public, job preservation and improved living conditions for fishermen."
"The proposals also stress that creating more and better seafaring jobs, particularly in the fishing industry, also depends on guaranteeing a fair and adequate income for people working in the industry."
"There is also a need for mechanisms to compensate fishermen who are affected by stock recovery plans, and to boost support for scientific fisheries research in the various Member States, particularly under the Seventh Framework Programme, and Community support for adequate means of assistance and rescue for crews."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk."
"He has been initiating discussions very well for over a year now and has outlined the challenges."
"Many thanks, Mr Piecyk!"
"We, too, unanimously support the report."
"However, we regret, Commissioner, that the action plan contains too few practical measures."
"Mr Piecyk has already pointed out that the entire set of environmental problems remains unresolved."
"There are no practical measures and it is unclear what contribution the players - ship-owners, for example - are making towards combating climate change and how they can exist in the competition that they have to bear globally."
"This extends from measures such as the reduction of sulphur and nitrogen oxides at sea to measures in the ports, such as the use of land energy."
"I am in all honesty a little disappointed."
"When the Commission says that it will be putting forward proposals on this in the autumn, we shall no longer be able to implement these in this parliamentary term."
"Perhaps you will be able to add a little more butter to the fish, as the people of Hamburg say, and then have a bit more drive."
"The second point concerns the issue of marine monitoring."
"I believe we do not simply need improved cooperation between the national coastguards."
"We not only need to strengthen FRONTEX - which address illegal immigration - but we also need a European coastguard."
"This has been one of our concerns for years, that all activities, whether they be fishing activities, customs work or police work, are being centralised in the Member States and a powerful European coastguard is being introduced for this."
"Mr Commissioner, will the Commission be putting forward a proposal on the coast guard in this parliamentary term or not?"
"One final point, which is new, is the amendments on pirates."
"We have to provide better protection for our fishing and merchant shipping fleets in international waters and we therefore need European as well as global action."
"The freedom of the seas should not become the freedom of the pirates."
"on behalf of the PSE group. - (RO) I congratulate our colleague Mr. Piecyk, whom I appreciate very much and I am glad that we are discussing his report today, when the Tripartite Declaration establishing the European Maritime Day to be celebrated every year on May 20th is signed."
"An integrated maritime policy of the Union should ensure synergy between sectors with special economic importance such as: the shipbuilding industry, maritime and fluvial transport, harbour activity, fishing activity, energy, tourism, environmental protection and maritime heritage protection."
"As of 1 January 2007, the Union borders the Black Sea and the Union should promote its common maritime policy in this region as well."
"There are coordinators for the TEN-T projects for inland water transport and for transport on maritime corridors."
"The expansion of the TEN-T network refers to maritime corridors."
"Unfortunately, the demands for projects that the Commission has launched for the European maritime corridors do not refer to the Black Sea region as well."
"I request the Commission to draw up studies and projects for the Black Sea region, which has to become a strategic region of the TEN network."
"I also request the Commission to draft a plan of concrete actions for the protection of delta and estuary areas and here I particularly refer to the Danube Delta."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate Mr Piecyk on an excellent report."
"It is important that we are having a discussion at this symbolic moment, but my desire is above all to draw attention to the practical aspects of this report."
"Really it is a major anachronism that, among other European policies that we are implementing within our Community, maritime affairs have so far been set to one side and are not covered by a Community-wide policy."
"What I wish to point out is that this is not an individual sphere; this is a sphere with very extensive dimensions, as indicated in this report."
"It has an economic dimension; there are large numbers of people who make their living from the sea and who work there."
"It has a very strong social dimension, which we must bear in mind when we talk of restructuring this industry, and when we talk of what to do with those people who make their living at sea and from the sea."
"Our discussion has a very important environmental dimension, which is particularly emphasised in this report, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for that too."
"There is also a very important regional dimension; we must not forget that regions that take their living from the sea, and that lie next to the sea, constitute a very substantial part of our Community."
"I would also like to stress a point that has arisen in this discussion, which is that we always treat our work and our discussion as a sort of contents list and prompt for the Commission."
"We outline certain answers, we pose questions and we sketch out our doubts, whereas our expectations in relation to the Commission are in fact very great and we expect answers to come as quickly as possible, with specific solutions."
"I would also like to point out that for very many countries this is a priority matter, with as much importance as other European policies, such as agricultural policy."
"Madam President, attempts to get the shipping industry away from the old-fashioned notion that the sea wipes away all tracks have so far failed."
"No, the sea remembers as well as the soil and the air, as well as plants and animals and the human body, and the shipping industry's contribution to pollution remains enormous."
"Imagine if we could get the major shipping nations to make the IMO an active player in the battle to save the global environment instead of using the IMO to put the brakes on good initiatives, as is currently the case."
"This report by Mr Piecyk is an excellent addition to our previous achievements in Parliament, but I hope that we can strengthen it further by gaining support for our proposed amendment, so that shipping will undoubtedly be included in the CO2 quota trading scheme."
"We already have aviation included. The only logical and defensible approach is for shipping to also contribute."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, support Amendment 1 to have the Maritime Emission Trading Scheme included in the report."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Willi Piecyk on his report."
"I come from an island and I understand very well the importance of maritime research and progress."
"I think today's report gives us a great advantage in achieving this."
"We are not very satisfied with the Common Maritime Policy in Ireland but there is more than that at stake."
"Some time ago, we visited my area in the company of the Fisheries Committee and we saw the wonderful work that is being done by the Maritime Institute in Oranmore in county Galway."
"Together with other institutes like the Maritime Institute we will be able to promote the necessary research throughout Europe so that the blue revolution we speak so much about can come to fruition and support our plan."
"I shall speak only briefly to point out that any initiative on maritime policy must respect Member States' sovereignty as regards their territorial waters and exclusive economic zones."
"I would point out that Article 5 of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic lays down that the State may not alienate any part of the Portuguese territory or of the sovereign rights it exercises over it - and that includes rights to adjacent sea beds."
"Furthermore, it is essential to improve the working conditions of seafarers, guaranteeing jobs, respect for the principle of equal pay for equal work, a reduction in working time and no application of the multi-skilling requirement, and resisting any renewed attempt to liberalise port services at EU level, in particular as regards intra-Community shipping; the 'sound financial basis' for the maritime policy should not be built at the expense of the European Fisheries Fund and the common fisheries policy, but should be based on the principle that new priorities will require new financial resources."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations are due to Mr Piecyk for his excellent report on the Integrated Maritime Policy, and also to my colleague Mr Jarzembowski for his pertinent remarks."
"Madam President, this report has the great merit of incorporating the various different aspects of this policy: environmental, economic, social and safety aspects."
"In particular, I am referring to the problems associated with illegal immigration, terrorism and smuggling, which occur along the full 320 000 kilometres of European coastline."
"The Member States with coastline need to step up the surveillance and control of their seas."
"Cooperation between them and the countries from which these illegal activities originate absolutely must be implemented as quickly as possible."
"It is also true that scientific discoveries, the considerable progress of technology, globalisation, climate change and maritime pollution are changing considerably Europe's relationship with the seas and oceans, with all the problems and challenges this brings."
"However, I am disappointed that the text proposed to us does not cover policy on ports and fisheries in more detail. These are two particularly sensitive dossiers, as we know."
"In France, professional fishermen are blockading the Atlantic, Channel and Mediterranean ports in reaction of course to the sudden rise in diesel prices and the quotas policy imposed by Brussels."
"The sector is in crisis structurally as much as economically."
"Fishing bosses no longer want to invest in their boats so the fleet is ageing."
"The average age of French fishing vessels is 25 years."
"Fewer and fewer people are going into a career in fishing because of the constraints on the profession."
"Madam President, an integrated maritime policy has to take these sectoral considerations and problems into account and quickly reverse the trend that is leading to the slow and painful death of the fishing sector."
"(PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Piecyk, anyone passing in front of the Berlaymont building at the moment will see a huge hoarding bearing the phrase 'An Ocean of Opportunity', in reference to the European Maritime Day (which is today) and to European maritime policy."
"The European Commission is quite right and I too believe that the investment we are resolved to make in the sea could provide an excellent opportunity to use that vast resource in a responsible and competitive manner."
"Unfortunately the world is awash with lost opportunities, with shipwrecked good ideas."
"That must not be the fate of the European maritime policy."
"We cannot, or rather, we must not lack the will or the capacity to carry the policy through, as Mr Jarzembowski quite rightly pointed out."
"The energy of our belief in the potential of this initiative must not be expended on halfway measures or the mere mouthing of generous-sounding ideas which are basically much less ambitious than we would like."
"Our road to success will entail: decisive investment in blue technologies; promoting a network of maritime clusters to develop best practices and the most advanced technologies; making the most of the sea in the fight against climate change and in using it as a source of renewable energy; promoting maritime transport and coastal tourism; acknowledging the maritime regions, in particular the outermost regions and their importance in security and protection against illegal immigration, trafficking, smuggling and terrorist threats."
"We must also, of course, ensure that we have a strategic and integrated vision and sustainable financing for these policies."
"I therefore now appeal directly to the Commission and to my fellow Members to say that the ambition shown cannot be less than the ambition to build another European centre of interest based on an integrated maritime policy."
"This water, Commissioner, will not flow under this bridge again."
"I just wonder whether the European Commission and this Parliament will be able to rise to their own challenge."
"(FR) Madam President, one of the aims of the first European Maritime Day we are celebrating today is to buff up the image of the maritime occupations by restoring their future prospects."
"In addition to the improvement of working and employment conditions for these occupations and the redefinition of career plans, a number of structural conditions also need to be met."
"Today, throughout France, desperate fishermen are blockading ports because they no longer believe they have a future."
"In addition to the fishing restrictions aimed at protecting fish stocks - the principle of which I am not querying, though I do wonder about its fairness - rising fuel prices are now also threatening them with bankruptcy."
"This is already a problem in France but it is likely to spread to other parts of Europe in the near future too."
"The European Union can and must act in this area by supporting restructuring and encouraging the introduction of cleaner-burning, more fuel-efficient vessels."
"As a matter of urgency, it must also help companies affected by this economic crisis to stay afloat."
"I highlight this last point because we cannot let the first European Maritime Day coincide in the minds of citizens with the death of an entire trade."
"(DA) Mr President, Mr Piecyk's report points out that there must be more concrete action on the table when we are talking about maritime policy, and I strongly agree."
"Nowhere is such an active maritime policy more necessary than in the Baltic."
"It is the EU's most polluted maritime area with extensive pollution from the land, as well as from ships. Added to this there is the dumped ammunition from past wars."
"There must be a cleaner environment in the Baltic, and we would also like to see strong economic development in the area, together with a move towards coastal shipping traffic relieving road traffic."
"A solution must then be found to limit the emissions of ships that does not hinder the development of coastal shipping."
"I believe that the way forward lies in methodological freedom to achieve the political goals for emissions combined with financial instruments."
"I hope that in its Baltic strategy the Commission will strengthen work to improve the environment and learn from the pilot projects that Parliament included in this year's budget."
"Madam President, I represent Scotland, one of Europe's primary maritime nations."
"The EU has some 68 000 km of coastline; Scotland has some 11 000 km of that."
"So, in terms of maritime interests, Scotland is at the heart of Europe."
"We have much to gain and much to contribute to a maritime strategy and policy."
"We have waters rich in minerals, energy and biological resources and we are ideally located as a maritime hub for Europe and the wider world."
"Maritime nations will have their own priorities in terms of strategy and policy for the resource which is their sea."
"Any EU policy should assist maritime nations in achieving their objectives such as by funding research, by facilitating development of new routes for transporting goods and passengers, supporting energy interconnectors, improving safety on vessels and energy efficiency."
"Can I quote from Article 34 of the Piecyk report, which says 'the integrated maritime policy for the European Union should be developed in such a way as to avoid failings in the CFP such as over-centralisation'?"
"In other words: add value and not take over as an excuse of competence."
"(EL) Madam President, the Commission communication on maritime policy for the European Union aims to ensure the profitability of ship-owners and of the monopoly groups active in the sector."
"What can be said about the proposals for an integrated maritime policy?"
"Firstly, they promote new privileges, and changes in the Community and commercial legislation international framework."
"Apart from anything else, they divisively create social problems for workers in the shipping industry and residents of island regions."
"Secondly, maritime policy is being lumped together with transport and related sectors."
"Thirdly, sweeping changes are being introduced in training and labour relations in order to replace the workforce with cheaper labour."
"The workload is being intensified as are the risks to human life and the environment."
"Fourthly, ports are being sold off to business group monopolies."
"Fifthly, the mechanisms of repression are being strengthened under the pretext of combating terrorism."
"Sixthly, flags of convenience are symbols of competitiveness and the EU's anti-labour maritime policy."
"It is not for nothing that 68% of the capacity of the Greek-owned fleet and 85% of Germany's shipping capacity are under foreign flags, although they are actually based in EU countries."
"Madam President, my constituency of South-East England includes over half the coastline of the English Channel, a name that that stretch of water has held for centuries."
"Yet the latest maps on the Arc Manche region change the name of the English Channel to the 'Greater North Sea' and call the Bristol Channel the 'Celtic Sea'."
"On whose authority have nautical miles suddenly become kilometres on those maps?"
"Now, you may think that these things are little things, but not where I come from."
"The Commission has failed completely to understand the impact of such gratuitous and absurd nonsense on an island nation, and they are hurrying the day when the UK walks away from the EU and takes its GBP 1.5 million-an-hour club subscription with it."
"Mr President, we now have Maritime Day, we have an integrated maritime policy, we have DG MARE."
"We have certainly come a long way and I think we owe the congratulations of this House to the Commissioner, but also to Willi Piecyk, for the hard work and efforts that they have all contributed towards achieving this objective."
"Europe's maritime interests affect the lives and occupations of millions of our citizens."
"90% of our external trade and 40% of our internal trade passes through our European ports."
"Globalisation means that this is bound to grow."
"If you take into account all of our coastal and outermost regions, we have got over 320 000 km of coastline, home to a third of our EU total population."
"Marine-based industries and services and the other activities of these coastal regions account for 40% of our GDP."
"But we rely on our maritime resources for more than trade: our seas are a source of food, energy, minerals and recreation."
"The sea is also an important climate regulator and we have already seen the results of climate change on fish stocks."
"At a time of growing demand for healthy marine protein, fish stocks continue to decline."
"We now have to rely on imports from outside the EU for more than 50% of the fish we consume."
"Critics always try to blame the fishermen for over-exploitation of our marine resources, but global warming, environmental pollution and many other factors have also played a part."
"If we are to realise the full potential of Europe's maritime interests and to realise the vision of clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas, then we have to implement a management plan that aims for sustainability in every area, and the way to do that is devolve more management responsibility to our regional advisory councils."
"(PT) First I should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission for the proposal presented and the methodology adopted and to congratulate Mr Piecyk on his splendid work and openness in the preparation of this excellent report."
"As a native of an old maritime nation, Portugal, and of an insular and outermost region, Madeira, I strongly support this report because it guarantees, among other fundamental aspects, appropriate recognition for the outermost regions in the effective implementation of maritime policy due to their position and their extensive experience, including in the areas of innovation, research, the environment, etc."
"Secondly, in the interests of improved management and sustainable exploitation of marine resources and appropriate combating of climate change, enhancement of coastal areas, support for environmentally friendly forms of maritime transport and an effective port policy, support for marine research, promotion of social rights in line with previously agreed international requirements, lifelong learning and support for tourism, which is one of the fundamental activities in this maritime policy."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to acknowledge the work of Mr Piecyk."
"Mr Piecyk, we have come to expect very good reports from you, and this one is no exception."
"Many thanks!"
"My constituency is Szczecin, in Western Pomerania."
"We have a port, a shipyard, shipowners, fishermen and a maritime administration."
"First of all, I welcome the declaration establishing a European Maritime Day."
"Secondly, as a result of this report, the shipyard workers of Szczecin and Gdynia, and also of Malta and other countries, will be pinning great hopes on the new maritime policy."
"The shipyard industry is a global industry."
"Our shipyards must function under conditions comparable to those throughout the world, where our competitors are working."
"What we need, then - and here I am addressing you, Commissioner - is a prudent policy and sagacious concern for European shipyards."
"(ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, as a European citizen of Galicia, a maritime region par excellence, am very proud of the excellent work done by the rapporteur, my friend Willi Piecyk, and I thank him along with the other political groups for supporting my amendments on the upsurge of the phenomenon of maritime piracy, which is sadly once again in the news following the two recent hijackings."
"It is right that our concern should be set out in the resolution, because we are facing a serious international security problem that needs to be dealt with."
"Over the last 10 years 3 200 sailors have been kidnapped, 500 have been injured and 160 killed in this type of attack."
"We are asking for something very simple: a mechanism that will enable a warship from any Community country in international waters to provide assistance to Community vessels, whether fishing or merchant vessels."
"We are also asking for Europe to support the initiative in the United Nations aimed at expanding maritime law."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Happy European Maritime Day!"
"(PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following the 2006 Green Paper, the action plan now under consideration in Mr Piecyk's excellent report has seen the addition of a series of measures to be taken in the context of the European Integrated Maritime Policy."
"We must therefore work on an overall vision not only as regards the seas as such, but also as regards the strong relationship with the coastal areas and all things connected therewith: employment, environmental issues, regional development, economic development, investing in marine research and excellence, that is, in a whole series of sectoral policies that, if we tackle them together now, will make it possible to achieve greater cohesion and success in policies put into practice and therefore to attain greater social, economic and environmental sustainability, which is absolutely crucial."
"For that very reason this report stresses the need for research and innovation to play a central role in boosting regional development potential to support all those activities concerned and affected, either directly or indirectly, by maritime policy."
"The alternatives for mobility on the seas and the challenge of wave power are some of the promises already being developed and they will certainly bring great expectations as regards future economic solutions and naturally are sustainable and deserve to be supported."
"(PT) Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to those of my fellow Members who have already quite rightly congratulated our rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, and who have praised the work already done by the European Commission."
"It is already four years since the present Commission made what was perhaps one of the principal political promises it has made; it is appropriate to point out that very significant steps are about to be taken and the Commission is therefore to be congratulated."
"I should, however, like to stress the point on the ecosystem approach to maritime policy."
"Such an approach seems to me to be vital and, since I noted that the most recent Commission communication was rather reticent about full implementation in view of the problems that presents for various European seas, I should like to point out that we need to look at the outermost regions in view of their own specific characteristics."
"There are no problems with a fully integrated approach there and I would challenge the Commission to do that as soon as possible."
"(PL) Maritime transport and ports and shipyards are rather forgotten sectors, although they have considerable growth potential."
"A suitable conception is required for the development of competitive and safe maritime transport, ports and related sectors that would guarantee a high level of maritime safety."
"Haulage by sea is a far more energy-efficient means of transport than road haulage."
"Let us therefore give shipyards a chance to develop, including those in Gdynia, Gdańsk and Szczecin."
"Let us remember that 90% of the EU's external trade and almost 40% of its internal trade passes through ports."
"Europe has been linked to the sea since the dawn of its existence."
"It had to be that way, since our coastline is 70 000 kilometres long, or three times the length of Africa's coastline."
"For years the sea provided for our forefathers and was a source of considerable income."
"The situation remains the same today."
"Only an integrated and coordinated approach and appropriate action will enable us to benefit from the potential that our seas have to offer."
"Madam President, in my intervention I would like to emphasise two aspects which I consider very important."
"The first is the River Danube, which, through its connection to both ends of the continent, links the North Sea with the Black Sea."
"Its potential is far from being exploited partly because the situation in the former Yugoslavia - situated in a central position of the river - has been blocking any initiative."
"But with the prospect of a final solution so close it will be difficult to justify the lack of a comprehensive initiative to transform the Danube into the very waterway of the continent, bringing further economic development to its shores all along its course."
"The second aspect is mainly political."
"The maritime approaches to the Union are shared with countries which are not Member States."
"Therefore the EU has to see to it that its neighbourhood policy and its instruments are so designed as to further the aims of an ambitious target of an integrated comprehensive maritime strategy."
"(BG) Marine space is definitely the area where the most integrated policies are applied in real terms."
"The seas provide the environment for a multi-directional communication among countries, people, activities and policies."
"In Bulgaria, we say, ""The sea brings together all things distant.”"
"I stress that the Black Sea, as an eastern border, and the Black Sea Region should enjoy equal treatment with all other marine policies."
"Contemporary development poses serious challenges before marine countries, and not only before them."
"On the one hand, there is the need to protect the environment, water, coastal areas, biodiversity, the employment opportunities of people, and on the other hand, there is the challenge to use marine resources in the interest of the development of society and the people."
"There are many vital components in this policy."
"I draw your attention to the need for strict oversight of marine transportation and of all energy projects involving the crossing of seas and to ensure sustainability and renewable marine resources."
"Madam President, I am pleased today that we can see the importance of a joined-up approach to maritime policy."
"The links between shipping, climate change and tackling pollution are essential if we are to preserve the common resource of our seas and oceans."
"However, I hope that next year we can make more of 20 May and I think there is an opportunity next year with the 2009 European elections for every candidate in those elections to use 20 May to highlight the importance of our seas and oceans and coastal communities."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, the engaging debate and the range of interesting points you raised clearly demonstrate the commitment of this Parliament to move forward the agenda of the integrated maritime policy for the Union."
"I assure you that the Commission fully shares this commitment."
"Many speakers raised the point that we have not gone far enough in our proposals and that we could and should have been even more ambitious."
"I take these comments as a sign of your real conviction that this policy is one that will be a success and will make a significant difference to the millions of European Union citizens and stakeholders that are affected by our oceans."
"Let me reiterate that this is only the beginning of a whole process and that at this stage our primary focus is to ensure that we have the tools in place in the short term to be able to develop and direct the process in the right direction."
"This is therefore the main thrust of the action plan adopted by the Commission last October."
"On the issue of financing, I agree with Mr Queiró that financing is a key issue that will have an impact on the success of this policy."
"Thus far we have mobilised financing from savings made in policy areas such as fisheries."
"This was not to the detriment of fisheries programmes but due to savings and unused money."
"The issue of future funding of the integrated maritime policy will be a crucial one in the discussions and in the future financial perspectives."
"Let me now turn to a few specific points that have been raised and on which I would like to give an immediate comment."
"I would like, however, to assure you that we will give full consideration to all the points that have been mentioned during the course of this debate."
"With regard to emissions by ships I would like to recall the very significant agreement that has just been reached within IMO on SOx and on NOx."
"I would like now to have more focus on CO2 and we should do so first within the IMO and, if this fails, we would have the obligation to act ourselves."
"On the point that was raised by Mr Jarzembowski concerning the European coastguard, to whom I paid particular attention, I would like to underline that this is a very sensitive matter."
"However, I foresee the development of a coordinated mechanism of national coastguards or of surveillance systems."
"With regard to the fuel price increases, let me reiterate that this is certainly not due to any measures taken by Brussels, but it is an international problem and it is a new reality."
"We are doing our utmost to find appropriate solutions to help the sectoral structure and to face up to this reality."
"We have just reached agreement in fact with France in this regard and I am sure that details of this agreement will be made public in the coming days."
"On the issue of piracy, of course the Commission is deeply concerned that incidents are on the increase."
"We see a need and an opportunity for mutual assistance and support among the EU membership to face this threat and await further direction from the Council and from the Member States themselves on this."
"I also agree with those who have made calls for more regional approaches and we will be working in this direction."
"Our project on surveillance in the western Mediterranean is based on such a regional approach and we hope it can serve as an example to be extended to other regions."
"In fact we will be looking at the maritime policy for the Baltic and Black Seas, which has been referred to by a number of speakers this morning, as we have just started to do with regard to the Mediterranean."
"I do not have time to outline the actions already taken or envisaged in the short term on fisheries like IEU, the structural fishing practices, the ecosystem approach, discards, port strategy, maritime transport, marine maritime research, the marine environment, energy, governance, surveillance or the social exclusion of seafarers, all of which we are dealing with."
"However, I can assure you that the Commission's commitment to push forward this new policy hand in hand with Parliament in particular and with the Member States and stakeholders is guaranteed."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"I totally agree with the statement that Europe's seas should be 'the cleanest in the world, with... the most profitable economy, the best research and technology, the most modern and cleanest shipping... and the most innovative ideas'."
"We have to recognise, however, that in order to achieve these aims, the Commission's Action Plan for Integrated Maritime Policy should be much more ambitious."
"On the other hand it is clear that the Action Plan contains 'too few practical measures', and that we have to admit that European maritime policy is not prepared for the consequences of climate change, particularly the rise in sea levels and the increased risk of flooding of ports and coastal regions."
"The Members States must do their utmost to ensure that European maritime policy makes an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"Moreover, land-based pollution of the seas constitutes a significant proportion of overall maritime pollution."
"I conclude that, in order to prepare, the Commission be asked to put forward an action plan to reduce land-based pollution."
"For their part, the Member States are called on to act promptly to transpose the legislation in this field into national law."
"in writing. - We in Europe must do our best to ensure that an effective maritime policy is in place which protects and pays sufficient attention to maritime issues."
"The report highlights areas of success, but it also points out shortcomings."
"In my eyes, key issues to be addressed in order to ensure such an improvement are a more coordinated cooperation and a strengthening of regional authorities and coastal communities."
"These local actors have to be incorporated into any new strategy since they are the ones who are in charge of the actual implementation of any such strategies."
"Through the method of increased cooperation between different coastal entities, more must be done to improve environmental protection of local ecosystems."
"Additionally, in order to avoid environmental harm caused by ship accidents such as the crash of oil tankers in the Black Sea a few months ago, I would like to see clear guidelines on seafaring in European and nearby maritime waters."
"This means that increased cooperation with seafaring third countries is necessary."
"If necessary, the European Union should be ready to assist these countries with fulfilling the hopefully soon to be established stricter guidelines."
"We would all profit from such an approach."
", in writing. - (PL) Not all EU Member States have access to the sea, but an appreciation of the significance of exploitation of the sea is universal."
"The maritime industry, maritime services and activities located in coastal areas are estimated to contribute 40% of the total GDP of the Community of 27."
"This is the reason why further practical steps to put into effect an integrated EU maritime policy are expected, steps that follow the European Commission's Green Paper."
"We are seeing efforts to make better use of the potential of coastal shipping, thus relieving overland routes; sadly, my country's contribution to this is negligible."
"It does seem, though, that economic problems are being pushed into the background by environmental and climatic priorities."
"This is a trend that is characteristic of all EU policies."
"The difficulty, however, is to make one chime with another."
"The rising dispute over protected areas in the Baltic is just one illustration of the tensions between the economic interests of the fishing industry and aspects of protection of natural resources."
"From the Polish viewpoint - that is, that of a country 'working its way up' - finding a balance between economics and the environment is essential."
"The link between the report under examination and the first European Maritime Day celebration is pleasing."
"It would, however, be of greater importance to fit out a common maritime policy with financial and legislative tools, to ensure that formal celebrations are not all we end up with."

"Oral explanations of vote"
"(PL) Mr President, there are a number of controversies surrounding the production and consumption of tobacco."
"We must be aware that the fact of tobacco growing in the EU really has no impact on the level of consumption of tobacco products by our citizens."
"Were we to restrict or cease tobacco production in Europe, this would not result in a fall in the number of cigarettes smoked."
"Imported tobacco would be used."
"I fully support the development of a public information programme to publicise the dangers of smoking, and this should be paid for by cigarette manufacturers and tobacco producers."
"(CS) I support information campaigns on the harmful effects of tobacco and the European Parliament resolution on a long-term plan to finance these campaigns with EUR 80 million, deducted from the subsidies to European tobacco growers."
"This will mean that no burden will be placed on the EU budget."
"Although the level of raw tobacco production in Europe is marginal, barely 4% of world production, we are the world's leading importer of raw tobacco and for most of our requirements we rely on the supply from third countries where tobacco is produced locally under conditions that are less closely regulated than those applicable to European tobacco."
"However, I object to subsidising tobacco production in Europe, and not only as a matter of general principle: the public funds allocated for this area could be used elsewhere and in a better way."
"(EL) Mr President, we, the PASOK Group in the European Parliament, have voted in favour of Mr Berlato's report."
"We believe the public should continue to be informed on matters relating to tobacco and tobacco products."
"There should be a similar policy with self-financed funds to inform the public on health matters relating to other products such as meat and fats."
"Furthermore, in regions such as Greece, where tobacco production has been drastically reduced, we cannot see why subsidies should not continue in their present form until 2013."
"Mr President, first of all I have to apologise to the House; as shadow rapporteur, I was unable to be here yesterday evening because my flight was not on time."
"So I apologise for that."
"Mr President, much has been written about the Northern Ireland peace process and this is another non-legislative report."
"The question is, did it do any good?"
"Yes it did."
"It meant that many small groups in Northern Ireland, especially women's groups, were able to get off the ground and were able to provide for their areas."
"Was it fair in distribution?"
"The answer is, no, it was not."
"At the beginning PEACE I was certainly not fair;"
"PEACE II was better, and I certainly look forward to PEACE III being another improvement."
"Unionist communities are not getting their fair share."
"Greater care must be taken to ensure that the cross-border bodies that are in place respect the balance in the region."
"There is no point in their existence if they do not."
"A glaring example of this is ICBAN, a cross-border body which in my opinion should not receive any more funding until they rectify the position."
"I would like to pay tribute, Mr President, to the many people since the beginning of the PEACE programme who have given their time voluntarily to work for the greater good of all, and I trust that Northern Ireland will go forward and prosper."
"The people deserve no less, and I warn against the sinister forces that are still around in the region."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report mainly for two reasons: firstly, because this report quite emphatically demands that the Member States finally implement the Lisbon Strategy and therefore measures on employment policy as well, and secondly, because it demands that good and affordable childcare arrangements finally be set up in the Member States."
"This is a very important precondition for compatibility between family life and work."
"This is particularly in the interest of single mothers because employment opportunities are thereby created and poverty can be combated."
"These are therefore positive strategies that are needed in order to translate the appropriate employment policy measures into reality."
"(PL) Mr President, employment is an indicator of how we are progressing."
"It is, however, difficult not to perceive certain defects in the sphere of social and territorial cohesion."
"In the EU, considered as a sphere of wellbeing, there are still almost 80 million people, that is 16% of all EU citizens, who are living in or threatened by poverty."
"Many jobs are of low quality and there is no help to get young people into work or to extend the working life of many experienced employees, or to employ disabled people."
"We must bear in mind that it is regions that are most backward in development terms that have to contend with the greatest problems."
"High unemployment, low involvement of older and disabled people in employment, a high proportion of people remaining out of work for longer than 12 months, women finding it harder than men in the job market - these are just some of the problems they have to face."
"In Poland this situation arises in the 'Eastern Wall' regions."
"The situation in the Czech Republic is worth commending: there they have made the lowering of barriers to employee movements one of the priorities of the forthcoming Presidency."
"(NL) The report by Mrs Van Lancker actually reads like a type of catalogue of good intentions and wishes."
"Improved and better-paid access to the labour market for women, disabled persons and immigrants is always said in one breath, even though it concerns three very different groups."
"An increase by five years in the average retirement age in the EU by 2010, perfect childcare facilities, barely any school leavers without a job, a job for people who have been unemployed for four years, and so on."
"That is all well and good, but it is not Christmas Day."
"This is a Parliament; not a Christmas pageant."
"Mrs Van Lancker should know better."
"We both live in a country in which, unfortunately, 10 million people in both parts of the country are simply crying out for a fundamentally different approach to the employment issue in the two parts of the country."
"We no longer require uniformity at European level; on the contrary, we require the possibility for the Member States and regions to take the specific measures that are required at local level both quickly and effectively. Thank you."
"(NL) This is an initial report on Parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure and, in actual fact, is teeming with the complacency of this institution, whereas the opposite should be the case in this initial report."
"Everybody knows that money is thrown around in this institution."
"The two places of work cost a tremendous amount of money, without actually offering true added value."
"Each year always heralds enormous increases in the operating costs of this institution, this time camouflaged as it were as a necessary consequence of the Treaty of Lisbon, which to my knowledge has not even been adopted yet."
"Then, of course, there is the new Statute for Members, a concoction by Eurofanatics, intended to cut even more firmly through the bond between Members of Parliament and the people who they represent, which will of course all cost a great deal, will it not?"
"It is for all of these reasons, and many more, that I have voted against this report with conviction."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, regarding the report by Mrs Sudre, with my Group's support I tabled a number of amendments as part of a compromise."
"These amendments have been partially fulfilled. I would like to thank the Committee."
"The amendments concerned recognition of the added value of the outermost regions in the fields of space, renewable energies, energy self-sufficiency and biodiversity, the importance of public service for the development of the ORs, acknowledgement of the lack of integration of the ORs into the European Research Area, recognition of the benefit of the NET-BIOME programme, and the ORs' ability to make a significant contribution to established international priorities."
"On the other hand, I am disappointed that this report has not fully integrated the social and cultural chapter for comprehensive development and that support and recognition of the regional languages of the ORs, funding of research into slavery and colonialism, and the defence of the rights of the native peoples of Guyana were not kept."
"I am also disappointed that the report makes no significant commitment to strengthen research capability so that it matches potential."
"I am disappointed that my proposal for regulation of postal and telecommunications pricing between the national territories and the ORs was not upheld."
"As part of my assessment, I am disappointed that my request for a social and environmental impact study of the CMO in sugar and bananas was rejected."
"However, I voted in favour of this report, which certainly provides valuable information and results for the ORs."
"(CS) I would like to follow up on the politically charged debate we had yesterday."
"I did not support the Socialists' proposal relating to collective redress because the responsible thing, in my opinion, is to wait for the results of the impact studies in order to assess the effectiveness of collective redress, in particular as regards the costs incurred by consumers."
"Therefore, today I want to protest against improper comments during our debate yesterday by my fellow Member Mrs Gebhardt, who gives voters the impression that only the Socialists protect consumer interests, unlike the democrats who protect the interests of industry."
"Such manipulative political rhetoric and demagogy bear no relation to reality and I object to them."
"(NL) I have voted with great conviction against the Lynne report because, in my opinion, it goes much further than countless reports approved by this Parliament in the past that, in themselves, are highly questionable."
"Parliament is now once again throwing its doors wide open to a type of all-encompassing European anti-discrimination policy, which leaves barely a single social domain untouched."
"I have said it before in this institution and I shall say it again: the fight against discrimination, if it is necessary, is a fight that falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States, and Europe must not assume the role of police officer or thought police in this regard."
"Indeed, anyone who reads the Lynne report closely will come to the conclusion that it has less to do with the actual fight against discrimination than with undermining freedom of expression even further and, in particular, making political correctness into a legal affair."
"I cannot agree with this and have therefore voted against this report with conviction."
"(DE) Mr President, we are all in agreement that every conceivable measure has to be taken against discrimination."
"Therefore, we have also declared our faith in four directives."
"A fifth is being prepared."
"There is support for this one, too."
"I have, however, voted against this report because it chooses a wrong strategy, because it does not advocate the implementation of existing laws, but instead immediately demands another new directive, which includes new authorities, new bureaucracies and new test procedures."
"This means barriers are proffered instead of solutions."
"All in all, this does not lead to discrimination being abolished."
"My entire delegation is pursuing a different path."
"My delegation would like the Member States to be asked ultimately to implement everything that already exists in current law and not, as the report suggests, taking the second step before the first."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, within the GUE/NGL Group there exists great tolerance for minority positions."
"There are cases where those minorities like to show to the plenary of this Parliament that their viewpoint differs from the large majority inside our group."
"Such was recently the case in the voting on my report concerning the relationship between Macedonia and the European Union."
"We gave the limited speaking time for our group to one of our Greek Members, who declared that the European Union cannot admit any new member, as it would be better to abolish the Union itself."
"Possibly this remark created the misunderstanding that my group did not follow my proposals to speed up the negotiations with this candidate Member State."
"However, this position was only the viewpoint of the Communist Party of Greece, not of our group as a whole, which supported my proposals, as did the vast majority of this Parliament."
"In the last debate this morning we again had such a situation."
"On the Piecyk report on an integrated maritime policy, the two speakers from our group were the Greek Member Pafilis and the Portuguese Member Guerreiro."
"Getting the opportunity to speak on this issue was very important for the parties they represent here."
"In their national debate, those two parties prefer to use the Piecyk report as a symbol for everything that is wrong about the working conditions of seamen and port workers and also for everything that can be linked with NATO intentions for the military use of the sea."
"The majority of our group, including the German and Netherlands delegations, take the view that the Piecyk report has nothing to do with those issues."
"We twice supported the defeat of the Ports Directive but we are not against maritime policy in general."
"We support Mr Piecyk's proposals, which are focused on useful elements like the environment, the protection of coastal regions, education and the quality of labour."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, one of the main challenges with which Europe has to contend is climate change."
"This also has a direct bearing on maritime areas, especially coastal regions threatened by rising water levels."
"Secondly, significant exploitation of maritime resources, especially through excessive fishing, as well as climate change, currently constitutes a serious threat to the marine environment."
"Relations between oceans and the climate are treated as a major part of EU climate policy."
"Thirdly, almost 80% of pollution of the marine environment originates from the land."
"Environmental threats such as shipwrecks on the sea bed and the remains of military ammunition and chemical weaponry are also of considerable significance."
"Fourthly, intensive fishing has rocked the equilibrium of the ecosystem and is destabilising biodiversity too."
"Fifthly, oceans and seas play an important role in the European strategy to ensure energy security."
"On the one hand, they are a source of oil and gas, as well as a source of renewable energy."
"On the other, they constitute a means and a route for the transportation of energy and thus increase energy security."
"We therefore need to create a sustainable policy for development of the seas and oceans."
"Written explanation of vote"
"I voted in favour of the report by my Swedish fellow Member Jan Andersson, under the simplified procedure, which confirms the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Decision 85/368/EEC on the comparability of vocational training qualifications between the Member States of the European Community, which called for the Member States and the Commission to cooperate in drawing up Community job descriptions in specified occupations, and then match vocational training qualifications recognised in the Member States with the agreed job descriptions."
"Because this decision was difficult to apply, it was sensible to repeal it."
"The European Qualifications Framework (EQF) should address the limitations of the decision to be repealed, by focusing on improving the transparency of qualifications and by introducing a decentralised approach for cooperation which reflects the increasing complexity of qualifications in Europe."
"Nevertheless, this unfortunate affair testifies to the need for clarification and simplification of Community law so that citizens can understand and use it in their everyday lives."
"in writing. - (PL) A rise in employment in the European Union is directly related to occupational training and to mutual recognition of qualifications."
"I supported Mr Andersson's report because I feel that EU Member States should create a common model for verification of occupational qualifications regardless of the country in which they were acquired."
"This will encourage employees to keep improving their skills, and students to study, gain new experience and improve their knowledge of foreign languages in various parts of Europe."
"As a representative of Małopolska, the third largest region in Poland in terms of student numbers, I would also like to draw attention to the particular significance of diploma recognition for young people."
"All academic exchanges and the potential to compare qualifications are of exceptional importance for young people wishing to acquire experience abroad."
"One of the four principles on which the European Union's common market is based relates to the free movement of people."
"The free movement of people provides EU citizens with the potential to take up employment in another Member State."
"Different education systems and regulations on occupational qualifications, however, often make it difficult to accept employment in occupations in which we hold qualifications."
"This is why it is so important to be able to compare occupational qualifications between different Member States."
"In the view of the European Commission and also of the rapporteur, Decision No 85/368/EEC, which governs this matter, has not adequately facilitated the comparability of occupational qualifications to the benefit of workers seeking employment in another Member State."
"This is what lies behind the decision to replace it with a newer and more effective instrument, the European Qualifications Framework, which increases transparency, supports the transfer of qualifications and makes it easier to assess the results of study."
"I am pleased that this step has drawn broad support from various areas: social partners, industry and sector organisations, educational institutions and NGOs."
"This guarantees broad acceptance of the changes being made."
"I am therefore in favour of rescinding the Decision, and I feel that the EQF, as a tool enabling qualifications to be compared, will provide a chance for people to move more easily and will enable the aims that were not realised through Decision No 85/368/EEC to be attained, thus ensuring greater worker mobility in the European labour market."
"in writing. - (HU) I voted in favour of Mr Andersson's report because I believe it is important to overturn all possible barriers to the harmonisation of professional and vocational qualifications."
"It is important to repeal Council Decision 85/368/EEC, since implementation of this decision failed to bring about comparability of professional and vocational qualifications."
"The decision is now being replaced by other, newer and more effective European-level instruments such as the European Qualifications Framework (EQF)."
"As an instrument for the promotion of lifelong learning, the EQF encompasses qualifications of all levels, from those achieved through compulsory education or adult education to those awarded in higher education and in professional or vocational education and training."
"It is therefore important for Member States to give the maximum possible weight to education, as this is the basis for employment."
"Education, alongside the acquisition of general learning and cultural knowledge, plays a vital role in developing a tolerant European society."
"As well as learning to use energy efficiently and protect the environment, the next generation must also learn to accept and respect differences."
"Education is the key to many other things too: it provides an opportunity for minorities, for example for Roma people, to preserve their culture and ensure their integration."
"In minority communities nowadays there are increasing numbers of well-educated young people who are in a position to defend their own interests in the face of local authorities and governments."
"In order for this to become the norm, we need to develop language teaching, devote more attention to minority cultures in schools, and minorities themselves need to take a more active role in teaching."
"in writing. - (DE) In practice we have not always managed to smooth out all the difficulties regarding the mutual recognition of vocational training qualifications and maintain the quality of work here on the one hand, without creating unnecessary hurdles on the other hand."
"In this regard it is alarming that the Services Directive granted foreign service providers a certain freedom to do whatever they want in the absence of the possibilities of effective control and unexplained sanctions, whereas domestic service providers still have to comply rigorously with the law and standards."
"In a few years' time our domestic enterprises will be demanding a re-evaluation of the regulations that apply to foreign enterprises so that they do not go under in the face of merciless competition."
"Undercutting competition is therefore still being encouraged in the case of wages, working conditions and social security."
"Nor should the EU be encouraging this development with the 'blue card'."
"We have enough skilled workers if only we are prepared to pay them a decent wage."
"I voted in favour of the report by my Polish fellow Member Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg approving, in its first reading under the codecision procedure, the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council to codify Council Directive 93/7/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State as amended by Directive 96/100/EC (OJ L of 1 March 1997) and Directive 2001/38/EC (OJ L of 10 July 2001)."
"I am disappointed that the codification process is taking such a long time; it should be remembered that it was on 1 April 1987 that the Commission decided to instruct its services to proceed with the codification of all legislation at the latest after its 10th modification, emphasising that this was a minor matter and that its services should strive to codify the texts they were responsible for within an even shorter interval."
"The President-in-Office of the European Council (in Edinburgh in December 1992) confirmed these imperatives."
"Finally, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in an interinstitutional agreement on 20 December 1994 that an accelerated procedure could be used."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for the Geringer report because I agree that the cultural objects that were removed from the territory of a Member State illegally should be returned to the lawful owner."
"This report supports the idea of issuing a European Directive for establishing administrative cooperation between Member States on the return of cultural objects removed unlawfully."
"The Directive will stipulate the establishment of a central authority in each Member State, which would exclusively deal with this issue and cooperate with the similar authorities established in the other Member States and Interpol."
"At the same time, such a directive could simplify the administrative procedure existent at present in the European Union and, personally, I am looking forward to seeing this draft law implemented."
"in writing. - I endorse the codification of legislation relating to cultural objects unlawfully removed from Member States."
"The existing legislation has been modified a number of times and it is important that we have a clear legal framework within which Member States can secure the return of stolen cultural property."
"I also believe that cultural objects should be returned to local communities within Member States when there is clear local support for such an initiative."
"Within this context I fully support, for example, the return of the Lewis chessmen to a location in the Western Isles of Scotland and, likewise, the St Ninian's Isle treasure to Shetland."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting in favour of the report by Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State."
"I consider it fundamental that Member States should be able to work together to settle disputes between national governments and to recognise the importance of the protection of cultural assets at a European level."
"Cultural assets and works of art represent the heritage of the citizens of Member States, who have every right to be able to visit and admire them."
"There are in fact cases of scandal and disputes concerning stolen works of art that go back decades."
"I consider Community intervention to resolve these situations absolutely necessary."
"in writing. - Although having voted in favour of the report, I must draw attention to the fact that Article 13 of the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State states that this directive shall apply starting from 1 January 1993."
"Let me remind you that after the illegal annexation of the Republic of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940 numerous artefacts were moved from Estonia to different destinations in the Soviet Union that have not been returned, among those objects the Presidential collar."
"I hope that the Commission has not forgotten about that and will soon produce a proposal for a directive dealing with unlawful removals prior to 1993."
"I voted in favour of the report by my Italian fellow Member Mrs Locatelli, written under the consultation procedure on the proposal for a Council regulation setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking."
"Putting Europe at the forefront of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies globally is an excellent policy."
"Fuel cells are discreet, efficient energy converters that considerably reduce the production of greenhouse gases."
"They provide great flexibility since they can consume hydrogen and other fuels such as natural gas, ethanol and methanol."
"It became essential to set up a Community instrument with this Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) to create partnerships between the public and private sectors in the research field under the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7)."
"The JTIs, which mainly result from work by the European Technology Platforms (ETPs) reflect the EU's firm commitment to coordinate research in order to strengthen the European Research Area and achieve European objectives for competitiveness."
"I support the idea of giving more assistance to SMEs."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we should apply the Cooperation Specific Programme which identifies fuel cells and hydrogen as one of the six areas where a JTI could have particular relevance."
"This proposal setting up the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking is the fruit of work carried out within the European Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Platform and aims to contribute to the implementation of the Environmental Technologies Action Plan."
"Fuel cells are very quiet, highly efficient energy converters capable of delivering substantial cumulative greenhouse gas and pollutant reductions, since they can be operated on hydrogen and other fuels, such as natural gas, ethanol and methanol."
"The introduction of hydrogen as a flexible energy carrier can contribute positively to energy security and stabilise energy prices as it can be produced from any primary energy source, and as such can introduce diversity into the transport mix, which is currently dependent on oil."
"Although substantial EU public funding has been channelled towards research into fuel cells and hydrogen, those technologies are unlikely to be on the market as soon as we would hope."
"I welcome the Berlato report on the possibility of extending the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund until 2012."
"The EU feels the need to protect this important sector because the complete withdrawal of subsidies would cause enormous damage to production, with negative repercussions for employment in the regions involved."
"In some areas, tobacco can represent 35% of agricultural exports and a potential fall in production would do serious economic and social harm, particularly if the local economy is already in difficulty."
"It is important to underline the fact that the financing earmarked for the Community Tobacco Fund will be used to cover all initiatives and education and awareness-raising campaigns on the damage caused by smoking."
"Therefore, I hope that the proposal to extend the anti-smoking communication fund is supported by my colleagues, thereby also protecting the interests of the consumer."
"The Community Tobacco Fund financed by the transfer of a certain amount of tobacco aid for the years 2006 and 2007 promotes initiatives to raise public awareness of the harmful effects of smoking."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has proposed extending the funding until the end of the financial perspective and has increased the percentage rate to 6%."
"Tobacco consumption in Europe has not changed and the gradual reduction in European production has been replaced by tobacco imports."
"The parallel question of maintaining the CMO in tobacco and therefore of postponing the 2004 reform that should have applied from 2010 must be addressed during the health check of the CAP because decoupling causes the almost total abandonment of production with no sustainable alternative from the point of view of the economy and jobs, which has had very serious consequences for the rural areas concerned but no impact on public health."
"I do not think the fight against smoking and the extension of a transitional period enabling European producers to find alternatives to growing tobacco and reduce the negative impact on our regions are mutually exclusive."
"in writing. - (PT) Financing of the Community Tobacco Fund is aimed exclusively at promoting information initiatives on the damage tobacco products can cause."
"The proposal presented by the European Commission provides for the transfer of an amount equal to 5% of the tobacco aid granted for the calendar years 2008 and 2009."
"For its part, Parliament is proposing the transfer of 6% of tobacco aid granted for the period 2009 to 2012, assuming that aid to producers is continued."
"As we know, the European Commission has, unfortunately, moved towards decoupling production aid, which has been instrumental in reducing tobacco production in Portugal, although tobacco is still being imported from producer countries."
"The Commission is still linking this Fund to the system of support for tobacco growers on the grounds that it is the only source of financing provided for."
"In line with that rationale, and based on the view that information campaigns will continue to be of value, the amendments would seem to be appropriate."
"It also seems relevant to support the recent formal request made to the Commission by almost all the tobacco-producing Member States, for the Commission to bring forward a proposal for a regulation extending the current system of support for tobacco production until 2013, for consideration as part of the discussions in progress on the CAP 'health check'."
"in writing. - I have voted against this report because as someone who has argued from the very outset against subsidies for tobacco production, I believe that it would be devastating to extend the phasing out of tobacco subsidies from 2009 to 2012."
"I support the European Commission's proposal which indicates there is no justification for tobacco subsidies to continue to be linked to tobacco production."
"I believe that the Parliament's report which tries to reopen the debate about phasing out of subsidies by 2009 is totally unacceptable."
"I see no logical reason to continue supporting tobacco production particularly due to the negative consequences tobacco has on health and healthcare costs."
"in writing. - I voted against the Berlato report on the Community Tobacco Fund."
"The EU, in harmony with numerous Member States, has sought to reduce tobacco use by measures such as the ban on tobacco advertising."
"It is therefore rank hypocrisy for the EU to continue to fund tobacco growers within Europe."
"in writing. - The European Parliament resolution on the Tobacco Fund proposes to extend agricultural subsidies on tobacco."
"We vote against in protest at the whole system of tobacco subsidies."
"For the EU to financially support the growth of tobacco is ridiculous, to use part of this money to support anti-smoking campaigns hypocritical."
"All agricultural subsidies for tobacco should be abolished immediately."
"Anti-smoking campaigns are useful but can easily be financed in other ways."
"in writing. - Sergia Belato's report on the Community Tobacco Fund seeks to reopen the debate on extending tobacco subsidies until 2012."
"There is no justification for tobacco subsidies to be given to farmers from both a public health and economic perspective, therefore their extension is simply not necessary."
"Indeed, given the EU's stance on tobacco, I find the proposals contained in the report to be not only hypocritical but immoral."
"I therefore could not vote in favour of the report."
"I have voted in favour of the Berlato report, as has the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"It guarantees Community subsidies for tobacco growers for a further period and affords them protection against unfavourable discrimination in relation to growers of other agricultural products, for which subsidies are to continue."
"It is particularly important to make use of all the possibilities offered by existing resources."
"We must prevent tobacco growing from being abandoned and stop the exodus of the rural population during this transitional period for the crop."
"in writing. - (PL) Although the vote on the Belato report was positive, it does not resolve the problem of smoking and tobacco production."
"You could say that we have postponed a decision on these important matters, by several years."
"This problem will consequently return and will remain a problem for as long as people keep smoking tobacco."
"It will need to be solved, but not at the cost of farmers who have tied themselves to tobacco production and incurred the relevant investment outlay."
"Tobacco growing provides a living for tens of thousands of families, who often have no other way of obtaining income, as, for example, in regions of Poland with poor soils."
"This is why we need strategic decisions today, taken with due consideration, not under pressure from lobbyists representing intermediaries and traders functioning in an international system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Berlato and voice my support for his report."
"The report is extremely balanced and represents a rare and positive example of integration between the EU's agricultural and health policies."
"By proposing to increase the percentage rate of the deduction for subsidies paid to tobacco growers and releasing additional funding of over EUR 81 million for anti-smoking campaigns, the report manages to satisfy both camps with regard to certain sensitive areas."
"On the other hand, this report extends partially coupled aid to producers at no additional cost to the EU budget, and without discriminating between them and other agricultural sectors, confirming the position expressed by Parliament in Strasbourg in March 2004."
"in writing. - You will be aware that over many years this Parliament has been very vocal in its efforts to highlight the dangers to health of smoking tobacco."
"Yet through all that time the European Union has given millions of euros in support to farmers for growing that very same product."
"It really is hypocritical in the extreme to carry on such a policy."
"The report from the Committee on Agriculture tries to reopen the debate on extending tobacco subsidies until 2012."
"Yet the Commission proposal, that the report was allegedly drawn up in response to, is about extending the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund, which as we know is used to warn of the dangers of smoking tobacco."
"What was attempted here by the Agriculture Committee was a sleight of hand that would have done any top-class magician proud, but thankfully this has been spotted and hopefully exposed for what it really is; namely an attempt to extend subsidies to tobacco farmers."
"This has to be resisted by this Parliament on moral, economic and health grounds."
"The Commission's position is clear."
"There is no justification for tobacco subsidies linked to production."
"It is now high time Parliament adopted the same line by rejecting the Agriculture Committee stance on this issue."
"That is why I shall vote against."
"in writing. - Over half a million EU citizens die every year due to tobacco addiction."
"Not a penny of EU taxpayers' money should go on the Community Tobacco Fund."
"The Community Tobacco Fund should cease to exist."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my British fellow Member Mrs de Brún on the evaluation of the PEACE Programme (EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland) which stresses that local empowerment has been an essential part of peace-building in Northern Ireland and that the participation of civil society in this process has largely contributed to improving local policy making and implementation."
"I support the idea that cooperation between participants in programmes financed by PEACE and IFI (International Fund for Ireland) should not cease when the programmes come to an end."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the de Brún report on the PEACE Programme which rightly highlights the importance of local empowerment in the peace-building process."
"The PEACE Programmes have made a valuable contribution to the peace process in Ireland and efforts to build upon this in the future are to be welcomed."
"in writing. - I am pleased to support the PEACE programme and hope it will continue to help communities at a grass-root level."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my German fellow Member, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, which proposes to modify the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning meat and livestock statistics, but in a way that should permit agreement at the first reading under the codecision procedure."
"Livestock statistics (twice a year for pigs and bovine animals, and once a year for sheep and goats), monthly slaughtering statistics (head and carcass weight of pigs, bovine animals, sheep, goats and poultry) and meat production forecasts (meat from pigs, bovine animals, sheep and goats) are essential for managing EU markets but the legislation in force, which had become very complex, urgently needed to be dealt with."
"It seems sensible to include poultry meat in addition to statistics for meat from pigs, bovine animals, sheep and goats."
"in writing. - (RO) The simplification of procedures is a major objective of the European institutions, which are aware that overregulation is a burden both for their operation and for the efficiency and competitiveness of economic operators."
"For the farmers and agricultural producers in Romania, reducing the bureaucratic burden is a requirement in order to be able to fully benefit from the advantages of joining the European Union."
"The statistical reports should be taken into consideration both by Eurostat and in particular by the national institutions and companies."
"As regards meat, the statistical data represent a picture that allows taking actions in due time in order to regulate the market, by establishing intervention mechanisms."
"The statistical reports should be unitary, correct and available in due time in order to avoid major imbalances on the Community market, affecting producers, consumers or both groups equally."
"This report has precisely this mission and I welcome it!"
"At the same time, national authorities should also rigorously (and, where necessary, firmly) implement actions that would result in seriousness from respondents."
"This issue should be treated with the same care both by the person collecting and processing statistical data and by the economic agents sending them."
"Apart from rigorousness, this regulation will also bring about the uniformity of these data by common standards applicable across the European Union."
"in writing. - I welcome Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report on the proposal for a regulation concerning meat and livestock statistics."
"The regulation aims to simplify existing legislation in this area."
"I voted in support of the report's recommendations."
"I voted in favour of the report by my Belgian fellow Member Mrs Van Lancker, written within the framework of the consultation procedure, on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for employment policies of the Member States."
"I salute the excellent job done by my colleague and friend Mrs Morin, the rapporteur for our political group, particularly on flexicurity."
"At the risk of getting off the subject a little, since this Council decision basically aims only to make recommendations to the Member States on the basis of Article 128 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, I am disappointed that, although it was its duty in application of Article 138 of this Treaty, the Committee does not push forward the social partners and affirm that the time has come to create European employment legislation with the support of these social partners based on the procedure laid down in Article 139 of the EC Treaty."
"We cannot have an ambitious employment policy if we do not establish European labour legislation with the support of the social partners."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Strategy, particularly following the mid-term review, represents the EU's most important strategic commitment and is finally being accompanied by concrete results in terms of growth and employment."
"In this respect, Mrs Van Lancker, while recognising that the strategy has the advantage of having contributed to job creation, expresses the view that quality and safety need to be improved."
"It should be noted in fact that despite the steady fall in the number of unemployed, the number of workers with fixed-term contracts is on the increase, with clear implications and consequences."
"The figures reveal the need to monitor individual Member States to ensure that they tackle employment issues with an increasingly balanced, flexicurity approach: this means new jobs, but also better conditions for workers in general."
"As the rapporteur emphasises, however, the Lisbon Agenda needs to take more account of common social objectives: the buzzword of our strategy should now be inclusion, and not just growth and employment."
"in writing. - (PT) The current situation shows that, ten years after the first guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, there is ever less employment with rights, which in itself shows that the strategy is not aimed at the promotion of employment with rights."
"On the other hand, the constant changes to those guidelines accompanied by the European Union's ever more neoliberal economic guidelines have contributed to increased job insecurity."
"Although the rapporteur includes some palliatives concerning poverty or social inclusion, there is in fact no mention of the need to break away from the present macroeconomic and employment guidelines, which are completely neoliberal and where competition and flexibility reigns supreme, which is why such proposals amount to nothing more than a smoke screen, failing to tackle the root cause of the problems."
"Some other proposals even tend to promote flexicurity or, rather, the deregulation of the labour market, defending flexible and reliable contractual arrangements through modern labour laws, collective agreements and work organisation, with the indication that the Member States should implement their own action plans based on the common principles of flexicurity adopted by the Council."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Van Lancker Report dealing with Member States' employment policies."
"The report correctly emphasises the need for Member States to implement guidelines in a way which seeks to combat discrimination whether it is based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, or sexual orientation."
"The report also calls for Member States to recognise national traditions in implementing employment policy."
"I consider that the recognition of Europe's diverse traditions should be at the heart of all EU policy."
"in writing. - (PL) I abstained from the vote on Mrs Van Lancker's report on employment policy guidelines."
"The report did not, unfortunately, succeed in avoiding contradictions."
"On the one hand it contains plenty of phrases such as 'knowledge-based society', 'competitiveness' and 'technological challenges' while on the other hand there is talk of the need to ensure 'employment security', 'stable employment' and such like. The former stresses intentions, the latter, keeping things as they are."
"No progress can be made without disrupting the employment structure."
"This has never happened in history."
"Instead of talking about employment security, understood as maintaining existing jobs and types of work, then, we should talk about something else, namely ensuring access to work; access to work that exists now, at this moment in time."
"This should be our common concern."
"The employment situation in the European Union is not very good."
"The average unemployment rate of 7.3% in 2007, not taking account of assisted jobs, is higher than that of the other major economic blocs."
"In North America it is less than 5%."
"Far from improving the situation, the guidelines that have been presented to us will make it worse."
"The Lisbon Strategy, viewed in a positive light by the rapporteur, opens our economies up to unfair competition, particularly from communist China, which practises true social dumping."
"Furthermore, by demanding the reduction of 'employment gaps between third country nationals and EU citizens', the report clearly forms part of the immigrationist policy pursued for decades in our countries which, by bringing more than 1.5 million immigrants in from outside Europe, is in the process of turning us into third world nations."
"Restoring national preference, which is fair positive discrimination, reducing the weight of immigration and thereby reducing the tax burden on our companies and employees, and implementing the principle of Community preference to protect the European market: these are the principal measures that should be taken to develop employment in Europe."
"in writing. - I salute the rapporteur's move to strengthen the social dimension of the Lisbon strategy."
"The call for the introduction of a balanced approach to 'flexicurity' and the introduction of a clause on active inclusion, I feel, will strengthen employment policy across Europe."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (PL) There are numerous contradictions in the report on employment policy in the Member States."
"The rapporteur writes that the renewed Lisbon Strategy is delivering results in, among other areas, a rise in GDP in the EU in recent years and a fall in unemployment, and that the employment guidelines do not need a complete revision, but merely amendments to a number of individual points."
"The rapporteur also notes that in recent years as many as 6 million young people aged between 18 and 24 have left school early and discontinued their education, and that youth unemployment represents 40% of total unemployment in the EU, with this percentage being twice as high among migrants."
"In addition 78 million people are living in poverty, which is twice the population of Poland."
"She furthermore considers the rise in the number of jobs obtained at the cost of a fall in their quality, and the rise in the percentage of people employed part-time and for fixed periods, often under the terms of contracts concluded under duress."
"Reality speaks for itself, but we do not always want to listen."
"The reality is that society is not integrating, but dividing."
"Poverty is not diminishing, but spreading with each year that passes."
"Discrimination against women, older people and migrants in the labour market is not falling, and stereotypes in thought and in action are failing to disappear."
"in writing. - (SV) By and large the content of the report is positive, but it is hypocrisy to speak of social responsibility, local economy and equality while at the same time seeking to ensure that procurement rules prohibit such things from being taken into account."
"I will not contribute to this."
"The report gives a false impression of reality, and I therefore abstain in the vote."
"in writing. - (PL) I support this report and Mrs Van Lancker's view that the common social objectives of the Member States should be better reflected in the Lisbon agenda."
"I also support the transformation of the current Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs into a strategy based on growth, jobs and integration."
"I feel it is essential to promote common social standards at EU level."
"The creation of quality jobs is necessary, along with a strengthening of the values of the European social model."
"In my view, one of the key tasks in the EU Sustainable Development Strategy is the establishment of an integrating society in which aims and operational strivings take priority in order to limit the number of people threatened by poverty and social exclusion and greatly increase the part played by women, older people and migrants in the labour market and promote youth employment."
"in writing. - This report sets some important guidelines in the budgetary process of the 2009 budget and, overall, we strongly agree with the rapporteur's determination to continue to respect the voluntarily imposed 20% ceiling on parliamentary expenditure."
"2009 will be a year that will bring much change to the way the Parliament works and we believe that, in order to maintain this discipline, it will be necessary to closely scrutinise all spending proposals to ensure that they deliver value for money to the taxpayer."
"In particular we make no apology for reminding the Parliament that the biggest single saving they could make would be to abandon the two seat working of the Parliament."
"We also strongly support the rapporteur's proposals to provide the means for the removal of asbestos from the Strasbourg Parliament buildings."
"British Conservatives look forward to receiving the rapporteur's further thoughts in due course, and therefore have abstained on the final vote on this report."
"I voted in favour of the report by my Polish colleague Mr Lewandowski on Parliament's estimate of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2009."
"This budget has to meet major challenges such as the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon if it is ratified by the Member States, the fact that 2009 is an election year for Parliament and the entry into force of the new Statute for Members"
"Although I obviously agree with the fact that we need to be vigilant about the status of budgetary expenditure, I think we must be unyielding over expenditure associated with multilingualism (translation and interpreting), which is a condition of the political success of the European Union."
"We should also develop facilities for MEPs to receive visitors because these visits are very much appreciated and help citizens to get to know more about the European Union."
"Finally, in my opinion we should increase the staff of MEPs and the European Parliament's committees in order to ensure their independence and the high standard of their work, for example, when dealing with the other European institutions, lobby groups or national parliaments."
"in writing. - (PL) The year 2009 will bring many challenges for the European Parliament, linked above all to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the elections to Parliament, the new Statute for Members and the change of term."
"The overall budget level for 2009 will have to meet the challenges despite being below Parliament's traditional voluntary limitation to 20% of outlay on administration."
"The use in this year's procedure of a pilot process involving early and closer cooperation between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets in the case of all items with significant budgetary implications is worthy of note."
"The new approach is aimed at ensuring the most rational use of available means and identifying potential savings."
"I must state my satisfaction at the sensible estimations of expenditure on the new Statute for Members, especially as there is potential to fine-tune the amount at a later stage."
"It is also pleasing to see the integration of the proposed 65 new posts into the estimates for 2009 with the idea of strengthening Parliament's legislative activity and services to Members, while at the same time placing 15% of those appropriations in reserve."
"The announcement that the priorities established in the 2008 budget will continue in connection with interpreting and with the analytical service of the library is also pleasing."
"A successful conclusion to this year's budgetary procedure will also require debates to be held and specific decisions to be taken without delay concerning Parliament's policy on real estate."
"The budgetary process has now begun with the submission of the Commission's proposed Community budget for 2009."
"In previous budgetary processes, the European Parliament's budget has accounted for approximately 20% of the amount budgeted under heading 5 - (administrative expenditure) of the multi-annual financial framework."
"The rapporteur is proposing that similar levels should be retained for the 2009 budget."
"Such a decision should not block or hinder the availability of financial resources required to respond appropriately to the needs already mentioned to increase the number of staff and improve interpretation and translation services, respecting equality and the right to use all the official languages in the European Parliament and the activities it promotes."
"Furthermore, this has been a recurring problem, since the need to improve services such as interpretation and translation is frequently mentioned, but the financial resources required are not allocated; rules created specifically to discourage the use of different languages are frequently applied."
"Just look at the criteria adopted in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assemblies."
"On the other hand the report makes no mention of guaranteeing workers' rights, in particular with regard to the EP's increased outsourcing of services over recent years."
"in writing. - (RO) The European Parliament should become aware of the importance of the principle of solidarity, according to which the regions that have remained behind or are less developed should be supported, including financially, from the European Union budget."
"Unfortunately, approximately one year since its accession, Romania continues to dominate the top regarding the Gross Domestic Product per inhabitant at regional level."
"6 out of the 8 regions are among the 15 less developed regions in the EU and the North East Development Region where I come from still remains the poorest of the regions in the 27 Member States."
"Romania's rhythm of economic growth is insufficient at this moment in order to very rapidly reduce the gaps that separate us and the disparities we find everywhere and the extremely low absorption of structural funds is certainly one of the reasons that place us near the top of the European Union poverty list."
"This is why the politization of the central administrative act makes Romania become a net contributor to the EU budget, paying approximately 1.1 billion euros last year."
"The only consolation that remains is that 16 million euros will be returned to our country due to the fact that 2007 was the first year in which a budgetary surplus was recorded."
"The employment guidelines drawn up by the EU in collaboration with centre-left and centre-right governments have been enthusiastically contributed to by the European Parliament's political representatives of capitalism."
"They promote the most barbarous exploitation of the working class in order to achieve the aim of the Lisbon Strategy, which is the unrestrained growth of profit for plutocrats."
"At the centre of EU and government policy is the notorious 'flexicurity', which spells out the complete dismantling of labour relations."
"The EU is using unemployment as a means of intimidating workers."
"It is doing away with collective agreements and full-time steady employment. These are being replaced with individualised employment contracts and mainly part-time jobs having precious little in the way of labour, wage, social, insurance or pension rights."
"The EU aims to strike a decisive blow against state systems of social protection, insurance and pensions in all Member States."
"In the mediaeval employment conditions being prepared by the EU, the 'model' employee as described in EU employment guidelines is an 'employable' person working under conditions of every conceivable form of part-time work."
"He or she has no rights, having been trained and retrained in disposable skills according to the capitalist needs of the time."
"He or she is constantly on the move in search of employment, works until advanced old age or even death, and provides untold riches to be plundered by the plutocracy."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Swedish fellow Member Mr Holm on trade in raw materials and commodities."
"I agree with the idea that there is a need to secure the European Union's supply of raw materials and to ensure access to raw materials on the world markets, while noting that the European Union currently does not provide a coherent strategy that would allow its economy to face the challenges to its competitiveness due to enhanced competition for access to raw materials."
"I am disappointed that the report does not discuss the issues linked to currency manipulation in the world which, together with reduced exchange rates, distorts fair competition."
"Among the raw materials, oil would have merited particular examination and I reiterate my proposal to create a European instrument for the annual regulation of crude oil prices, which is at least worth looking into - not to fight market forces, which we have to accept, but to regulate the suddenness of their application in the internal market and soften the impact of crude oil price rises in the cost/price chain of the sectors concerned (fishing, transport, etc.)."
"Mr Holm's report seems to identify fairly clearly the problems the world is currently facing because of the unprecedented rise in the cost of raw materials."
"For European countries without natural resources of their own, this means problems with competitiveness, and therefore jobs, security of supply, greater dependence, and so on, and for poorer countries, puts their development in jeopardy and causes food shortage riots and the like."
"Although some of the causes are mentioned, particularly the predatory behaviour of some emerging countries like China and the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, others - such as speculation, Europe's Malthusian agricultural policy emanating from Brussels, the principle itself of global free trade, etc. - are obscured or nearly obscured."
"As for the solutions, it is clear that Parliament believes essentially in the regulatory virtues of the free, competitive market."
"However, that market is now revealing its limitations, and cruelly so."
"Energy, food and raw materials are not just products like any other: people's survival depends on them."
"It is time that in its international trade relations, Europe, from Brussels, defended its own interests and those of its Member States first and foremost, instead of trying to create a globalist utopia at any cost, human or social."
"in writing. - (PT) This report considers aspects beyond traditional trade in raw materials and commodities."
"In the new international situation various production factors and components may be regarded as raw materials, including energy."
"The increase in the prices of those products is serious for European industry, which imports them from outside its borders."
"The markets respond to the increase in demand on the part of more producers facing natural and environmental condition and react to financial speculation."
"It is worrying that this international situation has encouraged price levels capable of wiping out economic growth in Europe."
"Once that trend is established, the race for resources will give rise to pressure and shortages which are likely to pose a challenge to many generations of managers and will certainly have implications for the governance of the modern world."
"By means of this report the European Parliament calls on the Commission to raise within the WTO issues of access to raw material markets."
"The objective is to obtain reciprocity and one appropriate route is via the WTO."
"Negotiations on these products should never go below regional level so as to promote integration, development and sustainability."
"In order to prevent major speculation and conflict, we must ensure that our trading partners holding these resources receive a fair price for their commodities."
"We do not share the vision with regard to trade in raw materials contained in the report."
"We do not agree with the criticism that describes policies and measures introduced by third countries as: 'creating obstacles to free and fair access to raw materials (...), which have the effect of limiting access by EU industries (!) to raw materials and commodities'."
"Each country has the inalienable sovereign right to decide how it uses its raw materials or how it trades in its commodities."
"It is for the people of each country to decide upon the use of their resources and of the wealth created."
"The report does not mention that the real problem actually lies with the EU's neoliberal model."
"Steeped in neo-colonial ambitions, it seeks to return many countries to the role of producers of raw materials for the countries of the EU, using technology and dominance and control of the market mechanisms - including financial speculation - to promote economic dependence and exploitation by the multinationals."
"What is needed is a clear break from the reigning economic and social model, ending dominator/dominated relationships, defending national sovereignty, developing the economic potential of each country and complementarity and solidarity in its external relations, and production geared to satisfying the needs of the people and to preserving the planet."
"in writing. - The report dealing with trade in raw materials and commodities expresses many important issues from a development perspective."
"The report emphasises the problematic occurrence of speculation in inflating prices and increasing volatility on the markets, which needs to be regulated."
"It also calls for more support for diversification in developing countries, and highlights the importance of policy space for these countries to enable the development of not least their agricultural sector."
"The report also criticises the increase of meat consumption, and asks for ways of tackling that."
"However, the report also expresses points, which we find deeply problematic."
"This refers foremost to the repeated emphasis on the international competitiveness and the urge for the European industry to secure cheap access to raw materials."
"We do not support this focus, and can only conclude that the neoliberal face of the EU once more has been articulated."
"In general the report is a step in the right direction compared with earlier positions of Parliament on trade policy."
"in writing. - I welcome Jens Holm's report on trade in raw materials and commodities."
"Free and fair access to raw materials is important for the EU economy."
"Nevertheless, the implications of price volatility in raw materials and commodities for developing countries also need to be taken into account."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - Some news, although good in itself, cannot fail to give us concern as regards the consequences."
"That is partly the case with the increase in the price of raw materials."
"The good news is that, as shown by various indices, an ever larger proportion of the world's population is attaining levels of consumption previously unknown to them."
"The problem, however, lies in some of the consequences, above all the immediate consequences that such growth in consumption - and therefore in demand - might have."
"The laws of economics apply even in distorted markets and an increase in demand results either in an increase in supply or, as in this case, in an increase in price."
"That is what has happened."
"The European Union should encourage a general opening up of markets, so that ever more producers are able to take advantage of the increase in demand and it should foster an increase in trade."
"At the same time we have a duty to provide direct support to those immediately hit by these new circumstances: those who are unable to face the increase in the price of essential goods."
"Market distortion rarely produces positive effects, above all in the long term, but there is nothing to stop us, quite the reverse, from providing funding for those who have less."
"in writing. - (NL) Something is clearly going wrong with the trade in raw materials and commodities."
"There is currently much speculation on the prices of raw materials."
"Minerals, for example, are fairly expensive."
"Despite their natural resources, countries that are rich in minerals are remaining poor or becoming even poorer."
"Developing countries are also unsure of their own food supply, despite the fact that they produce a great deal of food."
"The problem is that food is being exported on a massive scale at excessively low prices."
"Furthermore, climate change forces us to manage this energy-guzzling market differently: extraction of minerals is to be discouraged, and localised food production and consumption are preferable to the global trade in agricultural products."
"In short, the trade in raw materials and commodities, as regulated today, has a highly disruptive effect and requires a multilateral approach."
"The report on the trade in raw materials and commodities initially comprised a just complaint against the ultraliberal trade policy proposed by the EU in late 2006. In the meantime, however, it has been toned down to such an extent that I can no longer lend it my support."
"For instance, it contains barely any significant policy proposals."
"Even worse is the fact that the report labels free access to raw materials and commodities as a right of the EU and pushes forward a bilateral trade policy as the ideal instrument."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my French colleague and friend Mrs Sudre, which she wrote in response to the Commission communication on the strategy for the outermost regions (ORs)."
"I support the idea that taking into account increasingly mathematical justifications for the measures taken should not serve as a pretext for calling into question part of the Union's policy to assist the ORs nor deter actors by imposing conditions on them which are too difficult to meet."
"Community interventions should be a catalyst for a spirit of enterprise that will transform the ORs into centres of excellence, driven by sectors that fully exploit their advantages and know-how, such as waste management, renewable energies, energy self-sufficiency, biodiversity, student mobility, research into climate change and crisis management."
"Finally, I support the fact that the future common immigration policy should devote special attention to the position of ORs, which are all EU external borders."
"I applaud the job done by Mrs Sudre which, unremittingly and with a great deal of skill, determination and compassion, speaks up on behalf of the outermost regions."
"in writing. - (PT) The motion for a resolution in this report contains recommendations on the assessment and future prospects of the strategy for the outermost regions, including in particular:"
"indicators other than merely GDP being used to measure the degree of cohesion achieved;"
"cohesion policy being better coordinated with other Community policies across the board, so as to enhance synergies, and current and future European policies being more effectively adapted to the realities of the situation of the outermost regions;"
"policies and measures in their favour that are not transitional and are adapted to their different needs and offer solutions for the permanent constraints to which they are subject;"
"Community support for agriculture in the ORs and provision for support measures for their respective fishing industries;"
"differential treatment in the transport sector, particularly as regards the inclusion of civil aviation in the Emission Trading Scheme;"
"the need for the debate on the future of the strategy for the ORs to include Lisbon strategy implementation in their regard;"
"the future common immigration policy should devote special attention to the position of ORs;"
"placing ORs at the heart of EU maritime policy;"
"ensuring future Community funding of the strategy for the ORs and the compensation of handicaps linked to their outermost status."
"The report deserved my support and that of my group."
"I called for the report to be adopted and voted in favour."
"We regret that the majority in Parliament rejected our amendments seeking to incorporate into the motion for a resolution on the future of EU policy for the Outermost Regions (ORs) - adopted today in plenary - the valuable and important proposals in the interests of the ORs, approved in the Committee on Fisheries."
"Some people argue that it is a resolution on regional policy rather than on fisheries."
"That is a fallacy."
"The motion for a resolution is the EP's contribution on the future of Community policies for the ORs, and it is here in Parliament that we shall have to explain the proposals approved, in particular those adopted in the EP Committee on Fisheries - which is what happened with the EP resolution on maritime policy."
"That is why we sought to present them again and also to be consistent with the view which we take in Portugal."
"On the other hand, we regret the rejection of our proposal that clearly explained that the Community support measures for the ORs should be of a permanent nature."
"The rapporteur states that the aim is that eventually these measures will no longer be necessary."
"That is basically a (pseudo) argument to cover up the fact that the constraints faced by the ORs are permanent in nature and will need to be negotiated in every budget or Community framework."
"in writing. - (FR) France is very concerned about the European Union's policy on the outermost regions."
"It is essential that the specific characteristics of these regions be taken into account, much more and much better than they are now, by the politicians in Brussels, especially:"
"through trade policy, as production by the outermost regions is in competition with that of the neighbouring countries that benefit from highly preferential conditions from the EU;"
"through immigration policy, as these regions are particularly vulnerable to immigration and the influx of illegal immigrants is creating economic and social problems there that are far beyond the local capacity to overcome them;"
"through provisions concerning State aid and especially by maintaining the tax exemptions that these regions benefit from, which are periodically called into question in the name of European law."
"I am particularly worried about the legal ambiguity that exists regarding Saint-Barthélemy: this small French island has been a territorial authority since 2007, and when it changed its status it wanted to preserve the tax exemption that is essential for its economic survival."
"However, the EU appears to consider it to be among the outermost regions, in other words a territory of the Union that is subject to Community law."
"It would be unacceptable for this ambiguity to put at risk the desire for autonomy that was clearly expressed by 95% of the population."
"in writing. - (RO) The main issue of the seven ultra peripheral regions is that, although they represent 1% of the European Union population, they deal with a delicate economic and social situation, aggravated by their insular position far away from the continent, the difficult surface, relief and climate, as well as their economic dependence on a limited number of products."
"Taking the actions listed by the Commission and supported by the Rapporteur a priority, such as the improvement of competitiveness, reducing difficulties related to accessibility and integration of ultra peripheral regions into the regional geographic environment, we can contribute to improving the socio-economic situation of these regions, homogenising their development with the other regions of the European Union and turning to good account their resources complementarily with the Community requirements."
"This is also one of the reasons why I voted for this report and I would like to add the need to give increased attention to ports, since 6 out of the 7 ultra peripheral regions are islands."
"The modernization of ports infrastructure can contribute to the promotion and development of the tourism industry, production sector and local markets."
"in writing. - (DE) Supporting the outermost regions of the European Union is in keeping with EU thinking on solidarity in order to reduce the disadvantages generated by their being difficult to access."
"In particular, we certainly need to ensure that these regions do not lose their agricultural self-sufficiency capability, which also applies generally to the European Union as a whole."
"In this regard it must be our common endeavour to maintain small family farms - also those of hill farmers in Austria, for instance, as well as every individual traditional small, medium-sized and organic farmer - so that they can continue their ecologically useful work and we do not lose our food sovereignty to giant farms or become dependent on big agricultural concerns."
"For this reason I voted in favour of the Sudre report."
"in writing. - (PT) The ORs have specific characteristics that have come to be taken into account in measures to promote European growth and development."
"However, there is still much to do for further development of those regions and for us to draw more benefit from that frontier area with other global economic blocs."
"Cross-sectoral and complementary measures in favour of the ORs have helped to improve the economic and social situation of these regions and it is still important to work on improved accessibility, stronger competitiveness and better regional integration."
"Nevertheless, there are still difficulties on the ground that are not being taken into account, such as the preservation of traditional agriculture, increased support for the development of key sectors or the maintenance of differentiated tax regimes."
"Making the most of the specific assets of the ORs is thus the strategy that will ensure the sustainable development of the outermost regions in terms of attraction and cooperation."
"Making new priorities of climate change, demographic change and migration management, agriculture and maritime policy is a good measure that needs to be complemented by the necessary diversification of OR economies, by their specific characteristics and by exploiting the rules in force as widely as possible, using the most appropriate tools for resolving the specific problems faced by the ORs."
"I abstained from voting on the own-initiative report by my Finnish fellow Member Mr Lehtinen, in response to the Commission communication on Community consumer policy strategy for 2007-2013."
"I am naturally in agreement on the fact that the 493 million European consumers should be at the heart of the three main challenges that the Union has to face: growth, employment and the need to form closer links with citizens, and that they are the life force of the economy, as their consumption represents 58% of the EU's GDP."
"Nevertheless, I remain convinced that while we have succeeded with the internal market through competition; in other words paying particular attention to consumers, I consider that we should, in response to the current global challenges, place producers at the heart of our concerns."
"Moreover, in the absence of a serious legal study, I have considerable reservations about the hasty manner in which the report tackles the issue of collective action by consumers against producers by asking the Commission to put forward a comprehensive solution at European level offering all consumers access to collective appeal mechanisms for settling cross-border disputes."
"To offer consumers better protection, Mr Lehtinen's report proposes improving the existing legislation in the relevant areas, making it simpler and smoothing out any regional differences."
"The EU has a duty to develop a real transnational economic policy aimed at the protection of consumer rights and at safeguards for consumer health."
"The proposal in question - which I support - is intended to create a harmonious legal framework to guarantee a solid, integrated system for product safety and to instil real consumer confidence in goods on the European market, thereby triggering widespread growth in consumption."
"To arrive at an effective consumer protection policy, however, the EU must invest a great deal of energy in improving market surveillance, if necessary by stepping up international cooperation, and in education and awareness-raising campaigns for the consumers themselves: until consumers have been persuaded that its products are completely safe, the European market cannot realise its full potential."
"This would allow Europe to become a truly competitive market able to satisfy and protect its consumers and encourage them to be bolder: real players in the market, in fact."
"in writing. - (PL) I supported Mr Lehtinen's report because the transparency of the regulations protecting European consumers is beneficial to those consumers and also to manufacturers who are competing among themselves."
"Economic changes in the new Member States have brought about the introduction of new principles of action for market entities."
"The range of goods on offer to consumers today is increasingly rich in terms of both products and services."
"I nevertheless feel that the position of consumers, especially in the new Member States, where we all recall the beginnings of the free market, remains relatively weak vis-à-vis large concerns."
"It requires greater transparency and an upgrading of the relevant legal framework guaranteeing consumers suitable protection of their rights."
"I was also glad to accept that part of the report in which the rapporteur speaks in favour of support for small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU."
"In my region, Małopolska, such enterprises account for 95% of the total, and most of them have not been around for very long (30% are less than 5 years old)."
"A genuine consumer protection policy must obey various principles."
"Firstly, there must be a fair income distribution and redistribution policy, based on decent wages, adequate returns for producers, specifically small- and micro-scale farmers, manufacturers and traders, to encourage markets close to the areas where the food is produced and promote food security and sovereignty."
"Secondly, there must be an effective policy to combat speculative trade and finance, and there must be information for consumers and guarantee of transparency."
"The report, however, pays little attention to these issues; on the contrary, it advocates positions that are more concerned with defending the interests of economic and financial groups and liberalising services than with consumers as a whole, although in parts it does contain some positive proposals, except that this is in a totally neoliberal framework in which consumers are the weakest link in the whole process."
"For example, the report stresses that enhanced liberalisation of the services market in particular is needed to promote competition, thus offering lower prices for consumers, which we well know is contradictory and serves only the interests of companies."
"That is why we were unable to vote in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (PL) Consumers are at the heart of the common market and should therefore be its main beneficiaries."
"In my view, though, a balance should be maintained between legislation that strongly protects consumers and the conditions for the functioning of businesses."
"Nobody underestimates consumers' rights to press their claims."
"I think, though, that we should in particular provide consumers with the opportunity to put their rights into effect rapidly and effectively."
"In my opinion that extra-judicial means should be especially strongly emphasised when considering consumer complaints."
"I would like to make the point that, according to data from Business Europe, as many as 90% of disputes relating to consumer rights are settled without recourse to the courts."
"The cost element of proceeding in this way is also not without significance, as it is very much lower than when courts are involved."
"I feel that the amendment voted through in Parliament calling for the creation of a European system of collective redress does not guarantee more effective consumer protection."
"This matter should be considered by the European Commission, and we should delay taking a decision until such time as the results have been published."
"It may be that this matter is adequately regulated by the Member States' legislation."
"Moreover, I fear that this system creates conditions for actions the real beneficiaries of which will not be consumers, but the world of lawyers who profit from the rise in rates for proceedings conducted."
"in writing. - (SV) I think it is a good thing that the EU is taking responsibility for consumers and I therefore voted for the report."
"On the other hand, I am opposed to ideas of harmonising consumer protection in the EU and appealing to more countries to adopt the euro."
"in writing. - The report proposes to establish an EU consumer ombudsman."
"We are sceptical towards this idea for several reasons: This post may create significant expenses which risk undermining the funding of consumer organisations."
"Moreover, the creation of another post at European level risks being too remote from citizens."
"Having said this, we still support the report since its strengthens consumers access to collective redress, which is fundamental for consumers' trust in making safe cross-border purchases."
"in writing. - I voted against the Lehtinen Report on the consumer policy strategy because, whilst there was much in the Report with which I could agree, I fundamentally reject the call for enhanced liberalisation of services."
"It is true that certain services can benefit from a liberalised economic environment and the freedom of movement for services is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the EU."
"However I consider that public services should be run for the benefit of the communities and individuals they serve and not for private profit."
"Services in areas such as health, education and lifeline transport links should remain publicly owned, publicly accountable and the responsibility of Member States."
"in writing. - Lasse Lehtinen's report on the EU Consumer Policy Strategy 2007-2013 reiterates the need to empower EU consumers and enhance their welfare and protection across the Union."
"My vote reflects the need for improved consumer protection across the EU."
"in writing. - (PL) EU consumer policy strategy 2007-2013 presents the proper directions for the development of consumer protection, but the point should be made that ad hoc actions are far too little."
"We must draw up a plan for further specific and consistent steps that will lead to consumer protection becoming an element in all EU regulations."
"We must make sure that consumer protection itself does not become a separate area in European policy, but is written into every European policy establishing the European internal market."
"Without the proper protective mechanisms, this important European project of creating a single market will not be completed."
"We must also bear in mind that protection of EU consumers has an external dimension - one reminder of this at least being the recent problem with imported Chinese toys."
"Our aim should be to achieve full consumer confidence in all products on sale on the internal market."
"Furthermore, a true internal market should offer a European system of pursuing collective claims."
"In setting this up, we must draw conclusions from the US system of class actions, with all its drawbacks."
"in writing. - (NL) Mr President, in principle, the report by Mr Lehtinen has my support."
"As approved in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, it contains all the essential issues we must deal with in response to the Commission communication: the pursuit of a horizontal approach, attention to contract law, the acknowledgement of the role of consumer organisations, the need for balance, the particularity of SMEs, the importance of soft law and of an improved knowledge base, and the need for more attention to the services sector."
"We also consider the passage on access to redress important."
"This is a dimension of the maintenance of law and order."
"It is a pity, however, that an amendment to section 40 was adopted in the plenary sitting that favours group actions before an analysis is available, based upon the examination requested in the report."
"Group actions encroach fundamentally upon procedural law."
"It is therefore unacceptable to put the cart before the horse. This is why I have abstained from voting."
"I abstained from voting on the own-initiative report by my British fellow Member Mrs Lynne regarding the progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the Union since the transposition of the directives of 2000."
"I agree with the fundamentals of the principles laid down in the report, in particular in terms of non-discrimination in fields such as education, lifelong learning, employment, social protection, housing and healthcare, the images of groups that are victims of discrimination in the media and advertising, physical access for disabled people to information, telecommunications, electronic communications, the different methods of transport and public spaces, social benefits and access to them, as well as the goods and services made available to the public, etc."
"Nevertheless, I am not convinced of the need for a new directive on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community."
"The political debate needs to continue."
"To be continued ..."
"in writing. - Conservative MEPs abhor discrimination in all its forms: we have tabled our own amendments to this report to make this crystal clear."
"But while some aspects of ongoing discrimination may still be a problem, to suggest that more EU legislation is somehow the solution is way off the mark."
"The UK already has a full body of law regarding discrimination, which continues to prove difficult to implement in practice."
"There needs to be better implementation of existing laws, and better understanding of the problems in their implementation, before we go down the road of yet more EU Directives."
"This Report, an own-initiative Resolution calling for yet another 'comprehensive and broad' EU Directive against Discrimination, is at best political posturing and at worst an open-ended invitation to the Commission to produce yet more and more one-size-fits-all EU legislation in a very sensitive area."
"As one UK Chamber of Commerce member succinctly put it, 'Most discrimination is not going to be solved by extra legislation."
"Time would be much better spent on multi-cultural, multi-faith events to change perceptions'."
"We agree."
"in writing. - This report seeks to go beyond the competence given to the EU by the Member States in the area of anti-discrimination."
"The Treaties clearly set out those areas where the EU has the power to propose legislation and what Member States can do on their own."
"This report, which is an own-initiative report, i.e. there is no proposal for legislation from the Commission, goes beyond what the present Treaties allow and also goes beyond the position if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified."
"In fact, any anti-discrimination measures which fall within EU competence are a matter for our Member State Governments and each Government has a veto."
"This is NOT for the European Parliament."
"Under existing Treaty powers, all Member States must agree to laws in the area of anti-discrimination."
"Indeed Ireland has a very robust body of National anti-Discrimination law, e.g. Equal Status Act, and has an excellent record."
"Improving the rights of the disabled and specifically addressing restrictions to goods and services is commendable."
"This report, however, has gone beyond the competence of the Union and as such the Fianna Fáil delegation have rejected it."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Lynne on progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU, since we need to urge the European Commission to keep a strict check on the transposition of Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC on equal treatment between persons, and on the implementation of national laws based on those directives."
"I would stress that women are particularly vulnerable to acts of discrimination at work, above all as regards their maternity choices."
"The right to be protected against any form of discrimination is a fundamental and basic principle of the European Union, and yet effective legal instruments and implementation are lacking, so that it is in danger of being emptied of all meaning."
"The report contains some positive aspects, namely the insistence that the Commission and the Member States should end all discrimination based on the employment contract by ensuring equal treatment for all workers, health and safety protection, provisions for working and rest time, freedom of association and representation, protection against unfair dismissal, collective bargaining and collective action."
"It also emphasises the importance of access to training as well as the continued protection of acquired rights by covering periods of education and training, improved care opportunities, the maintenance of essential social rights such as pension rights, training rights and the right to unemployment benefits during changes in a person's occupational situation, between employment contracts and between dependent and autonomous employment."
"In view of all the above, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats tried to amend the report in various aspects, in particular as regards the content of the demand for a non-discrimination directive; they were not successful since the voting went against them."
"For our part we reject the PPE-DE's proposals and supported the rapporteur, although we disagree with some points in the report."
"in writing. - (FR) The Lynne report on combating discrimination in the Member States, in particular in employment, is entirely in keeping with the texts adopted by Parliament on this subject."
"Behind the general terms and the few mentions of women or the disabled, it is not at all difficult to distinguish the real, obsessive focus of your attention: immigrant populations."
"In order to evade the issue, everything is intentionally mixed together: discrimination against women, young people, the elderly, people of ethnic origin, etc., but also national origin."
"If there is any type of discrimination that can be perfectly justified morally, legally and politically, it is national and European preference in terms of employment and social benefits."
"Correlatively, your proposals for 'positive action', as you do not dare to use the real words, are well and truly reverse discrimination, the first victims of which would be, and already are, Europeans themselves in their own countries."
"You think, however, that this type of discrimination is normal."
"in writing. - (PL) As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I entirely support Mrs Lynne's report."
"I have no doubt that the international law in force and our own EU adjudications are - from a formal aspect - desirable and good solutions."
"I therefore regret that their entry into force is continually coming up against numerous obstacles, even in our Europe, which would appear to be more democratic and less discriminatory."
"It is astounding that we might need to call on EU Member States to treat the provisions of Directive 2000/78/EC with full respect and to carry out constant and systematic monitoring of progress in the elimination of all forms of discrimination from political, social and economic life."
"This is of particular importance for the citizens of my country, Poland, who, enjoying the benefits of the common market and freedom of personal movement, live and work in many EU countries."
"I am very sorry to have to say that there is increasing evidence of discrimination against my fellow countrymen solely on the grounds of their nationality."
"Disturbing information of this kind is increasingly coming to light from Germany, Great Britain and Ireland."
"It would be a paradox if the European Parliament were to become so heavily and effectively involved in combating manifestations of discrimination in the world yet were unable to cope with respect for human rights at home - that is, in the EU Member States."
"All EU citizens surely deserve equal and non-discriminatory treatment!"
"in writing. - I welcome Elizabeth Lynne's report entitled 'Progress made in equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU'."
"I believe that we should not be aiming to promote a hierarchy of discrimination in the EU."
"Colleagues in the Conservative Party obviously feel differently and I would defy them to find an explanation for a position that I find fundamentally indefensible."
"We need a horizontal Article 13 directive and I voted in favour of Ms Lynne's report."
"in writing. - The Fine Gael members of the PPE-DE Group, Mairead McGuinness, Avril Doyle, Gay Mitchell and Colm Burke abstained in the final vote on the Lynne report on 'Progress made on equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the EU'."
"The report points out and criticises Member States for 'deficiencies in the transposition and implementation' of Directive 2000/78/EC and calls for more rigorous monitoring of Member States' transposition and implementation as well as strengthening of EU law in this area."
"We support the call for full transposition and implementation of EU Directives, but note that infringement procedures against some Member States have still not been concluded."
"We strongly support measures to end discrimination, including additional measures, but cannot at this stage support a call for further EU Directives in this area."
"It is important that existing EU Directives are fully implemented and the Commission should continue to ensure compliance at Member State level before there could be any consideration of new EU measures."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for this report and I consider it important for the progress achieved, but especially for the future actions required in order to achieve equality of chances and the fight against discrimination."
"The provisions of this report represent one of the most progressive parts of the legislation, with real benefits for an important number of European citizens for increasing life quality."
"According to the data provided by the Commission, 51% of European citizens believe that not enough efforts are made in their country to combat discrimination and provide equal chances."
"77% of EU citizens believe that women are under-represented in management positions and 72% believe that the population over 50 is under-represented at the workplace."
"The success of the report is guaranteed by two things: important support of the population for adopting measures in order to combat discrimination, which would ensure equal opportunities for everyone, as well as our political solid commitment, of the European social-democrats, for building a society where nobody is excluded and where all citizens have equal chances."
"I congratulate Mrs. Lynne on the report."
"in writing. - (PT) The active and energetic defence of non-discrimination is not to be confused with relativisation in which everything is equal, everything is equivalent and all choices, options or circumstances have equal value in the legal order."
"For example, the promotion of policies protecting larger families in no way constitutes a breach of the principle of non-discrimination."
"Just as the refusal to set legal frameworks for all possible forms of relationships between human beings could not be compared to any type of discrimination."
"What I support, and think it is my duty to support in the field of non-discrimination is, above all, the defence of a broad concept of individual freedom and not a collectivist State view of freedoms, in which only what is promoted by the State is regarded as non-discriminatory."
"Society may and does have preferences, that find their expression in public policies."
"It cannot and must not impose conduct or restrict conduct that does not conflict with the freedom of third parties."
"There are currently no less than five directives on equal opportunities and non-discrimination in the European Union."
"Twenty-eight actions for infringement are in progress against Member States that have not transposed them."
"This can only be deplored."
"Nevertheless, should we systematically impose gender equality by force and through repression?"
"I do not think so, quite the contrary."
"Let us stop stigmatising this discourse on discrimination by classifying minority groups and populations as 'good', in particular immigrants, and making Europeans feel guilty as if they were constantly practising discrimination."
"We need to put an end to these leftist refrains that do not do anything to help people who are being discriminated against, who are on the contrary stigmatised by them."
"Let us place more emphasis on each person's personal responsibility to end discrimination of any kind and on the need, especially for immigrants, to adapt to our rules, our laws and our values."
"in writing. - (PL) Discrimination, both indirect and direct, with regard to gender, age or disability, is still with us in Europe."
"The Internet portal Pracuj.pl ran a questionnaire among people in work and seeking work, employers, students and graduates."
"According to the questionnaire, the social groups most discriminated against in the labour market are the over-50s and disabled people."
"The most common manifestation of discrimination in the labour market is employers being guided by prejudices and stereotypes when selecting a candidate for a job - nearly 62% of respondents saw that as a major problem."
"After that we have unequal access to job offers/lack of suitable job offers (56%), unwillingness to provide employment for an undefined period/on a work contract (44%) and lower-than-average pay for the particular environment or industry (43%)."
"My view is that an anti-discrimination policy, as one of the fundamental principles of the EU, has a very definite task to perform in this sphere."
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote for this own-initiative report since it contains several worthwhile considerations relating to the creation of a system for the sustainable ecological and economic management of the EU's marine environments."
"We have also chosen to support the idea of a European Maritime Day."
"There is reason for scepticism over grand campaigns launched by EU institutions, but in this case we chose to support the idea since the environmental situation in the seas is a matter of urgency."
"However, we think that the report contains passages which can be interpreted as being too favourably disposed to commercial fishing."
"The fishing fleets in the EU currently suffer from overcapacity and need to be reduced for the sake of the declining fish stocks."
"It is wrong to guarantee commercial fishermen jobs in fishing."
"Active vocational training projects are among many measures which can be applied to assist workers and regions which are dependent on the fishing industry."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my German fellow Member Mr Piecyk on an Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union, drawn up in response to a Communication from the Commission on the same subject."
"The maritime areas (two oceans - the Atlantic and the Arctic - and four seas - the Baltic, the North Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea) and the coastline (70 000 km) of Europe are essential to its well-being and prosperity; they are the trade routes, the climate regulators, sources of food, energy and resources, and popular places to live and for leisure among Europeans."
"I would like to add that they are a reservoir of water, which will be a rare commodity."
"In a context of globalisation and rapid climate change, there is an urgent need to act by establishing an Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union, based on the acknowledgement that all the issues relating to Europe's oceans and seas are linked to each other."
"Maritime surveillance, which is essential for ensuring safety and security in the use of maritime spaces, maritime space development, which is an essential planning instrument for making ecologically viable decisions and a complete and accessible source of data and information, are very interesting paths to follow."
"Europe, partly because of its strategic geographical location, must set an international example in its maritime policy, harnessing the economic potential of the oceans and seas as an invaluable source of renewable energy."
"Similarly, setting up regional centres of excellence and providing encouragement and support for university research centres already in coastal areas, accompanied by an action plan based on innovation, research and environmental protection of oceans and seas, would represent a further step forward towards fully sustainable use of marine resources."
"The report also suggests that the action plan must make an important contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the use of fair emissions trading systems, by consolidating research into the oceans and seas as a renewable energy source and by introducing equal tax treatment of electricity and marine fuels."
"This would mean that, when docked, ships would be encouraged to use a land-based electricity supply."
"Finally, the proposal for coordination between the European agencies responsible for maritime surveillance would discourage and prevent attacks on European vessels and at the same time combat illegal activities such as smuggling, drug and human trafficking, thereby rendering international waters decidedly safer."
"Given the opportunity to discuss Mr Piecyk's report on an integrated maritime policy for the European Union, I would like to draw attention to implementation of the Water Framework Directive, which envisages action aimed at the identification and disposal of chemical weapons left behind in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea after World War II."
"I am referring to the plans surrounding the NordStream pipeline, the construction of which may disturb weaponry dating back to World War II that is lying on the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
"According to preliminary estimates, there are somewhere between 40 000 and 60 000 tonnes of chemical ammunition, of which about 12 000-13 000 tonnes are poisonous combat material."
"We do not even have detailed information on the location of a large part of this weaponry, so the risk of a disaster is enormous."
"Moreover, when the pipeline is commissioned, chemicals may be used that are harmful to the environment."
"This may lead to an environmental disaster with very serious consequences."
"This constitutes a direct threat to the life and health of people living on the shores of the Baltic Sea."
"The report mentions bringing about a situation in which 'Europe's oceans and seas will be the cleanest in the world'."
"I am therefore appealing for the European Union to take specific action on an integrated maritime policy and to ban the construction of projects that threaten the safety of European residents."
"in writing. - (DA) Shipping must be included in CO2 quota trading."
"The socialist delegation is working to have shipping traffic included in the CO2 quota trading system."
"Although this mode of transport is particularly environmentally friendly compared with most modes of goods transport, shipping accounts for very significant CO2 emissions that clearly exceed the share from aviation traffic, for example, which is also set to be included in the quota trading system soon."
"Today, the delegation has therefore voted in favour of the point in the report on an integrated maritime policy for the European Union that clearly states that we must include shipping in the trading of CO2 emissions."
"We have therefore discarded an amendment proposal from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance concerning the same issue."
"It is unclear whether the Green amendment proposal refers to a specific model for emissions trading."
"If this is the case, we have had no explanation of what exactly it contains."
"At present, we therefore do not wish to adopt a particular model, which in the worst case could hamper and delay agreement on the inclusion of CO2 emissions from shipping."
"in writing. - (SV) We entirely agree with some of the views presented in this report, for example that it is urgent to combat sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions from ships and that the common fisheries policy is too bureaucratic and centralised."
"However, most of the proposals put forward are negative."
"We have trouble seeing what could be gained from the introduction by the EU of a 'European Maritime Day'."
"We also question the value of EU financing for maritime research and a plan to survey and map wrecked ships and submerged archaeological sites, and we are critical of the idea that EU institutions should address the subject of maritime spatial planning."
"The report constitutes a further example of how the European Parliament seeks to gain influence in ever more areas of policy."
"Respect for the subsidiarity principle, which is often paid lip service but seldom applied, is conspicuous by its absence."
"We cannot accept that."
"We have therefore voted against the report in the final vote."
"in writing. - (PT) We think that a maritime policy based on cooperation between the Member States, that add value and promotes policies and measures linked to the sea set by each country, could have a positive impact."
"Nevertheless the EP is reaffirming objectives - for the integrated maritime policy - although less strongly than in the previous report, that we cannot agree with."
"Apart from being imbued with a federalist and geostrategic vision of the use of the exclusive economic zones of each Member State, it advocates the rapid integration of intra-Community maritime transport into the single market, i.e., its liberalisation; it stresses the initiatives aimed at establishing a European coastguard, an area falling within the competence of each Member State; it advocates incorporating shipping into emissions trading - yet more bargaining; and, paradoxically (or perhaps not) it declares itself in favour of maritime policy being given appropriate consideration in the EU budget (?) after 2013; i.e., it is once more advocating centralised EU political and economic authority whilst offering nothing in return (even if that could ever be acceptable)."
"Certainly the EP motion for a resolution contains some proposals with which we agree - some of which we tabled - but they do not make up for the negative content of the motion for a resolution."
"We therefore voted against it."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Piecyk Report on the EU's maritime policy."
"I particularly welcome the section which recognises that the CFP has been an unmitigated disaster and that the EU must learn from its failures in delivering an integrated maritime policy."
"My own country, Scotland, is at the very heart of Europe in maritime affairs and we can benefit from an EU-wide policy which covers areas as diverse as the environment, transport, tourism and employment."
"However, recognition must be had for the diversity of Europe's maritime areas and decisions must not be taken on the ""one-size-fits-all"" basis which has come to represent Europe's failed fisheries policy."
"I voted in favour of this text because I consider it to be essential for the European Union to equip itself with an Integrated Maritime Policy as quickly as possible."
"The EU would in fact have a great deal to gain from adopting a coherent strategy for implementing the different sectoral policies that have an impact on the maritime field, such as for example certain social, industrial or environmental policies, and also promoting the establishment of a real 'mutually supporting system'."
"I also welcome the will to step up the fight against climate change and pollution through the emergence of real centres of innovation, which will also be a source of competitiveness and social welfare for the coastal regions of the Union."
"Finally, I support the report's proposals regarding the security aspect of maritime policy, and in particular the idea of drawing up common rules in this area and sharing surveillance methods within the Community maritime space."
"This would enable us both to combat maritime piracy, a phenomenon that we have seen the return of in recent years, and to protect the natural heritage and archaeology of these areas in order to prevent any catastrophes that would have disastrous effects on the development of the Union's coastline."
"in writing. - Willi Piecyk's report 'An integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union' addresses the challenges that Europe's maritime industry now faces."
"Its recommendations will help facilitate Europe-wide decision-making in the area."
"It is only in establishing an integrated maritime policy that global issues such as globalisation and climate change and their effects on our oceans can be effectively engaged with."
"I voted in support of the report."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express myself in favour of Mr Piecyk's report on an integrated maritime policy for the European Union."
"I agree that an integrated maritime policy is necessary not only because the oceans and seas represent one of the most important economic and trading resources for the EU and thus must be protected, but also because effective and sustainable concerted action between the Member States would improve the way in which it is managed and developed."
"One of the points I consider to b fundamental is that maritime traffic should be regulated and improved in accordance with the objectives for tackling climate change and that the marine resource should be the focus as a potential source of clean, alternative energy."
"in writing. - Our seas are our common resource."
"We need a coordinated approach against the exploitation and pollution of our seas."
"We can only do this by working across EU countries which have an interest in maritime policy."
"I hope that next year more EU citizens will be able to participate in the European Maritime Day."
"Perhaps, as next year this day will fall during the European Elections, all candidates will use 20 May to highlight maritime policy issues."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Misleading 'Directory companies' (e.g."
"'European City Guides') (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on misleading directory companies, (e.g."
"'European City Guides'), by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - B6-0152/2008)."
"author. - Mr President, the clear objective of this oral question is to get action and redress for the thousands of small businesses across the EU which are being defrauded daily out of millions of euros by sham European 'directory companies'."
"This Parliament has received hundreds of petitions and a mass of correspondence to our constituency offices from businesses who have fallen victim to these prolific scams against small businesses."
"We must, of course, recognise that these scams have been in existence for over 40 years, according to the legitimate directory publishers represented by the EADP."
"But this is without doubt a scam which requires a European response."
"As an example, the structure of the Maiwolf holding company, which owns the European City Guide and other such companies, is a complex web of European scam companies registered, operating and domiciled in several Member States of the EU and in the EEA countries Switzerland and Liechtenstein."
"Despite legal action and fines issued by courts in several Member States, it continues to operate, making a mockery of EU cooperation on law enforcement."
"Indeed it took seven years through the courts for the company to be shut down in Barcelona, only for it to immediately restart trading in Valencia."
"Maiwolf Holding is a hub of a web of companies operating scams not just at EU level but at global level and continuing - I am afraid - to escape the long arm of the law."
"By responding to the European City Guide, businesses were led to believe that they were simply responding to an information request or updating or correcting their data."
"They were led to believe it was a free service, and then suddenly they found themselves slapped with an invoice for thousands of euros which, if mentioned at all, had only appeared in very fine print in a confusing and misleading manner."
"The same Maiwolf holding company apparently also owns the debt collection companies which then proceed to harass, bully and threaten businesses to pay up."
"A website, 'Stop the European City Guide', that campaigns against the City Guide fraud, was also subject to legal threats and their ISP had to shut them down, although I am pleased to say that they are currently up and running again."
"Many of the activities of this fraudulent company are clearly in breach of the Misleading Advertising Directive of 1984."
"We need better and more coordinated enforcement to close the loopholes or gaps which are exploited by such companies."
"I can inform the presidency that my committee will review the implementation and transposition of the Misleading Advertising Directive and, of course, the new Unfair Commercial Practices Directive."
"We are particularly interested in the example of Austria's transposition of the Misleading Advertising Directive whereby businesses cannot be bound by a contract unless they have clearly and explicitly signed up to its terms and conditions."
"This is a model, Presidency, which I hope you will follow in discussions with the other Member States."
"Small businesses, of course, are not helped by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive as it does not cover business-to-business transactions - even for small businesses."
"Member States must make better use of the cross-border enforcement network to put these cowboy businesses out of business and out of operation once and for all."
"I certainly share with my colleagues here the sense of frustration of the many small businesses who for years, not months, have continued to suffer harassment and financial loss."
"If we believe, as we say we do, that small businesses are the backbone of the EU economy, then it is time to stand up for them, to defend their rights and to defend them against these fraudulent practices."
"I certainly welcome Commissioner Kuneva's interest and her commitment to monitoring their activities, but monitoring alone does not get results and does not actively target these companies."
"It is unacceptable, I believe, that the business complaints have fallen on apparently deaf ears and that the sole trader behind the City Guide has been allowed to continue to peddle his fraudulent practices without facing the full force of European law."
"So I am calling today on the Member States to urgently take action, to recognise the serious and damaging consequences of allowing this fraudster to continue to rip off our businesses."
"I want the Member States, and indeed the presidency, today during our debate, to commit to taking action, not just to debate the issues we have known about for many years."
"So I urge the presidency to answer these questions and to work together with us to find a resolution for the businesses who continue to suffer from this fraud."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) I should like to thank Mrs McCarthy for her question."
"My thanks go also to the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I shall try to answer the question within the framework set by Mrs McCarthy."
"With regard to the first question, namely what Member States have done to close fraudulent directory services, I must inform you that as yet the Council has not received a proposed solution from the Member States."
"Similarly, it has not been informed either of action taken by the Member States to close such companies or of the intentions of their competent authorities as regards exchanging data on the companies."
"With regard to the second question, about taking steps to close the loopholes in transposition of the Misleading Advertising Directive - the European Commission is responsible for this Directive and its implementation, as laid down in Article 211 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"So in my opinion, the European Parliament should address this question to the European Commission."
"In connection with these two questions, I should also add that as yet the Council has not been informed of what action the Member States have initiated to make the business world aware of the risk constituted by fraudulent directory services."
"With regard to the issue of extending the scope of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, I can, however, confirm to Mrs McCarthy that this Directive does not cover the cases described by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"In other words, it does not cover cases of fraudulent commercial practices targeting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The reason for this is that the scope of application of the Directive concerned is restricted to business-to-consumer relations."
"With regard to the possible extension of this Directive to business-to-business relations, I can only say that the Council will adopt a position on this issue as soon as an appropriate legislative proposal is put before it."
"I should, however, remind you that the Council has already debated the issue of whether the relevant Directive should also cover business-to-business practices, at the time when the Directive was adopted."
"I should remind you that in addition to the Commission, most Member States also rejected the idea of extending the Directive to cover unfair commercial practices that do not harm the consumer."
"Irrespective of this, however, I must emphasise that companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises, are not without protection against such practices."
"They are protected by the Misleading Advertising Directive."
"I should like to end by explicitly agreeing, on behalf of the Presidency, with the Committee's view that unfair and fraudulent business practices are unacceptable in any economic area."
"I also believe that action needs to be taken against such conduct."
"The Member States deal with unfair business practices as stipulated by their legislation."
"The example of the European City Guide, which you mentioned in your question, has also been brought before the courts in at least one Member State."
"I should like to thank you again for your question, and I shall in any case listen attentively to the debate."
"Mr President, when you open this directory - because this is a big, thick publication - you find hundreds of pages, with thousands of companies, very often small businesses that found themselves in this directory after being cheated."
"They did not want to be included in it, but were included against their wishes."
"Parliament's Committee on Petitions has received about 400 petitions from small businesses caught in this trap."
"I believe there are three aspects to this issue."
"Firstly, the small businesses involved are the victims of fraud."
"Secondly, there is a cross-border, transnational aspect, which should therefore be of interest to us in Europe, in the European Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission."
"Thirdly, companies like 'European City Guides' are profiting from shortcomings that exist in legislation."
"What is the European Parliament doing, besides what the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is doing, as Mrs McCarthy has told us?"
"The Committee on Petitions will be producing a report on this issue."
"I will be the rapporteur, and my report will have four aims."
"Firstly, it will aim to increase awareness of this problem, which is a big one."
"Secondly, it will continue to encourage the Council and the Commission, in particular, to take clear action, because if they cannot take action today, they need to be in a position to do so."
"Thirdly, we also need to determine whether there are legislative shortcomings, and this is the role of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"Lastly, it also needs to offer these victims useful advice."
"The Committee on Petitions will hold consultations and meet with the victims and social partners, as well as with the Commission, before adopting this report, which is expected to be adopted by the end of this year."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the activities of companies that carry on dishonest commercial and marketing practices are worthy only of condemnation."
"We must surely protect consumers' rights against such pseudo-market actions and support them in their battle against companies that, in the current European reality, see themselves as completely beyond punishment."
"Thousands of companies throughout Europe are taken in by allegedly free advertising in business catalogues, for which they are in reality required to pay anything from a few hundred to a few thousand euros."
"The publishers of these worthless catalogues - from a business as well as an advertising point of view - not only target specific industries, such as tourist agencies, hoteliers, doctors, restaurateurs and even the world of science, but also, unfortunately, approach state agencies and institutions."
"This is why EU citizens are asking how it is that the originators of such practices, who have after all been identified by their first name and surname as the proprietors of the companies publishing these catalogues, have been able to make a fortune using fraudulent and dishonest practices profiting from the fears of small European businessmen in the face of vindicatory companies and courts."
"I am consequently asking the Slovenian Presidency - and I am addressing the Presidency more than the Commission - to instigate coordination of action by Member States, mainly in the sphere of exchange of information and mutual warning against this type of fraudulent practice, to send out information concerning the owners and the boards of these companies, and also to propose the introduction of stricter penal sanctions for this type of activity."
"Continuation of the current situation will undermine the faith of businesses and citizens of the European Union in the idea of a European common market and will also, unfortunately, erode the differences between honest businessmen and quasi-Mafia activities."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, many thanks to Mrs McCarthy and the Internal Market Committee for presenting this question."
"I could wish that we had had a rather more robust answer from the Council, I have to say."
"The situation is absolutely unacceptable and I am going to start by making a confession."
"In the early 1980s, I was a lawyer in the UK, but I founded a practice with a lawyer in Germany."
"We started getting these demands that we had advertised our practice in a European City Guide and, even as a lawyers, we felt harassed and frightened."
"So if lawyers feel frightened by these people, I am sure ordinary small SMEs must."
"But the oddity of this is that EU law ought to be able to provide an answer and it is seemingly failing to do so, even after 20, 30 years that this has been going on."
"Indeed, if you read some of the letters from these people, they are even quoting EU law back at people to harass them even further as victims."
"And what do we get from the Council?"
"I am sorry, it is not good enough: well, we might look at misleading advertising and we will think about it."
"Thirty years on we really need something more."
"What are people meant to do?"
"We need a thoroughgoing debate about whether we should redefine who and what is a consumer."
"We tried to raise it during the discussions on contract law."
"We need to go further and deeper if we are going to deal with this problem."
"Lastly, if the Member States are too timid or too frightened to deal with this, let me make another suggestion that perhaps is a little contentious here."
"If the Commission gives us a substantial system of collective redress, let us call it class actions, then maybe citizens will be able to take action themselves if nobody else will do it for them."
"Now there is a thought."
"Mr President, four years later we are at last having a debate on the European City Guides."
"I could not carry down the files of complaints I have, as other colleagues have outlined."
"Europe gets beaten about because it does not connect with its citizens and here we have a golden opportunity - and I direct this to the Council - to connect with people who have a real problem and who are coming to their MEPs for a solution."
"It is not just businesses that are affected."
"I have heard from school secretaries who signed this in error and are terrified and who have paid over money."
"The tragedy with European City Guides is that it works because people are threatened and terrified."
"Whether you pay or not, they continue to harass and abuse people."
"But it is a European problem and therefore requires a European solution."
"I suppose I am celebrating slightly that we are having this debate and that my colleague, Simon Busuttil, is going to have a report and prepare information, but I think the Council needs to be a little more proactive on this, and indeed the Commission likewise."
"The question is very specific and it raises five key issues that need to be addressed."
"In my view, this problem is enormous but we need to have it quantified."
"Exchanging information is a great idea but it could cause frustration if we do not have action as a result."
"We must close loopholes."
"For example, in Ireland, European law is being quoted to those who have signed up to European City Guides."
"They are being told that they will be taken to court in another Member State and fined and penalised."
"They are getting phone calls with huge amounts of harassment to themselves and their co-workers."
"This is not acceptable."
"We definitely need to redefine what a consumer is because, as I said earlier, this is not just about business."
"But I repeat the point."
"We have a golden opportunity here to show people all over Europe that we are active on issues that are hitting them directly."
"Let us seize the moment and let us not waste it today with just words and no action."
"Mr President, the power of many of these fraudulent directory companies is that they are in another Member State, so they seem untouchable unless in some way the EU intervenes."
"They also instil fear in people, many of them very small businesses without any legal help or advice and many, after being harassed for years, eventually give up and pay the money."
"Like many of the other speakers, my office has been inundated with complaints, but usually from sole traders: plumbers, dentists, doctors, people who have been targeted by European City Guide."
"These people feel as if they are on their own, that they have just made a bad decision, that they got caught out and in some way they almost blame themselves."
"I find it unbelievable when I hear that the majority of Member States do not want any extension of the Directive to do something about the relations between companies."
"I just wonder, is it because the companies that are being targeted are small businesses, that it is not the big corporations that are being affected?"
"I believe citizens need more and better from the Council and the Commission than they are getting at present."
"I think the current situation is not good enough and I call on the Council to do something about it immediately."
"Mr President, I want to get straight to the point."
"Let me address this to the Slovenian Presidency; I think they have been great in their presidency."
"Minister Lenarčič, just let me give you four things that I would like you to bring up at your next meeting of the Competitiveness Ministers."
"The first thing, is for you to ask the Commission to take the SOLVIT mechanism - which is supposed to deal with every single internal market complaint, not just market-related ones - and put this firmly on the agenda."
"Get them to circulate the information that is already available on independent websites - and we should be ashamed of the fact that it is actually the people affected by this who have taken this up on their own - there is a lot of comprehensive information, and make that part of their remit."
"That could happen straight away."
"So that is your first task."
"The second task is that you should be saying to all your colleagues that their business information services (because they have services that reach out to SMEs) should also be circulating that information to them in their own languages and you should be putting just a modest amount of your budget behind to actually explain to businesses what is going on."
"Thirdly, give those to your law enforcement authorities."
"And, also say to the Commission and to the people who are running your consumer protection cooperation: put this on your agenda."
"It will not take very much to do."
"The information is there."
"It is not a difficult thing to do."
"So that is three things you should do."
"And the fourth thing you could do as well is to say to your colleagues this: these practices, if practised on individual consumers are absolutely illegal under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive."
"Everybody knows that is the case."
"And the companies affected are essentially taking on the role of private consumers."
"But, in individual Member States, in your process of implementing that (and I have to say by the way the Member States have not done very well in implementing it, and even my own Member State is actually well behind), you could easily include a clause specifically including directories and small businesses in your implementation."
"It would not take much to do."
"So there are four specific actions there."
"So I look to you, Minister, and we will look at the agenda, and we expect it to be on the next agenda of the Competitiveness Council."
"How can we go round saying to small businesses, 'participate in the internal market', if we cannot even give them the simplest of safeguards on a simple act like this?"
"It is a disgraceful neglect by all of us of our duties in the single market."
"Mr President, the European City Guide and the similar guides are essentially a bunch of crooks, but our legislation has not been good enough to enable us to deal with them."
"This question should equally have been asked of the Commission in terms of initiating a new legislative proposal to tighten up the relevant legislation so that we can deal with them, but pending that my advice to any small business faced with demands from European City Guide and similar guides is simple: do not pay; ignore them; ignore the pressure."
"An organisation has been set up called 'Stop the European City Guide', an association of victims of this guide."
"Their website had to be removed because of pressure and legal threats against their internet service provider to make them shut down their website."
"I now therefore host their website on my website so that they can continue to disseminate information as to how businesses can protect themselves."
"We need firm action on this."
"We need it soon."
"(PL) Mr President, may I congratulate Mrs McCarthy on an excellently prepared oral question on the subject of the dishonest practices of advertising companies based on 'European City Guides'."
"The Committee on Petitions, which I chair, has appointed Mr Busuttil to draw up a report on this matter."
"We have received an enormous number of petitions complaining about precisely this practice."
"The Commissioner said that the Commission has not received such complaints that might spur it on to launch an investigation into this matter but, the way I see it, this debate, along with the debate to be held on the basis of Mr Busuttil's report, will serve as an adequate reason for the Commission to take action in this matter, as these practices are hugely dishonest and harass small business and ordinary people - in other words, people who do not have armies of lawyers at their disposal to protect them."
"I urge the Commission to take action in this matter."
"Mr President, I have dealt with 19 cases of people who have been fraudulently exposed to expenditure and to debt actions because of European City Guides."
"Of those 19, 17 were small businesses that employed three people or less."
"And of those 17, six of them were elderly people over the age of 60 who were afraid of seeing a solicitor's letter coming in the door."
"The reality was that what actually happened here was a misrepresentation under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act or the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, as Mr Harbour was talking about."
"That in itself is a fraud because, if you agree to do something, you expect to get something in return that should be offered in consideration."
"What actually happened was a misrepresentation as regards the service that was being provided."
"I think, as some of my colleagues have said, this is probably a matter best dealt with at Commission level."
"However, it would be right that the Competitive Council and each Minister be made aware of it, and would be empowered to introduce legislation at a national level which may be quicker to do than to actually try and bring forward a revised European directive on this matter."
"Mr President, I just want to echo my colleagues."
"We have to stop passing the buck on this issue."
"We must stop allowing these companies to 'catch me if you can'."
"That is the game they are playing with this."
"I am not leaving the plenary, Minister, without some commitment to action."
"Mr Harbour gave you some ideas, but what I want you to do is to raise specific things that I did actually raise in my intervention at the beginning. I want you to raise at the Council working group the Austrian model where, under the Misleading Advertising Directive, they already ban these practices."
"Not all Member States do it."
"You could ask other Member States to follow suit, take the Austrian model and ban these practices by introducing amendments in their national legislation."
"I also want you to ask the Council to agree that we have cross-border enforcement networks for consumers."
"I want you to instruct them to accept, investigate and act on the directory companies in the context of the cross-border enforcement network."
"That, I believe, will enable us to have some action across the border and to stop these people escaping the long arm of the law."
"So, please, if I could have that from you, I think we can all go away somewhat happier."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) Thank you very much, Mr President, for allowing me to speak."
"I should also like to thank all our colleagues who have taken part in the debate."
"Let me start by making one thing clear. Nobody in the Council, neither the Presidency nor any Member State, supports the continuation, or even the occurrence, of fraudulent conduct in the internal market constituted by the European Union."
"Quite the reverse, and that is why this debate is so welcome, and why I personally welcome it on behalf of the Presidency."
"Secondly, I can assure you that the Presidency has taken note of the unanimous demands for increased activity and immediate action."
"You can rely on us to pass these demands on to our partners in the Council."
"Thirdly, I am delighted that the Committee on Petitions has decided to prepare a special report, and we look forward with pleasure to this report by Mr Busuttil."
"This should generate additional impetus for appropriate activities at European level."
"However, I should like to emphasise one thing."
"Mrs McCarthy, you mentioned the example set by Austria."
"Good examples certainly serve to encourage others to follow them."
"And I also believe and hope that this debate will play a part in this."
"I must stress, however, that the Commission is responsible for transposition of the directives."
"As has already been mentioned, and as you also thought in your question, this issue involves two directives."
"The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive does not cover this segment."
"One solution would be either to redefine the concept of the consumer or to extend the scope of application of the Directive."
"I expect both these options to be on the table when a decision is taken on these matters."
"We are aware that the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive has not been in place for long."
"It has only been in force since December, and I think we shall soon have to assess how it is being applied."
"Secondly, I wish to stress again that the Misleading Advertising Directive covers this area."
"Swindles and fraud of this kind definitely involve misleading advertising, which means that certain legal remedies are already available."
"Finally, let me stress again that I have followed the debate very attentively, and that the Presidency will convey the mood of this plenary to Council members."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - The 'European Cities Guide' and similar outfits are fraudulent operations which specifically target SMEs."
"They urge companies to sign up to directory services which are presented as being free of charge."
"However, due to dubious and complex 'fine print', theses schemes then proceed to harass people for money in an extremely threatening and malicious manner."
"Ironically, these fraudulent companies quote EU law in order to intimidate their targets further."
"Of course, these scams represent no value whatsoever to the consumer or businesses."
"In fact, they flout numerous examples of EU legislation, such as the 1984 Directive on Misleading Advertising."
"This problem is evident in countries throughout the EU and therefore requires urgent action."
"The solution lies in EU level cooperation, namely in the form of some tough legislation."
"We must ensure that any EU directive tackling this issue contains no loopholes and that it is satisfactorily implemented in all member states."
"I call on the Council and Commission to assist the work of Parliament and take action which reflects the urgency of this situation."
"If we are encouraging our SMEs to compete within the single market, we must at least be able to guarantee their protection against these appalling scams."
"Conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator - International carriage of passengers by coach and bus (recast) - International carriage of goods by road (recast) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by Mrs Ţicău, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator - C6-0145/2007 -;"
"by Mr Grosch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services (recast) - C6-0147/2007 -; and"
"by Mr Grosch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international road haulage market (recast) - C6-0146/2007 -."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) Mrs Ţicău, Mr Grosch, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission published draft legislative instruments in July 2007."
"These were the proposal for a regulation on common rules for admission to the occupation of road transport operator, the proposal for a regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, and the proposal for a regulation on common rules for access to the market for transport services by coach and bus."
"The Portuguese Presidency began work on the regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, and the Slovenian Presidency continued this work and also opened the other two dossiers."
"In parallel with the work in the working group, we also began informal talks with rapporteurs in the European Parliament."
"At the April meeting of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy (TTE) Council, ministers conducted a political debate based on a package with the main issues, with the following results."
"Firstly, with regard to the regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, the key question of cabotage remains unanswered."
"Most Member States essentially supported the compromise decision under which three cabotage trips are permissible within seven days after unloading in the host Member State."
"However, quite a lot of Member States, who were also supported by the Commission, called for transit cabotage also to be made possible, to avoid empty road traffic."
"The Presidency is currently endeavouring to find a compromise solution in the Council."
"Secondly, with regard to the regulation on admission to the occupation, a compromise needs to be found on the national electronic register and the register of transport undertakings."
"In fact we shall soon be agreed on the timetable for establishing this register."
"Thirdly, with regard to the regulation on international coach and bus services, the debate needs to be continued at working-group level."
"We have agreed that the solutions in the other two regulations should also be applied analogously in this regulation."
"The Slovenian Presidency will be endeavouring to achieve political agreement on these three proposed regulations in the TTE meeting on 13 June 2008."
"I wish to emphasise that we shall try to take your requested amendments into consideration as far as possible and thus, to a great extent, bring our points of view into line with one another."
"The Slovenian Presidency wishes to help to consolidate and complete the single market."
"I am convinced that the fast-growing road transport sector constitutes one of the foundations of the single market for the free movement of goods and passenger transport, and that the Community's legal regime needs to be modernised, in order to be made more efficient, to have greater control, and to ensure honest competition."
"The Slovenian Presidency unreservedly supports the aims set out in the proposals for the three regulations."
"I should like to emphasise that the Slovenian Presidency is aware of the existing restrictions in the European Union's transport market, which means that it sees its task as lying not only in strengthening the rules and control mechanisms for cabotage, but also in introducing uniform rules for access to the occupation."
"The electronic registers in particular will help to improve efficiency and transparency in the transport sector and to effect a substantial reduction in the administrative burden."
"Lastly, I must thank MEPs and, in particular, the rapporteurs Mr Grosch and Mrs Ţicău for the constructive exchange of views."
"Let me say again that the Slovenian Presidency will do everything in its power to achieve a balance between the various interests, and also to ensure that the solutions we accept will make the European road transport industry more efficient and more competitive."
"At this point, I should like to say that it is my hope and wish that we shall continue the constructive dialogue, and that the European Parliament will achieve a consensus as soon as possible."
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) Regulations regarding access to the international road passenger and freight transport market, together with the Regulation regarding access to the profession of road operator form a package."
"These subjects are inextricably connected."
"I am very pleased to see these three texts subject to a vote today in order to establish your position at a first reading."
"I thank your Rapporteurs, Mrs. Ţicău and Mr. Grosch, for their work, as well as all the members who have contributed to it."
"A rapid agreement is necessary for the following reasons: the European Council of March 2007 expressed its wish in this respect; the sector in question, more than 900,000 enterprises, wants to harmonise the conditions for access to the profession in order to have a loyal competition and clear rules regarding this restricted but delicate problem, namely cabotage."
"15 years after the first regulations regarding access to road transport, the market continues to be fragmented, with 27 national versions of rules as regards the control of access to the profession and the definition of the good repute required for this access."
"I will also remind you, one more time, of the divergent interpretations of the notion ""temporary” as regards cabotage."
"Consequently, it was about time to stimulate the progress in integrating the internal market in the field of road transportation."
"A rapid agreement is possible."
"I have the feeling that the Council's and your positions can be directed even more toward a common point."
"With the help of the Slovenian and the French Presidency, I believe it is possible to reach an agreement soon."
"I can assure you of my support, at least in principle, regarding most of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Since the detailed position of the Commission regarding each amendment submitted has already been transmitted to the relevant Parliament service, my reserves or observations will focus only on a few matters."
"The first one, the matter of the cabotage, seems to be a major item of this package."
"Yet, no solution will be good unless it is controllable."
"The essential quality of the Commission's proposal is precisely the clarity, simplicity and controllability of the mechanism introduced: three operations within the seven days following an international transport."
"This relation to an international transport is generally recognized and, exactly for this reason, I understand the interest raised by amendment 17 of the Grosch report, which provides the performance of cabotage operations in a transit country on the shortest way back."
"Nevertheless, the proposed formulation makes the amendment difficult to control - and I cannot support it for this reason."
"On the other hand, in order to avoid empty races, I believe we could control a provision saying that one of the three operations within seven days can be performed in a transit country within a maximum of three days."
"I would have no trouble with supporting an amendment in this respect."
"It is the same with amendments 18, 37, 40, 44 and 47, which provide that restrictions regarding the number and duration of cabotage operations shall be eliminated gradually, until their complete elimination in 2014."
"We have to take into consideration the market reality in various Member States."
"The fiscal, social, and salary conditions are still very disparate due to the absence of sufficient harmonization and I am afraid they will remain the same in 2014 as well."
"The proposed package will certainly contribute to this harmonization as regards the control of access to the profession but it could not guarantee a sufficient degree of harmonization by itself."
"Under these circumstances, an automatic liberalization of cabotage would result in a deformation, and not a consolidation of competition conditions."
"Therefore, a clause of subsequent review of this matter seems more appropriate to me."
"I mention that, until this review, it goes without saying that the regulation does not prevent Member States in any way from completely opening their cabotage markets provided that they do this without any discrimination against the other Member States or under agreements between the national governments prior to the Community rules in force regarding market access."
"Amendment 21, as formulated, omits these specifications and, consequently, cannot be supported by the Commission."
"As regards access to the profession, the aspect of good repute and serious infringements of the law is essential."
"I believe the procedure you propose, regarding the withdrawal of good repute in case of a serious infringement of the law, has a great dissuasive power, still remaining appropriate."
"I welcome in particular amendment 104 of Mrs. Ţicău's report, which provides a very clear list of these infringements."
"Therefore, we can support the Parliament's proposal as regards article 6."
"The European Companies Register has a special importance in guaranteeing the control of good repute."
"In this respect, in principle, we support amendments 70, from 72 to 78 and 114, which provide for a rapid and progressive introduction of interconnected national registers."
"Lastly, the draft regulation allows small businesses to resort to so-called external administrators."
"In other words, they are administrators who do not work directly in these small businesses."
"Amendment 27 does not establish limits for this possibility which, in my opinion, should remain an exception and not become a rule."
"Therefore, I cannot support it."
"Yet, I could support amendment 109, which provides for a reasonable limit of 50 vehicles."
"Finally, as regards the issue of the 12 days, I remember the former amendment 102 in Mrs. Ţicău's report, which refers to the reintroduction of the so-called 12-day derogation in the case of coaches."
"I agree with the plenary session's choice to vote this amendment in Mr. Grosch's report regarding buses."
"The Commission has not adopted a position on the content for the moment."
"At present, the social partners are working on this subject and we have to wait for the result of the first exchanges in order not to legislate in a hurry."
"A more detailed re-examination of this matter will be necessary as soon as an agreement is reached between these partners, yet without slowing down the progress in reaching an agreement on cabotage and the register."
"Rapporteur. - (RO) I would like to begin by thanking the Commission, the Council, the Co-Rapporteurs, in particular Mr. Grosch, Mr. Sterckx, Mrs. Lichtenberger and all the colleagues I worked with in making this report."
"The Proposal for Regulation regarding access to the occupation of road transport operator is important because it concerns 4.5 million employees in the field of road transportation and over 900,000 European companies."
"We tried to have consultations that were as comprehensive as possible with those operating in this field and for this purpose the TRAN Committee organized a public debate last October in order to gather as many opinions as possible regarding the proposal for regulation."
"The Regulation replaces Directive 96/26, which was implemented differently by Member States."
"The Proposal for Regulation establishes common criteria according to which a company has access to the occupation of road transport operator, a stable headquarters, management from an operational centre, access to a sufficient number of parking spaces, criteria to prove the financial standing, good repute, the transport manager's role and the conditions he/she should meet, and here I refer to the certificate of professional competence and good repute, as well as the Member States' obligation to create national electronic registers to be interconnected."
"193 amendments were submitted to the TRAN Committee, which have brought changes to the Commission's proposal."
"Thus, the Parliament, the TRAN Committee opted for a text that refers only to severe and very severe infringements, the latter being well-defined in a new appendix to the Regulation and, for the severe infringements, the Commission shall come up with a list of infringements whose repetitive nature can result in losing the road carrier licence."
"This list will be approved by the procedure of control regulation."
"As regards the national electronic registers to be interconnected by 1 January 2012, they will be developed starting from a minimum common structure, which shall be presented by the Commission by 1 January 2010."
"The electronic registers will have a public section and a confidential section."
"The public section shall contain data on the road transport operators and road transport managers and the confidential section shall contain data on the infringements committed or the sanctions enforced and shall be accessed only by relevant authorities, in compliance with the provisions regarding the protection of personal data."
"I emphasize the fact that these confidential data can be kept in separate registers."
"As to obtaining the certificate of professional competence, the TRAN Committee opted for eliminating a fixed number of training hours and replacing them with the obligation of a written examination followed by an oral examination as well, according to the decision of each Member State."
"Another amendment proposed stipulates that a transport manager shall be sanctioned only for the facts imputable to him."
"Thus, any sanction decision can be disputed and the recording of sanctions in the electronic register will be made only after a final decision in this respect."
"The TRAN Committee considered it was sufficient for a company to prove its financial capacity based on the annual accounts examined by an auditor or a properly accredited person, based on a bank guarantee or another financial instrument, for instance insurance."
"Therefore, the minimum 80% limit for immediate available funds was eliminated in favour of a minimum threshold for capital and reserves."
"The TRAN Committee also considers it important that the euro value be established every year and not every 5 years, as provided in the Commission's proposal."
"We also proposed the elimination of article 22 from the Commission's proposal, which established certain rights of priority differently for various Member States and amendment 52 was introduced, which allows people who prove that over the last 10 years prior to the effective date of the regulation they continuously administered the road transport activity to be exempted from examination."
"We proposed to limit the number of vehicles administered by an external manager to 50, and the number of companies to 4."
"As regards the internal transport manager, the socialist group proposes to limit the number of vehicles directly administered by a transport manager to 250."
"We believe this is necessary because the transport manager should also have decent working conditions."
"Two amendments regarding the 12-day derogation in relation to the rest period of coach drivers for international passenger transport were also submitted in the TRAN Committee."
"An agreement between employers and trade unions is expected in this respect and, for this reason, the two amendments will be submitted again in Mr. Grosch's report."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I should also like to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteur, the Council and the Commission for their effective cooperation."
"I believe we have been trying to create a complete package in order to maintain a certain coherence between the three reports."
"At first glance I would say that Parliament to some extent leads the way."
"We were perhaps hoping to have achieved a result already in an unofficial trialogue."
"However, Parliament can now point the way."
"I am convinced that the Council can very usefully take on much of what has been debated here and will be agreed."
"The transport manager, as just stated, plays an important role in access to jobs."
"I believe it is important that we shall know tomorrow how enterprises are structured in an international sector such as this, who takes responsibility there on the one hand in terms of finances and reliability, but also on the other hand in terms of the important regulations on transport."
"If we are working at international level tomorrow, it is important to know how partners are structured and that we can rely on them."
"We have tried to organise this as simply and transparently as possible in administrative terms."
"We are, however, very much counting on the Council's cooperation because the information network we want to create must be transparent, efficient as well as readily available."
"Any kind of delay here is unnecessary in our view, because progress on this can be very quick thanks to today's information technology."
"The preconditions for jobs are also clear."
"We do not want any special conditions for people who already have work experience and have proved they are reliable."
"We would, however, like this also to remain verifiable at regular intervals."
"In terms of market access, transport by bus is somewhat easier."
"We have also sought coherence there with access to jobs."
"We in Parliament have set our priorities on focusing for the time being on serious offences."
"An exchange of information on minor offences between countries in future was really not what we were after."
"If we have good information available on serious offences, we are already a major step ahead."
"In our view existing treaties should not be jeopardised."
"In addition, we believe public urban transport is already protected by its own regulations and it is incumbent upon the Member States to check whether or not problems are occurring there."
"The 12-day regulation is already the subject of debate here, of course, and as has just been mentioned, Parliament had already requested this 12-day regulation before, but it was not resolved under the British Presidency at the time."
"Parliament has always spoken out clearly on this because we are not just market-oriented."
"We have also been considering safety criteria and we wanted to take this subject up once again."
"I hope that this Parliament will find the right time as well as the correct formula for adopting this subject."
"Finally, access to road haulage: the famous concept of cabotage is, of course, enormously important here."
"In simple terms it is ultimately about somehow regulating what is referred to as the Services Directive in the transport sector."
"How should I, if I come from a third country, provide services in another country?"
"Should I be doing this indefinitely?"
"Should I be doing this under just any conditions?"
"This is ultimately the key question."
"We are not talking about large transport companies here, but about smaller enterprises."
"On the one hand we are accommodating the environmental aspect by wanting to avoid empty runs, but on the other hand we should not - being well aware that the social as well as the fiscal conditions differ greatly from country to country at the present time - be encouraging direct dumping in these two sectors either with this regulation."
"Limiting cabotage operations to three a week is at least in my view a clear statement."
"This is much better than the term 'temporary', which would virtually have meant 27 countries having 27 different legislatures in the next few years, which would definitely not have been beneficial for the sector."
"I believe the regulation is clear."
"The fact that this now has to be completed within a reasonable time is, in our view - I am now speaking for myself - plain sailing insofar as the differences in terms of wages and taxes are being abolished."
"We have also been examining cabotage rather more realistically and this means we are already able to start after the first unloading."
"Unlike the Commission, I am of the opinion that cabotage must be possible on an international journey as well as on the return journey."
"We therefore also want some coherence in market access in terms of serious offences and information about them, just as we also want to simplify the administrative procedures."
"Finally, an appeal once again to the countries themselves."
"With these regulations, as we have been debating and adopting them here today - particularly with regard to cabotage - there is little sense in going into too much detail when the countries as a whole are not being given the necessary funds to carry out accurate monitoring of these cabotage journeys."
"There is not a vast amount of work."
"In our view it entails eventually harmonising the management documents on the one hand, and on the other hand getting to a point where total cabotage expenditure of 2% is properly monitored at European level; for certain countries, however, this does mean 30-40% of the work in this sector."
"I believe that only then will what we are doing here make sense."
"Certain details, which we disregard, will then make sense, too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on behalf of my group: firstly Mrs Ţicău, and secondly my colleague Mr Grosch."
"They have done very good work: they have attempted to bring together the various conflicting opinions within the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Our group supports in principle the Commission's proposed new regulations for conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator and for access to the market for coach and bus services and access to the international road haulage market."
"However, our amendments call for further steps towards harmonisation and liberalisation."
"May I point out that we are still aiming towards the idea of the European internal market, which was actually supposed to be introduced in 1958."
"The Council has long been reluctant, but the European Court of Justice said in 1985 that we must also establish the European internal market in the transport market, so we must become a little bolder in this respect."
"A brief comment on the topic of licence to pursue an occupation."
"The demand that the Commission develop an integrated register of infringements of road transport legislation by 2010 is very important because Member States must be able to decide on the withdrawal of licences, for example, according to unified criteria."
"We must consider not only licensing, but also withdrawal of that licence."
"If we want to eliminate the black sheep, we must decide on the matter of withdrawal of licences according to unified criteria and, in this respect, I hope that the Commission will undertake to produce a unified register by 2010."
"With regard to access to the market for coach and bus services, I believe that we ought finally to make the internal market a reality, step by step."
"Therefore, I hope that the Commission will support us in making it no longer necessary to obtain authorisation from another Member State for cross-border regular services not extending more than 50 km beyond the border."
"This is nothing less than protectionism rearing its head."
"With regard to access to the international road haulage market, we must stop cabotage at some point. It makes no sense in a common internal market."
"The point of a common internal market is that every business must be able to offer its services in every part of the Community."
"For environmental reasons, I would say to Mrs Lichtenberger that if I want pointless return trips to stop, then I must find a sensible way of making it possible for providers to undertake trips within other countries."
"Do not come to me with conditions!"
"We are talking about doing away with cabotage in 2014."
"There are still six years to go."
"If we cannot manage to harmonise the conditions to some extent in six years, then we will never manage it, and you will still be promoting cabotage regulations in the year 3000."
"I am familiar with these sorts of stories from Hamburg, because we always thought that our neighbours outside of Hamburg would pay incredibly low wages."
"We must see to it that we create an internal market."
"My most important point is the issue of the 12-day rule."
"Here we must simply draw clear lines."
"We need the 12-day rule for occasional cross-border coach services."
"It is not helpful when the operators and the unions now say: 'We are about to reach an agreement.'"
"We must make a statutory ruling."
"We must pave the way for revision of driving and rest times."
"I am more than willing to discuss details of implementation with the unions and operators later but it is for Parliament to legislate the provisions on driving and rest times."
"We have clear proposals, which were supported by a majority in committee, and I would ask you to vote accordingly tomorrow."
"Mr President, Mr Jarzembowski, the reason the state of Hamburg now has a black-green government is so that the Conservatives can learn a thing or two about all this."
"That is excellent."
"I would first like to congratulate Mrs Ţicău, as it is her first report."
"She did a very good job, as of course, did Mr Grosch, of whom Parliament has come to expect good reports."
"I was somewhat startled by the questions put from outside."
"We are not trying to reinvent road transport with these three reports, but rather to determine how best to organise it and also ultimately how to raise the safety criteria, because there are a great many companies that want to use the roads."
"Finally, we are also interested in how social protection is connected with all this."
"The freeing up of cabotage should not really pose any problems either."
"As has already been mentioned, unladen journeys are of no benefit to anybody."
"They make no sense at all."
"However, we do need to ensure that the situation does not get completely out of control."
"Therefore, it would make sense for us to resolve tomorrow that we will check, in 2012, what has happened by then, and how everything has developed, so that we build in some reserve, as it were - and there is an amendment in this vein by Mr Grosch, which we support."
"By 2014, when everything is supposed to launch fully, it also should be provided with a safety clause."
"In the event that serious disruption to the market does occur, a Member State can then say 'We are pressing the emergency button and going to the Commission."
"This is a case that requires a remedy.'"
"My final point concerns the 12-day rule."
"I have always supported it; we supported it at the time."
"Now, however, a new situation has arisen, in which the unions and the hauliers have reached an agreement."
"That could cause problems with the amendments."
"Therefore, tomorrow, we would be very much in favour of postponing by a month acceptance of the report that contains the part about coaches and deal with it later, in June, when it is fully ready."
"To do it that way would make sense and would also involve the industry."
"on behalf of the ALDE group. - (NL) I should like to quote from the White Paper: 'Nowadays, lorries are no longer forced to return empty from international deliveries."
"They can even pick up and deliver loads within a Member State other than their country of origin."
"Road cabotage has become a reality.'"
"This is what the European Commission said in 2001."
"Since that time, a number of Member States have once again introduced a number of restrictions and so, once again, we have a fragmented market that we did not have in 2001."
"What does the Commission say now?"
"We shall mould this fragmentation into rules so that the fragmentation is the same for all."
"I am therefore very disappointed - I even said so to Commissioner Barrot - with the Commission proposal, which means a step back in comparison to the 1993 directive."
"Fortunately we have been able to do something about this but, in my view, nowhere near enough."
"What is it that we are doing, then?"
"We are spending billions of euro via Galileo in order to ensure that we know where the transport is."
"This means that a transport company can organise its operation efficiently throughout the European market and then we say: no, stop, bureaucracy."
"You must submit papers despite being busy."
"You must do all kinds of things that mean you operate less efficiently and even possibly see your lorries returning empty."
"That is what the Commission is now saying, and I find it a major disappointment that the Commission even dare put it down on paper."
"Therefore, in this instance, I believe that the social aspect is a kind of excuse that is very readily used."
"Otherwise, why would the French authorities approach Belgian transport companies to find out whether they are conducting no cabotage or too much cabotage in France?"
"The wages in Belgium are higher than in France, not lower."
"This is not a social issue; it is about protecting a country's own market."
"The result, therefore, will be greater environmental damage followed by, within a couple of weeks, Commission proposals for green transport."
"Congratulations!"
"Fortunately, therefore, we and the rapporteur have been able to do a number of things about this."
"I hope that these make it through."
"We have the prospect of an open market by 2014, but this is not enough as far as I am concerned."
"I would prefer to see this achieved by 2012."
"Nor do I believe that we require new studies."
"This time, we must truly throw open the market - and, Mr Piecyk, I agree with your amendment - in order to ensure that action is taken in the event of a disruption in the market."
"This action must be taken in an open market, however, not by creating additional obstacles in a market in which there are already hundreds."
"With regard to the report by Mrs Ţicău, I am in full agreement with a strict approach towards people who are starting out in the business."
"Incidentally, I have made the requirements even more stringent on a number of points."
"I thank the rapporteur for entering into discussion with me in this respect."
"If we are strict towards the players in the market, therefore, we must also ensure that the market is truly an open one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cabotage sounds like a good idea."
"Preventing unladen journeys also reduces emissions and, after all, the transport sector also has an obligation to finally start reducing emissions."
"It is just a pity that, in the past, this regulation was frequently abused, to disregard social standards and to use dumping prices to gain market share."
"The rapporteur has therefore generously chosen an approach that takes this into account."
"Monitoring of everything that is decided here is crucial - and that is also my appeal to the Member States."
"Otherwise, none of it will work."
"I can therefore agree with this part of the package."
"That is not quite the case with the report on coach transport, however, where some members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism expressed a wish to include the famous 12-day rule on driving and rest times again, and the very well organised bus lobby has been providing us with an excessive amount of information for months on end, in order to achieve this."
"However, far too little effort was made to canvas the opinions of employees working in this industry."
"I could not support this regulation, purely because of the amendments."
"However, if an agreement between the social partners comes about - I mean between the companies and the others who are affected, because this includes people who are not part of any union, as this sector has a particularly low level of union membership - then I would like the regulation to be accepted as well."
"We will just have to wait and see."
"It is only fair to do so, if we recognise social partnership."
"Therefore, let us postpone this part and find a better, prudent solution later, so that we do not have to renegotiate afterwards and find ourselves in a position where we may not be able to achieve anything further."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, my group believes that continued and improved protection of workers and consumers is more important than constantly increasing freedom for businesses within the European market."
"This choice is even more important in relation to cross-border, long-distance transport by bus and lorry than in many other business sectors."
"Regulations have applied in the coach transport sector since April 2007 that require coaches to spend one day off the road every six days during a group holiday trip in order to protect the driver from fatigue."
"We expressly agree with the objective of this measure."
"Nevertheless, we realise that the method of implementing this causes annoyance, not only to operators and customers, but also to the drivers themselves."
"I have previously pressed for improvement in the implementation of this by means of agreements with the trade union, the European Transport Workers' Federation."
"It is better that drivers be guaranteed rest at home than be forced to do so en route in the midst of surprised and displeased customers."
"Agreement on this point is good, but we reject any attempts to unilaterally abolish this protection."
"There is exasperation in the road freight transport sector because each country has different rules on whether or not freight can be transported when driving back from abroad."
"As a result of this, lorries too often return largely empty."
"Nevertheless, it is still too early for the whole of Europe to adopt the system that now functions reasonably between the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg."
"Such a system can be implemented only between countries with a similar level of income and social conditions."
"We have no objections to cross-border solutions if these guarantee all drivers a respectable wage, satisfactory mileage allowance and adequate safety measures."
"We do object, on the other hand, if in such a system the current large wage differences existing between EU Member States are abused to reduce labour costs."
"This would mean that everyone earning a respectable income would lose his or her job and then the only people still working in that industry would be doing so based on the current terms and conditions of employment of Poland or Romania, for example."
"My group has therefore submitted Amendments 45 and 46 to the report on haulage, in order to make the opening of the market for cabotage dependent upon the development of equal working conditions and an evaluation in 2012."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) I should like to thank Mr Grosch and Mrs Ţicău for the work they have done and to make three comments."
"My first comment relates to the amendment of the list of offences in Mrs Ţicău's proposal, which may lead to the permit of a transport operator being withdrawn."
"This list of offences is an essential element of the package, and constitutes a potential restriction of the internal market."
"For that reason, it would be better if the list of offences were to be amended via the codecision rather than the comitology procedure."
"I have therefore submitted an amendment in support of this alteration that I hope you will all support."
"Secondly, I should like to stress the importance of thorough supervision of the list of offences."
"The proposals being discussed here this afternoon are intended to improve the internal market."
"This means that it is important, however, that a truly level playing field be created."
"The Member States will have to enforce the rules under this regulation in the same way, and therefore I request that the European Commission thoroughly monitor the correct application of this regulation by Member States."
"My third point is that there are indeed Member States that attempt to limit this cabotage to a minimum."
"This is in complete contravention of the principles of the internal market and, in addition, indirectly pollutes the environment."
"I shall therefore certainly lend my support to the amendment that is intended to lift the restrictions upon cabotage with effect from 2012."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposals by Mr Grosch are aimed at the uniform and stringent application of road transport regulations, which I support;"
"I agree that criteria ought to be laid down which should have to be met before these activities can be carried out, and that surveillance by the relevant authorities should be stepped up through a single document recognition system and a system of sanctions, and that permission must be sought from the countries that these services cross."
"Following the excellent work by my fellow Members, I would just like to add that as I see it, shortening the time for international cabotage is not possible unless there is a truly fair and equal approach to laying down the rules so that we avoid any cases of dumping, which often ends up benefiting some operators at the expense of others."
"In my opinion, the 2014 deadline is fitting and could even be extended."
"Mr President, you wait for one report on buses and trucks and three come along at once."
"The question is, are they all travelling in the right direction?"
"On cabotage: I am one of the strongest supporters in this Parliament of liberalisation, and indeed in general on the issue of cabotage."
"But, of course, I want to be absolutely certain that we do have a genuine level playing field for this to operate."
"We have different vehicle and road safety standards in the UK, we have a geographical seclusion, we have a particular tax system which is different to some others, and there are employment concerns: these are issues also to take into account."
"So, whilst I think there is a lot of clarity in the Commission proposal and I welcome it, I think that we have to be very careful in the opening-up of the market in the way proposed."
"The overall impact of cabotage is somewhat ambiguous and I know that a lot of hauliers, people involved in the industry, are very concerned."
"Therefore, I think we have to be sensible and balanced about this and I certainly would like to see a review of the proposal within four years of implementation with full consultation from the industry in the meantime."
"That is the only way I think that we can guarantee a level playing field and full liberalisation to have good effect."
"I would just like to add another point on another of the reports."
"I am concerned, for example, when the scope of regulation in Europe begins to extend to the transport of the elderly by volunteers."
"Surely the application of law to such groups is both unnecessary and unhelpful."
"European law should aim to always encourage mobility and access."
"I think that in this case, in the beautiful areas of Britain such as my own constituency of Yorkshire, we do not want any impediments to the enjoyment of our regions and this road transport package coupled with the drivers' hours regulation should not lead to public transport in rural areas becoming a thing of the past."
"(ES) Mr President, I would especially like to thank my colleagues Mrs Ţicău and Mr Grosch for their patience and their ability to bring together all the shadow rapporteurs around proposals that have at times been well supported and at times more controversial."
"The truth is that Parliament has taken the opportunity to recast these texts on road transport in order to try to improve the legislation and move towards more opening up in the case of cabotage, in principle for reasons of co-modality, as we are working on in other matters, in order to promote freedom of movement and, of course, to prevent unladen journeys from being made."
"In order to do this, we have suggested the possibility of establishing a clause that will ensure that the liberalisation of the market does not lead to distortion."
"I would like to stress that the central reason should be social dumping; and for this purpose we are also establishing the date of 2014 for complete freedom of cabotage."
"It should be said that to some extent this text will be more credible because we have essentially focused on serious infringements, as they are the ones that can really be monitored."
"Of course, we reject the suggestion of specific, privileged bilateral cabotage between neighbouring countries, because, as one of my fellow members rightly said, it fragments the market still further."
"With regard to the text on buses, we would like to inform you that the Socialist Group is going to ask for, or I should say, has already asked for the vote on this legislative text only to be postponed, because we think that if, as we have already been told, there is an agreement between the employers and the workers' representatives and the trade unions for a review, shall we say, of the 12-day rule, it must be recognised -even though some of my fellow members do not wish to do so - that to some extent it opens up a review by the back door that has not been sufficiently explained or clarified, and that therefore needs this guarantee of the agreement between the employers and the trade unions."
"Otherwise the public will not understand why we are voting on a text tomorrow that is already useless because there is an agreement outside Parliament."
"(NL) Discussions regarding the phenomenon of cabotage have caused emotions to run high for many years."
"The existing regulations are supposed to be too unclear owing to the use of the word 'temporary', which serves as an excuse for various Member States to illegitimately further protect their own market."
"In order to clarify this issue once and for all, the Commission introduced another new regulation last year and, as Mr Sterckx has just stated, I had high expectations of this."
"Remarkably, however, the Commission proposed that a strict check be put on cabotage opportunities."
"Based upon the current Commission proposal, transport operators would be faced with more restrictions, rather than greater freedom."
"This is indeed remarkable given that the existing regulations have been perceived as a step towards complete freedom, including by the European Commission, since their adoption in 1993."
"Naturally, we need a European approach."
"The sector should not be subject to all manner of national concoctions designed to limit cabotage opportunities to a minimum for one day longer."
"The Commission proposal itself, however, is not sufficiently - if at all, to be honest - in keeping with the principles and objectives of the internal market, nor with those of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The arguments in favour presented by the Commissioner in his speech, such as road safety, the environment and the reduction of the administrative burden, are neither here nor there."
"In order to achieve the greatest possible degree of efficiency with regard to planning, a free market is simply essential."
"After all, each restriction leads to increased transport movements, whether it relates to cabotage, as in this instance, or, for example, the totally absurd medley of driving prohibitions."
"Therefore, as Mr Sterckx has just quite clearly stated, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is committed to achieving a completely free market, preferably as of 1 January 2012."
"The Member States must also be completely at liberty to agree unrestricted cabotage arrangements earlier than this, should they deem it desirable."
"Furthermore, it must be above all clear that authorisations granted prior to the entry into force of the intended regulation will nevertheless remain valid."
"We do not agree with the 'another study and then we shall see' path."
"The appointment of committees and study No 250 will lead to virtually nothing, except maybe to a great deal of fuss, associated costs and other bad jokes, and that is something we are all too familiar with."
"A free market would prove beneficial to the sector and indeed also the consumer, and this should be achieved as soon as possible."
"I should like to conclude by saying one more thing: that, quite rightly, there is a clear majority in this Parliament for dispensing with the references to 'repeated minor infringements'."
"There is no room for these in the regulation."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the three regulations we are debating here are closely linked to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital."
"When the four freedoms were established in 1957, no one had clearly envisaged the transitional regulations for the new countries of the European Union."
"Of course we are up against limitations set out in the Accession Treaties of the 10 new Member States."
"Even after the opening of the Schengen border, these countries comply with the transitional regulations for transporting people and goods that can be summed up as follows: banned or limited cabotage."
"In the course of debates on lowering emissions and on the effectiveness of road haulage in particular, some requirements in the regulations in question seem somewhat futuristic, in our opinion."
"I remember the fines on transport of empty lorries and the so-called 'full-capacity freight transport centres' that existed in the people's democracies."
"Perhaps we will have to return to some kind of a similar regulation."
"Basically, we do the right thing when we try, in the common area, to harmonise the use of the existing rules, in addition to the common CMR documents."
"If access to the market is simplified, the restrictions on cabotage are partially relaxed, and the basic working conditions in the sector are harmonised: both in regard to employment and to the attitude of individual Member States to enforcing the EU regulation, this will be heartily approved by both entrepreneurs and employees in the sector."
"Consequently, having given consideration to the aspects I just mentioned, the GUE/NGL Group supports the proposals in question."
"- (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the regulars at the long-distance drivers' table, hauliers and public policy watchdogs are not criticising our proposals to replace and simplify existing directives, then we are on the right path."
"For me, it is a good path, because it contributes to several fundamental points: firstly, to increasing safety in road transport, because controls and the exchange of the data thus gained are more important than new legislation, but also because access to a profession and the issuing of licences are subject to unified quality criteria."
"Secondly, to eliminating distortions to competition, because it makes it possible to put a stop to the activities of the black sheep in the transport industry, fight discrimination and increase the status of the occupation."
"Thirdly, to environmental protection and the conservation of energy resources by reducing unladen journeys."
"Fourthly, to making coach tourism more attractive, because 12-day tours will be guaranteed once more."
"Fifthly, to the reduction of bureaucratic requirements, because the national electronic registers will be networked and access to these should be made easier, and simplified templates for Community licences and driver attestation are also planned."
"Sixthly, to setting the modernisation of the sector in motion."
"I believe that legal certainty for future cabotage transport operations is particularly important, even if these currently make up only 2-3% of the transport market."
"Every unified regulation in Europe is better than the current patchwork quilt arrangement."
"From an ecological point of view, we should open the way for cabotage transport immediately, but from a social and economic point of view, it makes better sense to limit it for the time being."
"However, the goal must be the complete abolition of all limitations on cabotage transport operations by EU companies, as long as they meet the new licensing conditions."
"I expect to see concrete steps towards this by 2014."
"Moreover, we should not hamper bilateral agreements that open up the market more quickly."
"(NL) First of all, I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their work."
"This is an important package of measures that have a major, very specific impact upon a great many people within Europe."
"What stands out most is of course everything relating to cabotage."
"In that respect, it was and remains necessary to clarify a number of issues in order to set the bar equally high for everyone."
"The way in which the existing cabotage rules were interpreted varied too widely from Member State to Member State, necessitating rules."
"Furthermore, just to be perfectly clear: more cabotage can lead to more efficient road transport, which is good for both the economy and the environment, and must by all means be encouraged, therefore."
"Nevertheless, it must be clear that this must not result in social dumping, and therefore the gradual opening of the market must go hand in hand with the establishment of social rules of play that are equal for everyone."
"The differences in fiscal and working conditions must be smoothed out as far as possible, that is to say preferably with the worse conditions being brought up to the standard of the better conditions."
"The compromise of throwing open the market in 2014 therefore seems justifiable, provided that Amendments 47 and 48 are adopted, that the Commission, in particular, takes the 2012 study into the differences in social and working conditions seriously, and particularly that the Member States still have a type of alarm procedure at their disposal, including after 2014, for use in the event of serious disruption to the national transport market."
"There is a need for a clear definition of which activities are and are not permitted in anticipation of this, and of course adequate supervision is required."
"With regard to the driving times and rest periods of coach drivers, it would also seem logical to me - as a number of Members have already mentioned - to postpone the vote, so that the compromise worked out last Friday by employers and employees can be fully incorporated into our legislation."
"The compromise is in the pipeline but has yet to be transposed into legal language."
"The result of the talks proves that social dialogue can work at European level."
"A good balance has been achieved, taking into account the specific features of the coach sector."
"(PL) Mr President, in such a short speech one can deal only with fundamental matters concerning the documents under discussion."
"It is worth remembering that our goal is a free market, and a free market in terms of these services - road services - too."
"From this aspect the documents we are discussing are in reality a type of services directive, only one that is aimed at this particular market."
"In this connection the second point worth thinking about is that all restrictions and indirect routes that we apply - such as solutions relating to transitional periods, cabotage and the year 2014 - are partial solutions that should not divert us off the main highway of maximum market openness."
"Finally, it needs to be emphasised that certain special restrictions linked to this specific market, such as working time and solutions relating to the environment and to traffic safety, are obviously of great importance here, but we should not forget where the boundaries of safety and social negotiations lie."
"(FR) Mr President, we cannot seriously discuss the issue of carriage of goods by road without tackling the problem of dangerous materials."
"In the texts being proposed to us today, as elsewhere in European legislation, this problem is either underestimated or poorly dealt with."
"Yet if there is an area in which we need more from Europe, more restricting Community regulations, it is this one."
"As many businesses put their dangerous materials on the roads in order to prevent their establishments from being classified as a 'Seveso site', the flows of dangerous materials circulating around the Union are constantly growing, thus increasing the risks of a major catastrophe."
"With regard to the carriage of dangerous materials by road, there is a huge lack of training, a major shortage of equipment in terms of parking areas that can safely take the vehicles concerned in accordance with Community regulations."
"The danger of mixed loads is sorely underestimated."
"Goods that are harmless when taken separately can become dangerous if they are in the same parking area; currently, people are quite simply unaware of this danger."
"I argue in favour of the creation of a European agency for the safety of land carriage of dangerous materials to promote a truly comprehensive safety policy at Union level."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I wish to speak specifically on the Ţicău Report."
"While we have a proposal that is largely unproblematic, I would like to comment on the issue of sanctions."
"It is important to understand that we need common sanctions, but we also need to address the issue of common enforceability."
"Whilst I am against more red tape, we must find a system whereby drivers and their companies can be more easily prosecuted when they cause accidents in other Member States."
"At present, such companies and their drivers are escaping prosecution for offences caused, for example, in the United Kingdom, as the paperwork required to bring them to justice is currently too great."
"This is particularly alarming when we consider that according to my information there has been a 75% increase in road traffic accidents by drivers from other Member States in parts of my constituency alone in the past five years."
"I regularly receive complaints from people who have been quite badly injured by commercial vehicles and their drivers and it is frustrating that our present police enforcement services are either unable or unwilling to hold these drivers to account."
"I therefore look forward to further developments in this area so that we can ease the path in bringing these reckless individuals to justice."
"(PL) Mr President, we are holding this discussion at a rather specific time - that is, when we have lost a good Commissioner for Transport, by whom I mean Jacques Barrot - a time when we are awaiting a new Commissioner."
"In fact, I am interested in whether the designated candidate for Commissioner is listening to our discussion today, as that would surely be justified in every possible respect."
"We are talking here about the road haulage sector, a sector that has made it possible to achieve a 40% rise in economic exchange between the EU Member States in the last five years."
"We are talking about a sector that is de facto keeping Europe moving."
"My view is that we need as much freedom as possible here, including in cabotage."
"At the same time, though, we need as much firmness as possible, especially in combating practices such as the existence of rogue coach operators, who are frankly wrecking the market."
"The sanction of withdrawing their licence is not applicable, as they do not have and have never had any such licence."
"Throughout the sector, though, I can see several significant threats: the price of fuel and its rise, the way in which external transport costs are internalised, the way in which working time is executed, and I also have the impression that the profitability of haulage companies is generally falling."
"This is why I would like to offer my particularly enthusiastic support to Mr Piecyk's report, in order to be able to discuss the issue of bus and coach transport and to vote in June."
"I support Mr Sterckx's position on the need for a new study of the consequences of opening up the market, but this should also be linked to an assessment of the economic wellbeing of the road haulage sector."
"(ES) Mr President, I would first like to discuss Mrs Ţicău's report."
"This proposal is key to modernising the occupation of transport operator, through the uniform application of common rules in all Member States to authorise access to that profession."
"In this respect I applaud and willingly welcome the Commission's proposal."
"However, I would like to repeat a question that I raised during the debate on this report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"It is regarding the term 'good repute', which I put forward, and which, in the interests of consensus, I then withdrew and proposed substituting it with 'ethical standards'."
"I am not in any way questioning this requirement; on the contrary, I agree that it should be required that transport managers should not have any serious criminal convictions or serious sanctions for infringements of Community legislation relating to road transport."
"I do, however, advocate changing the term, because we are presuming bad practice in a profession that is a key sector of the European economy, that generates wealth, creates employment and guarantees the mobility of people and goods."
"We should think carefully before assuming that someone is not of good repute to pursue an occupation if that is not proven."
"Secondly, I would like to highlight the importance of Mr Grosch's report on common rules for access to the road haulage market."
"The proposal for a regulation defines cabotage operations, putting an end to the current legal uncertainty."
"It allows up to three consecutive transport operations for an international carriage of seven days."
"However, we should go further in order to lift any restrictions on cabotage and achieve greater liberalisation of national markets."
"Finally, I applaud the reduction in bureaucracy that this new proposal for a regulation brings in relation to the new simplified formats for the Community licence, copies of this licence and the drivers' certificates, that will help to reduce the delays caused by roadside checks."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need to make the transport sector more efficient and more competitive."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate the two Rapporteurs for their work and refer to the Ţicău report."
"I welcome the introduction of the criteria for quality access to the profession of road transport operator into the report in order to the quality of licensed operators and not to restrict their access to the profession."
"Whether we speak about people or goods, the profession of road transport operator involves the performance of indispensable activities for the economic development of the Union, in harmony with the Lisbon objectives to stimulate the economic activity in the European Area."
"I believe the implementation of this Regulation will result in an increase in the number of jobs, as well as in achieving a higher degree of safety and correctness related to road transport in the European Union."
"Again, congratulations to the Rapporteurs."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, here in the European Union, we are always proud - and quite rightly so, more often than not - that we try to find the middle ground and work together to find a solution, and that we often succeed in this."
"It is not always easy."
"Today's joint debate on the reports by Mrs Ţicău and Mr Grosch provides some particularly good examples of this, and also some exceptionally bad ones: the 12-day rule and cabotage have been mentioned more than once."
"The 12-day rule is good; hopefully it also brings social benefits."
"However, for a certain sector of the low-cost tourism market, it has become an increasing problem, and we want to take consumers' interests into account here as well."
"We have heard that attempts are being made to arrive at a good compromise, for which perhaps a little more time is needed."
"If it is a matter of a limited time - and that is indeed the case - then perhaps we should also take this time."
"The same applies to the cabotage rules."
"We are all agreed that we want to see better use made of the diverse infrastructures. However, this naturally affects many areas, particularly the transport industry, and the interests in the Member States vary widely on this."
"I am not entirely sure whether, when it comes to the topic of cabotage, a little 'euromythology' does not come into play here - simply because of the many years it has been under discussion."
"I would like to know whether there are really as many unladen journeys represented in the long lines of trucks that we have to overtake on the motorways - or are not allowed to overtake, as the case may be - as we are always being told."
"Perhaps an 'I'm running unladen' flag would be of interest here."
"However, the heart of our debate today is not so much the legislation we pass but what the Member States will put into effect, apply and implement."
"(FR) Mr President, I would first of all like to thank our two rapporteurs for the excellent work that they have done, and then hope that, under the French Presidency, this very important road package will obviously have a future and come to a conclusion."
"I would first like to focus on two subjects."
"The first is cabotage and the date that the European Parliament deemed right to set, in other words automatic liberalisation in 2014."
"From this point of view, there is a natural distortion created between the peripheral countries and the transit countries."
"Countries such as France, Germany and probably Austria are by nature the most cabotaged countries, and the fact that we have just chosen a definition of cabotage that involves cabotage following an international journey is a good thing, but it means that the social issue is definitely going to create considerable distortions, while in carriage by road, it is the principle of the country of origin that applies, once one is mobile."
"I therefore think that it would have been much wiser to wait, as was initially planned, for a report from the Commission enabling us to take stock of the social distortions before deciding on automatic liberalisation."
"My second point relates to the derogation concerning driving time for buses."
"As I have already said, without going into the subject in depth, I find this procedure detestable."
"Under pressure from pressure groups, an amendment has been tabled which is an amendment to a text that is not the original text."
"This issue should be resolved by a new proposal from the Commission, amending what we called here the 'Markov report'."
"I would also like to remind you that we are tabling an amendment to the Markov report in the form of a regulation when the Markov report was a directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am not - ah, it was a regulation, you are right, it was a regulation - but, in any case, I think that the formats need to be the same and that we should not get into this habit of tabling amendments, under pressure from pressure groups, to texts other than the original text."
"Mr President, I am not saying that I give preference to Mr Grosch or to Mrs Ţicău but I will speak about cabotage like my honourable colleague Mr Savary did."
"This cabotage discussion has been going on for many years."
"As one of the stakeholders said, 'The behaviour of the Council can be compared to the behaviour of a snail'; that is how slowly the Council has been moving on this subject whereas Parliament has finally got its act together."
"Cabotage is more important than we realise and I have to say that I cannot agree with my dear friend, Mr Savary, when he expresses fear that the social market will be distorted."
"If you do not allow cabotage to happen, what does it mean?"
"It means unnecessarily high transport costs; that means unladen, empty lorries going here and there."
"What is the EU all about?"
"The EU is all about an open market, and we have to care for EU citizens."
"If we get the transport costs down that means that the EU citizens will benefit and therefore we are giving them added value in their daily lives."
"At this point in time people everywhere are asking: 'What is the EU doing?'"
"Ordinary people are literally running after the money as the prizes are getting higher."
"Well, at the same time we cannot apply protectionism."
"We must allow people to have a better life and, if we can lower the costs, our economy will improve and the ordinary people will benefit from it."
"Just to give an example, on trade between Finland and Russia all the transport has been taken over by Russian lorry drivers and the Finnish citizens are benefiting from it."
"I cannot see why French citizens - I have my feet in both camps - would not benefit from cabotage."
"So we have to say 'yes' to the future."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) Naturally I agree with all those who believe that the matter must urgently be brought to a conclusion."
"Admittedly cabotage is a very sensitive subject."
"This has become clear in your discussions today, including with respect to the individual Member States."
"There are some who support complete liberalisation and others who advocate partial liberalisation, while others again are essentially opposed to liberalisation."
"Of course it is important for us to bring our points of view into line with one another, despite the differences that exist."
"We must also - and I wholeheartedly agree with this - take account of small and medium-sized enterprises and, in particular, of environmental concerns."
"Here, I am thinking above all of what is known as transit cabotage, although I should like to leave this aside."
"It would be absurd - not to mention unacceptable - to have empty road traffic."
"Since there are differences of opinion here, in my view we need an intermediate stage or transitional period before the cabotage sector is completely liberalised."
"Naturally I hope that tomorrow Parliament will accept the proposed amendments that help to harmonise cabotage services in the European Union and, in particular, will accept the proposed abolition of empty road traffic, as I have already emphasised and which I wish to stress once more at this point."
"Thus cabotage should also be possible on the return journey."
"In my opinion, the differences between Parliament and the Council are not so great as to prevent progress or agreement in the relatively near future."
"I also agree with all those who regard monitoring and control as very important in this area."
"In my view, this could also be brought about by the electronic register that is yet to be established, and here, I must emphasise, we are very close to reaching an agreement as regards the timetable and the actual establishment of this electronic register."
"This also applies to traditional means of control like the digital tachograph and the waybill, of which you are probably aware."
"Offences also play a major role, when they lead to disqualification from driving."
"Here, we obviously have to proceed very circumspectly and with sensitivity, and above all to be receptive to companies."
"The '12-day rule' for bus transport has been mentioned a number of times here."
"The Council has not yet reached a decision on this either."
"However, we are also aware, and this needs to be clearly stated here, that the social partners are conducting a dialogue."
"Naturally we are prepared to discuss this, so that Council and Parliament come to an agreement as soon as possible."
"I should like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Grosch and Mrs Ţicău, once more for the constructive exchange of views."
"The Slovenian Presidency will, in any case, do all it can to bring the various interests into line with one another, and also to ensure that the final compromise text helps to make the European road transport sector more efficient and above all, as I must emphasise, more competitive."
"It is my hope and wish that this productive dialogue will be continued, and that agreement will be reached with the European Parliament as soon as possible."
"Member of the Commission. - (RO) I am pleased with the agreement that comes into view in relation to the essential aspects of the road package."
"I refer in particular to the register and the withdrawal of certain abilities in the case of serious infringements of the law."
"On the other hand, it is obvious that the subject of cabotage is more problematic."
"Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that the notion of temporary cabotage, which is now in force, leaves serious legal uncertainties."
"This situation is not acceptable for the sector in question."
"No rule is perfect, but the rule proposed by the Commission - three operations within one week after an international transport - is at least clear and much easier to control."
"This does not introduce more or less cabotage into the Member States taken separately, but a better performed cabotage which is, on the one hand, better controllable and, on the other hand, effective from the logistic point of view."
"I am telling those who want more cabotage that the internal market is being built gradually and has to go hand in hand with harmonization."
"Since I have mentioned harmonization, I would like to remind you that certain matters regarding fiscal, salary and social harmonization are related either to the Member States' competence or can be achieved by unanimity."
"In this context, we can say that total openness, without any guarantees and safeguarding measures, taking into account that cabotage is temporary, by definition, would send us back to today's legal uncertainty."
"Consequently, the European Commission accepts that the liberalization of cabotage is a long-term objective."
"On the other hand, we should closely monitor developments and, in this context, we are ready to make a report in 2012."
"In conclusion, I note the concerns expressed on numerous occasions in relation to the issue of the 12 days for tourist trips."
"If the European Parliament is in favour of postponing the vote on international passenger transport, the European Commission will not be against it because, indeed, we need an agreement on the register and cabotage as soon as possible but, at the same time, we also need an agreement as comprehensive as possible between the social partners on the issue of the 12 days."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Situation of the Roma in Italy (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation of the Roma in Italy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission strongly condemns any form of violence against the Roma and asks the authorities of all the Member States to ensure the personal safety of all the people within their territory."
"The events last week in Ponticelli are not an isolated case."
"The racist violence that is fed by political populism, hate speech and media hype is a phenomenon that can be seen in many Member States."
"The Commission categorically rejects any stigmatisation of the Roma or likening them to criminals."
"The authorities of the Member States must not only refrain from such conduct, but also set an example in the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"They have the obligation to investigate racist attacks and to punish those who incite them or perpetrate them."
"I would like to highlight something."
"The very point of the European Union is to overcome what has characterised the history of Europe over the centuries, racial hatred, pogroms and destruction by fire."
"Europe promotes the right of every man, woman and child to be protected from persecution and discrimination."
"It embodies social solidarity, democracy and the rule of law, along with respect for every person of a different origin, religion, skin colour or way of life."
"We should not close our eyes to the real problems that the Roma are facing in Italy and in other countries."
"Everyone can see the extreme poverty, social exclusion, intermittent unemployment and low level of education that they are victims of."
"This situation leads to human suffering and social tensions."
"It pushes the Roma to the margins of society."
"This loss of talents and potential is cruel for the Roma and a loss for Europe."
"Why does this situation exist?"
"The Roma are not less intelligent than the majority, and neither are they beggars or born criminals."
"What can we do to change this situation?"
"Let us be honest about what the Commission can do and what the governments of the Member States must do."
"As was rightly underlined in the conclusions of the European Council in December 2007, which your Parliament welcomed, the Member States and the Union must do everything in their power to improve the inclusion of the Roma."
"With regard to free movement of citizens within the European Union, Directive 2004/38 is based on well-established principles of Union law."
"Many of its provisions have already been in force for decades."
"The Directive also incorporates the case law of the European Court of Justice on these issues."
"Following the accession of Romania to the European Union, the Romanians enjoy the same freedom of movement as the other citizens of the Union."
"The Romanians are no longer immigrants from third countries."
"Romanians are citizens of the Union."
"They cannot under any circumstances be treated less favourably than the other citizens of the Union, and the Commission will ensure that their rights are respected."
"The Directive allows Member States to deny citizens of the Union who are inactive and do not have sufficient resources the right to live in their territory, so that these people do not become a burden on their social welfare system."
"The evaluation of these resources cannot be automatic, but must take into account the behaviour of the individual."
"The rules on free movement are not made to benefit criminals."
"The Directive allows the exclusion of people whose behaviour represents a genuine, current and sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of society."
"The fight against crime must be done with full respect for the rule of law."
"A decision to exclude can only be made on a case-by-case basis and the procedural guarantees and basic conditions must be respected."
"In the case of immediate exclusion, the urgency must be duly justified."
"The exclusion of citizens of the Union is an extreme measure."
"It is a limitation of a fundamental freedom of the Treaty."
"Most of the essential aspects of the inclusion of the Roma in society, such as education, employment, social inclusion, public health, improving infrastructures and housing fall under the competence of the Member States."
"The European Union is nevertheless prepared to take on its role of coordinating, supporting and facilitating national policies."
"If we all learn to exercise peer pressure, we will be able to achieve results."
"In the field in which the European Union clearly has competence, the fight against discrimination, I am making a commitment to ensure the application of Community legislation."
"Directive 2000/43 is an important instrument with a broad scope for application."
"Its implementation at national level must nevertheless be complemented by initiatives to raise awareness focused around rights and obligations."
"Active monitoring of complaints by the bodies responsible for equality and full involvement of civil society in this supervision process are essential conditions for any improvement in the situation."
"The events of the past week in Italy require joint efforts on our part."
"Our Roma fellow citizens need our solidarity in order to break the vicious circle of exclusion and violence fed by despair."
"I interpret this outbreak of violence as a cry for help."
"As political leaders it is our duty to offer every individual the hope of a sustainable solution to these problems."
"It is possible to combat social exclusion through targeted, made-to-measure programmes with funding from the European Structural Funds, in particular the European Social Fund."
"This programme could improve the living conditions of the whole population, and therefore of the minorities as well as the majority."
"In response to the call from the European Council and the European Parliament, we are currently examining the Community instruments and policies that can be implemented in order to promote the inclusion of the Roma."
"I would like to invite the Italian Government and the governments of the other Member States to discuss the results of this exercise with us and to take notice of the lessons that can be drawn from it."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Špidla."
"Social solidarity, democracy, rule of law: I wish that Parliament was more in tune with these values!"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation of Roma people in Italy - as in the whole of Europe - is terrible, and has been so for many decades."
"We have done extremely little, and the governments we guide or support, even governments belonging to our own political groups, are doing very little to put a stop to it."
"Neither left-wing nor right-wing governments have managed to bring about any change over recent decades as regards acceptance of the Roma, and this is why I believe it is extremely important to give this issue a regular place on the agenda and in debate in this House."
"We would like to ask for an even deeper commitment on the part of the political groups, however, and I believe that programmes are needed, genuine, properly implemented integration of the Roma is needed in Europe, if Roma people are not to fall victim to atrocities as a result of this sort of mass hysteria."
"I do not think it is enough to make speeches in plenary sessions, and it is completely useless to treat this issue as a party political matter, because neither socialist, nor liberal, nor conservative governments have been able to do anything."
"The ongoing lack of action in Europe at the moment with regard to the Roma issue is something we oppose, just as we oppose any reference to - or practice of - the principle of collective guilt, and just as we oppose crime."
"I believe it is very important that the Italian government should do everything it can to fulfil its promise and ensure that the planned security package is not directed at any individual ethnic group, and that mass deportations are avoided."
"Even more important in my view, however, is the message that we can send to countries from here, from Europe, and the responsibility that the European Commission needs to assume in order to ensure that minimum requirements are put in place, that an agreement is reached among the Member States regarding how they plan to go about changing the situation of Roma people in Europe in the immediate term."
"I think it is indispensable for Europe's standing in both moral and competitive terms to stop the empty talk and place the emphasis instead on action, on putting serious plans into effect."
"This should be the key focus."
"I also think that it is our task to promote and to demand this. Thank you."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament requested this debate and I thank you, Commissioner Špidla, for having addressed the essential elements of what needs to be said."
"I am also very grateful for your very clear words."
"Allow me therefore to begin with a plea to us all."
"Those both on the right and on the left in this Chamber share common values."
"I am very thankful that many Conservative Members in this Parliament agree with us that we must take a humanitarian approach to the problems that we have to solve."
"Human dignity in the European Union is non-negotiable."
"Burning down camps, chasing people through the streets - this is unacceptable!"
"This approach does not solve anything at all."
"Thank you, Commissioner Špidla, for placing this core value of European politics at the centre of your remarks."
"We want to contribute to solving problems, so I want to make one thing very clear."
"The problem that we are talking about today is not an Italian problem but rather a problem which, while it occurs in Italy, has in fact occurred everywhere in the European Union in recent years."
"The problem is that minorities are not sufficiently well integrated into European societies, and that the Roma communities in particular are suffering because of this in all EU countries."
"Events like those that occurred in Italy, about which we have been expressing our outrage today, have also occurred in other EU countries."
"Once again, therefore, this is not a time for pointing the finger at Italy."
"It is a time to think about how we, together with the authorities in Italy, can solve the problem, primarily in the interests of the Roma community, which needs immediate, direct assistance."
"It should also be solved in a way that is in the interests of the local authorities, the small towns and cities, some of which are overwhelmed by the integration work required of them."
"The mayors there need our help too."
"It was therefore very clever of you, Commissioner, to suggest that we think about how we can help municipalities like this immediately, using the EU funds available."
"I believe that the efforts we now have to make should all be focused in one direction."
"We should not be arguing at this point about who is to blame for something or who failed to do what."
"We should make a collective effort to take recent events as a reason to say that the Roma community needs all EU Member States, the entire community of European citizens, to be willing to integrate it."
"We must also insist that the Roma community allow itself to be integrated in our society."
"This has to be possible, with total respect for the cultural identity of this community."
"I spoke with Mr Frattini, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, by telephone today, to make it plain that we as the Socialist Group, together with the Commission and the Council, want to achieve a solution to the most urgent problems, because I believe that we must not allow the Roma to become the target of attacks by people who want to indulge in right-wing populist politicking on the basis of these inadequacies."
"This is our common task; this is the reason why we requested this discussion."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I congratulate the Commissioner on his very fine speech on this subject."
"I would like to express myself in response to the anti-Romany pogroms which took place in Naples on 13 May this year and the subsequent developments in Italy."
"I decided to visit Rome and Naples last weekend as a kind of field research and spoke personally to people living there."
"I also demanded urgent intervention by the Italian authorities to ensure fundamental rights and protect Roma in the country from further acts of violent, racist aggression and to defuse the climate of anti-Romany hostility prevailing in Italy."
"I had written a letter to Silvio Berlusconi on 23 February."
"Together with 88 other NGOs, we were seriously concerned that the political campaign which had been carried out associated Roma with negative stereotypes and used the whole Romany nation as electoral scapegoats, which is totally in opposition to European values."
"Now we can see the impact of that campaign."
"The Roma emergency was declared when the media reported that a 16 year-old Romany girl had attempted to kidnap a 6 month-old baby from her mother in Naples."
"According to my fact-finding mission, this story is false: the police have no record of this; there is no investigation concerning this case."
"On 13 May a mob of approximately 60 people used Molotov cocktails to set fire to five Romany camps in Naples."
"Similar violent outbursts have also occurred in other Italian cities, such as Milan."
"What is really worrying is that, according to the information I have received from the police officers in Naples, there is no police investigation concerning this case either."
"I have to tell you that the Italian Government appears to be strong with those who are weak and weak with those who are strong."
"Whenever they raise the security issue, they should first raise the organised crimes committed by the Camorra."
"They intend to talk about the immigration and Roma issue in order to divert the focus from Italy's real problems."
"I hope that the Italian authorities will ensure adequate and effective investigation of the events which took place in Naples and Milan and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law all responsible persons, including public officials making hostile statements about Roma which incite racial hatred."
"I call on the Italian authorities to cooperate fully with intergovernmental institutions, international organisations and domestic civil society to swiftly and effectively end the human rights emergency of the Roma in Italy."
"I also call on the European Commission to come up with an EU Roma strategy with the aim of making Roma inclusion an urgent priority and to provide leadership and coordination for Member States in their responsibility to ensure respect for the rights of their Roma citizens."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is not the right place for polemics against any one government; it is a place where we discuss, examine and look for shared solutions to issues that concern and worry European citizens, and what is happening in Italy concerns many Europeans."
"The incidents vary enormously in terms of importance and gravity: from attacks on the Roma, the situation of degradation and poverty of entire areas controlled by criminal gangs, where Italians and migrants fight over nothing, to the tragic waste crisis and finally the incredible statements made recently by Italy's beautiful new equal opportunities minister, bordering on homophobia."
"Therefore, without sterile polemic, let us stick to the facts and look at what we can do to help and improve the situation, rather than make it worse."
"What we must not do is deny the facts."
"Why are we here discussing the Roma situation in Europe and Italy?"
"It is because the Roma are the most discriminated against minority in Europe, and Parliament has been dealing with this issue for years."
"We are not do-gooders, but there have been episodes of extreme violence, intolerance and racism, which must be called by their real name if we want to start putting them to rights."
"As I said, we are not do-gooders."
"At the heart of the solution that we are all searching for is legality: by this I mean respect for all of the rules."
"This means rules that prevent people from stealing and squatting on public property, forcing children to beg or women into slavery, but also those that prohibit discrimination and persecution of the poor, and the decades-old repression of people who no longer know what nationality they are and are travellers not through choice, but because after fleeing so many times, the only thing that remains is life on the road."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality for many Roma in Italy and Europe."
"To conclude, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for his contribution, because he took a courageous stand and clarified some of the points that we have always maintained with respect to Directive 2004/38/EC and how this has been misinterpreted in places by the Italian government."
"I hope that his work to introduce clarity can continue, with our support."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps the gravity of the economic, energy and security situation for all EU citizens should have persuaded this Parliament to take it upon itself to stem the tide of fear that seems to be sweeping through all the EU countries."
"Yesterday however, with its partisan decision, it chose a different path, although perhaps this was just for the benefit of the media."
"It is obvious that the basis for the decision is not political but party-political, because of the fact that this is a debate without resolution."
"This speaks volumes!"
"We share the Pope's view on solidarity and generosity."
"Before there can be solidarity, however, there must be respect for the law."
"Italy is known for its generosity."
"While other countries have fired on non-Community nationals, while other countries have turned away ships carrying refugees or left people to drown, clinging to fishing nets or wreckage, Italy has always welcomed non-EU and EU nationals with great kindness and generosity."
"Of course, there have also been acts of atrocity, and these must be condemned and indeed have been by the current government."
"We wonder, however, why the Roma situation in Italy was not picked up by Mrs Mohácsi last year, five months ago, or even a year and a half ago."
"Why is Parliament talking about this today, five weeks from the vote, when it failed to address the issue clearly when it was obviously urgent?"
"No, Mr Schulz; if the title of this debate had been 'Situation of the Roma in Europe', we could have believed that this was a general problem."
"This is a party issue, whereas political solutions are needed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with Commissioner Špidla: we are facing political acts and events of unprecedented gravity."
"The directives and declarations of the European Parliament must apply to everyone, even Italy."
"We say this to the current government, whose acts and declarations on taking office cause us real concern and have shocked us."
"We also said this to the previous government."
"The fight against discrimination and the commitment to integrating the Roma is enshrined in parliamentary votes."
"The rights of mobility and residence are pillars of European citizenship."
"Europe must facilitate the implementation of its decisions."
"As a European minority which was persecuted by the Nazis, the right to citizenship of the Roma must be recognised."
"I consider what has been happening of late to be extremely serious: this is political exploitation of fear, for example of Romaphobia, to win electoral consensus; fear as a basis of vote-winning."
"In the process, politics and democracy are being stifled, peaceful coexistence is being poisoned and the very civilisation that Europe is called on to nurture is being destroyed."
"This discussion must produce concrete results: the monitoring of action by the Member States, the monitoring of local action and the monitoring of the living conditions of Roma citizens."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, what is happening in Italy is an example of what can happen when reality collides with the utopian idealism of the European Union."
"The idealism of the EU is that it can bring about a great, new, borderless state by means of unlimited, uncontrolled and indiscriminate immigration."
"The reality is that such mass and unregulated immigration brings with it massive social problems."
"I and my party totally condemn the violence recently seen in Italy perpetrated against groups of people because of their ethnic origin."
"We have heard about the integration of communities into host societies, but how can that happen when the sheer numbers of immigrants do not allow it?"
"The EU's mission is to create a great borderless state, and this has brought about vast movements of people in Europe in recent years, surely unparalleled since the fall of the Roman Empire."
"Signor Frattini, the new Italian Foreign Minister, wants to bring about tougher immigration laws."
"This is the same Signor Frattini who, when he was an EU Commissioner, said that Europe needed at least 20 million new immigrants from Africa and the Third World."
"Now that Signor Frattini has left the ivory towers of the EU and has a job in the real political world, he has changed his tune."
"The open-border policy of the EU means that no Member State can control who can and cannot enter their country."
"In Britain this has led to unbearable strains on infrastructure, public and social services and housing."
"It has brought about increases in disease and crime."
"Most of the organised crime in London, my constituency, is now the province of foreign ethnic gangs."
"Any country should be able to have a controlled immigration policy so that they can select what immigrants they want in the appropriate numbers for their needs."
"The appalling scenes of violence in Italy are a direct result of the European Union assuming control of what should be solely the province and control of nation states."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, unless I am mistaken, the repeated accusations made by Spanish socialists against Italy and its sovereign right to internal security come from those who keep a close guard on their coastline, those for whom the Ceuta and Melilla affair is still fresh, those who deal with Catalan and Basque separatism by putting political polemic and terrorism on the same footing."
"Do Spanish and European socialists know how generous Italy has been towards the Roma?"
"Do they know how much welfare, financial support, education and healthcare the Roma receive, which even Italian citizens do not get?"
"Do they know what percentage of anti-social offences is attributable to these 'travellers'?"
"I would like to ask Commissioner Špidla who is protecting the children who are on the streets begging, selling roses and cleaning car windscreens at traffic lights in Italian cities; in short, exploited children, whose parentage is often undetermined?"
"Why, for example, is action not being taken to analyse the DNA of all these children, with the twofold aim of protecting minors and confirming their lineage?"
"I believe I am right in saying that a precedent exists in Argentina for the children of desaparecidos."
"In my opinion, Commissioner, there should be no Romany camps in Italy, or for that matter in Romania or in any other country of the European Union."
"As a matter of fact, to allow the Roma to express their identity properly - and for their own protection and better self-governance - I propose that the EU should advocate the creation of a Romany State, perhaps even in Eastern Europe, given that a large number of Roma come from that region."
"This would mean an end to their diaspora; they could manage and govern themselves autonomously, their quality of life and welfare would improve and, if you permit me to say so, so would ours!"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a minute is certainly not enough time to cover this topic."
"It has been said that the Italian Government is not being charged, but in the speeches that I have heard, there has been frequent mention of populist right-wing policy."
"Mrs Mohácsi said that the incident in Naples involving the six-month old baby was untrue."
"Mrs Frassoni blamed the Italian equal opportunities minister."
"A government sworn into office just six days ago is the target of fierce accusations from Spanish ministers, when much more serious incidents have taken place in Spain."
"I think - in fact I am convinced - that it would have been far more plausible if the Commissioner had spoken about solidarity with citizens in general, rather than just some of them."
"We are and I am in favour of the issue of universal solidarity."
"I believe, however, that a government has a duty to ensure the safety of all its citizens, and not just some of them; it has a duty to ensure that all children can live in the same conditions, and not just some of them; it has a duty to strive for integration, but not by offering to become, in some cases, a refuge for criminals."
"It must defend everyone."
"Madam President, you have been very generous, so please allow me to finish this thought."
"I believe that a government cannot and should not be indicted; a government, moreover, which was voted in by an unprecedented majority in Italy."
"I believe that this issue, which is extremely sensitive and extremely important, as we all agree, must be tackled in earnest, and not with political gestures."
"I have always supported the idea that Parliament, the European Union, must abandon political posturing once and for all, and have a credible European integration policy without attacking individual governments."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Špidla was right when he said that the recent attacks on Roma camps in Rome and Naples were very serious incidents, and that these must be dealt with by finding answers that neither absolve Europe of the blame, nor make scapegoats, nor use discriminatory and humiliating language."
"I apologise to Mr Romagnoli, who we have just heard."
"These types of response risk fuelling a dangerous climate which could erupt into violence and racism."
"This debate, Mr Zappalà, is not a trial for Italy or its government: the Commissioner has sent out a clear message of cooperation."
"We expect convincing and concrete answers from the Italian Government, in line with two basic requirements: integration and safety, and reception, integration and security in accordance with the law and enforced by the State, not by militia and vigilante patrols, which hark back to a dark time in our country's history that we do not want to see reappearing."
"Some newspaper headlines today read 'Europe puts Italy on trial' or 'Comrade Schulz, Berlusconi's enemy, against Italy'."
"This is ridiculous."
"I would like to say that Italy, a country held in high esteem and loved for its civilised values, asks Europe to fulfil its role in strengthening security and fostering integration."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to say this: despite the gravity of these incidents, which I think everyone here recognises, there is a certain mindset and an ignorance of the situation in Italy and in Europe which frightens me."
"It is always somebody else's fault."
"Therefore, I demand the duty and right of self-accusation."
"We have been in power in Rome and Naples for 15 years!"
"In Rome, Naples and throughout Italy, a disgraceful television campaign has emerged."
"The percentage of airtime spent denouncing crimes, creating a psychosis of fear, has risen from 10% to 24%."
"Madam President, I just want to say that where there is no democracy, there is no peace for the Roma, or even for Italians."
"Italy is not a democracy; there is no rule of law."
"We can start from this point and fight, and we can hope, but not with the cheap morality that too many of us have."
"Madam President, I am deeply disappointed to find President Barroso not sufficiently engaged in dealing with Roma issues."
"In this parliamentary term we have adopted two joint resolutions on Roma and a report on Roma women, and we have had a number of meetings with the EC."
"Meanwhile anti-Gypsyism has increased and, apparently, the public acceptance of racism too."
"It is high time for action."
"This case in Italy with the Roma is a clear example of government-sponsored racism."
"The violence against the Roma scapegoats in Italy reminds me of the anti-Jewish and anti-Romany pogroms of the 1930s."
"Berlusconi's political tactics look like the ones of Milošević's ethnic cleansing in ex-Yugoslavia."
"I want to call on your solidarity to exert pressure on the EC and the Council for an EU Roma policy."
"I am convinced that the EU presidency has heard this debate and will examine the Roma issue more seriously during the next EU summit."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to clear up any misunderstanding."
"Any act of violence and discrimination must be condemned in no uncertain terms, but we need to consider the situation, and especially to avoid hypocrisy or, even worse, political exploitation."
"I am sorry to be so blunt, but I would like to cast a veil over the attempts made by many in this Chamber today to place the blame for the current Roma situation in Italy on Silvio Berlusconi."
"Perhaps Mr Veltroni and Mr Bassolino know more about blame, especially when it comes to the squalor in illegal Romany camps."
"I would, however, ask everyone to make an effort to act responsibly and in earnest, which we now need after all the delays and calls for a solution which have fallen on deaf ears."
"We need to redouble our efforts and to stand up for the people living in the Romany camps in conditions that are absolutely inhumane and unacceptable; we need to forget the mother whose baby was almost abducted and the family of Mrs Reggiani, raped and killed just under a year ago, sadly a case that has occupied this Parliament."
"Our proposals, which we have been making for years, are clear: they were incorporated into both the last European Parliament resolution on the situation of the Roma in the European Union, and into the European strategy on the rights of the child."
"One: solve the problem of Romany camps, where health and safety is non-existent; two: propose drastic measures, such as the loss of parental authority, for those parents who force their children into begging, prostitution and child labour; three: lower the school drop-out rate among Roma children, which is 75% in some Member States; four: make better use of Community funds available for all citizens of Roma origin who work, who want to be integrated and who send their children to school, but at the same time isolate and repatriate habitual offenders."
"Finally, I make this appeal to the entire European Union, given that the problem concerns all Member States, as the Council of Europe, among others, recently pointed out with regret."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Špidla, I am extremely worried by the recent events in Italy."
"There is a witch-hunt climate against Romanians and Roma, with a great number of punitive expeditions and with travellers' camps that have been set on fire."
"The Italian Government is waging an obsessive security campaign that calls into question Europe, the Schengen Treaty and free movement in the EU."
"We need to readdress the security issue from the point of view of legal culture, which cannot be influenced by the emergency aspect."
"The rule of law requires criminal responsibility to be individual; it cannot be attributed to collective categories."
"To depart from this principle sets a dangerous precedent that will lead to the criminalisation of entire ethnic groups."
"The security requirement is legitimate, but we cannot resort to exploitation designed to fuel hatred and xenophobia for political ends."
"Rather than making illegal immigration a criminal offence, the Italian Government should use EU funds more effectively for integration policies."
"In short, we need to reopen the debate on the expulsion of the Roma in the proper European setting and confirm that existing laws should be enforced, without calling into question the freedom of movement of EU citizens, which is an inalienable right of European citizenship."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that this is an indictment of a government which for two years has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to enter its country and at the same time has allowed those people to live in a state of absolute squalor, creating a new sub-proletariat."
"Those who did not consider a moratorium when Romania and other countries joined the EU should also be indicted."
"I do not think that Italy is able to tackle this problem, amid other pressing issues such as waste management, employment and housing."
"The Roma question is an insurmountable problem, given that this 'solidarity' is represented by camps - as shown on yesterday's Porta a porta [Italian current affairs programme] - which are theoretically legal, but where there is continuous child abuse and the sanitation conditions are absolutely appalling."
"I think the only thing that Italy can do - and Europe must support it in this - is: 1) suspend the Schengen Treaty for at least six months with regard to Italy, since Parliament recognises that there is a problem with the Roma emergency in Italy, so there should be a suspension of the Schengen Treaty; 2) make illegal immigration a criminal offence in Italy, as it is in other countries; 3) negotiate with Romania, Bosnia, Macedonia and Serbia - in other words with both EU Member States and third countries - for the humane repatriation of Italy's Roma population."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give Mr Schulz the benefit of the doubt when he says that he wants a constructive approach towards reception and the unavoidable rules that the Roma, like everyone else, must obey if they are to participate in the coexistence project that we call the European Union."
"The steady erosion of the rights and dignity of these people and the Italian victims involved in the escalating violence over the last 18 months are an example of the contradictions demonstrated by those governments and institutions that on the one hand preach understanding and on the other allow human beings to live in squalor and to be robbed, raped and killed at the hands of mob justice."
"If we are really determined to find a solution, Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, let us admit that not only did Mr Prodi's government collapse, but that both left and right must make an effort to accept each other."
"This will make it easier to shoulder a problem in which we would otherwise have been held to ransom by old-school politics and would have needed to raise the spectre of Mr Berlusconi to feel absolved from our mistakes. Thank you."
"Madam President, in Italy, a country worthy of our respect and love, the populist rhetoric has united with extreme-right doctrines and fuelled inter-ethnic hatred, encouraged anti-Roma pogroms and prepared the ground for racial laws."
"In a bizarre way the Roma phobia was combined with a Romanian phobia."
"While we protest vigorously against inhuman behaviour and discrimination in Burma or other remote places, yesterday the number of MEPs who thought that the events in Italy require more than a complaisant one-minute speech exceeded only by six the number of those who believe that this is not business as usual."
"The problem in Italy is not a Roma problem or a Romanian problem, as Mr Daul put it yesterday."
"Romanians and Roma are only victims."
"Italians are also victims."
"The events and developments in Italy are only the shocking expression of a tendency which is latent in many other places in Europe."
"And therefore they could spill over in all Europe; this is a European problem."
"To prevent this problem and to cope with the Roma challenge one does not need more repression but more integration."
"One does not need more police but more justice, and especially social justice."
"One also needs states which function, media who never mix up criminality with ethnicity and a European Union which is able to conceive and enhance a truly comprehensive and bold European strategy on Roma in particular and on intercultural relations in general."
"If we do not pass this test, the flames in Naples will set fire to all Europe."
"- (DE) Madam President, more than 10 million Sinti and Roma live at the margins of society within the European Union."
"The Decade of Roma Inclusion, which began in 2005, has so far changed little about this."
"The incidents in Italy clearly show that measures taken so far against exclusion and discrimination have had little effect and have not been implemented."
"In January we called again for an integration strategy for the Roma, and today we have debated and passed the Framework Directive on Anti-discrimination."
"The pogroms in the Romany areas of Italy show how urgently we need a genuine, comprehensive political solution. We do not need confrontation."
"True integration of the Roma into our society would be good evidence that the cornerstones of democracy, the rule of law and human rights form the foundation of the EU."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, it is up to the people of our country to ask the government to tackle the crime emergency, including Roma crime, realistically and without adopting a do-gooder attitude."
"Defend human rights by all means - this should have been done in Ceuta, but instead there was the conspiratorial silence of Socialist International."
"Comrade Schulz, would you agree?"
"Above all, defend honest citizens from the unlawfulness of others, including the Roma!"
"I will personally campaign so that the government in our country makes it a criminal offence to be a member of a criminal gang, much like the typical Roma gangs, who commit thefts, burglaries and even more serious crimes."
"Xenophobic violence is not characteristic of our people, let alone the people of Campania or Naples."
"It belongs to the Camorra, who we must fight."
"People are demanding safety, in the knowledge that this does not preclude humanitarian and solidarity measures."
"Safety is, however, the first priority, and it is just as important to guarantee this."
"We are not convinced by the idle talk of the Commission: citizens in Italy and in Europe are calling for protection from uncontrolled immigration and from the influx of people who are not emigrating in order to work but are often criminals who emigrate, rather than emigrants who commit crimes."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficult law and order situation and the natural public reaction following the numerous episodes of violence that have shaken public opinion in my country have led the Italian Government to adopt new security measures."
"I believe that we must vigorously reject the attempts of those who define the provisions contained in the security package presently being ratified by the Italian Council of Ministers as discriminatory, racist and outside Community directives."
"Strict measures on squatting, the expulsion of migrants without visas and higher penalties for those who commit anti-social crimes are consistent with European law."
"Italy is and will remain a receptive country which is developing a new integration policy, but it is no longer prepared to tolerate the presence of illegal immigrants."
"All EU and non-EU citizens are welcome, provided that they abide by the rules of peaceful coexistence."
"The European Union and its 27 Member States must each do their bit, and we must monitor the situation to make sure that civil rights are respected throughout Europe."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you do not mind I am going to stick to the facts."
"The facts tell us that Silvio Berlusconi's government is reintroducing the concept of race into the Italian legal system and is rapidly marginalising Italy within the EU, systematically violating the founding principles on which Directive 2001/38/EC is built, first and foremost the fundamental principle of the right of free movement of persons."
"I would like to mention just two implications of this: the first we witnessed in Naples a few days ago, when the Camorra were appointed as stand-in law enforcement officers and dislodged anyone who remained in the city's Romany camps with Molotov cocktails."
"The second one we heard from Mr Romagnoli, who has come out with a proposal whose origin can certainly not be embellished."
"This is a completely unoriginal proposal: to rebuild, build or conceive a State to which all Roma citizens are confined."
"I seem to recall that the same proposal was made about gypsies and Jews by Goebbels in 1930s Nazi Germany before war broke out, and the State of gypsies and Jews was replaced by crematoria."
"This is the message behind the proposal we have heard today."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I had planned to speak once, but I will speak again after Mr Fava has spoken, of course."
"Madam President, I am very sorry, but I believe, from what I have heard here today, that this debate was prompted by a persecutory, accusatory and punitive attack on a Member State and a government that was elected by an overwhelming majority."
"Unfortunately for some, however, it is guilty of not being a left-wing government."
"It is not our fault if the Roma are visible in Italy almost exclusively by virtue of their crimes of theft, robbery, child abduction and begging."
"This is the image that gypsies have in Italy, this is the image that the Roma have created, despite our best efforts."
"I am still looking for a Roma in Italy - and please someone tell me if they know of one - who is legally employed and who pays taxes."
"Do not accuse me of racism, please be serious."
"I am only defending honest Europeans - be quiet and go back to your gallery, go back to your gallery! - Madam President, I was interrupted."
"Do not accuse me of racism, be serious."
"I am only defending honest Europeans and honest Roma."
"Each Member State should put the safety of its citizens first, otherwise citizens will feel justified in dispensing their own justice."
"Therefore, to conclude, I would like the Spanish MPs and MEPs to get a grip, keep quiet and put their own houses in order a bit more."
"Please, Mr La Russa and Mr Pannella: we are not in the Italian Parliament, please behave properly - and stop making those gestures, do you understand?"
"Please let us stop this, otherwise I will call the clerks!"
"(HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"It fills me with dismay to note that, after Tibet and Kosovo, we have now arrived on European Union soil."
"Let us not forget that the Roma are European Union nationals; they too are EU citizens."
"Social issues and xenophobia are always connected."
"I would have been delighted if our socialist friends had also raised their voices when socialist and former communist prime ministerial candidate Walter Veltroni was still mayor, clamouring for the deportation of undesirable elements, confusing Roma people with Romanians."
"Next, we must not forget that the issue of minorities is many-layered: there are Roma, new immigrants, and national minorities, but they are all alike in that every European Union country must find a solution to their problems."
"The minimum would be to establish a human rights committee for minorities from 2009 and ensure that legislation is uniform throughout the European Union."
"To conclude, I would just like to say a word or two regarding preventive strategy: the role of the EU must not merely be to put out fires; rather, it must adopt the stance that unless there is social security, respect for fundamental human rights, and cultural and territorial autonomy for minorities, there is no Europe."
"(ES) Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Commissioner Špidla for the clarity of his speech and the speed with which the Commission has reacted."
"Madam President, allow me to speak on behalf a former Member of the European Parliament, the first Spanish gypsy Member of Parliament who was elected fifteen years ago, Juan de Dios Ramírez Heredia, who sent me a letter that reads as follows:"
"'You are well aware of the sad events that in recent days have caused so much sorrow to hundreds of innocent gypsy families who have been victims of racist violence."
"As the Unión Romaní we want this debate, so that no one can ignore the fact that we must, at all costs, defend human rights and the pre-eminence that law must always have over political passions."
"As European gypsies we believe in Europe."
"No one has constantly defended a Europe without borders more than the gypsies."
"For this reason we think that placing arbitrary limits on the free movement of persons within European territory would be a serious step backwards for the European integration that we so much dream of.'"
"Allow me to conclude, Madam President, by addressing Commissioner Špidla, who, along with Vice-President Frattini, presented a plan, a roadmap for legal migration here in Parliament three years ago."
"I think that Vice-President Frattini did a good job as Commissioner and I hope that he will also help to deal with this situation in Italy."
"(HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"In the city of Naples, the social reality that was temporarily masked by symptomatic management has burst to the surface with astonishing force."
"In the Europe of the 27, the problem can no longer be dealt with at Member State level; it is crying out for much more complex Community action."
"The problem is not an issue of relations between one nation and another, or between old and new Member States, or even between the Roma and non-Roma population."
"The crisis has made visible the hopeless situation in which a million European Union citizens are living, teetering on the edge of society in the suburbs of towns stricken with unemployment, in emergency accommodation, in insanitary conditions, struggling unnoticed for survival with no proper assistance or training services."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has not been silent."
"They have taken action, and not just talked about it, and they have also stated that, in a united Europe, blaming the Roma population for the current public security situation is unacceptable."
"How much we understand on the basis of events like those in Naples and how we can best use the Community resources available for remedying the problems is up to us."
"As the person reporting to the European Parliament on Roma issues, I offer the Commissioner our cooperation and ask my fellow Members of this House to do the same."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, having listened carefully to the whole debate, I would like to put forward a final opinion."
"The debate for the most part has not been up to level of the Commissioner's report and Mr Schulz's invitation to ignore the specific problems or machinations of a particular country - specifically Italy - and to consider the general problem which, I think we all agree, is reception and solidarity for those who enter different countries, for the Roma, who certainly have a specific problem, and at the same time security and legality, because security and legality underpin the reception and solidarity that we must offer."
"We should have answered the Commissioner, who asked: what can the Commission do?"
"I believe that Mr Barón Crespo said recently that the Commission, with the support of Parliament, can issue guidelines: European directives, when these are transposed."
"As with the issue of waste, so for the question of non-EU and EU nationals, a directive could be the solution, although not when Parliament, the Commission and the Council fail to take advantage of their solidarity, when they use it to have a debate which is purely about Italy and is manipulative, the government having been in office for only a few hours, a few days."
"If on the other hand the whole of Parliament focuses on solidarity - as envisaged by the Commissioner - then I believe we might be able to find solutions and get results."
"Madam President, when we Romanians were a candidate country, we were lectured amongst others by people like former Commissioner Frattini about the absolute need to respect the rights of minorities, including the Roma."
"Now we are members and many of the Roma population, as European citizens, have established themselves in other countries, like Italy, joining other Roma people living there, some in camps which are already 40 years old."
"I agree that some have committed crimes and have to be punished properly."
"But to generalise and incite aggressive, negative feelings against all of them, including through false media reports, is not acceptable."
"If we tolerate this gross infringement of the core European values, which we so much like to invoke, and close our eyes to those responsible, we only invite the worst, which would soon get completely out of control with incalculable negative consequences for the entire Union."
"(RO) I believe this debate could have been named: ""Serious infringements of human rights in Italy”, because, in fact, we are dealing with the Italian Government's lack of actions when a community has been subject to incredible violence and this was possible because, unfortunately, over the last months, the racist speech of a part of the Italian press, as well as some top politicians, remind us of the worst periods in Europe's recent history."
"The Italian government has the obligation to investigate the authors of these violent acts, who must be tried and the Italian justice must decide."
"Otherwise, the Italian government seriously infringes articles 6 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The non-State actors, the criminals, must answer before the Italian justice."
"The Italian government must answer before the European Union."
"This is the spirit of article 6 of the Treaty."
"(HU) Madam President, estimates suggest that Romania has several million gypsy citizens, and instead of there being a responsible social and minority policy addressing their intolerable situation, the world tends to hear about their fate through the sensationalist media."
"We witnessed this in connection with the criminal acts committed by Romanian gypsies in Italy."
"It is regrettable and distressing that it is only the shocking events in Italy that have managed to reach the European Parliament's social response threshold."
"It is even sadder that some political forces are treating these events as interference in Italy's domestic affairs and are trying to make political capital out of the gypsy issue."
"We must, on the other hand, oppose the use of anti-Romanian gypsy sentiment among the public by some political forces to foment anti-Romanian feeling in general."
"In the first place, the situation that has evolved in Italy is not an Italian domestic matter, and neither is it merely an issue relating to Romanian gypsies."
"It is an issue concerning all gypsy people living within the European Union, and one that demands and warrants more than just case-by-case or symptomatic treatment."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a political and media campaign is under way for the criminalisation of migrants and the Roma in Italy."
"A number of Italian MPs have exposed the Italian Government's true self here today, for example Mr Fiore, Mr Borghezio and Mr La Russa, who, as we all heard, clearly said that Schengen needed to be suspended, illegal immigration made a criminal offence, and all Roma expelled: it is tantamount to equating the Roma to criminals."
"This is the real Italian Government."
"The campaign is evident from the fact that it has just announced the appointment of a Roma special commissioner."
"This was followed by a round-up of Roma, instead of arresting those who set fire to the Romany camps in Italy."
"Statements of the kind that we have heard here are often expressed by various ministers in the Italian Government."
"This is why, Mrs Muscardini, we are having the debate now and did not do so sooner."
"Only one thing needs to be said, and I will conclude on this point: there are 200 000 Roma in Italy."
"Of these, 80 000 are Italian citizens."
"Of the remaining 120 000, 50 000 were born in Italy."
"If we granted citizenship, that would probably solve a large part of the Roma problem in Italy."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak, having listened to your debate."
"Allow me to touch very briefly on several issues."
"The history of Europe shows quite clearly that racism, ethnic hatred and intolerance always end up in disaster, sooner or later."
"Those who do not learn their lesson from history will sometimes experience the disaster again."
"The concept of human rights is Europe's answer to the lesson of history."
"Human rights are indivisible and must be protected by all constitutional systems throughout Europe, in all Member States."
"Each Member State must comply with this and make adequate efforts to fulfil this duty."
"There is another thing I want to mention in this context. This morning we debated poverty and social exclusion."
"It is true that poverty in Europe has been very individualised, very much pertinent to personal circumstances."
"There is one single exception though."
"If you belong to the Roma minority, with only a few exceptions you are socially excluded and poor, practically everywhere in Europe."
"That is the reality."
"On the other hand, it is clear that the situation of Roma citizens is not the same in all countries and that there are effective projects and methods that improve their situation."
"The debate also clearly showed that the issue of minorities is very complex and, as I said before, it must primarily be dealt with by the Member States, although there is also a role for the European Union and the European Commission."
"Therefore, I am pleased to be able to say, ladies and gentlemen, that as early as June we will submit a conceptual document to the Council that will attempt to review our hitherto ineffective policies."
"This is the unfortunate truth and this issue requires a great deal of effort on our side."
"The debate also showed clearly how easy it is to turn such extreme issues into political instruments."
"One of the duties of all democratic forces is to prevent such manipulation, which makes any efficient approach to the issue impossible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for expressing your views, which clearly highlighted the many facets of this matter."
"I would perhaps add just one more quick word: you expressed a number of different views, many of which I do not support."
"This is normal, just as some of you may not agree with my views."
"However, we heard one view that is quite unacceptable."
"I cannot remember who voiced this opinion but I believe you noticed it, too."
"The debate is closed."
"Thank you, Commissioner Špidla."
"I wish that this issue could be discussed calmly, with humanity and dignity, as President Pöttering often says."
"Mr Romagnoli, I have not forgotten about you."
"You made a request based on Rule 145, which is personal, so you will have a chance to speak after the debate, which is now."
"You have one minute."
"I just need to remind you that under Rule 145, you must not enter into the merits of the debate, but simply state whether there is a personal matter or comments that you think were wrongly attributed to you."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this should be a place of free and educated debate, but it fails to be that if it tolerates rudeness and insults that were perhaps unfounded."
"Personally, I have always condemned and still do condemn all violence and discrimination, at any time and in whatever form, against both individuals and communities;"
"I believe that self-determination, if we grant it to Palestinians, must also apply to others, so this was what I meant when I expressed my views about the Roma."
"I am sorry that someone twisted my words."
"I am sorry that some of my fellow Members called me names that I do not deserve, as anyone who knows me will agree."
"No one wants to question human rights."
"I am not a racist or a xenophobe, but I insist, ladies and gentlemen, on the right to social order which everyone here should defend, and on Italy's right to complete sovereignty."
"There was the business of a request; the Secretariat is checking, because there was no mention of what type of request it was."
"As you know, there is no resolution and no vote."
"- (DE) Madam President, I fully understand that often it is not possible to allow everyone to speak under the 'catch the eye' procedure."
"However, I do not understand why selection should then come down to allocating the right to speak to each group."
"This distorts the political weightings in the European Parliament significantly."
"Basically, it means that the small groupings are repeatedly given a much greater weighting."
"That is a legitimate political concern, but it is not what was intended by 'catch the eye' in the Rules of Procedure."
"I would also like to ask that in future, when somebody registers to speak in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, they are in fact given the opportunity to speak."
"We have five minutes left of allotted time."
"This was decided by the Conference of Presidents, and this is the correct amount of time."
"I will, however, make a note of your comments."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - (RO) The increase of violence against Romanian immigrants and the Roma population in Italy is the direct result of extremist speeches of fascist type, promoted by the right-wing and extremist right-wing parties in the recently ended electoral campaign in Italy."
"The Italian authorities should take into consideration the fact that the legislative amendments they intend to adopt must strictly comply with the European norms and not provide any collective expulsions or continue to promote a xenophobic attitude toward Community citizens settled in Italy."
"In fact, the main problem is not related to criminality."
"This involves an individual liability and it should be sanctioned as such by the Italian justice, according to the Italian laws."
"The priority is a coherent policy of integration into the Italian society and the support of the Italian State, including by using the European funds in this field."
"We regret the previous position of the Liberal Government in Bucharest and the ALDE group in the European Parliament, which refused the mandate extension for the European Commissioner appointed by Romania for minority issues in Europe, including issues related to the Roma population."
"Thus, Romania has lost an important political lever and the possibility to generate European solutions regarding the issue of integrating the Roma people into European society."
"in writing. - (RO) I welcome the fact that the European Parliament decided to organize a debate on the situation of the Roma community in Italy."
"This is a signal that this issue has begun to be seen in its true dimension: the European one."
"The issue of the Roma is so complex that only mobilizing the energies of the entire European Union could provide a concrete solution to a situation that comes from history."
"This is why we need a strategy and concerted action at a continental level."
"I request the competent Commissioners to propose a work plan in this respect urgently."
"I also believe it is the duty of the European forums to take a firm position on the way in which the Italian authorities understand implementing extreme measures."
"Setting nomad camps on fire, night raids, arrests without warrant and threats with mobilizing the army in the fight against crime - all these reflect an atmosphere of painful intolerance for the 21st century and represent a dangerous situation for the future of the EU."
"If we arrive at legislating on the climate of ethical and racial hatred, I believe it is the duty of the EU to consider the adoption of possible sanctions against a government that infringes the values at the foundation of the United Europe."
"in writing. - (RO) The recent events in Italy and the xenophobic position of the representatives of right-wing and extreme right-wing parties, which have formed the new government, against the Roma people prove that, unfortunately, speech and actions of a fascist nature are present in 2008 Europe."
"Making criminality ethnic is extremely dangerous, as well as the fact that politicians and the mass-media, by the media overlapping of crimes committed by Roma people, promote the idea that all criminals come from the Roma population."
"Criminality is individual and should be punished in compliance with the laws of the Italian state."
"The increase of violence against the Roma people in Italy both in speech and action is a European problem due to the consequences it may have and its solution consists in an integrationist policy of the Italian authorities regarding the Roma people."
"The European Union provides a series of funds for financing such social integration programmes, which the Italian executive can and should use."
"Secondly, the Community executive should take actions regarding the discrimination against certain ethnic categories on the Italian labour market, since at this moment Italy is far from achieving the objective of full employment."
", in writing. - (RO) I welcome the position expressed by the European Commission through the voice of the European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla, of condemning the violence against the Roma people, wherever they are."
"I also emphasize the need for a European strategy regarding the inclusion of the Roma population into the economic, social and political life of the European countries where they live."
"In the absence of such a European strategy, each country will try to solve its problems regarding the Roma population sometimes by using policies and means that are incompatible with the fundamental human rights, the free movement of people in the European area."
"Thus, I remind the European Commission that the European Parliament approved the Resolution for a European strategy on the Roma in November 2007."
"My country, Romania, has made great efforts to include the Roma people."
"The results have started to appear but the programmes in operation require more time in order to be able to assess their efficiency."
"From these programmes, I mention in particular the training of specialists from among the Roma people for public administration and police, the decrease in school abandonment among the Roma children, as well as their integration into universities."
", in writing. - (RO) One of the fundamental principles of the European Union is the free movement of people."
"The area of freedom, security and justice should ensure the security and, particularly, the respect for the rights of all European citizens."
"The current situation of the Roma people in Italy questions precisely the common fundamental values upon which the European construction relies."
"On 14 December 2007, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was signed and adopted."
"The European Union acknowledges the values stated in this Charter, in Article 6 which says that ""The Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity"" and ""the Union places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice""."
"Also, Article 19 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights mentions explicitly that collective expulsions are forbidden."
"I request the Italian government to ensure compliance with the rights of the Romanian citizens in Italy, as well as their safety."
"I request the Italian government to take actions against any forms of discrimination on nationality or ethnicity criteria."
"I request the Commission, in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties, to sanction firmly the infringement of the fundamental rights of the European citizens and not allow the adoption of laws or actions that would limit the free movement of people."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0156/2008)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one"
"Subject: Biofuel trading practices"
"What action is the Commission taking to stop the reported biofuels trading practice that exploits US agricultural subsidies?"
"The practice involves shipping biodiesel from Europe to the US where some fuel is added, allowing traders to claim 11p a litre of US subsidy."
"It is then shipped back and sold below domestic prices."
"It is estimated that up to 10% of exports of biofuels from the US to Europe are part of this rogue scheme."
"This is not an illegal act, but puts the European biofuel industry at risk."
"It also involves unnecessary shipping across the Atlantic, which increases emissions of greenhouse gases."
"Will the sustainability criteria as proposed by the Commission solve this problem and make it illegal to sell biofuels on the European market that have been involved in this practice?"
"Member of the Commission. - While the Commission cannot comment on the extent of the alleged practice referred to in the question, it shares the concerns about the impact on the European industry of the United States tax subsidy."
"The subsidy appears to benefit all bio-diesel exported from and, by the way, sold in the United States, whatever its source."
"According to the industry data, the US exports to the European Union rose from 100 000 tonnes in 2006 to 1 million tonnes in 2007, which is equal to about 15% of the European market."
"My colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, has raised this on a number of occasions with his US counterpart, Trade Representative Susan Schwab."
"He has advocated a change in the US legislation, for example restricting the subsidy to goods sold in the United States as a possible solution to the problem."
"So far there has been no movement from the United States side and the tax credit remains in force."
"The Commission would be prepared to consider an anti-subsidy investigation upon receipt of a properly documented complaint from the European Union industry containing sufficient evidence of countervailable subsidisation and injury."
"The honourable Member asks whether the sustainability scheme proposed by the Commission in its proposal for the directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, adopted by the Commission this January, will solve the problem created by the trading practice referred to in the question."
"The sustainability scheme provided for by the Renewable Energy Directive is about ensuring the sustainability of biofuels."
"It is designed to promote the use of sustainably produced biofuels while discouraging the use of poorly performing ones."
"You will remember the 35% discussion."
"The sustainability scheme would therefore not be able to address trading practices such as the one referred to in the question from the honourable Member."
"Commissioner, I am glad you are dealing with this."
"I think it is a scandal and it makes a mockery of all the work we are doing on climate change."
"In terms of sustainability criteria, if we have a greenhouse gas savings criterion, would these kinds of biofuels not fall foul of that because it has been shipped up and down the Atlantic adding greenhouse gas from shipping emissions, which are 5% of world CO2 at the moment?"
"If we have to wait for a complaint from industry and the opening of a procedure on illegal subsidies, how long will that take?"
"My fear is that, by the time we get something done, the European industry will have gone out of business."
"Member of the Commission. - The method of the calculation of greenhouse gas emission from biofuels compared to fossil fuel emission contained in the Renewable Energy Directive follows what we call the life cycle approach, which also takes into account the level of emission produced during transport of biofuels both within and outside the European Union."
"In this respect let me reiterate once more that reducing greenhouse gas emission from transport is one of the guiding objectives of the biofuel policy."
"Subject: European food aid programme for the most deprived persons"
"In 2005, the European Parliament approved a written declaration on the durability of the European food aid programme for the most deprived persons."
"The declaration not only advocated a permanent food aid programme plus an annual budget, but also called for it to be expanded."
"To ensure distribution of balanced food rations, the European Parliament called for the programme to be opened up to new sectors such as pork, poultry and eggs."
"Mariann Fischer Boel, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, was tasked with following up the declaration."
"That fact is that, three years later, there is still no sign of a basis for a new regulation and that only modest steps have been taken."
"As yet, it is totally unclear what budget funding is available."
"Food aid is very much an issue in the European Union, where 16% of the population lives below the poverty line."
"Can the Commission ensure a food aid programme at European level?"
"In the process, will it enter into a dialogue with the European NGOs active in the field?"
"Member of the Commission. - For 20 years the European food aid programme has made a decisive contribution in meeting the food requirements of undernourished people in the Community."
"On 4 April 2006 this Parliament adopted a supportive declaration on the European food programme for the most deprived people in the Community."
"This declaration calls on the Commission and the Council to provide a multiannual budget allocation and to introduce a series of flexibility measures in the management of the programme."
"A strong emphasis is also put on the need to secure a balanced diet for needy people."
"This programme actually started back in 1987 as an emergency measure in a time of abundant surpluses of agricultural production."
"During its first years, the food aid programme mainly relied on supply from intervention stocks."
"As stocks have been declining over the last years as a consequence of the successive reforms of the common agricultural policy, the Commission introduced a series of changes to secure the continuation of this scheme and these changes include the possibility of market purchase for products that are not available from our intervention stocks, the exchange of products within the same 'family' and the possibility to mix or incorporate intervention products and products bought on the market."
"The budget has also been adjusted in particular to take into account the recent enlargement of the European Union."
"It has increased from EUR 213 million in 2004 to EUR 305 million this year, 2008."
"Therefore the Commission has made all efforts to keep in operation a programme that is based on intervention stocks in spite of the fact that these were vanishing."
"So we can actually say that we have been pushing the programme to its limits."
"Now the time has arrived to rethink the future of this programme without losing sight of its broader picture."
"With this aim the Commission services are already working on an impact assessment that examines the options for the future."
"The internet consultation has attracted huge participation with more than 12 000 replies, which proves the high interest among European citizens for this initiative."
"NGOs have actually played a crucial role in the implementation of the programme and they will also remain a key player in the future."
"In a seminar which we organised in April they expressed the wish to maintain the food aid programme under the administration of the Directorate-General for Agriculture and they also stressed the need to introduce some kind of a multiannual allocation of funds and supply a broader range of different products."
"We are now examining these requests from the NGOs and will stay in close contact with them."
"After the completion of the impact assessment I intend to submit to this Parliament in September a proposal that allows the continuation of this scheme but on a very solid basis for the future."
"So I thank you very much for your interest and attention to this very important scheme."
"(NL) Madam President, I should like first and foremost to thank the Commissioner for this very clear, full reply, which also offers prospects for greater durability of this food aid programme, based upon the evaluation that is currently under way."
"I only wanted to ask whether this evaluation also takes into account the fact that a large number of people are still evidently dependent upon this food aid programme and that almost 16% of the European population lives below the poverty line, and whether it also takes account of the current food crisis and the spectacular growth in food prices."
"Member of the Commission. - We are taking into account all the input that we are getting from our very open approach to this process."
"According to the current figures available, 13 million people in the European Union are taking advantage of the special scheme for deprived people."
"As far as we can see, demand is not decreasing at the moment."
"- (DE) In many cases it is children who suffer most from poverty."
"Lack of food impairs not only physical development but also the ability to concentrate and achieve at school."
"This can then also affect a child's future success in life."
"Within the framework of the planned food aid programme, what arrangements are being made in this problem area to work through schools, for example?"
"(DE) I am sure it will be a good proposal, especially as you have also mentioned the necessity of a balanced diet."
"It is vital that this is a key focus."
"In this connection, the Commission could also add another key point, and that is to concentrate on fresh organic produce."
"Everyone has a right to eat products that may be slightly more expensive but are much healthier."
"To what extent will you be taking this into account?"
"Member of the Commission. - First of all, what we are doing just now is evaluating all the ideas and information that we have got."
"In this context we are trying to judge whether we should target our money in a specific way."
"We have not yet finalised our internal discussions, but I can say this regarding children: I think it is of huge importance that first of all we ensure that our young people are well nourished and therefore we will also publish this year an idea (and I hope to get full support for it) for a school fruit scheme in cofinancing with Member States that can offer children at a certain age the possibility to have a piece of fruit at school."
"I think it is in general a good idea providing a good habit to young people that hopefully will follow them throughout their lifetime."
"As to giving special priority to organic production: I think we have to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea, because if we choose organic we get less food and I think that is going to be a very difficult judgement to make."
"Subject: Speculation and the food crisis"
"Financial speculation is a major factor behind rising prices and the world food crisis. The commodities market in particular is attracting growing interest from investment funds."
"Is the Commission prepared to accept that, for the benefit of the few, commodities such as rice or wheat are becoming the focus of speculation while, at the same time, millions of people are dying of hunger?"
"Does it intend to take practical steps to end all financial speculation which directly jeopardises the food security of millions of people?"
"Does it also intend to promote the implementation at international level of a mechanism preventing countries from restricting exports of foodstuffs of which they hold large stocks and, more generally, from pursuing all policies that have the direct result of preventing the most vulnerable from exercising their right to food?"
"Part two"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission is actually very concerned about the impact of the current high prices, both within the European Union and also in the more global context."
"Developing countries and the most vulnerable populations have actually been hit very disproportionately with the consequent risks of hunger, malnutrition and social unrest."
"The communication that the Commission has presented today tries to analyse the root causes of these high prices."
"The Commission has presented a series of initiatives to counter the short-term effects of the food price shock, to increase agricultural supply and ensure food security in the longer term, and to contribute to the global effort to tackle the effects of the price rises on poor populations."
"Concerning the root causes, there are many factors which are simultaneously reducing global supplies: adverse weather conditions in key grain-producing and exporting countries, mainly Russia and Ukraine, which was previously called the bread basket of the Soviet Union."
"We have had adverse weather conditions in Australia for three consecutive years."
"We have had higher energy costs."
"We have had slower increases in yields and increasing global consumption."
"These direct impacts on supply and demand are significant contributors to agricultural commodity prices and to the increases that we have seen."
"Against the backdrop of food price increases, and in the wake of the financial market crisis, there has been increased activity in commodity-related financial markets to hedge price risk or diversify investment portfolios."
"These activities may have led to increased price movements and volatility on futures and spot commodity markets and have amplified the underlying price movements, but their influence on long-term price formation remains uncertain."
"So in today's communication the Commission commits to monitoring closely activities by speculative investors in commodity-related financial markets and their impacts on price movements."
"The communication notes that some exporting countries have responded to the rising prices by actually restricting their exports."
"India has introduced export bans, Vietnam and Thailand rice export limits, Indonesia export taxes on palm oil, and Kazakhstan a ban on wheat exports."
"Such taxes and export bans are designed to protect the domestic markets from short-term supply shortfalls and price shocks."
"However, they further tighten international agricultural markets to the detriment, especially, of the food-importing developing countries."
"In a medium-term perspective, such restrictions clearly send the wrong market signals, reducing the incentive for farmers to invest and to increase their production, and contributing to an imbalance on regional markets."
"The issue of the very negative impact of export restrictions should be raised at the relevant forthcoming meetings of the WTO and in other relevant international fora."
"The Commission remains convinced that there are significant potential gains for developing countries from the Doha Round in terms of new market opportunities, which would help generate additional export income, stimulate agricultural production and facilitate access to foodstuffs, thereby alleviating the current food price hikes."
"The Commission will therefore continue to work for a comprehensive and balanced Doha deal."
"The Commission trusts that it can count on the support of this House for the policy direction presented in today's communication as a basis for tackling the challenges that we are facing in this situation with prices that are actually going through the roof in some areas."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for this relatively long and interesting response."
"Nevertheless, in relation to one of the elements that triggered this crisis of financial speculation on agricultural products, I would like to ask you whether, following the scandalous behaviour of certain European banks - KBC and Deutsche Bank in particular - which, as you know, conducted entirely 'unethical' advertising regarding speculation on food products... I would like to ask you what the Commission intends to do about this."
"Along with my colleague Mrs Carlotti, I wrote a letter to President Barroso on 6 May, for which I have not yet received an acknowledgement, but I hope to receive a reply one day."
"The letter requested and proposed taking every measure aimed at banning, and I will read from the text: 'the offering, dissemination or promotion of financial instruments within the European Union, including investment insurance and in particular insurance products associated with investment funds, if their yield is directly linked to speculation on the increase in the price of food raw materials'."
"Could you tell me what the Commission's intentions are in this respect?"
"Member of the Commission. - I shall be very brief because I touched upon this in my first intervention."
"That might be the reason why it was fairly long."
"In the communication the Commission presented today it commits itself to monitoring the activities of speculative investors closely in commodity-related financial markets and the impact of those speculations on prices."
"(LT) As consumers, we instantly feel the effects of any price increase."
"However, throughout the price chain, with speculations being made, there are winners and there are losers, with producers of agricultural products finding themselves in the position of loser most often."
"In your opinion, what could be done to ensure that the increase in the price of agricultural raw materials is in proportion to the general price increase - in other words, to ensure that commodity prices are fair and farmers can have a decent life?"
"Madam President, while fully acknowledging the good motivation of the questioner and indeed the complexity of the issue before us, could the Commissioner confirm that she has no intention, nor do her other colleagues in the college of Commissioners, of interfering with the operation of the commodities market, which has the potential to do more harm than good if this particular avenue were taken?"
"We agree on the end, but not on the means of how to get there, I would say to the questioner."
"Member of the Commission. - I completely agree with the question raised on the consequences for the primary producer, for the farmer."
"The situation actually is that we have seen increases, especially in the cereal sector."
"When we talk about these extraordinary high prices, I always like to look back a bit in history to see how prices have developed; and, taking the past 30 years, prices have been decreasing the whole time from the primary producer."
"This has not meant that prices have not been increasing in the retail sector."
"But if you compare prices on cereals in 1975 and today and look at fixed prices, the prices were twice as high in 1975 compared to today."
"We see a situation where people are used to the fact that on average in Europe, I think it is only 14% of the income that is spent on food, and this has been decreasing as well over the whole period."
"When mention is made in the communication about what is going to be done, it is obvious that we have to look at the whole chain."
"It is the competitiveness Commissioner who is in charge of surveying the situation and we do not know at this stage whether there will be a positive or negative outcome."
"But we will keep an eye on all the reasons that are behind the increasing prices that we have seen since late August of last year."
"Subject: Communication and the Lisbon Treaty"
"In the context of Plan D and the recently announced Communication 'Debate Europe - building on the experience of Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate', could the Commission report on their communication strategy vis-à-vis the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty?"
"What concrete measures has the Commission taken to ensure a smooth ratification of the Lisbon Treaty?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - On the question about Plan D and the communication about 'Debate Europe', let me say that I see it as our duty, together with Member States and the other EU institutions, to communicate with citizens about all our policies and positions."
"While, on the Treaty, Member States of course have the main responsibility, the Commission must also stand ready to inform and explain."
"Our recent communication, 'Debate Europe', aims at promoting active dialogue between citizens and decision-makers and, although not specifically referring to the Lisbon Treaty, or to the Lisbon Treaty only, actions taken under 'Debate Europe' may be connected with communicating on the Treaty."
"The Treaty is one of our communication priorities for 2008."
"Our activities have been decentralised and differentiated to fit the national realities in each of our Member States, and this is 'going local' working in practice."
"Our representatives have worked with each Member State and Parliament information offices to draw up national communication plans to respond to different needs, and the activities have included liaising with national stakeholders, training for journalists, information relays and multipliers, discussions with civil society and events at schools and universities."
"We have prepared a broad range of support materials including PowerPoint presentations, elements for speeches, questions and answers, fact-sheets on different areas - all aiming to help communicators provide the facts on the issues."
"And from Brussels, as you know, the Commission has also launched a website dedicated to the Treaty in the 23 official languages, and our on-line forum 'Debate Europe' has recently been relaunched with discussions on the Treaty proving one of the most popular areas, with many thousands of submissions."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"So, why is 'Debate Europe' not working?"
"In Ireland the exhaustive time spent counteracting a litany of issues - often important in their own right but totally irrelevant to the content of the Lisbon Treaty - which create fear and confusion, deliberately or otherwise, is seriously detracting from the positive message of Lisbon."
"And knowledge matters in EU referendums."
"Voters' confidence in their knowledge of the issues involved in the Lisbon Treaty is crucial to the successful outcome of this referendum, for them to vote 'yes', having decided to vote at all in the first place."
"'Levels of knowledge of the Treaty suggest public opinion [in Ireland] is more like Nice 1 than Nice 2' - the words of Professor Richard Sinnott, not mine."
"Notwithstanding 'Debate Europe', Commissioner, as the Commission and Member States to date have failed abysmally to communicate Europe and how it works and an understanding of its present Treaties to over 90% of our citizens, how do you advise us now to communicate amendments to those same Treaties, amendments to Europe, to ensure the necessary degree of knowledge for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty?"
"We have failed to communicate Europe; how will we communicate amendments to a Europe that nobody understands?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - First of all, partnership is the key word."
"We cannot do it from Brussels; we cannot do it from the Commission side alone: we have to work together in communicating decisions we have taken together."
"I think that there are different roles given to the Commission and the institutions, compared with, for example, ministers, who of course also have to be out there everywhere in Ireland as well as in all other Member States to help, to explain, to listen and to communicate what this is all about."
"I think that if you start by communicating on amendments I am afraid that you have already lost the audience."
"My experience is that if you communicate clearly on the substance issues then it is much easier, and this is exactly also what our representation office in Ireland is trying to do: to communicate on the different substance issues."
"I know that, following a call for tender, they have engaged in, I think, about 20 different local meetings, where they also engage politicians, Irish politicians, to try to spread information and engage them on different substance issues."
"It might not be enough but we have to continue along these lines."
"I think, of course, that engaging with the media is one of the most important things."
"At the same time, it is important to respect the very particular laws and regulations you have in Ireland when it comes to debate before a referendum, and we are of course trying to do that as well."
"But we have an obligation to communicate and to engage with citizens on the policies and the positions that the institutions take, and I hope we can continue to do it hand in hand."
"- (DE) Are there any market research findings and opinion polls that would show what information European citizens actually need regarding this Reform Treaty?"
"Are politicians in Europe, from local municipality level up to European level, also being targeted?"
"What information is required here, and what will you do in the information offices in the capital cities in order to be able to improve the range supplied?"
"Madam Commissioner, you have mentioned the referendum in Ireland, and in three weeks they will have a very important, maybe decisive, vote in that country."
"We all remember the outcome of the Nice Treaty referendum in that very EU-friendly country some 10 years ago."
"What lessons have been drawn from this unfortunate experience, and how is the Commission participating in the pre-referendum discussion debate in Ireland?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Thank you very much for these relevant questions."
"What about knowing public opinion?"
"Well, we have our opinion polls through the Eurobarometer which give us a lot of guidance and where we can also identify some of the information needs."
"On top of that, of course, different opinion polls are also carried out in every Member State to find out more of the details and to make it country-specific."
"So I think we can say that we have a fairly good basis of knowledge of what citizens expect and what they need when it comes to information, although I also think that it can vary a bit from one Member State to another."
"I think that one of the lessons drawn in Ireland was the need to engage on a very broad scale and that is why the National Forum was set up;"
"I think that, following visits from both myself and, most recently, President Barroso, we have tried to engage and listen to the National Forum and their needs and we are trying through our representation office to respond to those needs, while also respecting that there is always a very special situation when you have a referendum: for example, you also have to respect the McKenna legislation which is in place in Ireland."
"This of course restricts or sets very clear limits on what ministers or the government can do."
"At the same time we have a general obligation to engage and provide information, which cannot be taken away from us, and I think that this is how we have learnt how to engage with the National Forum and also how to do more using the media and with young people especially, but also with women because in our experience they are the ones who very often feel alienated and distant from the debate."
"That is also where we have to use modern communication tools like the internet: another lesson learnt is that we have to engage through the internet."
"Subject: Closer cooperation between European Commission and European Parliament representations"
"The Commission is seeking to increase citizens' involvement in discussions on EU matters. At the start of April of this year, the Commission announced the 'Debate Europe' initiative."
"The intention is to broaden further the activities carried out at EU Member State level: consulting citizens, sharing information, knowledge and ideas about the EU, and providing opportunities for voters to meet EU officials."
"In some EU capitals, it is said that Commission and European Parliament representations cooperate poorly when it comes to giving EU citizens a better idea of what is happening in the EU and acquainting them with its agenda, its institutions and its Member States."
"Commission and Parliament representations often work separately, duplicating each other's activities, and do not carry out large joint projects."
"As the European Parliament elections in 2009 approach, are efforts being made to improve cooperation between Commission and Parliament representations in different countries?"
"If so, what specifically will be done?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - 2008 is a crucial year for all of the institutions to prepare for the European elections next year."
"It is in all our interests to work together to maximise turn-out in June 2009."
"The work launched by the recent communication 'Debate Europe', promoting active dialogue between citizens and decision makers on European issues, should contribute to this work."
"But the Commission and Parliament already work in close partnership in these areas, both in Brussels and at the level of our representation and information offices in Member States."
"Last month our services started a new working group to maximise the joint impact of our activities and also to seek closer cooperation between Commission and Parliament representations and offices."
"We are looking to revise the 2001 Code of Conduct on the working relationship that will open up new ways for us to work together, as well as facilitating the common use of resources such as audiovisual or press monitoring tools."
"We are also committed to the goal of shared premises in Member States - the so-called 'EU Houses' - and already in 25 of the 27 Member States our offices share space in the same building."
"As you know, we are in a pilot project in three of these European Houses - in Madrid, Dublin and Tallinn - with a common space which we call a 'European public space'."
"We have been able to broaden the scope of our activities to engage with cultural activities, and scientific and youth events as well."
"We now have a first report on this pilot project with the European public spaces."
"It seems to be very positive and we will continue along these lines."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your comprehensive and clear answer."
"I am sure that you are an optimist by nature."
"On the other hand, your position in the Commission also calls for optimism."
"I am sure that you are counting on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in all countries this year."
"I would like to ask what, in your opinion, would be the difference between the election campaign for the European Parliament in 2004 and next year, bearing in mind that most probably it will be after the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I shall be very blunt."
"I think that we also need to engage much more from the Commission's side, through our representation offices, in mobilising voters, to ensure that we have a higher voter turn-out."
"We cannot be too cautious."
"I think we all have to say that we want European citizens to exercise their right to vote and this is how we will engage with Member States - again in partnership, not taking a political position but really just to mobilise voters."
"We are looking, together with the European Parliament, through the Interinstitutional Group for Information and Communication, at how we can do this."
"Parliament has already presented a well-crafted and elaborate plan for the EP elections and we will contribute to that in the best possible way, using all our tools and especially our representation offices."
"Together with Parliament we can make sure that we increase the voter turn-out."
"(LT) I would like to point out that it is immensely important for an information company to have its material prepared in all the languages of the EU."
"I very much hope..."
"I will speak in English."
"Maybe you cannot hear me, as I see the Commissioner is busy."
"I just wanted to say that it is difficult to receive information in Lithuanian, because I represent Lithuania here."
"If you try to call the toll-free number for Europe Direct and ask a question in Lithuanian, you will be advised to wait for half an hour."
"It is difficult to find books in Lithuanian even here in the Parliament office for visitors, because the booklets are only available in the main languages."
"I do understand that there is a huge problem with interpretation and a financial problem, but maybe you have to set some priorities."
"Would you be so kind as to check how Europe Direct centres operate in different languages as, for example, Commissioner Kuneva is doing?"
"I think the situation is quite clear, that if you have something direct to say to citizens they will listen and hear."
"We had a debate on European City Guides today but we got very little in terms of reaction from the Council and I think we need to bring more clear messages back to people about what we do here in the European Union and that we are actually here for them, not just to talk about them."
"I would prefer that Parliament's representation took the lead at the Member State level rather than the Commission, but obviously I would say that, and I would urge respect and caution on the ratification process in Ireland."
"These are turbulent times and news emerging from the WTO is not assisting us in this regard."
"I think we have to be mindful of the genuine concerns of our voters."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Well, of course this is a constant struggle to make sure that we can provide information - that we can provide interpretation and translation in all 23 official languages."
"Sometimes we are not able to respond fully to that because we lack interpreters, for example, or we have not yet a full staff that can respond to this request, but I take note of your comment on that and we will look into it as well."
"I will also make a visit soon to Lithuania and I am sure I will hear more about this, but this is not due to a lack of will from the Commission."
"It is the starting point for any communication that you can communicate, hopefully, in your own language and understand what is being told, also in your own language."
"Therefore, we will continue to endeavour to make sure we provide all the necessary resources for doing so; therefore I fully respect your question and I think it is a very serious one."
"Well the other point was of course a comment and it is a fact that we have to start where citizens are."
"We have to respond to the questions they have, and of course the truth is that very rarely do they start by asking about the Treaty provisions or an amendment. They start by asking, What do you do about immigration?"
"What do you do about climate change? How do you fight the problems that we see as cross-border problems, and how do you deal with that?"
"And this is how we have to respond, and in an everyday language."
"I think that what has actually helped - and this is something I take credit for - is that we have now started with these citizens' summaries to all the proposals that we present."
"Also in our work programme, we will have an accompanying citizens' summary, and I see that this is very useful, and we have to continue along these lines."
"Subject: Commission's Plan D for Dialogue, Democracy and Debate and 'Debate Europe'"
"The Commission's Plan D for Dialogue, Democracy and Debate of October 2005 was a response to the EU's 'period of reflection' following the negative outcome of the referendums on the Constitution."
"Two and a half years later, does the Commission believe that it has effectively attained the objectives of its plan?"
"If not, why not?"
"What were the obstacles?"
"As regards the Commission's recent communication on the 'Debate Europe' project (April 2008) to bring citizens closer to the Union and its institutions, can the Commission provide details concerning eligible expenditure, the amount that will be available per Member State and organisation, and the beneficiaries that will undertake the pan-European consultation projects with citizens?"
"How will it provide a framework for cooperation among the EU's institutions and, in particular, with the European Parliament?"
"How will it contribute towards setting up electronic networks in which MEPs and members of national and regional parliaments will participate?"
"How will it create European public spaces in the capitals of the Member States?"
"How will it become more active at local level?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I can say that Plan D played a key role in testing new methods for civil society organisations to involve citizens from all walks of life in debates on the future of Europe."
"It gave us examples of consultation that we never had before, inviting randomly-chosen citizens from all Member States to sit down together and discuss the European Union's agenda."
"It was indeed a very exciting experience."
"One of the key lessons from this experience was that we need to strengthen the interface between citizens and EU decision-makers because, if we promise to listen better, what do we do with what we hear?"
"This is what they want to know."
"We decided to prolong Plan D in the period leading up to the European parliamentary elections in June next year."
"This new phase is called 'Debate Europe'."
"We have allocated EUR 7.2 million to Debate Europe, EUR 2 million of which to cofinance transnational projects and EUR 5.2 million to cofinance decentralised calls and actions supporting local projects administered by the representations."
"We do not decide in advance how much money is available per Member State or which beneficiaries will run these pan-European consultation projects."
"This depends on the results of the calls for proposals which the Commission is presently launching, both centrally and via our representations."
"We think that Debate Europe should also provide an effective framework for interinstitutional cooperation."
"One model was the concluding conference that was held on the first phase of Plan D last December."
"Here not only the Parliament, the Commission, but also the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee were involved."
"I think it proved complementary in addressing the specific citizens' concerns and that this kind of cooperation should become the rule in the framework of Debate Europe, also at national or regional level."
"We also hope that we can engage Members of the European Parliament much more in these local and regional activities."
"I have just informed this group - the so-called 'IGI' - about the request from this Parliament to engage in a pilot information network."
"We have prepared and will present to the European Parliament the outcome of our project very soon: preparing for such a network, joining national and European parliamentarians and we hope also inviting journalists to take part in the debate on European issues."
"I have already mentioned the public spheres, the European public spaces, in the pilot project."
"Along these lines we can continue Plan D, learn from the experience so far and engage with citizens on a number of projects and models that we hopefully can establish permanently - not only as something that runs for six months or so - and ensure that we can involve decision-makers with European citizens in these ways."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the problem for all of us lies in the fact that Europe is cut off from ordinary people."
"Despite all the good efforts made by the Commission and by us MEPs, we can clearly see that information is not reaching ordinary citizens."
"I should like to ask which agencies will bring the citizen closer to Europe, as envisaged in the Debate Europe plan."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - One of the new initiatives of course is that we need a European political culture, and that is what, as you know, we have presented."
"And this has been adopted by Parliament as well to engage in political foundations which can contribute to the debate."
"This is because we need to have it in the regular political discussions at all levels: EU issues have to be integrated better."
"I think that this initiative, in allowing European political foundations, will help."
"I think we need to do it through the media, to have a European media reporting on EU affairs, and that is why we have a new internet strategy, we have a new audiovisual strategy, where we will be better equipped to put European issues in media reporting all over Europe."
"And I think we have to provide the meeting places, the public spaces, and this is where we have some pilot projects to allow for that."
"These transnational projects where we have engaged in consultation with citizens can, I think, give us some useful lessons as well as some useful experience that hopefully we will be able to put in place permanently one day."
"But we have to use all these channels to be effective in not cutting off, but in engaging citizens: listening to them, explaining to them and advocating what we are doing at EU level."
"(EL) Madam President, before the Internal Market Programme of 1992 there was the Cecchini Report on the costs of non-Europe."
"Does the European Commission intend to prepare a specific communication on the costs of non-Lisbon?"
"What will be the cost to Europe if the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is not completed?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - This is always the most difficult thing: saying what happens if we do not do this or do that."
"We would like to present proactively the advantage, why we think that a new Treaty is needed."
"How can we be more effective?"
"We have tried, on the Commission's side, to designate and formulate questions and answers, our different background materials and what we have put on the internet in such a way that we argue proactively, on the offensive, as to why we need a new Treaty and what problems need to be solved."
"That has been our starting point but we have engaged, on the Commission's side, as well in trying to explain what the price would be of not agreeing, because I think it will also influence people's confidence and trust in whether we can really address the big problems and challenges that we see in front of us."
"Questions 35 to 39 will receive written answers."
"Subject: Restrictions on competition by sporting federations"
"Given that the sporting federations of specific EU countries seek to impose rules on their members which restrict sportsmen's and sports and women's possibilities with regard to contracts and freedom of movement, in clear violation of EU law, has the Commission studied the consequences of such practices from the point of view of freedom of competition?"
"Member of the Commission. - A number of cases coming before the Community courts have confirmed applicability of EC rules to the sports sector."
"In the Walrave and Donà judgments, for example, the European Court of Justice confirmed that regulations based on nationality which limit the mobility of sportsmen do not conform with the principle of free movement of persons."
"In the Bosman judgment the Court examined two types of restrictions which it found to be incompatible with the free movement of persons."
"Firstly, it prohibits, on grounds of discrimination as to nationality, a UEFA rule which restricted the number of foreign players from EU Member States allowed to participate in national football championships."
"Secondly, it condemned as an obstacle to the free movement of persons the FIFA transfer rule requiring the payment of end-of-contract transfer fees in respect of intra-EU transfers of players who are nationals of an EU Member State."
"The Piau and Meca Medina cases were the first Court judgments to apply EC competition rules to the sector."
"Since then the Commission has followed the methodological approach of that case-law in assessing whether a rule adopted by a sports federation or association infringes Articles 81 and 82."
"Therefore any sports rule which is capable of producing restrictive effects on competition has to be examined on a case-by-case basis in order to determine whether it pursues a legitimate objective."
"At the same time the Commission must be satisfied that any anti-competitive effects resulting from such a rule are inherent to the pursuit of its objective and are proportionate to its achievement."
"The Commission looked at the issue of international football transfers when it investigated the legality of FIFA rules on transfer fees for players who were still under contract."
"That investigation was closed in 2002 after FIFA committed itself to modifying its transfer rules on the basis of certain principles which aimed at facilitating transfers."
"In the Commission's White Paper on Sport, which was adopted on 11 July 2007, issues such as free movement of sportspersons were also exhaustively addressed, especially in the accompanying document entitled 'The EU and Sport: Background and Context'."
"In the same legislative package the Commission adopted the Pierre de Coubertin action plan which advocates sport-related action to be taken at EU level and contains a number of proposals to be implemented and/or supported by the Commission in numerous areas of sport."
"One such area concerns the free movement of persons, with the goal being to combat discrimination based on nationality in all sports."
"This goal shall be achieved through political dialogue, through recommendations, structured dialogue with stakeholders and, when appropriate, through infringement procedures initiated by the Commission against Member States."
"In addition, the Commission applies EC competition rules to sport organisations in so far as those organisations regulate economic activities."
"In doing so the Commission takes into account the specificity of sport."
"(ES) Madam President, thank you very much, Commissioner, for your extensive and very comprehensive answer to my question."
"In short, as a complementary observation to the explanation given by the Commissioner, I infer that at the moment the Commission is not thinking of adopting any legislative measures, as it considers that the current legislation, including the Treaties and the case-law, is sufficient, and that therefore the path that is going to be taken is that of informal agreements with the federations, codes of conduct, and so on and so forth."
"The Commission does not think that it is necessary at this time to have any additional measures, so all that is needed is simply to apply the existing legislation."
"Member of the Commission. - That is correct."
"The European Court of Justice - and the honourable Member has already felt the direction I am moving in - has ruled in the Meca Medina judgment that the compatibility of sporting rules with EC competition law cannot be assessed by way of declaring certain categories of rules a priori exempt from the application of EC competition law."
"The Commission will therefore have to continue applying competition rules on a case-by case basis, referring to its adopted decisions and the existing case-law."
"Finally, the Meca Medina judgment provides a clear methodological framework in that respect."
"In order to assess whether a rule breached EU competition rules, its effect must be proportionate to the legitimate genuine sporting interest pursued, so this proportionality test can only be applied on a case-by-case basis."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, in all the Member States, the national sports federations, particularly the football federations, complain vociferously on the basis of international sports federation statutes (FIFA, UEFA, etc.) every time their activities are investigated by the government."
"While we recognise the independence of the federations, does the EU agree with statutes that infringe and are considered to be above national legislation and a country's constitution?"
"Does the Commission agree that the UEFA home-grown players' scheme is compatible with the Treaty?"
"It encourages football clubs to have a proportion of their players coming up through their junior teams and their youth academies without a link to nationality and that therefore, quite unlike the FIFA scheme of 5+6 - which is based on nationality and would clearly be illegal - the UEFA scheme is something that is proportionate, legitimate and will force clubs to invest in training their young players rather than just relying on their financial muscle in the international transfer market."
"Member of the Commission. - I will try to combine the two questions as it is an area that clearly shares the same type of thinking, the goal being to combat discrimination based on nationality in all sports."
"I think that is the main thing and that is a principle, so to say."
"That goal should be achieved through political dialogue, recommendations, structural dialogue with stakeholders and, when appropriate, through infringement procedures."
"Therefore, I think that what we have to take into account is that this competition line that I was explaining earlier is quite clear and that it should not be attacked by other ways of thinking."
"Subject: Price rises and competition"
"Major price rises have been recorded in recent months in many Member States, particularly for foodstuffs, which has severely reduced the European public's purchasing power."
"Numerous observers have suggested that, besides the increase in the price of raw materials, there have been some excessive mark-ups by distribution channels and, moreover, possible breaches of free competition."
"Can the Commission state whether it has any permanent indicators that can alert it to an explosion in certain consumer prices, and also whether any investigations have been conducted recently into distribution channels, following the sudden price rises recorded in certain Member States?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission is of course concerned about the recent wholesale and retail price increases in food and food products."
"This has implications for the people of Europe and, even more seriously, implications for billions of others around the world."
"Indeed, EU food price inflation accelerated in the last quarter of 2007."
"The observed price increases at consumer level reflect recent developments in product value, cost and profit along the food supply chain."
"It should be noted that prices for major agricultural raw commodities had been rising for several months and continuously breaking record levels."
"That development mainly resulted from a combination of structural drivers: a steady rise in global food demand, the emergence of the biofuel market - only for a very small part - and more short-term factors such as adverse climate conditions, which provoked a decrease in the output volume of cereals in most of the EU Member States in 2007 and the restrictive export policy of some key world market suppliers and in general an increasing engagement of investment funds in agricultural commodity markets."
"Nevertheless, it should be underlined that prices of raw materials do not constitute a strictly proportional part of food prices, especially as it becomes more processed."
"Thus some other components of the sale price, and I am thinking of energy and labour margins, have also influenced recent increases in food prices in the European Union."
"It must be noted that these price increases are not necessarily linked to a deficiency in the application of competition rules."
"As the honourable Member knows, the primary objective of EC competition policy is to make markets work better for the benefit of consumers in the EU."
"As mentioned in several replies to recent parliamentary questions, the Commission, together with the national competition authorities forming the European Competition Network, monitors markets in order to prevent and sanction distortions of competition to the extent that these distortions can potentially harm consumers."
"The Commission only acts when it is better placed than national competition authorities to take action."
"They will act first, but when they are not in a position to do so, we will jump in."
"Indeed, since the issues related to the retail sector are frequently national in scope, the Member States are well placed to address them."
"However, the Commission would like to reiterate that, should any specific breaches of competition rules be confirmed and supported by legal and economic evidence, we will not hesitate to take action."
"It is of course important to consider all relevant factors affecting these markets and the Commission will continue to monitor consumer prices, retail market concentration and any allegations of anti-competitive conduct."
"The Commission considers market monitoring to be a very important task."
"In the framework of the Single Market Review, the Commission will analyse the possible reasons for the malfunctioning of retail services, seen both from consumers' and suppliers' perspectives."
"The levels and differences of consumer prices between the Member States are also monitored in the annual report of the Consumer Markets Scoreboard."
"The first edition - as you are aware - of the Scoreboard was published at the beginning of 2008 and the exercise will be carried out yearly."
"Prices are among the main screening indicators."
"Some price differences, especially in the case of non-tradable goods and services, may clearly be due to differences of income between the Member States."
"Nevertheless, particularly large differences between the Member States may suggest the need for further scrutiny."
"Additionally, the Commission will touch upon the issue of market power in the distribution sector in the framework of a High Level Group on the competitiveness of the agrifood industry."
"That initiative will be launched by the Commission in order to analyse the food industry, which in recent years has faced new risks and challenges which question the sector's competitiveness."
"The Commission will also in the weeks to come formally transmit a response to the European Parliament's written declaration on investigating and remedying the abuse of power by large supermarkets in the EU."
"The Commission's response will provide, among other aspects, certain clarifications in relation to buyer-power-related issues."
"(FR) As you know, this morning in Kehl, the French and German consumer ministers met to discuss the price differences between the two countries."
"These discrepancies can reach 30% for some high-consumption products."
"Among the causes discussed, they mentioned the differences in retail trading structures, and in particular the imperfect competition in some countries."
"Internet sales should allow consumers to take advantage of these differences by buying from the most advantageous countries."
"However, mail order on the Internet sometimes poses problems."
"For example, French people cannot buy from some German sites."
"Do you intend to take appropriate measures so that the European internal market will finally be a reality for citizens?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am absolutely aware of the importance of your question and of getting in line with one single market."
"You can be absolutely sure that the Commission will do its utmost to make it a real single market also in the retail sphere."
"(LT) From your report I understand that the Directorate-General for Competition works in cooperation with the competition authorities in the Member States."
"However, we citizens can see certain agreements taking place, resulting in price increases in all the countries simultaneously, yet the competition authorities fail to find any transgression."
"What would you say from your experience - is it a case of a lack of qualification in the Member States or one of abuse?"
"Member of the Commission. - So far the answer is a clear 'no', but we are aware that it is calling for our attention, and not only our attention, in terms of monitoring what is going on."
"What we have done is to put it on the agenda in the European competition network, and we are gathering information from all the Member States that have experience - some have inquiries, others are analysing, others are just trying to find out what is going wrong in the retail area."
"France, Germany, the UK, Belgium - they all have different approaches to today's situation."
"So far, there is no reason to say that there is a cartel."
"As soon as we become aware of a cartel we will act, I can assure you, but, by the way, I think it is not that bad, as national competition authorities are active and following the whole situation in this sector."
"Questions 35 to 39 will receive written answers."
"Subject: Accession negotiations with Croatia"
"Does the Commission think that the accession negotiations with Croatia can be completed by the end of the year? What is the exact timetable for the rest of the year?"
"Subject: Progress of the accession of Croatia into the European Union"
"Can the European Commission give a statement outlining the state of play with regard to Croatia's application to accede into the European Union?"
"Subject: Conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia"
"Since the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia the country has already made substantial progress, leading to the opening of many negotiation chapters, and is well on the way to meeting the benchmarks for opening and closing further chapters."
"Above all, there have been positive developments in connection with the alignment of Croatian law with EU standards, protection for minorities and efforts to bring about judicial reform."
"In addition, through its recent decision not to introduce the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone Croatia has cleared the way for faster progress in the accession negotiations."
"These welcome developments are acknowledged in Parliament's report on Croatia's 2007 progress report, paragraphs 31 and 32 of which call for enhanced support for Croatia from the EU, and in particular from the Commission."
"How will the Commission step up the support it provides?"
"Provided that Croatia meets the relevant criteria, will the Commission put forward, in autumn 2008, a provisional timetable for the conclusion of the accession negotiations in 2009?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Mr Posselt, Mr Crowley and Mr Ebner have all asked about the state of play of accession negotiations with Croatia and I can respond to them jointly."
"These negotiations with Croatia are progressing well overall."
"So far negotiations have been opened on 18 chapters out of 35 and we have closed two of these chapters."
"As regards opening benchmarks, 11 sets of benchmarks have been set."
"The Commission has assessed the benchmarks as being met in seven of these 11 cases."
"In these cases our recommendations are now under discussion among the Member States in the Council or negotiation positions are being prepared."
"In the remaining chapters, such as competition policy and public procurement, opening benchmarks were already set by the Union in the first half of 2006 - that is two years ago."
"But Croatia has been slow in taking the necessary measures to meet these opening benchmarks."
"Croatia is still working on opening benchmarks for the chapter on the judiciary and fundamental rights, where there are many difficult challenges in areas such as judicial reform, the fight against corruption and refugee return."
"While Croatia has done plenty of good work aligning with the key 16 chapters where we have closing benchmarks, Croatia has not done enough at this stage to meet all closing benchmarks in any of these 16 chapters."
"With the remaining conditions still to be met by Croatia it unrealistic to assume that accession negotiations could be concluded this year in 2008."
"Croatia has nonetheless made good progress overall and therefore 2008 could be a decisive year in Croatia's EU accession negotiations."
"Provided a number of conditions are met by Croatia, the Commission will in this autumn's enlargement package present an indicative timetable or a conditional roadmap for the conclusion of other technical negotiations in the course of 2009."
"The first condition to be met is that Croatia should meet all opening benchmarks by June this year, i.e. next month."
"Secondly, Croatia must comply with all legal obligations under the stabilisation and accession agreement and it must also continue to comply with the general conditionalities of the stabilisation and accession process."
"And thirdly, Croatia needs urgently to improve its management of EU financial assistance under the PHARE and IPA programmes."
"The President of the Commission will continue to provide substantial financial and technical assistance for Croatia in order to help it fulfil the requirements of EU membership."
"Once sufficient progress has been made by Croatia in meeting opening or closing benchmarks, the Commission will prepare and submit in good time the necessary recommendations to the Member States for the positions to be taken in the intergovernmental conference."
"So, in a nutshell, ultimately the pace of progress of Croatia towards the European Union will be determined by its own ability to meet all necessary conditions."
"Thus we can work and progress on the basis of Croatia's own merits."
"- (DE) Commissioner, you know my position - that Croatia should have become a Member long ago, if justice prevailed."
"However, I am not expressing my personal point of view here, but that of this House."
"Parliament said that negotiations should be completed by 2009 at the latest."
"At its meeting in Croatia a few weeks ago, the Joint Parliamentary Committee said that all chapters should be opened under the Slovenian Presidency and closed under the French or, at the latest, the Czech Presidency."
"Does the Commission believe that this schedule is realistic and what is it doing to speed things up?"
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response."
"Two points."
"First of all, with regard to the judicial and fundamental rights chapter where there appears to be a lot of difficulties concerning the negotiations: how best can we help Croatia to advance on that side of it?"
"Secondly, concerning the distribution of the PHARE programme money and the management of those monies: where are the biggest pitfalls that the Croatia financial management system has to overcome?"
"Thirdly, going back to what my colleague Bernd Posselt said, we thought there was an agreement that this would be concluded very quickly."
"If there are still 17 chapters which have yet to be opened for negotiation, how can we proceed at the pace that we want to see happening?"
"Member of the Commission. - Thank you for these very pertinent and important follow-up questions."
"The Commission is working with Croatia as it would with any other candidate country so that we follow the negotiating framework adopted in unanimity by the Council and by the Member States."
"It is our task and responsibility to monitor progress in meeting the benchmarks on the basis of our rather new benchmark methodology, which was created and adopted at the end of 2006 - with very strong support by Parliament - in order to improve the quality of the EU accession process."
"This means that once a country is able to open one benchmark and then close the same benchmark it has proved that it has made sufficient progress in the issues concerned."
"I give you one very concrete example: that is the shipbuilding sector in Croatia."
"We expect that Croatia will provide a very concrete restructuring strategy for the whole sector, as well as for all the individual shipyards concerned in this sector."
"There was a meeting recently between the Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia and my colleague Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for Competition, to scrutinise the state of affairs in this regard."
"We are still waiting for somewhat more convincing efforts by the Croatian authorities to show that Croatia will be able to restructure its shipbuilding sector properly so that we can move forward in the field of competition policy where state aid is a very critical benchmark."
"This is to prove that it really is in the hands of the Croatian Government and the authorities to meet the benchmarks."
"We always knew that some of the benchmarks were more challenging than others and the Commission has encouraged Croatia to work diligently in order to meet these difficult benchmarks, especially in the area of judiciary reform that Mr Crowley referred to, as well as in the other area I mentioned, the shipbuilding sector."
"Concerning judiciary reform, we are providing legal and technical assistance for Croatia under the institution-building part of the instrument for pre-accession."
"We are encouraging twinning exercises and of course we provide our own expertise for Croatia."
"Member States are also providing their peer reviews which are important in order to benchmark whether or not Croatia is making good progress in this field."
"So all in all, we are doing well overall in the negotiations."
"The pace of the negotiations essentially depends on the pace of these critical reforms in order for Croatia to meet first the opening and then closing benchmarks."
"Subject: Progress of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) towards accession to the European Union"
"At a press conference held at the NATO Summit in Brussels on 5 March 2008, the Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Rehn, stated that the failure of Greece and FYROM to reach an agreement on the name of the latter would adversely affect FYROM's accession to the European Union."
"The EU wishes to encourage the continuation of negotiations under the auspices of the UN in order to find a mutually acceptable solution in the near future to the question of that country's name. What measures will the Commission, therefore, take to facilitate the resumption of negotiations and find a mutually acceptable solution?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, please allow me to clarify that on 5 March I did not attend a NATO Summit."
"I might have wanted to but I did not attend the NATO Summit as is mistakenly indicated in the question."
"Instead, I took part in the meeting of the Commission - our weekly meeting - and in that meeting we adopted a Commission communication entitled, 'The Western Balkans: enhancing the European perspective'."
"Subsequently I made the statement at the press conference on this issue to which the honourable Member is referring."
"In that context, in the press conference, I noted that the main issue was consuming much political energy."
"I encouraged the leaders of both countries to find a formula which is acceptable to both sides."
"I have done this publicly and privately."
"In reply to a question I explained that the decisions relating to the EU accession process are taken by Member States on the basis of unanimity."
"In this context I expressed my concern that the lack of a solution to the main issue could have a negative effect on the country's accession process."
"I can assure you that the Commission will continue to call on the parties to engage constructively to resolve the main issue."
"However, the Commission has no competences, no powers on such measures and therefore efforts should continue under the auspices of the United Nations within the framework of the two important UN Executive Council resolutions which date from the year 1993."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your answer, which confirms the statement you made in Brussels."
"I also thanked you in my question on 5 March at the press conference on the matter."
"Given that in a resolution on the accession prospects of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) the European Parliament has recently recognised the need to speed up negotiations in order to reach a generally accepted solution, let me ask you this: do you intend, together with Parliament, and by exercising your powers, to take any steps before your report is drawn up in the autumn?"
"Member of the Commission. - We continue to encourage both countries concerned to find a solution to this long-standing - I should say too long-standing - problem."
"We have full confidence in the United Nations Mediator, Mr Nimitz, who has a clear mandate to facilitate talks between the two parties in the framework of the two critical resolutions of the UN Security Council from 1993."
"The Commission cannot therefore play the role of mediator."
"We have no powers, no competences, but we encourage both sides to take a very constructive approach, to engage and finally find a solution to this matter."
"- (DE) Commissioner, the Commission has a responsibility: it is the guardian of the treaties."
"The Interim Agreement states that bilateral issues must not be allowed to become a barrier to accession."
"I wanted to ask you to confirm that and to ask whether you have observed any efforts on the part of the Macedonian Government to resolve the issues and whether, in your opinion, Macedonia has made progress in recent months."
"Member of the Commission. - In my view you are indeed right that the country has made good progress for the past half-year or so in terms of some critical reforms such as the judiciary reform and the reform of public administration, as well as on the implementation of the police law."
"In fact, in the March communication we have set eight benchmarks based on key criteria, key priorities, of the Accession Partnership which reflect the necessary reforms we expect the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be able to undertake, thereby achieving sufficient progress to allow us in our autumn report to propose a recommendation to start accession negotiations."
"This will depend upon concrete results in the reform work and we will of course reflect that in our progress report which is currently under preparation."
"I would like to point out that in order to start accession negotiations, in order for the Commission recommendation to be accepted, in the Council there is a requirement of unanimity of all EU Member States and therefore, even though we see this as a bilateral issue, we have to take this into account as a political reality."
"As regards our recommendation, that depends solely on the progress achieved by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the implementation of the reforms on the ground."
"Subject: European funding for the Turkish army in Cyprus"
"Media reports allege that the EU has provided the Turkish army with funding to the tune of EUR 13 million."
"Can the Commission confirm that the Turkish army in fact been financed out of European funds?"
"If so, which funds and projects were involved and over how long a period?"
"How much money did the Turkish army receive in total?"
"Who took the initiative of authorising this funding?"
"Does the Commission plan to continue funding the Turkish army in future?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am very glad to respond to this question because I can do it very briefly."
"There is no fund provided by the European Union to the Turkish army in Cyprus as suggested in the title of the question by the honourable Member."
"Under the pre-accession programme, IPA, the European Union supports in Turkey a project which is called 'Civic training for conscripts', and this project indeed is run in Turkey, not in Cyprus."
"The purpose of this project is, through the Turkish armed forces, to educate conscripts who are doing their military service on the issues of human rights, gender equality, women's rights, children's rights, protection of the environment, general health care and the fight against drug addiction: in my view all very worthy causes, and this is what this programme called 'Civic training for conscripts' in Turkey is aimed at achieving."
"(NL) I should like to thank the Commissioner for his response, but I have two brief questions in this regard."
"First and foremost, how does the Commissioner explain the broadcasting of such affairs by the press?"
"This information came from a press review and I believe that it was stated in a Turkish-Cypriot publication."
"Secondly, how can the Commission ensure that the Turkish troops occupying Cyprus do not somehow come by a portion of the funds and thus that these funds are not being used for anything other than their intended purpose?"
"Member of the Commission. - It is indeed important that we correct myths with facts and that we correct misunderstandings by providing concrete and objective factual information."
"Therefore, I am very grateful that the honourable Member has asked this question."
"In fact, by answering your question which I just did, I am sure that we can now provide facts which will correct these misunderstandings in the media which were referred to by Mr Claeys."
"As I said, this project is run in Turkey by the Turkish armed forces and therefore this should clarify the point made by the honourable Member concerning where this project and programme is being run."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.55 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Announcement by the President: see Minutes"
"Composition of political groups: see Minutes"
"Composition of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Mobile satellite services (MSS) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Hall, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the selection and authorisation of systems providing mobile satellite services - C6-0257/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I first of all should thank Parliament for having addressed the Commission proposal as a matter of urgency and I know this is not easy at all."
"Parliament has done more than the impossible in order to get there, and it has done well."
"Mobile satellite services constitute a sector with high potential for Europe with applications ranging from high-speed internet access, through mobile broadcasting, to emergency services."
"The development of a competitive internal market for mobile satellite services will produce significant economies of scale and a more efficient use of spectrum, and all this for the benefit of businesses and consumers throughout Europe."
"However, timing is of the essence if we do not want to miss the current window of opportunity for mobile satellite systems."
"This initiative puts in place a pan-European, binding selection process of specific satellite operators, and it is very innovative indeed in several respects."
"I am therefore very grateful for the efforts made by the rapporteur, Mrs Hall and for those made by all the other colleagues in the European Parliament to promote consensus in Parliament and in the Council within what remains a very short time-frame."
"There are many amendments in the report aimed at including in the legislative decision details initially meant to be addressed during the implementation of the selection process."
"These include a detailed description of the selection criteria, the respective weighting of these criteria, the duration of the authorisations to be delivered by the competent national authorities and so on and so forth."
"In normal terms such level of detail is not present in legislative texts."
"But the Commission is ready to accept the amendments by Parliament."
"These amendments will of course contribute to a level of transparency which is even higher than the one in the proposal, and in addition the main elements of the proposal, in particular the competitive nature of the selection mechanism, the basic structure of the selection process and the main milestones and selection criteria, have remained largely unchanged."
"Despite these additional details, Parliament and the Council have asked for specific comitology procedures for several steps in the implementation of the selection programme."
"These procedures, which can be either regulatory or with scrutiny, are, I have to say, less flexible and more time-consuming than what the Commission has proposed."
"While the Commission is ready to show flexibility on this, and to accept these amendments, it should also be clear that this might have an impact on the overall timing of the selection process."
"This is of the essence and that is why I really call on all parties involved in the implementation to show flexibility in the practical arrangements that will be needed in order to bring the selection of satellite operators to a successful end as soon as possible."
"In this sense I also invite the Council to make all necessary efforts to finalise the agreement before the June TELCO Council so that a decision can be taken."
"So I know that there is a lot of work which has to be done now by our legal specialists in the Commission, Parliament and, most of all, in the Council."
"In conclusion, the Commission can support the amendments put forward by Mrs Hall."
"They correspond to the Slovenian presidency's compromise text and they pave the way for a first-reading arrangement."
"I am very confident that this sound compromise will receive broad support from Parliament."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I want to begin by thanking everyone who worked on the MSS decision."
"I say that not just as the usual courtesy, but because the decision has come to plenary this week as a first-reading agreement thanks to much support from my parliamentary colleagues and the help of the Commission in supplying additional text."
"I would also like to give warm thanks to the Slovenian presidency, who shared Parliament's determination to reach an early agreement in the interests of European competitiveness."
"In February 2007, Member States agreed to make radio frequency bands in the 2 GHz region available for a harmonised approach to mobile satellite services in order to avoid interference and fragmentation of the internal market and open up the possibility for European MSS technology to become globally competitive."
"The purpose of today's MSS decision is to select and authorise the operators of these pan-European mobile satellite services."
"In the debate and negotiation on this decision, the differences to overcome have been institutional and geographic, rather than party political."
"Firstly, MEPs were concerned that in the Commission's draft proposal there were elements of the selection and authorisation process which were of a political, rather than a purely technical, nature and that it was therefore not appropriate to use comitology to decide the details."
"In particular, MEPs and ministers from Member States on the periphery of the EU were very concerned that the selection criteria might favour operators who could only provide a service covering the centre of Europe."
"MEPs were also concerned that the selection criteria might not reflect Parliament's frequently expressed commitment to public interest services and to the inclusion of rural and less-developed regions."
"These difficulties were resolved by bringing into the text detailed and transparent wording on the weighting to be given to geographic coverage, public safety and protection services and the range of services provided to consumers in rural and remote areas."
"Particularly important was the compromise reached before the vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, stipulating that all applicants must commit to services covering at least 50% of the population and at least 60% of the aggregate land area of each Member State."
"While this falls short of the 100% coverage which I know some colleagues would have preferred, I think it offers a realistic compromise given the technical and economic constraints that the industry is under."
"Furthermore, Member States retain the right to use the spectrum for other purposes where and when it lies outside the mobile satellite service area, and Member States may impose emergency service use of mobile satellite systems during major disasters."
"To conclude, I think we have reached a very good and swift agreement which will benefit both citizens and industry."
"I trust that the final signatures can be put on the deal in June to allow the first call for applications to go out before the summer, and I hope that, next time Member States and the Commission decide they need a pan-EU service in a particular frequency band, they will look to the MSS decision as a model of how to reach a speedy agreement by involving Parliament in the detail of the text."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Mr President, I too, would first like to thank Mrs Hall for her extremely ambitious efforts to achieve a timely result for this difficult report."
"She did it!"
"The report was difficult because it had to establish rules for the special case of Europe-wide mobile satellite services before the Telecom package was revised."
"It is to Parliament's credit, and most especially to the credit of its rapporteur, that we have succeeded in finding ways to make a preliminary ruling like this, which nevertheless makes a sufficient degree of transparency possible and actually links exceptional decisions to exceptional circumstances."
"I am very glad about this, therefore, and can say on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education that we support the result that has been achieved, because it includes three points that are important in our committee's view: firstly, the decision respects the competence of the Member States to decide how to allocate frequencies."
"Secondly, the decision is also linked to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and thirdly, this will also strengthen media pluralism and cultural diversity within these services."
"All we can do now is hope - and this is our wish - that this work is also worthwhile and that there really will be pan-European mobile satellite services, as this decision leads us to expect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate my fellow Member Mrs Hall, the rapporteur on this complex matter, for her willingness to cooperate with the rapporteurs from the political Groups."
"I include in this my excellent colleague Mrs Niebler, Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the committee responsible, which does a superb job."
"The compromise proposed is satisfactory."
"It is the fruit of long discussions that we had with the Slovenian Presidency, which I congratulate on the quality of its work, and should enable us to reach an agreement at first reading so that mobile satellite services will be provided quickly."
"This matter is a great European success, and well done, Commissioner, because in the future, systems supplying mobile satellite services, such as high-speed data transfer or mobile television, will be selected at European level."
"This is evidence of efficiency, better economy and Community preference."
"We are aware of the compromise."
"We have come a long way, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has accepted an increase in the services provided to citizens, as each system will have to cover 60% of the territory of the Union from the start and the whole of the territory at the latest seven years after the launch."
"I am pleased that the major criteria for the coverage required was territory and not solely population, which means that our rural and outlying areas can be served."
"This is something that is close to my heart, as I come from a rural region that took a long time, and is still taking time, to benefit from the technological infrastructures as have the large urban areas, and it is about equal opportunities for citizens wherever they are in European Union territory."
"Once the text has been adopted in Parliament and approved by the Council, I ask the Commission to do everything to quickly establish mobile satellite services according to reasonable pricing that needs to be monitored."
"These services are major financial and technological challenges, but they mean that Europe has the opportunity to equip itself with an advanced sector in terms of satellite services."
"Finally, I hope that the boldness and brilliance of our European manufacturers will enable them to submit to this political compromise, proving once again their huge capacity for technological adaptation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, finally we have arrived at the eve of the vote in Parliament regarding the S band, which has been so highly anticipated by the operators and by the majority of the Member States."
"We note the significance of these frequencies, which so far have not been used and whose capacity to transmit mobile television, data or emergency services is now recognised, and which Parliament has expressed its particular commitment to."
"It is true that the method cannot be optimal."
"This somewhat 'impressionist' approach, which has consisted of establishing a frequency plan in small brush strokes, has shown some limitations."
"We will seek to remedy this when we examine the Telecommunications Regulatory Package."
"With regard to mobile satellite services, fundamentally the final result offers a balance between political ambition and economic feasibility."
"In particular, Parliament insisted on the degree of geographical coverage in order to protect against the risk of a digital gulf being created between Member States, but also within them."
"The weighing up of the criteria for the 'beauty contest' is a true reflection of the respective weight of the concerns of Parliament and of European citizens, in particular in relation to public services."
"Finally, the possibility of to some extent requisitioning the frequencies allocated in the event of a disaster is in line with the current discussions within the ITU, where the contribution of telecommunications to protecting human life was examined last year at the global conference."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group, I must stress how pleasant it was to work with Mrs Hall, our rapporteur, whose utter determination was clear."
"I also commend the Slovenian Presidency for its effective contribution."
"It was given a baptism of fire by being faced with a really thorny issue."
"Finally, I would like to commend the willingness of our Commissioner, Mrs Reding, the technical cooperation between the Commission services, the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and the legal and language experts from the two joint legislators who enabled us to produce a quality text."
"I am also happy to have chaired the two trialogues that helped to clarify the points to be debated and resolved."
"Parliament was conciliatory in the finalisation of the agreement with the Council in view of the short timescale in relation to satellite programming and the economic and industrial stakes."
"The financial investment to be made is sizeable and risky, and we all want it to succeed."
"This is why I am concluding this intervention by calling on the Presidency and the Commission so that we can hear them make a commitment that the timescales for the adoption of the text and the publication of the call for candidates before the summer will be respected."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is at present one of the key partners in spatial matters."
"The ambitious plan to launch a satellite system for the Galileo navigation satellite system is sufficient proof of this."
"All satellite-based systems should use in communications the same radio spectrum from 1980 to 2010 MHz and 2170 to 2200 MHz."
"It makes sense that this resolution is trying to unify the fragmented regulations of the individual countries in a uniform framework, and to set up a unified operating methodology for communication frequency assignment."
"For the given satellite, the frequencies should be the same for all EU Member States."
"This should both eliminate harmful interference and at the same time enable uniform development of this part of the sector, namely satellite communication."
"Taking into account that in the area of satellite communication the European Union at present covers 40% of the world market, we can clearly see that a common non-discriminatory policy can significantly strengthen the important role of the Union in this sector."
"In our opinion, the proposed solution will lead to much better development of the technical and economic communication elements."
"Only a uniform solution across all 27 states can overcome the existing national administrative barriers."
"This sector offers opportunities for qualified labour and it is therefore advisable to support this sector."
"The entire GUE/NGL Group supports this resolution."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying how proud I am of the work we are doing in the European Parliament on the report under debate."
"This is not just a matter of new technologies."
"We are talking about the important role played by a whole range of new technological applications, both in strengthening the social, economic and territorial cohesion of the EU, and in transforming its conventional economy into a knowledge-based economy."
"In particular, the message we are giving to European citizens today, ladies and gentlemen, is that within seven years of implementing the MSS systems, every last inhabitant of the most remote village in the Union will be able to enjoy satellite and mobile terrestrial services."
"This means very fast Internet connection, mobile television, satellite telephone, and above all, state protection and relief in the event of natural disasters."
"We have fought hard in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to ensure that no regions should be excluded from these services."
"If this happened, the digital gap between the metropolitan centres and outlying regions within each Member State, and generally between different regions of the EU, would widen."
"To conclude, I sincerely congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hall, and the shadow rapporteurs for the campaign they have fought in Parliament and with the Council to ensure that these very important requirements are included in the final legislative text on which we will be voting tomorrow."
"(BG) Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mrs. Hall, the rapporteur, for her efforts to ensure that all EU citizens from all Member States have access to mobile satellite services."
"Thanks to the efforts of this House, the criterion for pan-European coverage has the biggest weight."
"Other criteria will also include whether systems offered by operators provide services in the outermost and sparsely populated areas or other services of general public interest such as civil protection and disaster recovery."
"The resolution is a basis to create real opportunities for individual and corporate service users from countries such as mine, the Republic of Bulgaria, which are not located centrally within the territory of the EU, to have access to pan-European mobile satellite services, including access to broadband Internet, mobile multimedia applications, services related to civil protection in the case of natural and industrial disasters and, of course, this facilitates improvement in the competitiveness of countries lying in the periphery of the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, as the radio frequency spectrum is a public good, market forces alone cannot secure the world of communication for everyone."
"A dual approach of politics and consumer economy is needed."
"When apportioning the spectrum one must focus on its social, cultural and economic value, rather than just increasing the MSS providers' income or government revenue."
"Commissioner, I admit that at first I was disappointed with the criteria for selecting MSS providers, and particularly with the paltry 60% geographical cover of the Union, in view of the pan-European geographical cover and pan-European provision of mobile satellite services."
"In countries such as Greece that have many mountains and islands, it is difficult to invest in fibre optic networks everywhere, which is why MSS provision assumes great importance."
"With MSS, it is possible to provide complete cover throughout the Member States."
"This facilitates viable economic development, in line with the aims of the reformed Lisbon Strategy."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hall, and the shadow rapporteur from my group, Mrs Trautmann."
"Thanks to their contribution and effective cooperation with the Council, we have arrived at a distinctly improved motion for a resolution."
"(PL) Mr President, the objective of the European Commission's decision that Parliament is assessing is to put forward harmonised principles for access to mobile satellite services in all Member States."
"The need for Community solutions is obviously justified by the cross-border nature of satellite communications."
"We must not, however, forget the particular significance of this solution, which requires us to maintain due care during the subsequent procedure."
"We must take special care that the frequency bands in question constitute a perceptible supplement to land-based mobile communications networks, chiefly in areas threatened by the phenomenon known as the digital divide."
"We must not simply allow excessive fragmentation of use of this section of the spectrum, and, what is worse, squander the anticipated economic benefits."
"Mr President, quite simply thank you, thank you to Parliament and thank you to its rapporteur, Mrs Hall."
"I think that they have been worthy of the satellites sector, which is an economic sector, but above all they have been worthy of the European citizens who will benefit from mobile satellite services: telephone, Internet, television and also security services, especially in the event of a disaster."
"Here, therefore, we have a service that is going to be very important for our great Europe."
"The Commission, meanwhile, is going to do its best to publish a call for candidates as soon as possible, and as soon as possible means before the end of the summer."
"I therefore ask the Council to move quickly, very quickly, so that the Ministers can decide by June, so that, afterwards, we will be able to put everything in place so that the decisions that will be taken tomorrow by the European Parliament at what I must say is a breathtaking pace can be put into practice in the interests of our industry and our citizens."
"Thank you for this exemplary work!"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, it was very good indeed to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission has every intention of moving forward on this before the summer."
"That would be very welcome news, both to citizens and to the industry itself."
"Otherwise, I would simply like to thank everybody for their comments in this debate and to say once again that this would not have been possible if it had not been for the extremely good level of cooperation between everybody who has been involved in negotiating this decision."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Women and science (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Thomsen, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on women and science."
"Mr President, let me first of all express my gratitude to the European Parliament and especially to the rapporteur, Mrs Thomsen, for their support for the Commission policy on women and science."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mr Dover, for his constructive approach."
"We agree with Mrs Thomsen's explanatory statement that the elimination of gender discrimination in science heralds a new era of excellence for European research and academic growth, and a boost for innovation."
"The Commission is well aware that there is a serious imbalance between female and male researchers."
"The latest available statistics show that whereas women represent more than 50% of graduates in all university departments, only 15% of professors are women."
"In the field of science, engineering and technology, the corresponding figures are 34% female graduates and 9% female professors."
"The Commission agrees that this is a serious waste of talent and resources, as it is contrary to the principle of equality."
"Since 1999, the European Commission has been attending to the issue of the lack of women in research."
"In the Fifth Framework Programme, the Commission gave financial support to studies and projects in the field of women and science."
"Since 2003, the Commission has also been publishing the 'She Figures' statistics, which show the participation of women in European research."
"The next issue will be published in 2009."
"More to the point, in her report, Mrs Thomsen supports the target of at least 40% women and 40% men on the various committees under the Framework Programme."
"This non-binding target has been in place since 2000 and has brought very good results."
"For example, women's participation in committees evaluating research work has increased from 10% in the Fourth Framework Programme to 34% in the Sixth Framework Programme."
"This shows that when the issue is adequately highlighted, progress can be achieved even when there are no binding targets."
"Indeed, the existence of binding targets could, in the long term, prove counterproductive, as it signals discrimination against men, and most men and women do not agree with such targets."
"The report underlines the negative impact of an interruption in employment on women scientists' careers."
"In the context of the European Research Area, the European Commission shares these concerns and supports the adoption of policy measures facilitating greater coordination between professional and family life."
"Networking among women scientists may also contribute substantially towards attracting more women into science and key jobs."
"This is why we have created the European Platform of Women Scientists, which serves as a catalyst and creates role models in scientific research."
"One of our main targets is to increase the number of women in key research posts."
"This is directly linked with the target agreed by the Member States in 2005: 25% of senior posts in public research organisations should be occupied by women."
"A report on this issue was recently published under the title 'Mapping the maze: getting more women to the top in research'."
"It concludes that transparent and fair assessment is not in itself enough to increase the representation of women in decision-making mechanisms."
"We need a change in the prevailing perceptions."
"Specialists make proposals about how existing scientific mentality and culture can be broadened and made more open, but the challenge now is to put that into effect."
"These projects are continuing in the Seventh Framework Programme; they are now linked to the implementation of the European Research Area."
"The conference to be held in May 2009 under the auspices of the Czech Presidency of the EU will undertake a survey of the successes of the last 10 years and will also identify the areas in which further efforts are needed."
"The European Parliament's contribution here will be invaluable."
"In March 2006 the Commission adopted the Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010."
"This roadmap forms the framework for action by the Commission and is an expression of our commitment to promote gender equality in all our policies, both internally and externally."
"Our priorities are: reconciling private and professional life; promoting equal participation of women and men in political and economic decision-making bodies, as well as in science and technology; and eliminating gender stereotypes in the fields of education, training and culture, and also in the job market."
"Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to speak."
"I am glad that today we can put women and research high up on the agenda, as I believe that it is a pivotal issue for Europe with regard to fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Europe must create more jobs; we must create better jobs and we must become stronger in research and innovation."
"In each of these three tasks, women are an essential part of the solution."
"We must have more women in work, and we must have more women in managerial positions and decision-making bodies."
"If we in Europe are to create up to 700 000 research positions in the coming years, we must also become better at utilising our female talent base."
"At a general level, I had two objectives in drawing up this report."
"Firstly, I wanted to set out the status of the current situation."
"What is the proportion of women in research and why are things so bad?"
"Secondly, I wanted to look ahead and come up with solutions and suggestions as to how we can improve this situation."
"The situation is not satisfactory at the present time."
"Women comprise an average of just 35% of researchers working in the public sector and 18% of researchers working in the private sector."
"Furthermore, even though women make up more than 50% of EU students and achieve 43% of doctoral degrees, they hold only 15% of senior academic posts."
"We can therefore see a marked distortion in relation to the representation of women in decision-making and managerial positions."
"Our own recently created institutions such as the European Research Council are also failing to meet any equality criteria."
"Just 5 of the 22 members of this research council are women."
"I have also emphasised the fact that in most European countries there is a still a marked under-representation of women on scientific committees - yet another example of women's lack of representation in decision-making bodies."
"I would like to say a little more about the second, and perhaps more interesting, part of my report, namely the forward-looking solutions and proposals."
"I listened carefully to the input that was given during the consultation process held in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, and one of the clear points that arose was that it was first and foremost a matter of drawing up policies for the area."
"If this problem area is ignored at both national and institutional level, nothing will happen."
"In my report I therefore included a requirement for the Member States and the Commission to set a target of at least 40% women in all recruitment and evaluation panels."
"I believe that this is absolutely essential."
"If we are to change the situation, we must ensure that there are more women in decision-making bodies, so that efforts can be made from the top down to create a new culture. I have also called for more open recruitment procedures."
"Experience shows that closed recruitment procedures very much favour men, who point to each other as being the best qualified."
"I have also made it clear in my report that we must not shrink away from positive action if we are to harbour hopes of correcting the situation relatively quickly."
"After all, our own figures indicate that there are currently no naturally positive developments."
"I have therefore recommended that special funding be set aside to promote female researchers and to focus on the importance of networks and role models as simple initiatives, which have produced positive results in the Member States."
"Very simple initiatives such as a sentence stating that women in particular are encouraged to apply have also produced good results."
"My work on this report therefore shows that there are many barriers."
"It is of course important that there are good opportunities to combine life as a researcher with family life, with the opportunity to take maternity leave even if you are a PhD student, but it is also a matter of culture."
"Cultural barriers are of course more difficult to express in a formula, but in reality - like the more concrete barriers - it is a matter of focusing on some of the distortions."
"I will say no more here, but I look forward to hearing your comments on the report."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, it gives me the greatest of pleasure to welcome every word that the Commissioner spoke this evening and also to congratulate Mrs Thomsen, who has done a wonderful job as rapporteur on this most important subject."
"It is a delight for me on the centre-right of the Chamber to be applauding a Socialist from the other side and from another country than my own and to wish her well because she has balanced the whole approach; she has highlighted the most important factors relating to the fact that ladies come to their teenage years ahead of males."
"They are more intelligent; they are more hard-working; they can apply themselves and yet, even when they go into higher education, into the start of a research career, they sometimes fall away."
"This is often because of pressures at home, in their personal lives."
"Mrs Thomsen is right in her report and this evening to concentrate and focus on those problems."
"The report has constructive ideas."
"The only thing I hold back from is setting specific objectives for the percentage of women that should reach this grade or that grade or that position or another position."
"That is too prescriptive."
"But, on the other hand, this report has my total support."
"I was honoured to produce the opinion from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I thank those shadow rapporteurs on the main report and on my opinion for their full cooperation."
"This is an example of a piece of legislation and a report here in the European Parliament ensuring that we are seen at our best, in cooperation, focusing on the needs of the research industry."
"I close by saying that last Thursday evening I went with one of my colleagues, Lambert van Nistelrooij from Holland, to Oxford University."
"All of the scientists, the researchers, there were female."
"I greatly welcome that."
"Thank you very much, Mr Dover."
"I thank you particularly in view of the fact that, apart from Commissioner Dimas, you are the only man who has signed up for this debate tonight."
"I have only female speakers."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SK) Thank you very much, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"Allow me to congratulate Mrs Thomsen, on behalf of the shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group, Mrs Sartori, and on my own behalf as well."
"I want to say that the situation regarding women and science is comparable with the situation of women and politics, although in the field of science women are slightly better represented."
"This is in spite of the fact that women make up approximately 60% of university graduates."
"A scientific career is more than a nine-to-five job."
"There is also a strong competitive angle: women often must perform higher than men in order to become successful."
"An older female colleague alerted me to this fact at the start of my scientific career many years ago."
"Is the question why women are so under-represented in science, why after a period of time there is a decrease in the number of young female scientists and therefore why we consequently lose gifted scientists, the correct question?"
"Creating conditions for combining working and family life is of vital interest for female scientists."
"In this respect, achieving the Barcelona goals is especially important."
"If women are supposed to be successful scientists, the facilities available to them should be reliable, accessible, first-rate, appropriate to the character and requirements of the scientific work, and sufficiently flexible."
"However, we also have to consider the question of general support for science and development."
"If the salary fluctuates between low and lowest, no one can expect such professions to be attractive for young women or even for young men starting families."
"This is a real problem in some countries, namely the new Member States, where support for science and research does not account for even 1% of GDP."
"Let me finish by saying that the situation should be solved by changing the conditions rather than by setting quotas."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, women's participation in higher education has increased dramatically over recent years."
"This has not, however, resulted in an improvement in the ratio of women to men in the sciences."
"The number of women in engineering has also risen in the past twenty years, but not by nearly as much as in other occupations and scientific disciplines."
"As a result of the difficulties, a large proportion of women scientists abandon a career in science, and this is unacceptable and irrational. It is more difficult for women to get ahead in their profession."
"This is particularly apparent with regard to wages."
"Women are less well represented in scientific institutions."
"Female researchers are forced to choose between career and family."
"The temporary breaks in women's careers in science due to family reasons make promotion of women difficult."
"We must look at methods aimed at establishing a balance between working life and private life and apply best practice."
"The Lisbon Strategy also requires us to apply the principles of gender equality in the field of research and development."
"We must take more effective action in all areas of science, making recruitment procedures and promotion requirements more transparent."
"We must strive to ensure gender equality in university and non-university research and in the governing bodies of these institutions."
"The report is excellent, and I recommend its adoption."
"I also congratulate my colleague Britta Thomsen who, as a researcher, has studied this subject in considerable depth."
"Thank you for doing this."
"on behalf of ALDE. - (ET) Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, life in today's world is increasingly bound up with science and technology through both new or improved products and services and technological development."
"Europe's women scientists undoubtedly contribute to this process."
"It has already been stated here that there are more women undergraduate students in universities than men; this is also true of Master's and Doctoral degree students - there are more women."
"However, there are seven times fewer women than men working at a senior level in scientific and educational establishments: the average is 15%."
"Why is this?"
"The scientific world throughout the ages has always been comprised predominantly of men."
"This has been justified with the argument that genuine knowledge is attained using precisely the objective methods and logical discussion which come less naturally to women than to men."
"The fact that the scientific body is comprised even today predominantly of men is in itself more down to the assimilation of masculinity into scientific thought than to the above justification."
"Academic science has shown that the notion that objectivity can be equated with masculinity is a myth."
"The reality today, however, is that that myth unquestionably influences the distribution of employment and the decision-making process associated with the funding of scientific research."
"This belittling attitude also gains strength through the media, where women are portrayed in a one-dimensional, tendentious way."
"Often women are portrayed in the media in any old position, chiefly as members of women's groups, and not as professionals in their fields."
"At the same time we have done little to change the situation and increase women's opportunities for better employment."
"To change this view, which is widespread in society, we must start to advocate science to both sexes as an interesting and attractive area from the earliest stages."
"The pictures in children's books depicting women in aprons and men in spacecraft must disappear."
"I support the positive measures proposed in the report to encourage and support women scientists, whether in the form of careers advice aimed at women scientists or special programmes to support girls' and women's interest in science-based careers."
"I cannot, however, support mechanistic quotas based on gender as they tie us to a specific time-period and may result in quantity instead of quality."
"I thank the rapporteur for a concise piece of work and apologise."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, gender equality is a value and objective of the European Union."
"However, although much has been written about it, discrimination occurs on a daily basis."
"Sadly, perceived equality also exists in science."
"We know that more girls than boys leave secondary school with higher education entrance qualifications, and more young women than young men have a tertiary qualification."
"Women are therefore very well educated, but they hit the glass ceiling upon graduating from university."
"The figures are sobering: only 15% of all professors are female."
"Only 15% of the top positions are occupied by women, even though the majority of university graduates and half of all those completing a doctorate are women."
"Wage discrimination also occurs in science: the committees that make decisions about research projects comprise fewer than 20% women."
"One could almost hypothesize that the greater the amount of money spent on a research project, the less likely it is that women will be involved."
"What we need, then, if we are to do more than simply pay lip service to equality, are quotas - but they must be ambitious quotas, so that they really achieve something."
"Gender equality must apply in all areas of science, and this equality should apply to at least 40% of the underrepresented sex, i.e. women, and not merely to 25%."
"Therefore, for change to happen, we must set ourselves precisely this ambitious goal."
"To close, let me to mention another matter close to my heart: we know that by 2010, the European Union will be short of 700 000 researchers."
"We must therefore make every effort to prevent the European Union becoming a scientific wasteland."
"Yet highly gifted girls are being overlooked very early on."
"Encouraging highly talented young women is a matter that is very close to my heart and I would ask the rapporteur to place more emphasis on this."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, in my country, Poland, the average level of education among women is higher than the average level of education among men."
"As a physicist by profession, employed at Warsaw University, I did not experience any discrimination on gender grounds."
"I would have felt demeaned if my professional status had been decided not by my knowledge and intellectual capacity, but by some secondary feature, such as gender."
"Through her work and her passion for discovery, Marie Skłodowska-Curie obtained results for which she was twice awarded a Nobel Prize."
"The rector of my university, ranked number one in Poland, is also a woman, a professor of physics."
"The reality that governs the situation of women in the world of science is not the same everywhere, though."
"Problems are evident when you learn that women make up only 35% of scientific workers employed in the State sector and higher education in the European Union, and only 18% in the private sector."
"Sometimes this is a result of family duties being placed above the call of science, but not always."
"The findings of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this report are important, in my view."
"It is in fact during the first period of education that it is easiest to show that while science may be hard, it is always involving, and it is therefore worth making an effort to discover what we consider to be interesting, and what we cannot reach other than through scientific study."
"It is worth encouraging anyone who is up to it to take up scientific work; many women have such capabilities, and it would be a shame to miss out on this potential."
"The examples referred to in paragraph 3 are of some validity here, indicating as they do that this effort brings results."
"Under the Lisbon Strategy, but independently of it, it is immeasurably important to invest in people and in their education."
"This increases a person's opportunities in the labour market."
"This is also true of the very specific labour market that is the sphere of science."
"It is therefore important in all traineeships, exchanges between educational institutions and other such opportunities for improving one's occupational standing that access criteria should not be discriminatory."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) My thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Thomsen, for highlighting the problem of inequality in science and research."
"Inequality pervades society."
"Through commitment and opinion-forming by women's organisations among others, however, awareness of inequality in many sectors has increased and many have realised its negative consequences for society as a whole."
"But precisely in the scientific community it has long been hidden."
"Hence this report is of special importance."
"While the EU emphasises the role of research in economic development, research continues in many cases to be reserved for only one gender."
"In the public sector 35% of researchers are women, in the private sector just 18%."
"The Scientific Council of the European Research Council has 22 members, of whom five are women."
"This report focuses attention on the problem but, in my opinion, it is not enough."
"We must raise the level of ambition still further."
"I have a comment to make in the discussion on equality: we must continue to defend the demand for equality by saying that it is needed for economic growth and development."
"When shall we be able to say that equality is an objective in its own right which does not need to be defended in economic terms?"
"Equal rights are human rights!"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the role played by women in science appears to differ among the individual EU Member States."
"In the very difficult times under Communism, women in Poland had access to science and political rights significantly earlier than in many countries of the old EU."
"Previously, the problem was - and it still is today - more one of a poor economic situation and opaque criteria for allocating resources to scientific research, usually regardless of gender."
"Despite these obstacles, there are many women who, as wives and mothers, fulfil important social functions, working as ministers, directors, deans and professors at higher education institutions or as doctors, without feeling that they are being discriminated against by men."
"Contrary to what strident feminists say, in my country women are generally respected; they do not have complexes but rather an awareness of their own value and strength, in the knowledge that, in cooperating with men, they are playing an important role in all areas of life, while, however, placing the highest value on defending life, protecting marriage and the family and other supreme values."
"The percentage of women students is constantly on the rise, and by the 1990s it was already 51%."
"According to reports, women make up 38% of scientific workers in EU countries in Central and Eastern Europe, although a large number of them are employed in fields in which expenditure on scientific research is low."
"It therefore seems right to suggest that more funds be made available, accompanied by encouragement to take up scientific work, alongside the further strengthening of the position of women, especially through legal regulations enabling family and professional life to be reconciled, including financial and social recognition for domestic work with the aim of offering a genuinely free choice, but without parities or any change in the definition of excellence."
"The percentage differentiation in management positions may be linked to the significant mental and physical effort being too much of a burden, so the representation of women should be put into practice by recognising and utilising knowledge and individual predispositions along with improving legal and economic conditions and aid infrastructure, which make it easier to reconcile family life with one's occupation."
"(SK) In order to meet the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, the priority for the European Union must be to create a wide base of scientists capable of implementing quality research at the highest international level."
"Women's participation in science does not correspond to the needs of research, even though women achieve higher education than men, and even though there are more women in higher education than men."
"It is thus necessary to concentrate on educating and supporting top female scientists and to motivate talented women to take up a scientific career by creating good opportunities for quality scientific work, by providing an adequate career and salary."
"Obstacles preventing women from participating in scientific work still exist today."
"Psychology and at times insufficient solidarity among women also play a role."
"The fact is that female researchers find it more difficult to reconcile working and family life than men."
"The breaks women take in scientific careers for family reasons have a negative impact on their career prospects."
"Since scientific work is non-stop, it would be to women's advantage to work from home as well, unless their presence at the workplace is inevitable."
"The majority of those who experience mobility problems are women because it is generally a woman's task to look after children, older people or other family dependents."
"Women would welcome child-care facilities at scientific institutions."
"I think that quotas will not solve the problem of the lack of women scientists if women themselves do not wish to change this status quo."
"They must have suitable conditions, be more confident and show solidarity with one another."
"I trust that the Seventh Framework Programme and scientific research programmes will support projects that encourage women to take up scientific careers."
"It is important for the project selection systems to be transparent, which is why women should have equal representation on assessment boards and selection committees."
"(PL) Even though women make up more than 50% of EU students and achieve 43% of EU doctoral degrees, they hold, on average, only 15% of senior academic posts and are in a minority among researchers."
"In the government and higher education sector they comprise an average of 35% of researchers, and in the private sector just 18%."
"Analyses have shown that existing recruitment systems are not gender neutral."
"The existence of a 'glass ceiling' for women trying to progress to senior positions is well documented and affects all areas of the economy, especially those related to science and technology."
"The Commission and Member States should introduce transparent recruitment procedures as soon as possible to ensure a gender balance in recruitment bodies."
"Since research represents a crucial sector for the economic development of the European Union, and Europe needs to recruit 700 000 additional researchers as part of the fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and development, it is very important to programme science as an area that is open to both genders and to ensure that women are properly represented among scientists."
"In order to achieve this aim, it is essential to provide appropriate working conditions that will suit a female scientist along with an infrastructure that enables a smooth interface between professional and family life."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thomsen, on an excellently drafted document."
"(LT) Regretfully, despite the legal acts adopted by the EU and all the declarations and discussions we have had, the gender mainstreaming dimension in the sphere of scientific research, among others, remains unsatisfactory."
"Although there are a large number of female students in the universities of the EU, only 18% of researchers working in the private sector and only 15% of researchers in senior academic positions are women."
"In the government and higher education sectors women account for just 35%."
"Moreover, women working in scientific research are paid much less than their male colleagues and their work usually consists more of teaching than of research, which seldom allows them to achieve recognition."
"I urge the Commission and the Member States to increase their efforts to support women aiming to forge a career as scientists."
"In considering how to support them, we cannot overlook the family dimension, the flexibility of working hours and the improvement of child care institutions and family flexibility."
"Mr President, coming from a science background myself, I welcome this important discussion on women in the field of science and technology."
"In principle I agree with Mrs Thomsen's report, which seeks to identify the barriers that account for the under-representation of women in science and I agree that most education systems in Europe continue to sustain gender stereotypes."
"Her report notes other factors that contribute to the under-representation of women in this field and regrettably in many other professional fields as well."
"These factors include the negative impact of career breaks for family reasons and restrictions on mobility due to family responsibilities."
"I applaud its call on the Commission and, more particularly, Member States to take positive action on a number of fronts - education, childcare, social security, parental leave - as well as making available adequate funding in order to improve the prospects for women seeking to further careers in or to re-enter science after rearing a family."
"We need competent women at all levels of society - and indeed we need women with scientific backgrounds in politics also - but I believe we will never achieve this by setting quotas on gender participation."
"Instead, we should aim for more transparency on recruitment, for mentoring schemes, strengthening the networking among women scientists, the promotion of female researchers as role models and of course the adequate availability of funding to encourage women in science, while maintaining fairness and equality."
"I believe that most women scientists would agree with this."
"In 2003 in my own country, Ireland, a Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) Committee was set up to make recommendations on strategies to increase the uptake among women and girls of science subjects and higher level-mathematics at second level and to increase the number of females choosing science engineering and technology courses at third level."
"This committee is chaired by Professor Jane Grimson of Trinity College, Dublin, an eminent academic in her own right."
"We also have an organisation known as WITS - Women in Technology and Science, which was inaugurated in 1999."
"We have the Wiser Workforce Project, which is a return-to-work initiative for women scientists."
"We have Science Foundation Ireland, which has launched four programmes to address under-representation of women in Irish science and engineering."
"Finally, these schemes aim to encourage and support the development of sustainable mechanisms and practices which will ensure that women researchers have an equal opportunity to compete on the basis of their scientific expertise, knowledge and potential."
"(BG) President, Commissioner, the report on Women in Science is very well scoped, and it deals with the participation of women in one of the most important development processes, scientific research."
"Its importance is determined by the fact that it outlines the structure of scientific development and provides solutions in a key aspect, the make-up of human resources in science."
"Women play an important role in universities, research institutes and the private sector."
"The unsatisfactory level of women's involvement in management and decision-making in science, the low percentage of women holding PhDs, or who are professors or members of academies has to do with public stereotypes and difficulties on the path of women in their pursuit of careers in science."
"What we need is to apply flexible working hours, to develop provision of services which support women and provide opportunities for choice and self-fulfilment."
"An enhanced role for women in science should not be considered as just another gender policy."
"It is a mission that makes better use of the high potential of women without falling into the other extreme."
"Because of their devotion to science, women should not give up their natural purpose of creating a family and being mothers."
"For young women in science, the principle of double priority should apply: both family and career."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I think that our goal is the same, we want to achieve parity, but we are not unanimous about how to achieve it."
"Commissioner, your statistics are well put together, they prove that the road is long and laborious and that you have done the right thing by introducing quotas for nominations in committees, because, without a proactive policy, we will not find women, because in order to find them we first need to have the will to find them."
"So the higher up the ladder we climb, the more reticence there is about appointing women, and what is entirely ill adapted and illogical is that in the education sector women are largely in the majority, but in academic environments they are absent."
"So why is this the case?"
"I think that an analysis needs to be done."
"We need to invite the Member States, and perhaps the Commissioner could put some pressure on the Member States to establish a degree of benchmarking to clarify the situation in their universities."
"Often selection processes for professors do not have the same criteria."
"Women are always asked the question: 'What childcare arrangements will you make?'"
"Men are never asked this question and therefore in this debate we are all talking about out childcare responsibilities."
"Would this also be the case if we were talking about men?"
"Why is it that we do not turn the problem around, and, moreover, it is not a problem."
"Having a family is a great joy, it is a treasure, for men too; why should we not change our views?"
"I think that the appointment of professors should be reviewed, along with the process and the questions that are asked and, in order to make progress in the fields of new technologies, the Commission should take targeted action."
"Regarding the excellence criteria, I do not think that we can make any allowances."
"(RO) Dear colleagues, I will present three issues very briefly."
"In former socialist countries, the situation seems even more dramatic since the previous gender policy led to the development of a significant segment of women who were active in the field of science."
"On the contrary, transition has generated the brutal decline in funds allocated to research and the decrease in the number of researchers."
"Today, yesterday's women researchers sell insurance policies, are civil servants or have left their countries of origin, with multiple negative consequences: waste of human resources, high dissatisfaction and obstacles to development."
"The second issue is that, today, the activities of mass communication, public relations, and advertising companies play an important role, including economic, in the gross domestic product."
"They rely on the research in human and social sciences where many women work."
"Nevertheless, a traditional hierarchy of sciences does not provide them with sufficient social recognition and works as indirect discrimination against the women researchers in these fields."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Thomsen's report has touched on a sensitive aspect of my own experience."
"I received my doctorate from the Sorbonne when I was already the mother of three children and my husband had four."
"I had to cut myself off from the world of further research."
"The pursuit of academic excellence gets into your blood and you feel wretched when forced to abandon it."
"Now I must admit that much later, after I had had more children, a German university offering a programme specifically for mothers gave me the opportunity to continue my research, which I have been continuing voluntarily until now."
"Therefore, possibilities do exist, and for this reason the family aspect should be included in the planning of research programmes and research posts, so that human resources are made full use of."
"I think that binding targets will thus no longer be required and the perception of women's contribution to research will change."
"For this reason, planning is necessary so that women can be accepted according to the particular stage of their professional life."
"Because of the few years in which a woman has no choice but to be excluded, she is deprived of the joys of academe for the rest of her life and society loses out on what she has to offer."
"Women researchers should therefore be given the opportunity to take part in programmes."
"At a later stage, the participation of women in research programmes should be a criterion for assessing the quality of universities."
"May I also remind you of the report that we presented last year, in which we said that it ought to be possible to combine professional and family life from undergraduate level onwards."
"(PL) Mr President, I congratulate my fellow Member on a very good report."
"An increased involvement in scientific research is essential if the principles of the Lisbon Strategy are to be achieved."
"As the rapporteur emphasises, Europe needs an extra 700 000 researchers if the Strategy's principles are to be put into effect."
"I believe that the involvement and potential of women themselves will mean that they make up a high percentage of this group."
"I am, however, concerned at the proposal to ensure a gender balance in evaluation and recruitment committees."
"As a woman politician, I would not like my activities to be assessed solely through the prism of my gender."
"I would prefer the quality and results of my work to determine how I work."
"There is an interesting proposal to increase interest among young people in taking up further education in specific and technical fields."
"This should be accompanied by action to promote science as an area that is of interest for work and professional development among both women and men."
"I feel that proposals enabling a professional career to be combined with family life are worth considering."
"They should be viewed in a broader context - in a context where women's participation in the labour market is supported and encouraged."
"(SK) As my colleague just said, Europe needs more than 700 000 researchers today."
"I consider this alarming."
"Women could close this gap."
"Current statistics show that although women achieve higher education than men, they comprise only one third of researchers working in the government sector and only 18% of researchers working in the private sector."
"I believe that first of all we have to do away with gender stereotypes that influence not only the choice young women make regarding their field of study but also the job allocation process, research funding and hiring criteria."
"Although I agree with the need to ensure that women participate in the EU and national programmes, I do not think it should be done through quotas."
"I support the idea of providing innovative forms of flexible working time for women that will allow them to continue research work after becoming mothers."
"This can significantly contribute to greater participation by women in top scientific posts."
"Mr President, as one of a very small number of men attending this important debate, and as a scientist myself, I feel the need to say this:"
"In my long experience as a medical practitioner I found that women scientists were just as good as, if not better than, men."
"The only problem for women in achieving top positions has, in my view, been the very hard choice they have had to make in deciding whether to be a full-time mother and a part-time scientist or the reverse."
"Women have always made the choice to be full-time mothers."
"I therefore feel that this report is very important."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, but we need practical ways of helping mothers achieve top positions and not just theoretical ideas."
"Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to speak."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your comments."
"I am pleased to hear that you share my concerns and visions for the future of European research."
"With regard to the aforementioned quotas, I believe that I have been a little misunderstood."
"I am not talking about quotas for researchers, but it is very clear that one of the most important barriers to employing and utilising the female talent base lies in the composition of recruitment committees."
"This is because they are not gender-neutral, and I therefore believe that we must do something about that."
"We cannot continue to ignore this problem and hope that tomorrow will be brighter and that it will happen all by itself."
"We must demand political action now."
"The Commission has of course been the progressive player in this matter, as a unit for women and research was created several years ago in the Directorate-General for Research."
"It is the Member States that are lagging behind."
"It is their commitment that will be essential in relation to securing change within the university and research institutions."
"I would like to thank my fellow Members, the Secretariat and the Commission for their cooperation."
"I was very pleased with the cooperation of researchers and the European Platform of Women Scientists in particular - special thanks must go to them."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) As a teacher of mathematics, I have dealt with the phenomenon of young women's ever decreasing access to science directly."
"Taking into account the statistics that show that ever fewer young women chose science faculties, where mathematics, physics, biology or chemistry are intensively taught, I consider the draft report of the European Parliament on women and science to be opportune."
"The experience I have in the educational field makes me say that the ever decreasing involvement of women in science is a matter of mentality and under no circumstance of capacity."
"For this reason, I consider it important for the European Union to initiate more programmes that promote equality of chances and change of mentality regarding young women's access to science."
"Organizing experience exchange programmes and competitions at European level, even from an early age, can give confidence and courage to young people, encouraging them to go to science schools."
"We need as many European programmes as possible to contribute to the equality of chances by stimulating creativity, logical thinking, intuition and ideas exchange at a European level."
"Banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury (debate)"
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups."
"Without their assistance and contribution, I could not have achieved a satisfactory compromise with the Council."
"If approved exactly as agreed with the Council and without amendments invalidating it, the compromise text may represent a significant step towards implementing the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury."
"The text will put an end to the export not only of metallic mercury, but also of certain important mercury compounds that are produced in large quantities in the EU."
"The EU is a major exporter of mercury; every year it supplies about 1 000 tonnes of the current world total of 3 600 tonnes."
"The proposed Regulation under discussion deals mainly with 12 000 tonnes of mercury which will become surplus in the coming years, and it will pave the way for further measures to be taken at international level."
"Let us not forget that mercury is a worldwide pollutant which knows no bounds."
"Dealing with it is a matter of priority and international concern."
"The Regulation will contribute significantly towards strengthening the EU's leadership role in the talks being held under the auspices of the UN Environment Programme, and also towards the adoption of an international treaty on mercury."
"The most important provisions of the compromise text are as follows:"
"It broadens the scope of the ban on exports covering not only metallic mercury but also cinnabar ore, mercuric chloride, mercuric oxide and mixtures with a mercury content exceeding 95% by weight."
"An express prohibition has been imposed against mixing metallic mercury with other substances for export."
"The ban on exports of mercury and certain mercury compounds has been brought forward."
"An obligation has been placed on companies operating in the chlor-alkali and gas cleaning industries to notify the Commission and publish information on the quantities of mercury in storage or being dispatched for disposal."
"A review clause has been included requiring the Commission to re-examine the situation and submit a report on the matter to the European Parliament and the Council no later than 15 March 2013."
"The clause contains proposals for additional measures."
"It has been agreed that arrangements should be made for an exchange of information by 1 January 2010, with an export ban being considered for any products containing mercury."
"Lastly, according to the agreed text, mercury no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry or produced in other industrial enterprises will be regarded as waste and put into safe storage."
"We have also succeeded in introducing conditions for the acceptance of metallic mercury prior to its final disposal on the basis of research into its solidification."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let me say in conclusion that I think the compromise text we have achieved with the Council is an important one if it is approved without amendments, which would send us back to square one and considerably delay measures to protect the environment and public health."
"I believe that with tomorrow's vote we will be taking a step forward, which will ensure a satisfactory level of protection for public health and the environment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks and congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, on his excellent contribution to the Regulation on the banning of exports of metallic mercury, and also to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for their positive and constructive input."
"This Regulation implements two of the procedures mentioned by the Commission in its communication of 2005 to the Council and the European Parliament on the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury."
"The adoption of this Regulation will be a milestone in the implementation of the strategy, since it will prohibit exports from the Community of metallic mercury, -which account for at least 25% of global supply."
"The main aim of the proposed Regulation is to limit the global supply of mercury by banning exports of metallic mercury from the EU and putting it into safe storage."
"The Regulation is concerned mainly with 12 000 tonnes of mercury that will become surplus in the coming years because mercury cell technology in the chlor-alkali industry will be progressively phased out."
"The Regulation will prevent the export of surplus mercury to third countries and its use in gold digging and similar unlawful activities, which contribute significantly to the accumulation of mercury in the environment."
"Parliament's efforts to further increase the scope and improve the text of this legislative initiative have been fruitful."
"They have ensured that the Regulation in its agreed form will become an effective means of protecting public health and the environment."
"I should like to thank the institutions and all those who took part in the process with a view to achieving agreement at second reading."
"In particular, I should like to emphasise the constructive role of the European Parliament in shaping this satisfactory agreement."
"On some important points, Parliament has insisted on going beyond the scope of the Commission's initial proposal."
"In particular, let me underline three points that were at the centre of the negotiations:"
"· The scope of the export ban."
"· The date of its entry into force."
"· The safe and economically advantageous final disposal of metallic mercury."
"The Commission understands Parliament's aim to secure optimistic targets for these fundamental points and is in a position to accept the proposed changes."
"The Commission will, of course, keep a close eye on the correct enforcement and observance of all the Regulation's provisions, and will also re-examine the need to take further measures."
"This proposal contributes significantly to the aim of reducing exposure to mercury."
"It paves the way for taking further measures at international and global level."
"International negotiations are in any case in progress under the auspices of the UN Environment Programme."
"Adopting this Regulation will send out a strong message regarding the EU's commitment to addressing the problem."
"In addition to Amendments 42-63, which have already been agreed, five new amendments have been tabled on the use of the Almadén district in Spain as a priority area for the safe storage of metallic mercury."
"The Commission understands the likely economic impact on the region if the mercury mine is closed."
"A research programme coordinated by the company MAYASA, which owns the area, is receiving more than EUR 2 million in funding from the LIFE Fund."
"This programme is examining safe disposal methods for metallic mercury."
"Its findings will be useful for setting acceptance conditions for the final disposal of mercury, as provided for in Amendment 56 to the proposed regulation."
"The Almadén district could obviously be considered for the safe storage of mercury, provided it meets the conditions to be imposed, and provided it has the necessary permits."
"However, the Commission cannot justify the proposed priority in Amendments 37-41 of only one region, and therefore cannot accept those amendments."
"To sum up, the European Commission can accept the compromise package as agreed in the tripartite discussions, namely Amendments 42-63."
"It is satisfied with the agreement on the regulation at second reading."
"However, Amendments 37-41 have not been agreed and cannot be accepted."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, can I first of all offer my thanks to Mr Papadimoulis for guiding this report through Parliament."
"I fully understand that this must have been a very difficult and time-consuming process."
"However, I must express my dissatisfaction at the final stage of this process, namely the informal meetings that were held with the Council with a view to reaching the second-reading agreement."
"They were conducted by Mr Papadimoulis alone without the other shadow rapporteurs being invited."
"I think that is a regrettable situation."
"My group has been generally supportive of the common position originally adopted by the Council, as I am well aware of the need to try and agree a speedy implementation of this regulation."
"My group agrees with the major points that were a matter of concern for some Member States, particularly the need to retain the possibility of safe permanent storage and the need to adhere approximately to the agreed date of implementation."
"Most of those issues were addressed and resolved."
"However, two specific issues were not."
"First of all there is the position of Almadén that the Commissioner referred to."
"We do not think that the compromise amendments go far enough: we think there should be specific references to the problems caused in Almadén, one of the primary mercury-mining areas in the Community, and we think they should be addressed."
"They were addressed by Parliament at both stages and we think they should be in the common position."
"The other issue about which I am disappointed is the specific inclusion of a reference in the compromise package to a possible ban on the export of barometers."
"This was not present in the common position and was not supported by my group."
"I am disappointed that the Council conceded that point to Mr Papadimoulis during the negotiations."
"Therefore I have retabled an amendment to delete it from the final package."
"Finally I would like to thank the Commission and Mr Papadimoulis and particularly the Slovenian Presidency who I know have worked hard on this."
"It is not their fault that our parliamentary procedures, in my view, need serious reform on these matters."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Socialists are going to vote in solidarity and coherence with the district of Almadén, Spain, which is going to be seriously affected by the text that we are discussing and that we are to vote on tomorrow."
"The district of Almadén and its people, my compatriots, have lived for centuries from the mercury that was extracted from their mines, which are the largest for this metal in Europe and the world."
"Over recent years they have suffered a considerable economic and social recession, as for various reasons, mercury mining has been gradually limited."
"We are now deciding to ban its export."
"Not only have we not opposed this whole process, but, as we understand the health reasons behind it, we have focused our efforts on the one hand on raising the awareness of the population regarding the need to take on board the new situation and, on the other hand, on developing mechanisms to enable Almadén and its surrounding area to move forward by restructuring its activities based on the experience and working capacities of its people and taking advantage of an exceptional natural environment."
"In Almadén we have been talking about the European Union as a context of solidarity."
"We have explained to the people that the Community institutions would continue to look after them, that they would receive help to continue with the efforts that they are leading with the help of the Spanish Government, the Regional Government of Castile-La Mancha and Ciudad Real Provincial Council; and this commitment has been confirmed by all the pronouncements made by Parliament."
"Firstly, it has always been recommended that resources and mechanisms should be made available by the European Union and its Commission to support Almadén in restructuring its activity, so that the people will not suffer as a result of the closure of their traditional mining industry."
"Secondly, it has been recommended that, when considering a location for the mercury storage provided for in the Directive for all the metal that has or will appear in Europe, Almadén should be considered as a priority."
"The logic was based on both the experience that has been accumulated here in handling mercury and on the fundamental fact that the majority of the mercury in Europe is already entirely safely stored in Almadén."
"This is something that was decided at the time and will not in any way be altered by what we adopt tomorrow, but rather, without naming Almadén, the consensus amendment that the parliamentary groups reached, which also appears to have the support of the Council and the Commission, means that the previous commitments remain fully in force."
"Although we would have preferred it to have been cited more expressly, and we will therefore vote for the amendments that do so, we understand that the text that will be adopted is sufficiently committed and will continue to support the interpretation of that text which will enable the district of Almadén to consolidate the socio-economic recovery that is already underway."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, I want to thank Mr Papadimoulis for facilitating good cooperation."
"I also think that cooperation with the Council went well, although we had disagreements over content."
"We must first note that mercury is a toxic and dangerous heavy metal."
"To begin with, some criticism. I think that it odd that, while we ban the export of hazardous waste and ourselves practically cease to use mercury at all, we seek to delay an export ban so that industry has time to run down its stocks before it is defined as waste."
"It is a hazardous chemical which we know will be dispersed in nature by gold washers and which will destroy the environment in other countries."
"I actually wanted a much earlier date for the ban to take effect."
"But a compromise is a compromise."
"I can instead be glad that the voluntary measures of the industry are now included in the legislation, so that they will actually be implemented, and that all the necessary adjuncts will be covered by the export ban, for example cinnabar, oxides and calomel."
"In that way we have at least got a comprehensive piece of legislation."
"As regards how we are to deal with the waste, we are talking about quite small quantities."
"Imagine 10 000 tonnes of liquid mercury."
"It would not take up much room, in fact it would fit in the space here in front of the podium - it corresponds to a volume of 10 cubic metres."
"No more than that."
"Yet it is a huge amount of mercury."
"Many molecules, in fact."
"We must not release a single one of them into the environment."
"The only way of actually implementing the EU's waste legislation is not to dump mercury for permanent disposal in liquid form."
"For my Group, therefore, Article 7 was crucial to a resolution of the matter, in other words the article in which we are to return to the question of waste solidification."
"We cannot achieve any permanent disposal without looking again at that method."
"I was gratified today to receive an e-mail from a Swedish waste organisation (det svenska avfallsbolaget) which says that a pilot plant is now being constructed that can already handle 500 kg of waste and convert it to insoluble, solid form."
"When we return to the matter in 2010, I can guarantee that disposal in solid form will be a safe method which complies with the EU legislation."
"- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Schlyter has just said, 10 thousand tonnes is a very large amount."
"Just to give you an idea of the scale, it is enough to poison approximately 4 million people a day."
"About a year ago, we discussed the dossier at first reading."
"Sufficient regulation of metallic mercury compounds and mercury has been arranged."
"It has been ensured that this material does not return to the European Union."
"Safe storage has also been sufficiently evaluated."
"The actual restrictions make sense given mercury's increasing toxicity, although I would have liked to see more far-reaching restrictions in many areas."
"The compromise works very well, and at this point I would like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his work."
"It does not meet all expectations, but it does meet a great many of them."
"As a former local and regional politician, I also have a great deal of sympathy for our Spanish Members, who have to find a solution to the Almadén problem that will be workable for everyone."
"The compromise is so worthwhile, however, that we must not allow it to miscarry because of this issue."
"There ought to be enough time before tomorrow's vote for the Commission to make an appropriate statement of some kind."
"It is important to accept the compromise now, because otherwise, there is a risk that we will not reach agreement in this parliamentary term."
"I would like to mention one further matter: the mercury strategy is not yet complete."
"The Commission's two panels of experts continue to rate amalgam as safe."
"I cannot agree with this opinion."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has brought back some amendments that refer to Almadén, the largest and oldest mine in the world, that were adopted by a large majority at first reading."
"The Almadén mine has been closed since 2003."
"However, Almadén is the main exporter of mercury in the European Union and still continues to have considerable economic activity associated with mercury, because it sells it through the contracts signed by the company Mayasa with other companies in the chlor-alkali sector."
"These contracts are valid until May 2011."
"Almadén should be expressly cited in the Regulation, because it is the only area in the European Union that is directly and negatively affected by the ban on exports, and because it has the best technicians and experts in handling mercury."
"The mine also has the capacity to store all of the liquid mercury in the European Union, at a depth of 200 metres, in an enclave of quartzite rock and volcanic rock with a high degree of impermeability, as verified by the Director for Sustainable Development and Integration of the European Commission's Environment DG, Mr Mäkelä, and the Slovenian Environment Minister, who visited the area in March 2007."
"(SK) Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"The report by my fellow Member Mr Papadimoulis mentions dental amalgam as one of the sources of mercury supplies in Europe."
"Allow me to quote some interesting figures."
"Stomatologists in the European Union use 125 tonnes of mercury each year."
"They carry out more than 200 million mercury fillings each year."
"Our citizens walk around with more than 1 100 tonnes of mercury in their mouths."
"Amalgam waste containing 50% mercury is generated during the processing of dental amalgam and its application, in the process of removing original fillings, during cremation of the deceased."
"Extracted teeth and the possible leakage into groundwater after ground burials are also sources of mercury."
"Dental mercury also infiltrates the atmosphere during communal waste incineration."
"Taking all the above into account, dental practices rank only second or third in the production of mercury waste in the European Union."
"I am glad that the report reflects these facts as well."
"(PL) The position of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and at the same time the Spanish viewpoint, was presented by my colleague Mr Martínez Martínez."
"I would therefore like to speak not so much about mercury, as about the specific example of a region whose fundamental activity is undergoing massive change."
"As a representative of a new country that went through a period of transformation in the early 1990s, I know this pain experienced by regions."
"It is therefore with the greatest satisfaction that I wish to emphasise that the European Union, and Parliament too, do not wish to abandon Almadén to its fate."
"Whether EUR 2 million will suffice is another story."
"The most important thing, though, is that this is how we are approaching this matter, and that is very valuable."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all concerned for their contribution."
"I do not understand why the rapporteur has put at risk a second-reading agreement and the adoption of the regulation in advance of the UNEP discussions in October 2008, where hopefully we will get a legally binding agreement on this most important area."
"He has put it at risk because of his lack of collaboration during the trialogue and during discussions."
"Maybe the Commissioner understands why the benefit of discussions at this stage was not extended to all the shadow rapporteurs or at least the key shadow rapporteurs who showed interest."
"I have serious reservations procedurally on what has happened, which has polarised a very important debate and report which otherwise could have been easily concluded with the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, according to the agreed text, mercury no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry or produced in other industrial enterprises will be regarded as waste and will be put into safe storage as soon as the ban on exports comes into effect on 15 March 2011."
"By 1 January 2010 at the latest, the Commission will organise an exchange of information between Member States and other interested parties with a view to considering the advisability of taking additional measures."
"By 1 January 2010 at the latest, on the basis of the available scientific data and current research on safe options for mercury disposal, the Commission will recommend the appropriate requirements governing the facilities and conditions for accepting metallic mercury."
"The Member States will monitor enforcement of the Regulation and its impact on the market, and will notify the Commission accordingly."
"If it is considered advisable, the Commission may propose a review of the Regulation by 15 March 2013 at the latest."
"Certain key provisions have been included in the proposed compromise package."
"The most important of these is a ban on exports extended to cover not only metallic mercury, but also cinnabar ore and two common compounds of mercury, mercuric chloride and mercuric oxide."
"As Mr Papadimoulis said earlier, mixtures with a mercury content of more than 95% by weight have also been banned from export."
"Mixing metallic mercury with other substances for the purpose of exporting metallic mercury has been expressly forbidden."
"A revised schedule has been agreed, which is in fact more exacting than that envisaged in the original proposal, while at the same time ensuring sufficient time for taking suitable measures at each stage."
"Provision has been made to exempt mercury compounds used in research and development and for medical or analytical purposes."
"An obligation is imposed on companies in the chlor-alkali and gas cleaning industries to notify the Commission and publish information on the quantities of mercury in storage or being dispatched for disposal."
"A review clause requires the Commission to re-examine the situation and submit a report on the matter to the European Parliament and the Council proposing additional measures, if considered advisable, no later than 15 March 2013."
"The Commission is in a position to assure Parliament that enforcement of the Regulation will be closely monitored and any necessary additional measures will be proposed in good time."
"At the same time, the Commission is implementing the other procedures covered by the mercury strategy."
"It is negotiating vigorously for the adoption of international measures under the UN Environment Programme."
"Adopting of this Regulation ahead of the discussions scheduled for October 2008 on proposed international action, will demonstrate the EU's commitment and determination."
"This comes at an opportune time and enhances the EU's credibility among its partners."
"It is therefore essential that we agree on this compromise text."
"To conclude, Mr President, the Commission is in a position to accept proposed compromise amendments 42-63, as agreed in the tripartite talks."
"As I have said, the Almadén district could obviously be considered for safe storage of mercury, provided it meets the conditions to be imposed, and provided it has the necessary permits."
"However, the Commission cannot justify the priority given to only one area proposed in Amendments 37-41 and therefore cannot accept those amendments."
"Mr President, once again I warmly thank the rapporteurs from all the political groups."
"Without their effective cooperation at every step of this long-term endeavour and at each stage of the successful tripartite dialogue (and how effective the discussion has been), we could not have achieved the satisfactory compromise that has emerged."
"The Council's initial position, ladies and gentlemen, contained only one of the European Parliament's amendments."
"The compromise before us shows that the important positions adopted by the European Parliament at first reading, together with the Commission's constructive contribution, have been included in the agreement with the Council."
"We must safeguard this achievement."
"I can understand the concerns and requests of our Spanish colleagues concerning Almadén: let me remind you that we adopted this wording at first reading on my own recommendation."
"However, we must be absolutely realistic."
"Neither the Council nor the Commission is adopting this proposal and even the Spanish Government did not put forward such a request in the Council."
"If the European Parliament is overzealous on the Almadén issue tomorrow, we risk setting at naught the significant progress made by Parliament and failing to take advantage of a satisfactory compromise."
"We will also delay the adoption of measures to protect public health and the environment, as the current Parliamentary term ends in a year's time."
"There is a grave danger that the Council will return to square one, which is its initial position, and a very long way from the position we adopted at first reading."
"I therefore call on you to vote in favour of this agreement tomorrow."
"Once again, I thank the shadow rapporteurs, the representatives of the Council and the Commission for the joint effort we have made to achieve this agreement."
"Mr President, I would have appreciated it if my question could have been addressed either by the Commission or by the rapporteur, but I see that it was not."
"Maybe that constitutes a statement in itself."
"Perhaps they will do so in writing."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - (HU) Mercury is one of the best known and most dangerous of the heavy metals."
"It damages the nervous system and immune system and is especially harmful to babies and children."
"I welcome the initiative to ban exports of mercury because, despite the restrictions imposed in recent years, its use has not declined significantly."
"Instead, it has shifted from the developed world to developing countries."
"The European Union is the world's largest exporter and, therefore, if this regulation comes into effect, we can hope to see a reduction in mercury use world-wide."
"When mercury is used it can also get into foods, which then appear on European Union markets."
"For this reason, we not only have a global responsibility to reduce mercury pollution in the developing world; it is also in our interest."
"I regard it as a personal success and a success for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament that the export ban also covers mercury-calomel, given that mercury can easily be converted to calomel and the cost of converting it back to mercury is minimal."
"If we did not include this provision, it would be easy for exporters of metallic mercury to evade compliance with the regulation."
"Green Paper on better ship dismantling (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Green Paper on better ship dismantling."
"rapporteur. - (NL) On various shores in South Asia enormous seagoing ships for scrapping are dismantled under conditions that are environmentally damaging and humanly degrading."
"Social standards do not apply here."
"In Bangladesh alone, 200 lives have been lost over the past few years as a result of work on the dismantling of ships."
"Many children are used to dismantle the ships because it is easy for them to get into small spaces."
"They are expected to remove toxic substances without any protection for themselves."
"The substances then end up in the environment, with disastrous consequences for the fishing and tourism industries."
"Regrettably, many ships from Europe also end up on the shores of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, for example, in this way."
"The high prices of steel, low wages, poor safety regulations and absence of environmental measures are evidently financially attractive."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety clearly states that these practices are ethically unacceptable and that the humanly degrading and environmentally destructive conditions involved in the dismantling of ships must not be permitted to continue."
"The efforts of an individual Member State or of the European Union alone will not be sufficient to tackle this."
"Whatever we may do in the years ahead, a global solution to the problem of ship dismantling is still urgently needed."
"Unfortunately, it has to be said that not much has so far been achieved at global level."
"This, indeed, is precisely the reason why the European Commission has published a green paper."
"The main objective that we wish to achieve is the protection of the environment and public health without simply displacing the problems to other countries."
"In view of the fact that many seagoing ships currently sailing under the European flag will need to be dismantled in the coming years, we can no longer wait to take action."
"The Committee on the Environment specifically proposes the following."
"In order to prevent evasion of the provisions of the Waste Shipments Regulation, guidelines must be introduced that make it possible to distinguish between when a ship is truly a ship and when it is waste."
"The implementation and enforcement of the Waste Shipments Regulation must be improved through tighter controls and monitoring by port authorities in the Member States, on the understanding that port states must have the power to declare a ship to be at the end of its life."
"A list must be compiled of seagoing ships that are likely to be scrapped within a few years."
"A competitive and clean ship dismantling industry must be developed within the European Union, for example at shipyards that are currently disused."
"In the framework of development aid, know-how and technology must be transferred to dismantling sites in South Asia to help them comply with safety and environmental standards."
"Incidentally, the dismantling of seagoing ships in Bangladesh is an extremely lucrative business, in which a sufficient amount of money can be earned in order to swiftly implement acceptable working conditions for dismantling work."
"I should like to emphasise that it remains essential that we continue to work on two levels."
"First of all, we must shoulder responsibility for our own European fleet and work towards establishing a global agreement."
"At this moment in time, we cannot concentrate on one of these two issues alone."
"The response I have often received from the shipping industry is that this Green Paper would prevent or delay the development of an IMO convention. I do not agree with this."
"Rather, I believe that we, the European Union, are actually anticipating this IMO agreement and, in due course, will be better prepared to implement it."
"Moreover, I am firmly of the opinion that the European Union would like to move away from the serious conditions that exist in South Asia as quickly as possible."
"I am pleased that there is a high level of agreement on this issue in the Committee on the Environment and both of the committees who were asked for an opinion."
"That is in any case a good start."
"I assume that the plenary sitting can support this course of action."
"It also appears that the Member States are now able to take action."
"Last Thursday, the Otopan left the Netherlands for Turkey after the authorities had had the ship cleaned, as a result of which all of the hazardous waste was removed."
"This is possible by virtue of the Waste Shipments Regulation."
"Previously, an export licence was refused because these conditions were not fulfilled."
"On that same Thursday, I received a visit from a delegation of the NGO that is committed to the responsible dismantling of ships is South-East Asia."
"It must be made clear that these people have been battling for a responsible ship dismantling industry in their country for many years, and we must not leave these people out in the cold."
"A lawyer from Bangladesh, people from India: they have been dedicating themselves to this cause for years, and I feel that we must support them in this and must adopt this resolution."
"I hope to hear what Commissioner Dimas intends to do in the near future with regard to establishing a responsible ship dismantling industry in these countries and to making the resources available to achieve this."
"Mr President, about a year ago the Commission adopted the Green Paper on better ship dismantling."
"Since then, there have been various developments, particularly in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), where a draft convention on ship recycling is being prepared and is expected to be approved in May 2009."
"However, recent reports in the media have once again revealed the dismal reality of shipbreaking practices in some parts of South Asia."
"I am therefore particularly satisfied with the support the European Parliament has given to the Commission's initiative to improve shipbreaking practices."
"About 90% of all large ships decommissioned around the world in 2007 were dismantled on the coasts of South Asia, mainly in India and Bangladesh."
"Many of these ships were from the EU."
"We estimate that one quarter of the global fleet flies the flag of an EU Member State, and about 40% of all vessels are owned by EU-based companies."
"Shipbreaking on South Asian coasts is often carried out under appalling conditions: there is no protection against pollution whatsoever and workers' lives are at risk."
"Very few ships have their hazardous materials removed before they reach the breaking yards."
"What Mr Blokland has just said about ship cleaning in Holland is very significant."
"When the ships reach their destination, the waste materials in question are removed in a way that is dangerous and harmful to the environment."
"To overcome this situation, international rules and Community legislation are already in place."
"However, the Basel Convention and the Waste Shipments Regulation are very often contravened and are rarely observed by the countries of destination, on the pretext that the ship is making its last voyage."
"According to the figures available to us, the number of ships reaching the end of their lives is steadily increasing, and the rules in question should therefore be adapted accordingly."
"The IMO draft Convention on ship recycling signals some progress in this area."
"It is likely to be approved in 2009 and we, for our part, shall do whatever we can to make that convention strong and effective."
"However, it will not apply to warships, state-owned vessels or other vessels in the service of the state."
"Furthermore, its implementation may take five or six years."
"Apart from this, the convention will be effective only if accompanied by the adoption of measures at national and regional level."
"Some Member States have already begun to take measures, as Mr Blokland has said, but a number of others have not yet begun to map out a strategy."
"For these reasons, it is essential to take measures in good time and at Community level."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you once again for your report and for the support you are giving the Commission regarding the proposed measures."
"The report contains interesting and useful ideas, which we shall study carefully when devising our strategy."
"In particular, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for his efforts, and Mr Hammerstein, Mr Evans and the other members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for their contribution."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Mr President, thank you, Commissioner Dimas, and thank you, Mr Blokland, for this very relevant and necessary report, because although for some time the International Maritime Organization has been preparing new legislation on ship dismantling, so that it is more ecological and causes less problems for the health of workers in the Third World, in the South, this legislation could take years to be ratified and complied with globally."
"In the meantime, ship dismantling could reach maximum levels in the next ten years, precisely because of the new rules banning single-hull vessels."
"There are going to be an increasing number of ships to be dismantled."
"The European Union cannot wait for there to be a change in the international rules; it needs to act now, to lead the change, to promote green audits of ship dismantling and create a fund with the industry to internalise the environmental costs and also to help the communities in the South, that have already suffered a great deal from the environmental and health costs of this problem."
"We also need to implement a precautionary policy through the principle of compulsory substitution of hazardous materials in ships, because ships that leave to be dismantled in Asia are not a means of transport."
"No."
"They are hazardous waste, and we are exporting this hazardous waste, which is prohibited by European legislation."
"It is time to take responsibility and to act ethically and morally."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - Mr President, I may perhaps be the only person here tonight who has actually witnessed first-hand the process to which we are referring."
"As Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, I have been to Bangladesh and seen the shipyards."
"In amongst the ships that were being repaired and dismantled - and the noise, I have to tell you, was intolerable - there were whole families living, sleeping, cooking meals in shanty towns."
"Children were playing around the boats, retrieving cricket balls from under the vessels whilst above them oxyacetylene torches were being used."
"It is not acceptable for European ships - and none of them were flying European flags; by this stage they had already been passed off as local ships or from somewhere else in the world - to be broken in these circumstances."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism believes that the EU should lead the way and encourage global action with the clear aim of putting an end to the current practices and ways in which ships are dismantled, particularly in parts of South Asia."
"But dismantling should not be stopped altogether, nor indeed immediately, as Mr Blokland stated, in view of its economic importance to the countries concerned."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he says that we must work towards a global strategy which ensures that all those who are involved in the process of ship recycling assume their due share of responsibility for the way it is carried out - for safety, workers' rights and the protection of the environment."
"Finally, I think we should also support the development of a competitive and clean European ship-recycling industry."
"But, in the meantime, Member States must commit themselves to a policy that state-owned vessels and old warships will be dismantled in a safe and environmentally sound way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, can we accept that our vessels that are to be broken up go and pollute the beaches of South Asia because we refuse to accept our responsibilities for dismantling them?"
"South Asia, which receives most of our vessels, unfortunately receives polluting substances such as asbestos, pyralenes, oils and hydrocarbon sludge, which end up in the soil, the sand and the sea, and that is not the only thing!"
"Children work on dismantling these vessels, because they can enter small spaces easily, and unfortunately, they remove toxic materials without any protection at all."
"They are cheap labour, and suffer from chronic incurable diseases."
"From an ethical point of view this is unacceptable, especially as the vessels come from Europe and thus end up on the beaches of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"The European Union, which is partly responsible for these social and environmental problems, must take the right measures, in cooperation with the IMO, to put an end to social and environmental dumping due to economic incentives."
"There are measures to be taken urgently, to establish constraints on the recycling of vessels, and that should include requirements for certification and notification."
"When vessels are designed and built, the perspective of future recycling should be incorporated, and facilities for recycling boats should be provided."
"We urgently need to establish facilities that will be deemed the best of their kind in terms of human rights, health and safety."
"Then, without wishing to deprive South Asia of this large market, we also need to provide facilities in European naval yards so that we can recover this waste for ourselves, and then develop what we could call ecologically rational dismantling, all of which could serve as a basis for an international agreement."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am glad that the Commission is bringing forward proposals and I am pleased the EU is finally dealing with this issue, because we have known about it for a long time."
"The conditions that Robert Evans has just described are nothing new to this Parliament and nothing new to the Commission."
"Yet it is now the end of May 2008."
"We have a Green Paper and we hear that we are going to have a proposal from the Commission to be adopted in May 2009, which means it will be at the end of this Commission and in the middle of the European election campaign."
"I wonder how we will ever have anything in place to deal with the hundreds of ships which the Commission has identified."
"It knows that 800 single-hull tankers will have to be dismantled from 2010 onwards."
"I wonder if you can comment, Commissioner, on that very short timetable which we are leaving ourselves to introduce legislation."
"It would also have been better if the EU could have completed the legislation in this Parliament before the end of your mandate."
"The Socialist Group will support Mr Blokland."
"We have supported everything he has done throughout this procedure and we thank him very much for his hard work."
"We will also support amendments which strengthen the proposal, but we will not support amendments which are protectionist."
"We are not seeking to stop ships being dismantled in Asian countries because, as Robert Evans has just pointed out, there are jobs at stake and the metals are a major source of raw materials for these countries."
"But we want the pre-cleaning, which, as Mr Blokland pointed out, is quite possible."
"We need to invest in specialised cleaning operations in Europe so that we can have a much safer environment for people to dismantle ships in the developing countries."
"We also support the creation of a ship-dismantling fund."
"I have seen that the PPE-DE Group have asked for separate votes."
"I hope they are not going to vote against that fund tomorrow in plenary."
"Commissioner, I hope we can act speedily and that we can get something on the statute books to deal with the huge increase in ships for dismantling in 2010."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, congratulations to Mr Blokland for his - as expected - excellent report and for the very good cooperation offered to all shadow rapporteurs."
"The subject matter of this Green Paper is very important, as well as being deeply worrisome."
"Much of the dismantling of ships as presently done can rightly be characterised by many as criminal, both with reference to human health and also with reference to the environment."
"Most such dismantling, as we all know, takes place on beaches and river banks on the Indian subcontinent with no or minimal concern for the most basic rules of protection of humans and of the environment from contamination by a variety of toxic substances, including numerous carcinogenic agents."
"Additionally, workers in such dismantling places are treated with the utmost disrespect for their human and labour rights and for their dignity, not to mention the use of child labour in truly atrocious conditions which, in some cases, differ little from child slavery in its most despicably shameful glory."
"A small number of amendments have been submitted, most with the support of the rapporteur."
"We shall follow his position, with the exception of Amendment 1, for which we can find no reasonable explanation why it does not meet with Mr Blokland's approval and for which we shall vote positively, and we trust that others will do the same."
"In giving our full support to this Green Paper let us hope that ship dismantling, regrettably a most necessary eventuality for the shipping industry, is done in the future in an environmentally, socially and hygienically safe manner and that it will provide a much needed but properly and safely earned income for the population of developing countries."
"Let us also hope that the ideas in this report are put into legislative form as soon as possible and that its scope is extended to include military as well as commercial vessels."
"Finally, let me say that I agree with previous speakers that our eventual aim should be a globally accepted strategy for ship dismantling."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Firstly, I should like to thank my colleague Mr Blokland most warmly for his excellent report."
"I feel that he has outlined very well the enormous problems that are created in poor countries as a result of the dismantling of European ships."
"The consequences for both working conditions and the environment are often serious, and the EU must not run away from its responsibility for these."
"Amongst other things, Mr Blokland opts to follow the route of more stringent international legislation."
"I am most certainly an advocate of such legislation, but I fear it will take much too long before tangible results can be achieved in this way."
"Europe must take action now and cannot wait for the rest of the world."
"Effective scrapping regulations must be established for ships."
"These regulations should include a provision to the effect that, in principle, European ships may only be dismantled outside the EU if the owners can demonstrate that it is impossible for this to be carried out within Europe."
"Furthermore, ships for scrapping that contain asbestos or other hazardous substances should in any case be dismantled in European territory."
"We cannot allow our rubbish to cause great problems elsewhere in the world."
"Once a ship ceases to be suitable for use, we must stop thinking of it as a ship."
"It then becomes waste and must be treated as such."
"We do not simply allow other hazardous waste to leave the EU without guarantees with regard to the way in which it is going to be processed, and so there is no reason why we should do so with ships for scrapping."
"In addition, emphasis should be placed upon processing within the Union itself, as is the case in the entire European waste policy."
"Finally, a policy of naming and shaming shipowners and Member States who have their ships dismantled according to methods that are unfriendly to the environment and people would be an effective initial step that we could in fact commence tomorrow."
"The responsibility for dismantling a ship responsibly must always remain with the owner and, subsequently, it is up to Member States to verify that this takes place in the correct manner."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your excellent work, and the same goes for Mr Blokland."
"The Green Paper before us on better ship dismantling is, in all seriousness, a classic example of the global imbalance that has resulted from industrial development and of the efforts of many different agencies at long last to do something about its negative impact."
"The responsibility of the industrialised countries rightly comes to the fore in situations where developing countries suffer intolerable social and environmental harm because others have gone in pursuit of economic benefits."
"The negative impact of ship dismantling is particularly glaring."
"With the greater environmental, health and safety requirements of which industrialised countries have had to take account, most of the world's seagoing vessels are dismantled in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, often in very primitive conditions."
"Dismantling yards barely comply with health and environmental standards, and toxic substances such as asbestos are handled by people wearing shorts and sandals."
"The use of child labour is also common."
"The equation is a difficult one."
"Ship dismantling is a profitable business for these countries, not only in terms of its effect on employment and the financial benefits but also for the recovery of raw materials."
"For example, Bangladesh gets 80-90% of its steel from dismantled ships."
"At the same time, low labour costs and the lack of basic standards make it an economically attractive business, which in practice results in environmental dumping and a human tragedy on an enormous scale."
"An increase in unprofitable dismantling in the EU with the help of aid is not, however, a sustainable option."
"There should instead be direct aid measures for the developing countries engaged in dismantling, greatly multiplying the environmental and social benefits."
"After vessels have been partially dismantled or cleaned they are in practice unfit to sail, and after asbestos has been removed, for example, most ships can no longer be moved."
"For that reason aid measures should focus on the establishment of certified dismantling yards, where the dismantling techniques used comply with Western notions of safety and environmental acceptability."
"Globally there should be a list for shipping companies of approved dismantling yards, and the International Maritime Organization should have a key part to play in their certification, to make the system truly international."
"This would solve the equation."
"The developing countries need the economic and material benefits derived from dismantling, and the shipping firms in the industrialised countries which are under growing pressure need the situation to change."
"(PL) Mr President, some words of acknowledgement for the rapporteur, Mr Blokland; as always, once again he has done some excellent work."
"Mr Evans said that he had seen ships being dismantled in Bangladesh."
"Beyond the Polish eastern border, which is also a European boarder, I have seen instances of 'non-dismantling' of ships; in other words, somewhere on the seashore, fishing vessels, passenger ships and freighters, and even military ships, have been dumped and the water has flushed them out."
"We are talking about the first step, then, which is dismantling."
"The second step would seem to be some kind of duty to dismantle."
"Then, finally, there is the third step - recycling, or establishing the kind of material used to build ships, how this material is embodied in the vessel and how such materials may be recovered."
"This is the process we are commencing."
"As an economist rather than an idealist, I believe we have quite a long road ahead of us, but it is a very good thing that we are starting our journey along it, and let us hope that we will find followers out there in the world."
"(RO) I would also like to congratulate Mr. Blokland for his report."
"In response to the accidents in which oil tankers such as Erika and Prestige were involved, the Union adopted the international legislation and rules for the gradual phasing-out of single hull oil tankers."
"It is estimated that approximately 1,300 single hull oil tankers will be phased out and sent for dismantling by 2015."
"The costs entailed by the ship dismantling are very high and make the recycling of ships unfeasible from the economic point of view."
"In many Member States, there are still ships that are very old, in poor condition, anchored at the shore or even stranded on the shores of internal waters."
"Thus, I believe special attention should be given to delta and estuary areas, where stranded ships could have a negative impact on the environment."
"Stranded ships often block navigable waterways periodically and cause substantial economic damage."
"Since 2005, the International Maritime Organization has worked on implementing a mandatory international system for ecological ship dismantling, a process to which the European Union has also contributed."
"The future international convention and the responsible involvement of Member States will be essential for solving the problems related to ship dismantling."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the high level of discussion this evening."
"Your report is extremely encouraging as regards the Commission's proposals."
"Let me mention three issues you have touched on."
"Firstly, you call on the Member States and the Commission to enforce the Waste Shipments Regulation more effectively."
"You also call on the Commission to draw up a list of ships likely to be taken to breaking yards in the next few years."
"We shall examine the possibility of drawing up such a list."
"As Mrs Grossetête has proposed, we must also list the facilities that meet higher standards."
"Furthermore, with regard to ships reaching the end of their lives, we agree that stricter regulation on the shipment of waste must be enforced."
"The Commission intends to provide the necessary guidelines."
"I expect the authorities of the Member States to ensure that there are no cases of ships being allowed to leave EU ports if they are clearly being sent for breaking in developing countries."
"In addition, in view of the fact that most ships of European origin will be broken and turned into waste outside Community waters, a binding international regime really must be enacted."
"Secondly, we shall examine the question of developing a competitive shipbreaking and pre-cleaning industry in the EU, without endangering the viability of South Asian breaking yards."
"The European shipyards are not in a position to compete with the breaking yards of South Asia."
"There is no question, then, of retaining or artificially bringing back the bulk of the shipbreaking market to Europe."
"What we can ensure, however, is the requirement that warships, other state-owned ships and those receiving state aid should be broken up exclusively in facilities that are environmentally well run, in Europe or in OECD countries."
"We could perhaps require ships flying the flags of Member States to be broken exclusively in fully authorised and certified facilities."
"Pre-cleaning should be made common practice so that it becomes practicable."
"Lastly, I see that you are supporting the proposal to set up a shipbreaking fund."
"You are asking the Commission to examine the possibility of imposing compulsory insurance as a guarantee of environmentally friendly recycling."
"The Commission is to examine the existing options."
"Those responsible in the shipping sector inform us that the new international Convention on ship recycling will combine with market forces to solve the shipbreaking problem."
"We certainly do not want to create unnecessary administrative or financial burdens."
"We shall, at any rate, keep a close watch on developments; we shall not hesitate to take regulatory measures if the market remains unable to provide a solution to this problem."
"Your continuing support will be of crucial importance in ensuring a change for the better in shipbreaking conditions."
"rapporteur. - (NL) I should like first of all to thank all the speakers for their appreciative words, especially Commissioner Dimas."
"I should like to make a couple more observations."
"I believe that it is of exceptional importance that this dismantling fund be established."
"This fund should be filled with contributions from shipowners and not, of course, with government subsidies."
"I believe that that is not at all necessary."
"In the same way as a scrapping fund for old cars, this will begin to support itself as time goes by."
"I am happy that the Commissioner is also thinking along these lines."
"We must be very quick and, therefore, it may perhaps be a good idea to enter into an agreement with the European shipowners as soon as possible, so that they will have their ships dismantled responsibly in any case."
"I know that shipping company P&O Nedlloyd Maersk has had around 20 ships dismantled responsibly in China, particularly also by ensuring that facilities were provided there where possible."
"I believe that we must make the shipowners, in particular, aware of their social responsibility and let them know that they really cannot do this any more; that is, to sell a ship for large sums of money."
"It is then sold 10 more times before it is finally dismantled."
"We need to adopt a completely different approach to dismantling and, in my opinion, it may well be possible to induce the shipowners to do so, especially given all the negative publicity on this issue in recent years."
"Dismantling work is also often carried out in contravention of local legislation and against the wishes of the Ministries of Social Affairs and the Environment."
"I have also been told that, in Bangladesh, it is not the national legislation that is the problem but the enforcement of such legislation."
"I think, therefore, that there may well be sufficient facilities in place, but they are not being used."
"Mr Matsakis also asked what my objection is to his amendment."
"The issue is that this amendment implies that environmentally destructive conditions involved in the dismantling of ships cannot be permitted to continue in developing countries."
"However, they cannot be permitted to continue anywhere, including in Eastern Europe, for example, where ships are indeed still occasionally dismantled according to irresponsible methods."
"It is therefore excessive to focus this exclusively on developing countries, particularly if it is later specified that it is not allowed to be carried out in places such as the Far East."
"I feel that this addition is unnecessary, therefore."
"Unfortunately, I cannot support the amendments by Mrs Liotard, as they are too protectionist."
"Mr Liberadzki has raised an important issue, specifically that there are also ships stored elsewhere, left to rust, with nothing being done about them."
"We must also tackle that issue."
"I should like to say a big thank you to everyone once again, and I shall leave it at that."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting closed at 23.40.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to welcome a delegation from the Mexican Congress, led by Senator Guadarrama, who have taken their seats in the official gallery."
"A very warm welcome to you."
"(Applause)"
"The delegation is taking part in the sixth meeting of the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee today."
"Mexico is a close partner of the European Union and this meeting is taking place at an important time in relations between Mexico and the European Union."
"The Lima Summit last weekend showed that we have many common interests."
"I also had the opportunity to speak with your President, Felipe Calderón."
"The Joint Parliamentary Committee will also be discussing climate change this afternoon, so I am sure that this plenary debate will be followed by you with interest."
"I wish our Mexican colleagues and friends a successful stay in Strasbourg."
"Scientific facts of climate change: findings and recommendations for decision-making (debate)"
"The next item is the interim report by Mr Florenz on the scientific facts of climate change: findings and recommendations for decision-making."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, welcome to the European Parliament."
"What prompted the European Union to set up a Temporary Committee on Climate Change?"
"It was the right approach, to present an overall view of how we, the European Union, intend to deal with this issue."
"If we want to help at international level to ensure that this issue is kept on the agenda - as Stavros Dimas is successfully doing for the Commission - as the European Union, as the Parliament, we must state what our concept is; in other words, we need to state what our visiting card is on this issue."
"Ultimately, Europe must show how we are dealing with this issue, and what approach we are adopting in order to encourage other countries and continents to move with us in the same direction."
"That is why it is important to begin with the scientific aspect of this debate, and that is what we are talking about today."
"Focusing on this aspect will never produce an attractive report because it simply deals with the status quo."
"It is not a matter of horse-trading: giving a bit here, taking a bit there."
"We have brought together these facts in numerous thematic strategies, during which we invited two Nobel Prize laureates to Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Mr President, you organised an excellent event and delivered a very significant speech on climate change, which was extremely gratifying from my perspective and which encouraged me to redouble my efforts."
"We have heard the views of numerous experts from international bodies all over the world, under the excellent chairmanship of my good friend Guido Sacconi who managed matters very well."
"We were also able to invite some critics, although unfortunately they did not all come, because they do not want to subject their criticism to international scrutiny."
"Producing criticism in print without being willing to subject it to formal scrutiny is hardly heroic conduct."
"I would have welcomed the presence of at least one or two critics willing to face up to international debate."
"We have read many excellent documents."
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was involved, and we also consulted the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme, the climate conference of the Federal Republic of Germany, and many others, with the result that we now have the facts before us."
"This is not a combative sort of paper, as some of my friends have occasionally claimed; it is a status report as a basis on which to determine how we should proceed in future."
"The arguments clearly show that there is a scientific consensus with which we can now progress with our work."
"There is a consensus on how to assess the anthropogenic influence; that is covered in Article 3."
"We have sufficient information to state that the target of limiting the global average temperature increase to not more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels in future is important."
"What, then, do we need to do in future?"
"In Europe, we need to muster our energy for a new third industrial revolution based on the three pillars of sustainability, namely product sustainability, the social dimension and of course the economic dimension."
"This is not a burden; it is a massive opportunity which we must develop further as our vision."
"One thing is certain: the climate debate is just a minor part of our problem."
"The fact is that in just 500 years, we are squandering energy which took millions of years to create, and we have absolutely no answer to the question of how our children, and our children's children, will be able to develop their energy sources in future."
"That is the great opportunity."
"We need the courage to be creative."
"The Stone Age did not end because we no longer had any stones available."
"Let me tell you, the Stone Age ended, fortunately, because we politicians had courage: courage to seize the future, courage for our children, and courage for this planet of ours."
"(Applause)"
"Many thanks, Mr Florenz, also for your kind words to the President."
"It is the exception rather than the rule for such kind sentiments to be expressed."
"As my role here is to be objective and neutral, I will refrain from making the point that very little praise tends to be forthcoming, especially from one's own political family."
"What has happened this morning was therefore quite an event!"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Mr President, Mr Florenz, ladies and gentlemen, proof is now available that man shares the responsibility for the great changes to the climate system, and that these changes have already had a negative impact on nature and human society."
"It is also certain that if we do not act promptly and considerably reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases during this century the global temperature will continue to rise, which will lead to general damage and disruption."
"The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released in Spain in November 2007, represents the most complete and the most credible scientific assessment of climate change so far."
"The report states that there is no doubt that the climate system is warming up, and that the increase in the average global temperature over the last fifty years has most probably been caused by the anthropogenic concentration of greenhouse gases."
"The assessment reports on the situation which have been published by IPCC since 1990 show that the science on climate change and the consequences thereof has made considerable advances over the last few years."
"This can be ascribed to a number of factors: the ever-increasing evidence of the known change to the climate, the scientists' hard work, and an improved dissemination of scientific discoveries."
"As has been stated in Mr Florenz's interim report, which in our opinion brings out some very important fresh formulations concerning the problems described that we know of today, the situation is enough to warrant the immediate creation and implementation of policies which will contribute to a reduction in greenhouse emissions."
"As we all know, this is why the European heads of state and government decided in March last year to send out a resolute message to the international community, with commitments concerning the reduction of greenhouse emissions."
"The European Union is determined to meet these commitments with an integrated approach to climate and energy policy."
"Secondly, it will dedicate special attention to energy efficiency, renewable sources of energy, biofuels, to carbon dioxide capture and storage and generally a transition to a low carbon economy."
"I should also like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, of the latest decisions of the European Council."
"As I already mentioned, last year the European Union adopted resolute and large-scale commitments concerning climate and energy policy."
"Now, in 2008, it is time for action."
"At the Climate Change Conference held in December last year in Bali, an important breakthrough was made with the beginning of the international negotiations process, which includes everyone, the developed and the developing countries."
"This process has been outlined in the Action Plan from Bali."
"The European Union is determined to further maintain its leading international role in the area of climate change and energy, and to preserve the necessary impetus in negotiations within the framework of the United Nations Convention, in particular at one of its next sessions this year in Poznan."
"The objective is to ensure that in Copenhagen in 2009, an ambitious, global and integrated climate change agreement is reached for the period following the year 2012, which will be in line with the European Union's objectives, that the global temperature should not increase by more than two degrees. The European Union will also contribute to this considerably by meeting the targets set out at the European Council's spring meeting in 2007."
"The key challenge is that the transition to a safe and sustainable low carbon economy is carried out in a manner that will be in line with the sustainable development of the European Union, its competitiveness, a reliable energy supply, food security, and healthy and sustainable public finances."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity you have given us today to discuss the interim report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, presented by Mr Florenz."
"I congratulate him on his excellent work."
"The report confirms the European Parliament's support for an ambitious Community policy on combating climate change. Let me take this opportunity, Mr President, to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their continuing support and vital contribution towards promoting our climate policy, raising public awareness and informing MPs from other countries."
"Mr President, I should also like to point out the important part you have played in promoting the EU's policy on climate change. I am sure that you and Members of the European Parliament will continue with the same commitment, so that in the two brief years we have ahead of us we can achieve an agreement by the end of 2009 in Copenhagen."
"We shall thus be able to deal effectively with this great threat to the planet."
"Both in the EU, where discussions on the climate and energy package of measures are intensifying, and in international negotiations, we must muster all our resources and cooperate as best we can. We must make use of the EU's head start, bearing in mind the Copenhagen Conference in December 2009."
"Two factors have helped us reach the important decisions taken in Bali: Europe's position as world leader in combating climate change, and the scientific findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."
"Thanks to these findings, many world leaders have accepted that there is indeed an urgent need to take measures. This series of scientific reports has now allowed citizens and political leaders, including Members in various countries, to better understand the scale of the challenge and the serious dangers we face if we do not intervene to stop climate change."
"I think we nearly all agree that it has indeed been scientifically proven that urgent, bold measures to combat climate change are needed."
"These measures are summarised in the interim report we have before us."
"This report puts across more clearly than ever before the scientific message given by the IPCC and other sources in 2007."
"The scientific debate on whether climate change is caused by human activity has lasted for decades because of scepticism, which has prevented decisive measures from being taken."
"Now the debate is over."
"This does not mean that all the questions have been answered or that we have understood every detail; but we now know enough to conclude that the rapid adoption of ambitious measures is in our interests, in terms of energy security and in economic, environmental and social terms."
"Not only do we not have the luxury of waiting but, worse still, the time we have is very limited."
"If we are to restrict global warming to 2°C, the threshold above which we lose the ability to limit or reverse its environmental impact, greenhouse gas emissions should peak within the next 10 to 15 years at the most."
"In the long term, to give us a good chance of not exceeding 2°C, global emissions in 2050 must be reduced to 50% of their 1990 levels."
"To achieve this, a radical change is needed in the way we produce and use energy."
"There must be a worldwide transition to a low-CO2 economy, and small but important changes are needed in many aspects of our everyday lives."
"What we need is nothing short of a green revolution."
"The IPCC reports have made it clear that even with ambitious measures to reduce emissions some serious effects of climate change are probably inevitable. The international community must therefore be ready to deal with them."
"For this reason, support will be necessary, especially to the most vulnerable among the developing countries, which will face the gravest problems."
"I now turn to the UN negotiations. We know we have little time at our disposal, since our overriding priority is to achieve an agreement in Copenhagen in 2009."
"Signing a substantial, comprehensive agreement that meets the ambitious targets set by scientific findings is a considerable challenge."
"Persuading our international partners to sign the ambitious agreement is our objective and will require a titanic effort."
"The EU must therefore remain faithful to its hitherto successful strategy. This means that we must achieve positive results at home and show our international partners abroad that adopting ambitious measures is neither contrary to their interests, nor does it hinder their economic development."
"One of our challenges here will be to secure the participation of developed countries in an effort to reduce emissions to levels corresponding to the 2°C target. This means a 25-40% reduction in their emissions by 2020 from the 1990 level."
"Let me not beat about the bush."
"We call on the United States to rise to the challenge; instead of hindering progress, it must encourage it."
"As you will have realised during your recent visit to the United States, discussions in progress there have begun to move in the right direction, but obviously we still expect much more from them."
"As well as working with developed countries, we must also work to achieve ambitious commitments on emission reduction from developing countries, especially the more advanced ones."
"There are many possibilities for reducing emissions; they entail significant additional benefits for energy security, human health, and development in general."
"Measures in this direction must be provided for and supported in the forthcoming 2009 agreement."
"Here, too, I believe, things are moving in the right direction."
"There is increased awareness of the need to take steps to combat climate change."
"At the same time, additional benefits are also becoming apparent, whether in relation to safeguarding energy, or human health, or economic development, which will not only be safeguarded, but will probably benefit."
"The recent visit by Commission representatives to China confirmed that our Chinese counterparts are fully aware of their pressing obligation to take internal measures."
"They have already begun to take them and intend to continue their efforts."
"We must support them bilaterally and multilaterally."
"We shall have many opportunities during the coming months and next year to put across our message."
"For instance, there will be the G8 Conference and G8+5, for which the Japanese presidency is concentrating on climate change."
"Further opportunities will come with the initiative under the auspices of the UN for the world's leading economies and the EU's various bilateral cooperation programmes on climate change."
"We shall make use of all these opportunities. We shall persuade our partners that urgent measures must be taken and that sound, viable policies must be mapped out on energy and climate change."
"In our endeavour we must systematically highlight the scientific findings underpinning our actions; we must keep referring back to the consequences of inaction or inadequate measures."
"As we know, the shared vision is to be the subject of negotiations in the context of the Bali roadmap."
"It is very important that the vision should be negotiated on the basis of the authoritative scientific opinions that we have at our disposal."
"We must insist that the negotiations should be conducted in the light of scientific findings."
"I am confident that together you have just as important a role to play as the Commission in putting this crucial message across to our partners, to our citizens and to their parliamentary representatives."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry I am late, but I was trying to keep my speed down in order to protect our climate."
"Our main debate today concerns scientific data on climate change."
"First of all I wish to thank my colleague Karl-Heinz Florenz for his outstanding work and his constant devotion to this issue."
"Ladies and gentlemen, scientific knowledge on climate change has now been established."
"In the opinion of a majority of experts on the subject, we can no longer entertain any doubts as to the fact that global warming is now a reality, and that it is largely due to human activities."
"A few dissidents question the reality of this phenomenon, without offering any genuine proof."
"The interim report by our Temporary Committee on Climate Change is the first phase in a process that will lead to a search for solutions."
"Almost all of us agree that the increase in world temperature ought to be restricted to two degrees above pre-industrial levels, while bearing in mind that we actually ought to be aiming for an increase of less than two degrees. The debate on climate change cannot, however, be boiled down to a battle of statistics."
"When we talk about the climate, we mention the melting of the Arctic ice cap, desertification, global warming, displacement of animal species, and especially phenomena that could have catastrophic consequences in terms of human displacement."
"This is a major challenge for mankind as a whole."
"The regions hardest hit will be the poorest countries in Africa, Asia and Central and Latin America, where environmental migration is envisaged."
"A new kind of refugee is set to emerge with the onset of extreme climate conditions."
"They will no longer be political refugees or economic migrants; they will be climate refugees."
"There is also a risk of a food crisis since there will be less cultivatable land."
"When supplies of drinking water become more scarce, tensions will rise, and wars could break out in a struggle for control of resources."
"We have an immense responsibility here."
"It is no longer a matter of questioning the phenomenon of climate change, but for all of us to work together to find solutions and implement them."
"The Climate Action and Renewable Energy package presented by the Commission in January is also now being discussed by Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy: emission quota trading system, sharing of the climate burden, capture and storage of carbon and renewable energies."
"Members of our PPE-DE Group on these committees and the PPE Group as a whole are heavily involved."
"We are expecting many such debates, and are determined to work together to find a compromise at first reading."
"It is essential that Parliament and the Council reach an agreement before the European elections."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has taken on the role of world leader in the fight against climate change vis-à-vis its international partners, and it must retain this role. If we do not take our role seriously to encourage the US and other countries, as you said, Commissioner, such as China and India, to join us in the fight against climate change, then who will?"
"Europe must be united and fully operational at the Poznań World Conference in December 2008, which will shape the agreement we hope to sign in Copenhagen in December 2009."
"This is a world challenge, but Europe is the power that can persuade its partners to join its fight, and we must make preparations for the future of our children and our grandchildren."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Socialist Group moved that the Temporary Committee on Climate Change be established and when we tabled that motion we were more convinced than ever that we are at a decisive phase in terms of European and indeed international policy, for what we are expecting of this Committee is a Herculean task, not only here in the House."
"The issues it is dealing with are - it must be said - a monumental task: a task, as we say in German, for an entire century."
"I therefore welcome the fact that this debate has revealed an overwhelming consensus among Members of this House that we must make massive efforts to master the challenges facing us."
"I would therefore like to join in the thanks expressed to Karl-Heinz Florenz who, as a member of a different parliamentary group but in his capacity as rapporteur, has presented a report whose contents we, as the Socialist Group, can certainly endorse."
"I am grateful too that, with Karl-Heinz Florenz and my colleague Guido Sacconi, we have two people from this House jointly steering the Committee, which in my view is a good sign that we can achieve a result based on a consensus."
"So much for the consensual issues: the question which in my view will undoubtedly arise is whether we will still be able to work together when it comes to substantive issues concerning the policy course that we should take, and when we start addressing points of detail."
"I would therefore like to highlight two or three fracture lines which we will have to deal with. I do not want to go into the detail of the interim report, which I think is excellent;"
"I would simply draw your attention to one example. A few years ago, we were all very enthusiastic when we said that, in reducing CO2 emissions, we wanted to move away from oil and towards renewable resources."
"We said that biofuels were the answer but no one realised at the time that the massive use of arable land for the cultivation of energy crops could lead to a shortage of farmland for the cultivation of foods."
"When riots occurred some years ago in Mexico, when maize flour was suddenly no longer available or prices had risen dramatically, we - or at least I - did not immediately make the connection."
"Today, we know that we have to solve energy and climate problems but also combat hunger in the world."
"We need to reconcile these two aspects, and this is just one small indication that we are tackling an interdisciplinary task which will require us to demonstrate considerable resolve, and that includes the resolve to make compromises, including compromises elsewhere as well."
"Europe is an industrial continent."
"The industrial structures which were established over the course of 50 or 60 years have been responsible for the damage to our climate."
"We need a change of course, but we all need to recognise that industrial structures which have been established over 50 or 60 years cannot be changed within two weeks by a parliamentary resolution."
"That takes time as well, so we will have to strike a balance between the very ambitious goals we are setting ourselves here."
"Commissioner Dimas is right; we have no time to lose. We have to strike a balance between these ambitious goals, on the one hand, and what is feasible, in terms of a change of course, on the other."
"Both these aspects are crucially important, and both need a rational approach that is geared towards compromise."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the French Presidency has said that it is willing to try and produce a result by the end of the year."
"If we have the same willingness to compromise and the degree of commitment in the Council that is apparent here in Parliament, that gives me cause for optimism."
"However, if we see the same tactical positioning within the Council that we always see in this particular institution, we will lose time."
"I have the impression that there is great readiness on the part of Parliament and in the Commission as well."
"If we have the same readiness in the Council too, and if all three European institutions work together, then before the European elections, we can achieve what Mr Daul has said: namely to signal to the public that the heads of state and government agree the broad policy outlines while the European Parliament does the detailed work."
"This division of labour is what is customary, and then it would actually be visible at last."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, if the interim report from our Committee on Climate Change does no more than state the obvious, that is no bad thing."
"For it confirms, in black and white, what most of us have acknowledged for some time."
"The science of climate change is incontrovertible."
"Permafrost and ice caps are melting, sea-levels and temperatures rising, largely due to human activity."
"Failure to act now means humankind will hurtle towards a tipping point from which there is no return."
"The deadlines for climate policy are set not by the European Union, nor by the world community: they are set by nature."
"And the bottom line is that - despite commitments in Kyoto - global greenhouse gas emissions are growing faster than ever before, up by a quarter since 1990."
"Some scientists say CO2 concentrations have already gone too far."
"All agree the window of opportunity open to us to stabilise emissions and limit the rise in temperature to two degrees above pre-industrial levels will close within seven years."
"Democracies are run by crisis management."
"Serious problems are often not tackled until they have to be tackled, and as Karl-Heinz Florenz points out in this excellent report we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions not by 20%, but possibly by up to 40%, depending on what deal can be made with third countries at the Copenhagen talks next year."
"There are positive signs from the other big polluters, China and the USA."
"Beijing showed a new-found willingness to negotiate at the UN summit in Bali and all three US presidential candidates are committed to tackling climate change."
"What we must do - in the absence of further evidence, and with the resources at hand - is to approve the Commission's climate change package, and I salute the work that my colleagues Lena Ek, Chris Davis and Vittorio Prodi have done in this area."
"We must also redouble our efforts to promote clean energy - and the amazing thing is this: we know how."
"Generating power from the desert sun, as a supplement to sources of renewable energy here in Europe, could speed up the process of cutting CO2 emissions at a stroke."
"Indeed, satellite-based studies by the German Aerospace Centre have shown us that, using less than 0.3% of the desert area of the Middle East and North Africa, enough high-voltage electricity can be generated to supply current and future demand in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa."
"It is not rocket science."
"It has been done for 20 years in California."
"Plants are now being built in Spain and Morocco to do the same."
"If we could summon the drive and the determination, the guts and the grit, we could make the shift from oil while providing jobs, drinking water and better infrastructure for those bearing the brunt of climate change."
"We could combat climate change without having to turn off the lights."
"Our aim should be to put Europe's money where its mouth is, to invest money in high-voltage solar thermal power generation and political capital in the human relations across the Mediterranean Sea to make it possible."
"We could find no better ammunition for use in negotiations with the UN to get a progressive international agreement in Copenhagen."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to Karl-Heinz Florenz for the very good cooperation in the Temporary Committee on Climate Change."
"If we take the Florenz report and say, 'this is the state of play in the climate policy debate in the European Parliament', we might conclude that there is a wonderful 'climate' among Members here in the European Parliament, were it not for the fact that - like the Beagle Boys in the famous cartoons, whom we call the 'Tank-busters' in German - a very different agenda is being pursued in the same place at the same time!"
"Unfortunately, in parallel to the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, climate policy is being pursued in the European Parliament's other committees as well: in the Committee on Industry, in the Committee on Environment and in the Committee on Development."
"In these committees, our colleagues often arrive at very different outcomes; they do not conclude that we are at the dawn of a 'green' revolution, a second or third industrial revolution."
"Let us take the controversy over the regulation of CO2 emissions from cars as just one example."
"What is being put forward at present in this context by Mr Langen, the rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, has nothing to do with ambitious climate policy or the effort to guarantee energy security through efficiency technologies, which is what we are prescribing for the car industry in Europe."
"The ambitious new dawn which is championed by Mr Dimas has been consistently blocked by various majorities in the European Parliament for the last one and a half years."
"I would like to know what has happened to the spirit of the broader climate debate in this controversy over cars."
"Here, it is not my Group that should put its hand on its heart; those who are applying the brakes here are distributed among all the other groups in this House."
"Let me make one further point: emissions trading will be an important issue in Poznań and Copenhagen."
"The Commission should ensure that we achieve a 20% reduction in Europe."
"That was the proposal made by Angela Merkel when Germany held the Council Presidency, and yet as soon as the Commission tables its proposal for emissions trading, Members spring into action yet again as the parliamentary arm of the industry lobby in Europe, with the result that the negotiations focus not on achieving ambitious reduction targets but on achieving exemptions even before the rules have been established."
"Mr Florenz's report is a good report."
"The fact remains, however, that what we are voting on today has nothing to do with the reality of climate policy in the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I too should like to add my voice of congratulations to Mr Florenz and say how fortunate we are that we have a man of his ability leading this debate and to compliment him on what he has produced so far."
"We are often accused of being remote in this institution, of not being in touch with our people, but on this occasion the EU is working for its citizens."
"It is no coincidence that 95% of European citizens believe in the importance of protecting our environment."
"Over two thirds believe that policies tackling climate change should be initiated at European level."
"My country, which is a small island, cannot solve or undertake to tackle climate change alone, just like any other country."
"In the Reform Treaty, which is a very prominent subject of debate in my country at the present time, the European Union has outlined measures which will see the 27 Member States combating climate change, united together."
"The European Union constructively facilitated the UN agreement breakthrough in Bali last December, with all parties now recognising the urgency of action."
"We must accept the difficulties that we are facing; the scientific evidence is now overwhelming."
"Climate change is a serious global threat."
"It is going to cost us."
"Are we seriously willing to sacrifice not only our climate and planet, but also our economies?"
"Continued inaction will eventually cost us up to one fifth of our annual gross domestic product, but real action will mean a 1% spend."
"Are we also willing to subject our climate to the point of no return?"
"Already scientists inform us that the last decade was the warmest on record and that 2007 was one of the top 10 warmest years."
"Let us not forget our achievements and goals in Bali."
"We need to continue to deliver a road map of cohesive solutions to the threat of climate change, ensuring that Member State flexibility is at its heart."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) The content of this report is correct, but I would have liked to see more in the way of concrete measures to counter climate change."
"Despite this, of course, the report has the support of the GUE/NGL Group."
"We note from the report that global emissions increased by 70% between 1970 and 2004, that the last decade was the warmest ever and that we face several tipping-points, for example the melting of the Greenland ice sheet."
"We therefore call for a 60-80% reduction in the EU's emissions by 2050."
"We call for climate-labelling of consumer products and measures to counteract the considerable emissions generated by the EU through imports from other countries."
"We also appeal for a change in lifestyle patterns."
"This is perfectly correct, but we must also make it easier for people to live in climate-friendly ways."
"For example, we must eat less meat and we must travel less by car and aeroplane."
"Unfortunately the EU subsidises the meat industry by huge amounts."
"Just as unfortunately the EU subsidises the construction of motorways, which only leads to increased motoring."
"Our measures to counter flying are also far from adequate."
"If we politicians do not create sustainable systems, we are not credible when we urge people to change their lifestyles."
"As I have said, we should go further."
"We must have more concrete measures to bring about changes, and we must have higher reduction targets."
"We must also be self-critical and question the economic order which prevails in the EU."
"The EU is after all committed to the completion of the internal market and permanent growth."
"This only leads to more transport, and that is unsustainable."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) First I thank the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, for the thorough interim report we have in front of us today."
"It is good to have all the relevant scientific information on climate change collected in this report."
"It can then serve as a useful step towards the final report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change."
"I have nothing to add to the content and I have therefore not tabled any amendments."
"A great deal is already known about climate change, but a lot of further study is needed, because many of the parameters are still not known."
"This report makes an active start with that additional study."
"I cannot support the amendments by Mr Březina amongst others, insofar as they are admissible at all."
"As regards the amendments by Mrs Doyle and others, I shall follow the opinion of the rapporteur."
"Finally, I should like to wish Mr Florenz luck in drawing up the final report."
"(CS) Mr President, the report we are debating today is a symbol of the arrogance and mainstream blindness of Parliament."
"It is dangerously close to suppressing freedom, democracy and solidarity with the weakest in society."
"In regard to freedom of thought, there is nothing worse than insisting that only one scientific opinion is correct and denouncing other ideas."
"In regard to democracy, there is nothing worse than giving political blessing to such an opinion and trying to control people's lives accordingly."
"In regard to solidarity with the weakest, there is nothing worse than pouring foodstuffs into car petrol tanks and watching people die from hunger."
"Such policies will not save the planet."
"The only winners will be the producers of subsidised rapeseed and manufacturers of windmill components."
"Taking into account that the report attempts to suppress the exchange of opinions, dictates what the scientific results should be and overlooks the needs of the poorest in society, in no way can I give it my support."
"I think that the Temporary Committee on Climate Change should be immediately dissolved."
"In conclusion I just want to say that I come from the Czech Republic and I can proudly say that, unlike other politicians, President Václav Klaus's thinking has not become warmer and his brain has not become green."
"Thank you, Mrs Bobošíková."
"I will try harder to pronounce your name correctly in future."
"I think we are all on a learning curve, not only the President but undoubtedly the speaker as well."
"Thank you, Madam."
"(ES) Mr President, I wish to thank Karl-Heinz Florenz and the entire working group for having brought in such high-level scientists to work on this issue."
"I think it is the first time that scientists have worked alongside Members of this House."
"This is an asset that must not be discarded since it is clear, as the scientists have stated, that we face enormous uncertainty in the shape of climate change. In other words, science is progressing and is changing its opinions as it goes, and thus we cannot turn science into absolute truths."
"What does this mean?"
"It means that if scientists, in their work, are constantly reviewing their findings and we are following along behind, then we must also be flexible and adapt our solutions to the changes in knowledge."
"This symmetry between ever-increasing knowledge and our own flexibility is very important."
"Thus one of my concerns is the enormous confidence we have in ourselves in Europe."
"Doubt and uncertainty form the basis of scientific work, and of getting it right in this case."
"I think we have to be aware of the fact that there may be other countries, those we are criticising, that are doing the right thing in certain areas."
"I say this, and I must reiterate that I support the project, for I believe that the concepts of complexity and impact must be taken into consideration, and this is borne out by what has happened to us with biofuels."
"We must also be ruled by absolute discipline in relation to environmental impact, economic impact and feasibility of the solutions."
"Since the aim of this document is not to provide solutions, however, I continue to support it."
"Nevertheless I would also say that we must apply a combined policy, and here the document must move one step forward in the second part, with decisions taken from above at state level, without neglecting the fact that climate change is an issue which must be solved by adaptation at local level."
"We must therefore start contemplating a policy of broad climate change knowledge from above, in combination with a policy operated from below, in industry, in economic sectors, in agriculture, in our various territories, to allow each country to draw up its own project in line with the general project."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too of course add my voice to those of my fellow Members who have expressed thanks and appreciation for the work done by our rapporteur, Karl-Heinz Florenz."
"I would also like to thank, informally, all Members and political groups who are working and have worked very intensively this year for the Temporary Committee on Climate Change which has genuinely forged a very strong, staunch climate of unity beyond the fringe areas of discord which do nevertheless exist."
"This gives me reason for hope because a summary of all the material we have gathered already and the material we are gathering for the final report will be forthcoming, and this will, in short, allow us to pass on a healthy legacy to the future Parliament which it can use to carry out the work it must do in line with the truly overarching vision which is so necessary on this matter."
"What we have today is the first chapter, the placing on record of the state of scientific knowledge on this issue."
"We should be clear that this does not mean that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific movement, but a forum where, following years of work, all scientific literature on the subject has been considered and a summary, an audit, has been made, reaching levels of probability in various areas, various assessments, which have very rapidly attained almost 100%, an unprecedented state of affairs, I believe, in the history of science."
"I believe that this is also of concern from a wider point of view; it could be regarded to some degree as a model for establishing an intelligent relationship, if I may be so bold, between scientific knowledge and political decision-making in respect of the extraordinary complexity of the issues facing the world today."
"Climate change is happening, it is happening fast, and therefore we must act promptly and, as Karl-Heinz rightly said, it is not only a problem but an opportunity."
"This knowledge is precisely the basis upon which, in the space of one year, Commissioner Dimas, the world political climate has also changed, and global warming is not the only thing to have happened."
"The world political climate has changed, culminating in Bali with an acknowledgement by everyone of the validity of the IPCC research and, in recent months, of truly important changes in the positions taken by leaders."
"Some of our work also involved carrying out several visits to China, India and recently to Washington in the United States, and we were able to seize upon what, as you noted, the Presidential candidates have stated very clearly, namely that there will be a very different commitment even in the United States over the coming months which really gives rise to hope for the international negotiations which are due to conclude in Copenhagen in 2009."
"I agree with you on that point and we are producing results which were unimaginable only one year ago."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Commissioner for your continued attendance."
"As a scientist I can only welcome the fact that the picture in terms of science has finally been accepted and acknowledged, even in high-ranking political bodies such as this."
"As Vice-Chairman of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, I am satisfied with the initial results of the joint work and I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, my colleagues and the Chairman, Mr Sacconi."
"Personally, however, I fear that all our goodwill will not be enough to resolve the serious problems which we face."
"I am thinking especially of the catastrophic outlook predicted by climate change for problems which are already very difficult, such as poverty, public health and access to natural resources, chief among which is water, and I believe that, once the first step on this journey of discovery into this phenomenon has been taken, namely the drafting of this initial report on scientific evidence, we will in all likelihood be choosing to accept a mission impossible."
"This mission will be to give grounds for hope, to come up with achievable plans for a future which is not built solely on conflict and inequalities and to offer a vision where science helps us to even out the imbalances which mankind has created or helped to exacerbate."
"What we should tell our fellow citizens is this: we will accept this mission and in doing so we will make a leap forward for civilisation."
"Mr President, at first sight this report may seem like a technical one, simply summarising the science as we know it."
"But make no mistake, this report is also a deeply political one and it is a call to arms, because the fact is that this report demonstrates the urgent need for a complete revolution in the way we run our economies."
"Knowledge brings with it responsibility and to know what we know about the realities of climate change and yet to fail to act in a commensurate way would amount to nothing less than a crime against future generations."
"So the logic of the report is this: that the EU's 20% emission reduction target is quite simply incompatible with the science on two degrees; that we must therefore move unilaterally to make at least 30% domestic reductions now; that we must respond to new facts - just last month a leading climate scientist, James Hansen, warned that current targets are far too weak and that we must commit far more resources to helping developing countries adapt, with all the revenue from the ETS auctioning being ring-fenced for climate action."
"The good news is that the EU is uniquely well placed to take the lead on climate change and that, if we were to take up that challenge, we might also find that our own institutions are revitalised and that the EU is reconnected with the citizens it is supposed to represent."
"(PL) Mr President, for some time now I have listened with alarm to pseudo-scientific arguments put forward in the very heart of Europe."
"I refer to presentations made in this House, from which wisdom based on sound scientific evidence is supposed be disseminated to the entire world."
"In fact, however, there are just as many scientists who maintain that we are not in a position to influence climate change with the means currently available as there are scientists who maintain that we can do so."
"Imagine for a minute that the first group is right, ladies and gentlemen."
"If that is the case and we devote enormous resources to alleged climate change, thus affecting humankind's well-being, notably in Europe, we shall be condemning the nations of Europe to a steep decline in relation to other nations that will develop faster in the meantime."
"I can assure the House that the Chairman of a parliamentary committee only takes account of the opinions of one set of scientists, and if Commissioner Dimas does not refer to all known scientific work on this subject, thus allowing a myth to arise, I shall protest in the strongest terms. I shall do so because action of this sort must be taken only and exclusively on the basis of conclusive scientific evidence."
"(IT) Mr President, colleagues, my great thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, because he has worked hard and has assessed several months' work by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change under the expert chairmanship of Guido Sacconi."
"The key political point which leads me to agree with the Florenz report is the acceptance of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a body and therefore of the UN and the Bali Conference guidelines."
"Note that this is not just a scientific point, but a point of democracy; it is a forum for world democracy."
"Now the issue before us is that if Europe seeks to be a credible, driving force in the post-Kyoto agreement we must have our house in order."
"The package of measures set out must be approved within a specific period, and in line with the Bali undertakings, in other words the package must be one which abides by the commitments, as well as being transparent, in place and verified."
"It is essential that we prevent exceptions and derogations which give rise to non-credibility within Europe and in relations with others."
"We must prevent any jiggery-pokery by Member States and the business world, in other words we must be serious!"
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Pęk."
"Many eminent scientists from around the world signed the Manhattan Declaration on 4 March this year."
"Amongst other things, it states that 'there is no convincing evidence that CO2 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past, is now, or will in the future, cause catastrophic climate change'."
"Last week, another 31 000 scientists endorsed that view in the Oregon Petition."
"This is no longer the odd dissenting voice, and Nigel Lawson, a member of the House of Lords Committee on Climate Change, also agrees that the debate is not over."
"Before we commit ourselves to enormous costs by way of climate taxes, carbon trading etc. at the very time when we are being warned of a likely global economic recession, we must listen to both sides of the debate and make absolutely sure who is right."
"Mr President, for once I come to the House with good news: global warning has stopped."
"1998 was the warmest year in living memory."
"For the last 10 years global temperatures have been static or falling."
"The recent modest warming is comparable to what occurred in the medieval warm period; before that, in the Roman Optimum; and, before that, in the Holocene Optimum."
"Temperatures today are below the maxima of the last 2 000 years."
"Increasing doubts are being cast on the role of CO2."
"Since 1850, average temperatures correlate well with solar cycles but very poorly with atmospheric CO2."
"The pattern of warming, both geographically and over time, is wholly different from that predicted by computer models."
"The greenhouse models predict maximum warming in the high atmosphere, but observations show that what little warming there is is at the surface and largely a result of the urban heat-island effect."
"The greenhouse effect of CO2 is logarithmic; that is, it is a law of diminishing returns."
"In greenhouse terms, the atmosphere is already saturated with CO2 and further emissions will have little effect."
"The sea-level is rising no faster than it always has, about six to eight inches a century; the global ice mass is broadly constant; severe weather events are no more frequent than they ever were; species extinction is driven not by global warming but by loss of habitat, and especially by the drive for biofuels."
"Recent studies show that polar bears are doing very well."
"Climate hysteria is increasingly remote from reality."
"We need to rethink our policies before they do any more damage."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Harms, tank-busting is actually a positive thing in a pacifistic sense!"
"The scientific facts are well-known: the climate change that we are witnessing today has much to do with human activity."
"In that respect, the achievements of the Temporary Committee are therefore exemplary."
"What perturbs me about this report, however, is its threatening undertone."
"I am perturbed that absolutely no space is given to divergent scientific opinions."
"The fact is that whenever politics claims to be infallible, it gets something wrong."
"The report talks about heat waves of unprecedented magnitude and about species extinction of up to 70% being caused by climate change."
"It says that almost every region of the world will be adversely affected."
"These assertions are based on projections from long-term modelling, but they cannot be ascribed so simplistically to human-induced climate change alone."
"Against this background, I think it is scandalous for our Parliament that amendments tabled by Mr Březina which draw attention to precisely this situation are to be declared inadmissible. Mr President, I would ask you specifically to declare Amendment 15 admissible."
"Environmental protection is not well-served if certain opinions are suppressed simply by means of administrative procedures."
"An exaggerated threat will trigger policy measures which lead to a skewed view of political priorities."
"One example is the assertion that climate change should become a priority in development assistance."
"However, AIDS, malnutrition, malaria and earthquakes are more pressing problems today, and this is where we should be deploying our political resources."
"In Europe, too, the debate about climate change has reached a dimension which is putting social achievements at risk."
"Already, a family in Germany is paying more than 40% of the electricity price to the state, and at the petrol pumps the figure is now between 55% and 78%. The new emissions trading scheme will drive up electricity prices again by at least 30%."
"I advocate a rational approach to the issue of climate change, so that we can then identify solutions which are socially and economically compatible."
"The amendments tabled by Mr Březina would offer a number of starting points, and I would ask you for your support."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) I would like to thank Mr Florenz."
"He has produced an excellent report."
"The climate change debate is very emotional, rightly so of course."
"However, today we have to opt for a sensible approach."
"In the next few months we shall be working intensively on climate change and many ambitious measures are on the agenda."
"It is very important for Europe to demonstrate its credibility before Copenhagen and to reach agreement on the climate package."
"That can only happen if we have a common basis and that basis is knowledge."
"Mr Florenz can take credit for having set out the scientific consensus."
"The starting point for our policy is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings."
"Thousands of scientists work together in the IPCC."
"It is a fact that the earth is warming up and it is also a fact that the warming is to some extent caused by human actions."
"In order to keep climate change within the limits, we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80% before 2050."
"That is no easy task."
"There are important interests involved."
"Of course clean production can bring in a lot of profit and employment and it is also good that this way we shall end our reliance on oil and enter the world of sustainable energy."
"However, the transition to a low-CO2 economy is not easy."
"Two things are therefore important."
"Firstly, the policy must be knowledge-based and that does not mean, Mr Pieper, that the consensus in the IPCC is set in stone."
"We can expect the IPCC to be open to criticism and well-founded arguments from the sceptics, because that helps knowledge, and so our Group fully supports paragraph 10."
"The second point is that long-term public support is needed."
"To make it possible for the public to support firm measures, we are asking for the basic scientific points to be set out in a brochure available to the public, so that everyone can be aware of the challenges we face."
"That way we can deal with the challenges together."
"I expect this report by Mr Florenz to be the basis for us to take more joint action and to establish a good policy by 2009."
"(SV) Mr President, let me also congratulate Karl-Heinz Florenz on an excellent report."
"I would point out that it has very strong political and symbolic significance, which is manifested not least in the fact that the leaders of the three big political groups introduced the debate."
"We all agree with the content of the Florenz report."
"It is also written in such a way that ordinary Europeans can actually read the text and understand what we mean."
"Its clear and instructive presentation is a further positive aspect which I am keen to highlight."
"However, problems still remain which we need to discuss."
"I urge you to support the amendments relating to the sea and the 1.5° rise in sea surface temperature."
"We also need to look at questions of public health."
"We shall be addressing that in the next report."
"I expect some sound ideas to be presented in that area."
"We MEPs now have a chance to show that we are determined and serious in our commitment on these issues."
"Avril Doyle and I are both rapporteurs on emission rights trading."
"If we are all serious on the things said today ahead of the vote, then we expect strong support for the proposals we shall be putting forward in our various committees."
"Finally, I would point out that we are in the middle of preparations for the Copenhagen Conference."
"These preparations must proceed in an entirely different way, in cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission and together with the developing countries."
"There are only 18 months to go."
"(EL) Mr President, I, too, congratulate Mr Florenz on his report."
"How excellent that it should be based on the scientific findings of the competent UN committee and that it should highlight the need for more and better information for citizens."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let us move from findings to action."
"We must adapt our policies to the measures proposed by science."
"We need cleaner fuels and cleaner cars."
"We know of your struggle, Commissioner, even within the Commission, against lobbies and interests that undermine the EU's efforts to be a world leader in the fight against climate change."
"The vast majority of the European Parliament is an ally. It will support a more ambitious effort on the part of the Commission and governments because human life and the protection of the environment are of considerably greater importance than the interests of certain business circles."
"(PL) Mr President, I am not the first to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report, and I am sure I will not be the last."
"The international community recently received the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) document containing an extensive scientific study of global warming."
"We refer to it in our report and in our resolution."
"Most researchers accepted this document, namely the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. So too did the majority of the governments of the 110 countries represented on the Panel."
"Nonetheless, voices are being raised questioning the validity of the document."
"They have been heard in this House too."
"It is therefore appropriate to begin by assessing the controversy."
"Firstly, almost everyone now at least agrees that global warming is a fact, even if some corner of our planet happens to be temporarily colder than in the past."
"Due amongst other reasons to the IPCC report, it now seems to be accepted that global warming exists."
"Consequently, it is no longer so important to refer to further indications of the approaching Apocalypse linked to rising temperatures."
"On the other hand, explaining and proving the reason for the rise in temperatures is certainly necessary."
"I would ask the House to remember that the majority of scientists who have researched this problem seriously believe that responsibility for global warming rests mainly, though not exclusively, with human beings."
"This is particularly true in relation to greenhouse gas emissions."
"It would be worth devoting further effort to documenting and proving this theory."
"Research into the causes of warming should certainly continue, and this should be the main conclusion of our deliberations."
"Nonetheless, it is most important for us to bear in mind that it already seems very probable that greenhouse gases produced by human beings are the main cause of global warming, so action is therefore called for."
"That is why the European Union assumed the role of world leader in limiting emissions."
"Consequently, it is particularly important for us Europeans to achieve a global agreement on this issue in Poznań and Copenhagen."
"We must remember that we cannot save the planet on our own."
"To abandon our own actions now, however, would be unforgivable."
"We cannot abrogate our responsibility to civilisation."
"(FI) Mr President, there is well established and recognised data on climate change worldwide, and the human origins of the current global warming trend are beyond any serious scientific doubt."
"This is what Mr Florenz states in his report at the beginning of his conclusions."
"The purpose after all of drafting this interim report was specifically to establish a common basis for the final version."
"The work of the Committee and Parliament needs to be firmly anchored to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."
"There is very clear consensus in this report that the global average temperature must be stabilised so that it does not increase by more than 2°C. This is also a way to take account of the economic, ecological and social impact of climate change."
"The facts are on the table, as Mr Florenz said."
"Now it is a matter of how we understand what we read - what our reading skills are like."
"That will be evident this year when we discuss the package of laws the Commission presented to us."
"I would like particularly to stress that, as this is a matter of the ecological, economic and social impact on climate change, we should focus more on the issue of energy efficiency."
"I hope the Commission will in its future activities make a special issue of the potential for increasing energy efficiency."
"As saved energy is the cheapest energy it is also ecologically the best way of combating climate change, and so on this point I hope that there will be new proposals and stimuli from the Commission."
"Mr President, we are discussing here an excellent interim report on the scientific facts of climate change by the rapporteur of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, Karl-Heinz Florenz."
"I would like to thank him for the huge amount of work he has put into this, and all colleagues on the Temporary Committee across the House."
"For legislators to ignore the peer-reviewed opinion of the overwhelming majority of scientists in the field of climate change throughout the world would be a combustible mixture of arrogance, irresponsibility and complete dereliction of duty."
"We are the decision-makers."
"We have a democratic mandate from our citizens and on this, the most pressing issue facing the world community today, we cannot be found wanting even when, or especially when, the decisions before us are extremely challenging."
"I would urge our dear colleagues who could loosely be termed 'climate sceptics' to travel this road with us, if only on the basis of the much abused but very important concept of the precautionary principle."
"Yes, the science is complex and dynamic, but with a ratio of five to one of the scientific community supporting the case we make, we must challenge, we must question and above all we must respond - and respond adequately - to the peer-reviewed work of some of our best and brightest in the fields of climatology and meteorology."
"More than two thirds of the world's surface is covered by oceans and three quarters of the world's mega-cities are by the sea."
"More than 97% of the planet's water is contained in the oceans and fish supply the highest percentage of the world's protein consumed by humans, on which 3.5 billion people depend for their primary source of food."
"As man-made greenhouse gas emissions rise, the scientific prediction is that dramatic changes such as warmer oceans, melting of the poles, rising sea levels and ocean acidification will pose severe threats to marine ecosystems and the fishing community."
"As I put on my hat as Vice-Chairwoman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would urge that its considered views be taken on board in this interim report today."
"Two quick points: it was a serious omission not to have included members of the Committee on Fisheries on the Temporary Committee on Climate Change and, secondly, I regret that the Temporary Committee felt unable to accept the opinion of the Fisheries Committee."
"In conclusion, there is a series of amendments emphasising the scientific impact of the consequences of climate change on the world's oceans."
"I would urge colleagues to support these amendments, as Parliament's decision-making report should be as comprehensive and as integrated as possible."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by expressing my warm thanks to our rapporteur for his work."
"The report - as the previous speakers have said - relates entirely to the scientific facts concerning climate change, which were discussed in detail with world-renowned experts during the thematic meetings."
"The agriculture and forestry sector is one of the industries hardest hit by climate change and therefore has a strong interest in effective climate protection measures being adopted at global level."
"The involvement of all countries, especially the developing countries, in the post-Kyoto process is essential."
"It is also important to underline that agriculture is by no means a driver of food prices: in the price of a bread roll, for example, the wheat used to make it accounts for less than 2% of the costs."
"It is also well-known that renewable resources for crop-based fuels do not release any more CO2 than was stored during their growth, which means that they are indeed CO2-neutral."
"It has also been recognised, on the basis of sound research findings, that humans are partly responsible for climate change."
"For that reason, it is important to conduct more intensive research as well as to save energy through more efficient use."
"Let us take heart from the fact that it took 3 000 years for it to be accepted that the Earth is a globe and not flat."
"May I appeal to this Parliament to engage in serious debate which recognises that climate change is a global problem; it is a macrosocial problem which cannot be resolved by means of sectoral policies in individual EU Member States."
"A solution can only be achieved worldwide, and the European Union should certainly take a leading and mediating role in combating climate change."
"(LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his clear and unambiguous position, which, on the basis of the results of scientific studies, acknowledges that global warming is really happening and that it is caused by humans."
"We ought to remember that a few years ago many influential politicians, including leaders of certain major powers, were still trying to deny this."
"The report goes a step further and rejects, as scientifically unfounded, statements to the effect that global warming is not occurring and that these are only natural variations in temperature."
"This report once again demonstrates that the EU is a world leader with respect to global warming."
"This is no cause for elation, however."
"In order to keep global warming within the bounds of 2%, according to current estimates the volume of CO2 emissions will need to be reduced by at least half by 2050."
"In this context, the statement in the report to the effect that nearly all the EU Member States have made good progress in meeting the Kyoto targets is over-optimistic."
"In the period from 1990 to 2005 the 15 older EU Member States reduced their emissions by only 2%, and it is very unlikely that in the remaining five years they will reduce their emissions by a further 6%, in order to achieve their collective Kyoto target."
"It is only thanks to the fact that the newer EU Member States have reduced their emissions considerably more quickly that the EU as a whole can claim world leader status in this sphere."
"It is expected that the newer EU Member States will reduce their CO2 emissions by 21% by 2010."
"It is only this fact that enables the EU leaders to talk about the apparently ambitious target of reducing emissions by 20% by 2020."
"Of course, this target is to be welcomed, but it is important that the largest polluters should achieve the greater part of this reduction."
"It is not acceptable to allow the efforts of EU climate change policies to be based only on the existing achievements of the newer Member States and isolated older ones, and to place an additional burden on them, while at the same time making allowances for the largest polluters."
"Regardless of the allocation of emissions reductions among the EU Member States, however, we will not achieve anything unless worldwide agreement is reached and countries such as the United States, China, India, Russia and others are involved in solving the problem."
"This issue must be a priority in EU foreign policy and climate change policy. Thank you for your attention."
"(SL) We usually opt for changes and measures only if they are based on solid facts."
"In the Committee on Climate Change we have accumulated numerous data from many scientists."
"Most of the data indicate that the changes in eco-systems are the consequence of anthropogenic emissions and indicate possible trends for the future."
"Whilst some are concerned and use the data as a threat, we must also see the good side of it, which is that we can still act."
"However, we must act quickly, responsibly, seriously, and in a coordinated manner: inside the Union first, and then also globally."
"We can succeed with international agreements only if we are sufficiently sensitive also in relation to the problems of third countries who are preoccupied with sustainable development issues, and many even with elimination of poverty."
"An integral approach requires a change in our European heads, because until now, we have only been preoccupied with development, or primarily with the development of a low carbon society."
"However, we can reach international agreement only if we give equal consideration to both the measures to reduce emissions and the measures for modifying emissions, in order to bring them in line with the climate changes."
"My thanks to the rapporteur for an excellent report, and I expect that, in this sense, our work will continue into the next year."
"(HU) Mr President, I congratulate Mr Florenz on his outstanding report."
"The debate on the scientific basis of climate change is exceptionally important, because sadly we politicians often fail to take the facts into account, although facts are very persistent things."
"I agree with Martin Schulz that we should call a halt to the debate based on beliefs and consider the facts."
"In Hungary, for example, the groundwater level on the Hungarian Plain between the rivers Danube and Tisza has fallen by 3-4 metres over the past 30-40 years; serious desertification has occurred, meaning that scientists have taken measurements and found that desertification is 50% due to climate change and 50% due to harmful human activity."
"In short, let us give due consideration to what the scientists are saying."
"I also agree that the European Union cannot resolve this problem by itself; the USA, Japan, China, Brazil and the developing world must be partners in this undertaking."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(FI) Mr President, mankind is to blame for climate change and man can also therefore help change its direction."
"The EU's goal is to raise the amount that biofuels account for fuel for transport to 10%."
"That is a goal that must be achieved, furthermore."
"We need to do all we can to achieve it, including incorporating the use of peat as the raw material in biodiesel."
"More money is needed for research so that the most efficient methods can be employed."
"For example, some studies show that energy production from algae is up to 15 times greater per hectare than production from grapes, palm oil and soya, so more research into this is needed."
"This is therefore one way we can reduce the use of palm oil and hopefully also stop it completely as it is by no means an environmentally friendly activity."
"We therefore need to take action in collaboration with the United States of America, China, India, and Russia."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"If we want to achieve success in Copenhagen at the end of 2009, I believe there are two things we absolutely have to take into consideration, things that I myself have experienced in the course of visits to India, Bangladesh, China and California over the past few months."
"First of all, we must make a genuine effort."
"In other words, it is not enough to pat ourselves on the back; it is not enough to talk of 10 or 20 or 30 or 40%."
"According to European Environment Agency figures, not only have carbon dioxide emissions not fallen since 2000, they have in fact risen somewhat, by 1%."
"The emissions trading system (ETS) is a great success and it is currently in the process of being reformed, but I believe that it would be worthwhile initiating similar reforms in the non-ETS system; perhaps the two systems should even be consolidated."
"I vigorously support the Council proposal to set 1990 as the base year rather than 2005."
"The other very important thing is the Adaptation Fund."
"If we want to achieve success in Copenhagen, we must create the Adaptation Fund."
"The Stern report showed that unless there is an Adaptation Fund the other regions of the world have very little chance of avoiding the unpleasant consequences of climate change. Thank you."
"(RO) Climate change already affects the European Union."
"In recent years, Romania, for instance, has been affected by drought, floods and hot weather."
"Some areas in Romania's South and Southeast region have started to turn into desert."
"The Union has undertaken an important role in the fight against climate change both as regards the reduction of causes and the adjustment to climate change."
"The Lisbon Treaty includes provisions on climate change and I also appreciate here the clause of solidarity in case of natural disasters."
"Unfortunately, global governance in the field of environmental protection is decentralized and sometimes the coherence of overall decisions is lacking; 18 multilateral institutions are responsible with monitoring approximately 500 international agreements, of which 300 at regional level."
"The European Union has to have the role of leader in this field."
"There are solutions."
"We need coherent actions on climate change, more ecological transport, research and development programmes, to adapt agriculture to adequate water consumption, reforestation and, especially, better waste management."
"I congratulate the Rapporteur."
"(SK) Climate change has serious implications, not only for ecosystems, but also for the economy, public health, water and food security, as well as migration."
"The latest scientific studies lead to the conviction that human activity too has contributed to the global warming trend and therefore the onus is on our society to implement effective political measures."
"I welcome the interim report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change and its recommendations on the EU's future integrated policy on climate change, and I strongly support the notion that the global average temperature increase should be limited to not more than 2°C. In addition to that, the European Union should make the effort to reduce emissions in a way that would keep the temperatures well below this two-degree cut-off point. Making scientifically proven information available to the public and so contributing to increased public awareness on this issue should be an important instrument in climate change mitigation policies."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, let me first welcome the interim report on the scientific facts of climate change."
"I am particularly glad because it emphasises the fact that scientists agree on the seriousness of this problem. The report also brings out the major impact of the human factor, especially energy, on climate change."
"The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC states that world CO2 emissions increased by about 80% between 1970 and 2004, and that these increases were due mainly to the use of fossil fuels."
"Given that there is an undeniably close link between the climate and energy planning, I should like to point out how necessary it is to create an integrated plan at European level so that we know what the most advisable and effective energy choices might be."
"Mr President, listening to the debate this morning I feel the need to make a couple of comments."
"First of all, the scientific evidence."
"There is no doubt that establishing the presence of global warming and its causation is a very complicated business."
"This is not a test-tube situation where an experiment can be done in a laboratory to prove something one way or the other."
"The evidence is based on long-term observations and very complicated procedures and of course there are some doubters, some scientists who have a different opinion."
"This is not new."
"Scientists are well known for differing in their opinions: let us not forget that even the causation of cancer by smoking has been doubted extensively by many scientists and they are still doubting it today."
"We all know of course what the truth is."
"The same of course has happened with thalidomide and the causation of phocomelia in human embryos."
"The second point is that emphasis should be placed on a global approach because we all know that the countries which pollute the most, i.e. the USA, China and India, are doing the least about combating global warming."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I have followed with great interest your very lively discussion, which was a very good basis for the interim report provided by the rapporteur, Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, for which I thank him, and congratulate him on it."
"Your discussion was such that it would benefit any parliament."
"It was very involved; I understood it as a positive criticism, since every opinion is precious, including a critical one."
"From your discussion I can summarise two basic conclusions."
"The European Union is and will remain a force capable of facing up to ... of course, in cooperation with all its global partners, to continue pushing for a serious confrontation on climate changes."
"And another conclusion, that the climate change is not just a problem, but it can also be an opportunity."
"However, we can deal with it effectively primarily by acting at a global level."
"I should also like to say that, within the climate and energy bundle, the European Union is successfully and thoroughly preparing all those measures with which we can effectively counter the consequences of the climate change."
"The transition to a safe and sustainable low carbon economy will influence numerous policies including the economy and people's everyday lives."
"Coordinated political measures are required in numerous areas of the European Union."
"This is where I would support your thoughts, that we have to stick together, not just concerning global decisions, but also to be unanimous regarding the details connected with these political measures."
"I should particularly like to mention the synergies between climate change and energy."
"In this respect, harmonious European and national policies must be created in the area of research, development and innovations; we must encourage a sustainable transport system, enabling the member States to adopt the necessary measures in fighting climate change; we must improve energy efficiency, particularly that in buildings, as well as other sources of energy in all sectors, and keep informing consumers about the efficient use of energy, in order to reduce the social implications and also to make the most of new opportunities."
"As has already been mentioned in Mr Florenz's report, the science on climate change is well established and recognised, and the fact that the current global warming is a consequence of human activity is scientifically irrefutable."
"Allow me to briefly comment on your differing views on the scientific framework of the IPCC."
"On this matter I am in favour of respecting the field of politics."
"The European Parliament is an eminent political arena."
"Of course we should also respect the field of science, which is, however, committed to the ethical principles of research and scientific accuracy."
"At the same time we should not forget the space of the citizen, the ordinary man, who will be affected by individual measures in terms of quality of his life, including when he is working out his family budget and planning his future."
"I would particularly like to say that it seems important that the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, has, according to Mr Sacconi, been doing well and discussed climate change issues in a positive atmosphere during their sessions, and also that it has, by a large majority, adopted an interim report on scientific facts concerning climate change."
"We particularly welcome the European Parliament's decision to extend the mandate to the Temporary Committee on Climate Change to February 2009."
"Mr President, we see this as a particular additional proof that in the sphere of climate change the European Parliament supports the ambitious policy of the European Union at an international level with its actions, taking care that its political decisions are backed with the latest scientific results."
"We are also pleased with the announcement in today's debate that the debate on the climate change bundle will follow, which should mean a serious fulfilment of the commitments made by the European Council in March 2008."
"Mr President, I thank all the speakers in today's debate for their very interesting interventions."
"In particular, let me point out that the EU, either as the EU-15 or the EU-27, will meet the Kyoto target, and there is no doubt about that."
"Since I will be or hope to be a commissioner for another 18 months, I assure you that there is no way we can fail to achieve the Kyoto target."
"I say this because the measures we have already taken, and are taking now, ensure that the Kyoto target will be met."
"Now this is the least we should do in the coming years. For the record, the figures you supplied earlier are correct."
"It has to be said that the EU is reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, while other countries such as the United States are increasing them, and at a significantly faster rate than in 1990."
"In 2005, as you said, we were 2% below the 1990 level, and in 2006 a little short of 3% for the 15 EU countries, which have a collective target. However, as the EU-27, our success is ever greater, as we are roughly 8% below the 1990 level."
"At the end of the period the Kyoto Protocol has given us to fulfil our obligations, the EU-15 will be at least 8% below, and the EU-27 at least 11% below the 1990 level."
"Let us note that our decrease of just over 8% is very positive because it will help us to achieve the target for 2020 and beyond."
"According to the interim report, scientific findings will play an important role in international negotiations because they will allow us to take bold measures."
"They will serve as a basis for assessing the suitability of the proposals to be tabled for negotiation during the run-up to the Copenhagen Conference."
"The resolution reminds us of the dangers involved in uncontrolled climate change, which will affect human society in a variety of ways and will seriously impact our economies and cultural traditions."
"The resolution quite rightly emphasises how important it is to avoid major disruptions to the climate, such as the drying-up of the Amazon tributaries and the collapse of large volumes of ice at both Poles."
"I think it is equally important to highlight the likely consequences of climate change in terms of international security, food and water shortages, and disputes over control of resources and over movements of migrants."
"Pressure is steadily increasing on the international community because of environmental emergencies resulting from extreme weather conditions and violent conflicts caused by climate change."
"The recent food price crisis is the most palpable example to date of what may happen: reduced harvests in many parts of the world are caused by extreme weather conditions."
"Unfortunately, this situation does not appear to be temporary or exceptional; it is set to become integral and recurrent and cannot be controlled without drastic changes to agricultural policy and farming practice."
"Allow me here to mention some other topics raised in the report."
"I will start with the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through suitable action at national level in developing countries."
"There is a need for the support and prospects offered by technology."
"There must be funding to transfer technology and enhance the administrative capacities of these countries so that the reductions in question can be measured, recorded and verified."
"This idea is at the core of the Bali Action Plan negotiations."
"As was noted in Bali, any move on the part of the developing countries will depend not only on serious commitments by the developed countries to reduce emissions, but also on substantial efforts on the part of those countries to provide funding, especially for the transfer of technology and creation of the necessary administrative capacity."
"It is important for the EU to take advantage of every opportunity for dialogue with the main developing countries, so that there is agreement on what exactly this means and how the EU can support such actions, either through cooperation in formulating policy, technical assistance, the transfer of know-how and the provision of incentives on the CO2 market, or through financial assistance."
"There are measures to be taken in all sectors, including action on emissions from energy use, and forest depletion."
"I will turn now to the scientific aspect of this discussion. The Commission fully agrees that scientific findings should be made known to the general public."
"Consumers should be prepared and made more aware of how much greenhouse gas is generated by their lifestyle and consumer habits."
"This increased alerting of the public should, however, be accompanied by strong financial incentives for companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions arising from the products and services they provide."
"A transition to a low-CO2 economy is necessary on a global scale. This can be achieved only through systematic, coordinated measures to reduce emissions in all sectors."
"The package of measures on climate change and energy now at the co-decision stage gives us a head start in the transition."
"It also enables us to show that an ambitious climate policy is both feasible and of broader benefit to our economies and societies."
"We shall continue our highly constructive cooperation on this important package of policy measures and shall reach an agreement, I hope, as soon as possible this year."
"To conclude, let me congratulate the European Parliament on its important contribution to the effort to combat climate change, and salute Mr Florenz for his excellent work."
"I hope Parliament will continue in this constructive manner. May our cooperation and exchange of views continue, both on the package of measures on climate and energy, and on the international negotiations in the run-up to Poznań and Copenhagen."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, many thanks for your closing words which are very encouraging."
"I think that we have been able to identify a consensus here in the House, and this consensus naturally obliges us to undertake further scientific studies and to eliminate the remaining doubts, for after all, in which area of human knowledge is there no room for doubt?"
"That is something which, as rapporteur, I certainly want to see happen."
"I am grateful for the praise which has kindly been expressed today, and I would like to pass it on to the staff behind the scenes who worked extremely hard on this report."
"Let me take this opportunity to voice my warm thanks to them once again."
"Listening to today's debate might give the impression that we are arguing over CO2."
"Let me say this: we will have many other issues to argue about, for CO2 emissions are just the tip of the iceberg."
"Yes, they are a serious issue, there is no doubt about that, but the real challenge is how we deal with our sustainability strategies."
"How should we care for our planet Earth, which we hold in trust for our children?"
"The energy sources that we are currently burning up took many millions of years to create, and we are squandering them in just a thousand years or so."
"The challenge, then, is how to make a litre of fuel go twice as far as it does at present."
"That is what we need to achieve, and then we will have fulfilled our task."
"That is the major challenge ahead: increasing efficiency in Europe, developing state-of-the-art technologies, using these technologies at home - that goes without staying - and also selling them profitably worldwide in order to create jobs."
"That is our opportunity, as I see it, and I would ask all of you to help us seize this opportunity with both hands."
"Let me reiterate my thanks to everyone, but with an eye to the Rules of Procedure, I would like to draw your attention to one last point."
"From the very start of this debate, there has been a dire mistake in the translation of Article 10 which says that I condemn something."
"That is not at all in my nature."
"I may disapprove of one thing and another, but I never condemn anything."
"I shall not mince my words: I think it is important to point out that there is a problem with bad translation in the House, which is evident throughout this entire report, and I would like to draw your attention to the correctly phrased amendments in this area which have been tabled in the House."
"I would like to thank everyone involved and invite you to work with us on the next and more difficult stage in this process, namely resolving the question of how we should now respond to these scientific facts."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - To successfully tackle climate change, markets need to adapt so they reflect the environmental cost of carbon."
"Polluters must pay."
"We must use every type of policy instrument including VAT reductions, emissions trading, and subsidies to change the behaviour of consumers and businesses so they have more incentives to take eco-friendly options."
"As Sir Nicholas Stern has pointed out, the economic and social costs of climate change will be catastrophic."
"Therefore, I strongly disagree with those in the House who deny climate change."
"They only need to look at the increasing number and frequency of natural disasters worldwide to see its impact."
"These disasters are clearly a wake-up call for us to take greater action."
"The EU has a legitimate role in tackling climate change and it needs to set an example and provide guidance to other countries."
"We need greater dialogue with emerging economies India and China to ensure that their growth contributes less to global emissions than EU and US's has done over the last century."
"There is a strong case for technology transfer from the EU to developing countries so they can avoid carbon intensive industrial development and leapfrog directly to a low carbon economy."
"in writing. - (HU) It is absolutely vital to take into account the facts of climate change based on the scientific evidence when making decisions in this regard."
"After all, the risk of taking the wrong decisions based on mistaken conclusions is at least as great as the risk of inaction."
"One thing is worth noting here: climate change is a fact that can be substantiated scientifically, and rapid and effective measures are urgently needed to remedy it."
"Sober consideration of the scientific facts can also help us to assess how market-based environmental protection instruments can contribute to enhancing the quality of the environment."
"In our opinion, greater effort is needed on the part of the Member States to popularise market-friendly incentives."
"The creation of the emissions trading system, which approaches the issue of emissions reduction on the basis of market mechanisms, is a welcome development."
"The fact that the system works is proof that the market, competition and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive ideas."
"In Hungary there are many examples that demonstrate how mistaken conclusions can result in wrong decisions being made."
"Biomass production in reality means burning timber; the harmful consequences of forced support for biofuels are becoming increasingly apparent."
"The measures put in place in these two areas do not meet sustainability requirements, and besides, they fail to offer a market-friendly response to the problem."
"We would like to stress that climate change calls for measures to be initiated that not only take into account the scientific evidence, but also allow market mechanisms to play a role."
", in writing. - (FI) Mr President, our resolution on the scientific facts of climate change contains some important observations which it is difficult to disagree with."
"It nevertheless needs to be said that it also contains some irritating remarks."
"There are examples of these in the history of science which should serve as a warning."
"As a philosopher I do not regard it as entirely harmless for a politician to interpret scientific results, draw hasty conclusions from them and try and control them, let alone 'condemn' some other interpretations."
"What is the point of this and why must such things be stated as a general rule?"
"This is a matter of our credibility, something we are going to need badly in our fight against climate change."
"In point 5 it says that it is scientifically 'proven' that man is the main cause of climate change."
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change at no stage claims that."
"The report talks of probabilities."
"Man's contribution to warming over the last decade is a strong probability."
"Point 7 stresses that scientific results 'clearly demonstrate how climate change will occur in the near future, following different regional patterns.'"
"That is precisely what we do not know."
"Last week, in their declaration at Reading, climate simulators appealed for a need for supercomputers."
"The question of what sort of regional effects climate change will have cannot be answered by meteorologists at present, partly due to insufficient computer capacity."
"Point 8 mentions that the deglaciation of Greenland and of the west Antarctic ice sheet are examples of tipping points of climate change."
"Data on deglaciation is very contradictory at present, however, because the thickness of the ice in core areas of Greenland and the Antarctic is actually increasing."
"Neither would I accuse or condemn climate change sceptics and critics, as is the case in point 10."
"Politicians especially should not do so either: they should leave the matter for the scientists to debate."
", in writing. - (RO) CLIM can make recommendations and provide solutions for the future policies of the European Union in the field, recommendations and solutions based on clear scientific proof and, especially, on the firm support of the European citizens."
"The scientific proof is unquestionable."
"Karl-Heinz Florenz' report is exhaustive, proving that scientific data are sufficient in order to make firm political decisions and initiate concrete actions not only at European level, but also at a global level, for drastically reducing the anthropic phenomena responsible for the climate change and mitigate their effects."
"The research efforts must be continued, especially in the field of new technologies, renewable energy and biofuels, in order to find the necessary balance for maintaining economic competitiveness, social development and ensure food and energy security, which are essential for European citizens' wellbeing."
"The scientific community and political representatives should join forces and support the activities of raising public opinion awareness and stimulating the participation of citizens in concrete activities, because the exchange of good practice, international, regional and, in particular, cross-border cooperation and dialogue, as well as direct involvement of citizens represent the most efficient means of fighting against climate change."
", in writing. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years the European Union has been one of the international actors that has shown the way in the development of a sustainable global climate policy."
"This is a position the EU must retain in the future too."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee for a successful report."
"It will serve to strengthen the view of the scientific basis which work to control climate change must rest on."
"It is worth noting that science and the knowledge it brings is continually changing as a result of new technologies and findings."
"Accordingly, we must remain open to all information on this phenomenon and, furthermore, respect differing opinions."
"It is extremely important to react decisively to climate change."
"Until now, each of the four intergovernmental panels has had to review its predecessor's estimates of the speed at which climate change is taking place."
"The phenomenon has progressed faster than the Community's earlier estimates for it."
"Now too there appears to be a need to review the previous IPCC's estimates."
"Studies by the US space agency NASA show that the control of climate change will call for more radical action: the gas content in the atmosphere caused by climate change must be restricted more stringently to be able to avoid these radical changes."
"The EU needs to take account of the growing scientific consensus that carbon dioxide emissions should be cut more dramatically to slow down global warming, as the IPCC recommended."
"Having looked closely at this development, I fear that the targets in the EU's climate package are not ambitious enough."
"The Union now needs to make far more determined efforts to establish eco-effective societies in the Union."
"Eco-modernisation must be the guiding principle for all the EU's policy areas."
"The ability to change in the face of this revolution will also be the main factor affecting the EU's international competitiveness."
", in writing. - (ET) The climate is changing and it is doing so because of human activity."
"Forty years ago, when I took ice samples at the Antarctic research station, we were as yet unaware of that fact."
"Today the IPCC, which collates the work of thousands of scientists, has provided sufficient proof that climate change is happening, and our job is to act rather than to continue to provide proof."
"On that point I am in full agreement with the approach taken by the rapporteur, Mr Florenz."
"The European Union must be ambitious and adopt a target closer to a 30% reduction in greenhouse emissions by the year 2020."
"Otherwise the matter will be complicated in anticipation of genuine contributions from other countries."
"It is odd that a higher forum votes unanimously on the detail of general targets but when it comes to targets for the content of CO2 emissions in car exhausts or several other specific measures it no longer ventures to be so ambitious."
"This is not how to tackle climate change effectively."
"I support the proposals for amendments which focus attention on the need to make more detailed studies and models of the situation of the oceans and seas and the influence of climate change on fish fauna."
"I am, however, unable to agree with several of the proposals for amendments in which doubts are expressed as to whether climate change is really happening, the importance of fossil fuels and nuclear energy is emphasised and the development of renewable energy is ridiculed."
"I believe that Parliament's Temporary Committee on Climate Change has helped to raise awareness among representatives of different walks of life and to set out a common position."
"As a compromise the extension of the Committee's mandate for nine months until the Poznan meeting is reasonable."
"A longer deadline might have meant our doing important work with too much of an eye on elections."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report."
"The debate about climate change, which is urgently required, must be underpinned by sound scientific facts."
"These are provided by Mr Florenz's interim report."
"This report should play an important role both in the public arena and in the Commission and the Council."
"Scientific findings on the 'greenhouse effect' have been available for more than 180 years."
"It was due to specific social conditions that this knowledge about the threat to our natural and climatic bases of life was ignored, preventing timely action and continuing to do so today."
"Either we start acting now on the basis of international cooperation to limit further damage and avert the disasters that are predicted and which will impact with full force on the world's poorest people first, or we continue along the road to destruction."
"The facts convincingly demonstrate that prompt action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is required, and that we must limit warming to less than 2°C through changes in our lifestyles and consumer behaviour and through the adoption of political and social criteria and frameworks. I support the rapporteur's assertion that it is not a matter of arguing over emissions values; now, the debate must focus on sustainability."
"The EU Sustainable Development Strategy must take account of these problems and finally establish policies on a sustainable basis."
"This requires a change in political priorities."
"Every day lost is potentially devastating and cannot be justified."
"Turkey's 2007 progress report (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Turkey's 2007 progress report."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, since the last report on Turkey there have been a number of positive developments in that country."
"I am thinking of the passing of the Law on Foundations and, even more recently, the first modification of Article 301 which must lead to further reforms that are necessary to guarantee full freedom of expression."
"However, it is also clear that Turkey presents a mixed picture and that much more needs to be done, not just to comply with the agreements with Europe, but also to fulfil promises to its own people."
"This report is balanced."
"I hope that some hobbyhorses that are being ridden will not get anywhere, because then the report will remain balanced."
"I have mentioned all the problems in the report and there are three important messages."
"Firstly, we are concerned about the implications of the AK Party case before the court."
"We expect the Constitutional Court to respect the principles of the rule of law, European standards and the Venice Commission guidelines on the prohibition of political parties."
"We welcome the fact that in 2007 democracy triumphed over attempts by the army to disrupt the political process."
"However, we are also concerned that there are still forces at work that are trying to destabilise the country."
"Clearly modernisation of the country and reforms are now needed."
"Prime Minister Erdoğan has promised that 2008 will be the year of reforms and we shall be pleased to hold him to that."
"The government now has to use the substantial parliamentary majority to set about reforms with determination; reforms that are vital if Turkey is to be turned into a modern and prosperous democracy based on a secular state and a pluralistic society and reform that is first and foremost in the best interests of the Turkish people themselves."
"A third point. The constitutional process is an ideal opportunity to draw up a new civilian constitution, with the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at its heart."
"That is the only way to establish a system of checks and balances to safeguard democracy, the rule of law, social cohesion and the separation between religion and the state."
"When you look at recent figures, they show that maintenance of the separation of religion and state causes tensions in Turkish society."
"However, as many as 72% of well-educated Turks have concerns about the secular nature of Turkey, 60% of citizens in all the large cities and almost 50% of other Turkish citizens."
"That unease is seized upon by the judiciary and the prosecutors who use their scope to disregard a parliamentary majority and operate very independently."
"A judicial system in a state under the rule of law should be independent but also impartial."
"The new constitution is the only way in which the Turkish Government can reform the country and establish the separation of religion and state and a state under the rule of law, in order to gain new public trust."
"That requires a guarantee of wide participation by all civil society bodies in the constitutional process."
"To me, that means reaching agreement on modernisation with all political parties, ethnic and religious minorities and social partners."
"Modernisation must ensure that the individual rights of citizens, citizens' freedoms, are brought into line with the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"With respect, we must continue the negotiations between EU and Turkey, but also without hypocrisy, so that we can be open and honest with each other."
"I find it very unfortunate that my colleague, Mr Lagendijk, is attacked when he says openly and honestly where mistakes have been made and when he also asks for cooperation by all political parties in the reform process."
"To summarise, Mr President, there is still a great deal to be done on the position of religious minorities in Turkey, the position of the Kurds and other minorities, the socio-economic development of the regions, improvements in the position of women, the dialogue between the Turkish Government and social partners, in which I particularly call attention to the trade union movement which is often under pressure, constructive cooperation in a solution to the Cyprus question and good neighbourliness in the region."
"In short, please comply with the arrangements that have been made."
"Mr President, I stress again that, in my opinion, only a society that allows itself to be led by respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and that is based on democracy, the rule of law and a socially orientated market economy can develop into a peaceful, stable and prosperous society."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me first thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and the Foreign Affairs Committee for a very solid, firm and balanced report."
"In the accession negotiations with Turkey six chapters have been opened so far and, as Mr Lenarčič said, it should be possible to open two more chapters during the Slovenian presidency, namely company law and intellectual property."
"Let me recall in this context one simple but absolutely fundamental guiding principle of the EU enlargement policy, which applies to every candidate country, including Turkey: the pace of negotiations depends on the progress made in legal and democratic reforms - and especially on their implementation."
"In other words, the technical talks on chapters make up the walls and rooms of the house - maybe even the roof one day - while the legal and democratic reforms constitute the very foundations of any new EU member's construction."
"And, as every builder knows, one must first make very solid foundations before moving on to putting the walls together."
"So, first the reforms, then progress in the technical negotiations."
"That is why I find Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report so pertinent."
"The Commission shares her views on the slow pace of the reforms."
"Yet certain legislative reforms have taken place."
"I note that you welcome the new Law on Foundations, and at your request the Commission will report on this law and its implementation in our next progress report on Turkey in the coming autumn."
"Moreover, the recent revision of the infamous Article 301 is a step forward."
"What ultimately counts, however, is its proper implementation to guarantee the freedom of expression for everybody in Turkey."
"In addition to the fundamental freedoms of expression and religion, further progress is essential in such areas as cultural and linguistic rights, the rights of women and children, and the rights of trade unions."
"All in all, a renewed focus on EU-related reforms is absolutely essential, which should also assist in overcoming the current political crisis."
"This is the message President Barroso conveyed during our recent visit to Turkey."
"Both government and opposition parties should engage in dialogue and search for compromise on the sensitive issues dominating the domestic debate, including the constitutional reform process."
"Both secularism and democracy need to be defended in this context."
"I regret that the Law on the Ombudsman has been blocked for two years by the Constitutional Court."
"I welcome the fact that you urge it to be unblocked, so as to set up the Ombudsman's Office without delay."
"We all know how important the Ombudsman's function has been in keeping authorities accountable and enhancing citizens' rights in the EU Member States."
"The essence of these reforms is to ensure Turkey's transformation into an open and modern society, with full respect for freedom and democracy, diversity and tolerance - that is, for democratic secularism."
"The very existence of our Union rests on the basic values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights that we share among ourselves."
"They are the basis of the family spirit and the contract of marriage, as Jacques Delors put it, to which we Europeans have committed ourselves."
"The Negotiating Framework with Turkey spells out these values, and it is the Commission's duty to monitor them."
"The Commission's role in the accession process can be described as 'the friend who tells the truth' - even if the truth is sometimes unwelcome in parts of the EU or in Turkey."
"Thus we cannot be indifferent to what is happening in candidate countries, least of all to events that affect our shared democratic values."
"I note your concern about the implications of the AKP closure case."
"Certainly, the ruling of the Constitutional Court should be compatible with democratic principles and the rule of law, including the guidelines of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe."
"We want to see Turkey move on from this case by respecting European values."
"Turkey cannot afford another wasted year on reforms and we need to see progression, not regression, in meeting democratic principles."
"Let me wind up with a few words on Cyprus."
"Now it is time for the leaders of the two communities to end the deadlock and move towards reunification of the island."
"I trust Turkey will fully contribute to a solution."
"The Commission endorses a renewed UN process and will fully support both communities on the island to make the necessary difficult compromises."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (NL) Important social and employment legislation has recently been passed in Turkey."
"One important objective is to bring more women into the labour market, because participation in the economy is badly needed to strengthen the position of women."
"It does not need to be said that women's rights are human rights."
"It is important for women to be able to claim fundamental rights as well as gender and reproductive rights and not be the victims of such vague criteria as 'against public decency'. That is also essential for gay organisations."
"Instruments are badly needed in Turkey to monitor that and introduce gender mainstreaming."
"I would therefore like to see a women's rights committee in the Turkish Parliament, with full legislative powers."
"Local elections will be taking place in Turkey next year."
"Nationally, the number of female members of parliament has doubled, but more needs to be done."
"Local turnout is still less than 1%, an enormous challenge if the fair representation of women in politics is now to become a reality."
"Madam President, let me first congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her report and also her cooperation throughout this time."
"The report sends a clear message to Turkey that its path towards Europe and its ultimate entry into the European family will pass through the following stages."
"Firstly, it must continue to strengthen reforms in all its sectors and structures."
"Secondly, it must show complete and absolute respect for human rights and the rights of minorities."
"Thirdly, Turkish troops must withdraw from Cyprus, and there must be a contribution towards a fair and lasting solution to the Cyprus issue."
"Now is the time for all of us to lend our support to President Christofias's initiatives in this direction."
"Fourthly, Turkey must maintain good neighbourly relations in general, and with Greece in particular."
"This means that violations of the Flight Information Region must stop, as must provocations of all kinds."
"Of course, there are forces in Turkey wanting destabilisation, whereas some Turkish citizens hope for a more democratic, progressive, developed, environmentally conscious, socially aware, peace-loving and Europe-oriented Turkey."
"These citizens need to be given the message that their struggles are not in vain, and this is what Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report achieves, as does the discussion we are holding here today."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the very fruitful and constructive cooperation."
"On behalf of my Group, I would also like to express our solidarity with Mr Lagendijk: we reject all the unfair attacks against him."
"I would like to confine myself to one key issue, namely the threatened ban on two parties, the AKP and the DTP."
"In both cases, we want to make it very clear that these bans would be completely unacceptable to us and would constitute major impediments to Turkey's progress towards becoming a member of the European Union."
"It is unfathomable, in our understanding of democracy, that a court should simply deny numerous voters the right, after the fact, to influence the political situation in their country by casting their vote for their preferred party."
"This is unacceptable in the case of the governing party, and it is unacceptable, too, in the case of the Democratic Society Party (DTP)."
"There are fundamental legal and democratic principles at stake which militate against such a course of action."
"As regards the DTP, instead of taking the opportunity to talk to representatives of the Kurdish people and enter into dialogue, because - together with the Turks - we reject terrorism, an attempt is under way to ban this party as well."
"I know that not everyone in the DTP is prepared to engage in dialogue."
"In that case, an approach simply has to be made in order to develop this dialogue appropriately."
"We therefore call unequivocally on all the moderate forces in Turkey to do their utmost to ensure that these two parties can continue to operate in Turkey's political landscape."
"We know that this is a protracted and open-ended process, but it must have a goal, and this goal must be accession."
"It is a goal which, in the European Union, we must do our utmost to achieve, in communication with our citizens."
"However, Turkey too must do its utmost, by carrying out the reforms that are required."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I too would like to start by expressing warm thanks to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the good cooperation, which was just as constructive this time as it was last autumn."
"Substantial consensus is a characteristic of this report."
"The parliamentary groups agree that Turkey must continue to make ongoing improvements of its own accord, but must do so far more rapidly than before."
"We also agree that this is something that we can, and indeed, must expect from an accession candidate."
"We also believe that the reforms must be pursued despite the major domestic political crisis."
"I would like to take up a point which Mr Swoboda has just made: the European Union is not party to this prohibition process."
"Commissioner Rehn is right to say that secularism and democracy must be defended; otherwise, like Mr Swoboda, I can see us facing a fundamental democratic problem which will place great strain on the accession negotiations."
"What is important to note is that many of the problems that we are talking about have existed for some time, so only a few points need to be emphasised here."
"Last year, we welcomed the fact that the Turkish Government had received a clear and unequivocal mandate for further reforms."
"We called for this mandate to be utilised in order to genuinely drive forward the reforms."
"We welcome the adoption of the Law on Foundations."
"That is a positive step, but on balance, we must say - and I think there is unanimity here as well - that we are all disappointed, overall, by what has been achieved."
"Let us take the constitutional reform: this is overshadowed by the headscarf debate to such an extent that no real progress has been made on the fundamental renewal of Turkey's constitution."
"The headscarf debate is also an issue of freedom of religion and freedom of opinion, but it must not be used for the cultural oppression of women who espouse secular attitudes."
"Another important issue, especially for the Liberal Group, is freedom of speech."
"The so-called reform of Article 301 is unsatisfactory from our perspective."
"I have spoken to many people in Turkey itself and, there too, very few people believe that this reform of Article 301 is serious and well-founded, especially as it is now a symbolic paragraph."
"There are many other paragraphs in the Penal Code which restrict freedom of speech. I do not want to list them all, but there is still a great deal of work to do here."
"Another point which I would briefly like to mention concerns relations with Turkey within the EU and NATO frameworks."
"We wish to stress that we expect Turkey to show a positive attitude towards European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) missions."
"We understand the difficulties that exist."
"Nonetheless, we expect an accession candidate to show a European spirit when the security of European personnel in missions such as EUPOL and EULEX is at stake."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Ladies and gentlemen, as you have probably seen, in the last couple of weeks the Commissioner and I have come in for a great deal of criticism from certain circles in Turkey."
"It is claimed that we do not understand Turkey properly, that we do not really realise what is going on in Turkey."
"I must admit, sometimes there are a number of things in Turkey that I do not understand."
"For instance, I cannot understand that many people in Turkey have no problem with the fact that the governing party, which won 47% of the votes in the last elections, is in danger of being banned by the Constitutional Court."
"What I also do not understand is that the Council of Europe recommendations on the prohibition of political parties were so easily passed over, because it is clear that the case against the AKP in no way meets the criteria."
"What I also do not understand is that it is so easily overlooked that, by banning the AKP and the DTP, about 90% of votes in the south-east were declared invalid, with all that that entails."
"What I also do not understand is that so much fuss was made in Turkey about the Commissioner and I criticising the fact that, in our opinion, a political case is one that, if it leads to the banning of the governing party, will really have serious consequences."
"In my view, it is our duty to say that and we should continue doing so."
"However, there are other things I do not understand."
"What I do not understand is why it was impossible for the authorities to allow the trade unions to demonstrate peacefully in Istanbul on 1 May, even in Taksim Square, such a symbolic place since 1977."
"What I also do not really understand is why it was impossible for the authorities to distinguish between rioters and trade unions seeking to exercise their democratic rights."
"I also do not understand why so much excessive violence was necessary against peaceful demonstrators and innocent passers-by."
"I shall end by expressing the hope that this Parliament will continue, as in this report, to encourage reforms, but also to criticise the government and the opposition if these do not take place, in a way that I would describe as clear, explicit, with respect for each other's views, but without taboos."
"I firmly believe that, if that happens, we in Turkey and the European Union will in the end understand each other better."
