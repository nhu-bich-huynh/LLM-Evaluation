"In this sense, I welcome the Commission's brave attempt to find a way to close the competitive gap that clearly exists between EU and non-EU e-business."
"But what we have to ask, and what our committee asked, was: is this the right way to do it?"
"Our opinion was very clearly that it is not."
"I was always told that one of the first rules or principles of a legislator should be: do not make law you cannot enforce."
"This was our committee's major concern."
"It may not be enough to rely on the good will of enterprises outside our reach."
"The good guys will comply, the bad ones will still be bad, and consumers may well use them in their search for a good deal."
"What else could we be doing here?"
"There is much talk about setting up business models for e-commerce regulation, but that is a wider issue and should be dealt with in a much more transparent way."
"There are underlying assumptions in this proposal about the place of taxation which could store up problems for the future in an international context."
"We may have something to learn from America, where they have, of course, imposed a moratorium on such e-tax."
"In short, the aim of this proposal is correct but the method is misconceived and if we really want to encourage Europe's e-economy, a right signal would be zero rate VAT for our own e-business rather than trying to impose our problems on others."
"Mr President, I am speaking in the capacity of draftsman of the opinion of my committee about the taxation of aircraft fuel."
"While road transport pays a hefty fuel tax, commercial aviation is exempt from this."
"The directive concerned provides for the possibility, in future, of amending or abolishing this exemption, based on external costs and environmental damage."
"For the time being, bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries are precluding a levy on kerosene for international flights."
"A levy on aviation is of crucial importance, both on account of the 'polluter-pays' principle and equal competitive conditions for various modes of transport."
"The efforts of the members of the ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, should therefore be geared towards opening up this possibility, for which an opportunity will arise next autumn during the 33rd general meeting."
"For a variety of reasons, such as noise pollution, air pollution and energy consumption, the discouragement of shorter flights, certainly domestic flights, deserves much attention."
"As and when the train offers an equivalent alternative on an increasing number of routes, this alternative can be promoted."
"I am thrilled by the fact that, partly thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a number of important elements are once again brought to the fore in the report. Due to events occurring at the time, these elements met with less than adequate support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"The fact that fuel for road transport is about three times more expensive than aircraft fuel, is striking, to say the least."
"Add to this the unruly increase in the number of flights, including short-haul flights, and the question arises as to where all of this will end."
"In business and leisure travel alike, people must be able to choose on the basis of honest competitive conditions."
"But at the same time, people, including those who never fly, are entitled to expect noise, air and other pollution to be kept down to an absolute minimum."
"Plenty of reason, therefore, to take a close look at whether aviation is carrying its external costs and not prejudicing the train or bus owing to unfair competition."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I would like to say that, as regards taxation of aircraft fuel, I am pleased by the reaction from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"They have, on the whole, taken on board the arguments that I have presented."
"Aircraft are currently the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases."
"It is estimated that around 5 percent come from aeroplanes."
"The number of flights is also expected to double in around 15 years."
"If we are to be able to live up to the requirements for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases we must take every measure possible to limit them."
"An example of such a measure is to make more use of financial instruments of control."
"As Mr Van Dam has also said, aircraft fuel should therefore not be exempt from tax."
"The Commission' s communication states that the effect is so small that it is not worth doing anything about it."
"I object to this line of reasoning."
"Aviation is a fast growing sector."
"If the effect is small today, it will, in any case, be larger tomorrow."
"This kind of reasoning is dangerous because it can easily lead to a situation in which no one does anything anywhere."
"We must start at one end."
"We cannot have the present structure and the present technology and at the same time achieve the environmental objectives."
"We must either change the structure or the technology or both."
"I think that the fairest thing from the point of view of the different transport sectors and also from the point of view of competition is for us to lead the way and introduce aircraft fuel tax within the EU."
"At the same time, however, we must pursue the line of revising the Chicago Convention of 1944 so that we establish a different system in the international area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to address the question of the taxation of electronic services and to clarify the nature of the problem."
"When goods are traded electronically across borders, VAT is levied as a matter of course."
"When an item physically crosses the national border, unless that item can be transferred electronically, VAT is levied."
"The question arising here is whether VAT is levied when such items are the subject of a service which is provided electronically."
"Even in these cases, we have many instances in which VAT is already levied."
"If the transaction takes place within the European Union between two Member States, VAT is levied."
"I am told that, when transactions are effected between states in the US, the applicable sales taxes are also levied in certain cases."
"The only instance in which no tax is levied is when the supplier is in a non-EU country and the recipient is in a Member State of the EU."
"There can be no doubt at all that this constitutes a distortion of competition, being detrimental both to retailers who, though they do not sell the same items, deal in similar products and to suppliers who offer the same sort of product from countries within the EU."
"Such distortion of competition cannot be tolerated in the long run, which is why I should like to say on behalf of my group that we endorse the proposals on this matter by the European Commission and by the rapporteur, Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil."
"In essence, it is only a question of finding a set of rules now so that these matters can be administered with as little red tape as possible."
"In this respect, the French proposal that registration be carried out in fifteen countries is surely not a suitable solution."
"The second point on our agenda is the taxation of aviation fuel."
"Here too, I go along with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in principle."
"The taxation of aviation fuel is desirable for various reasons, but it is our firm belief that it can only be taxed on the basis of an international regime."
"If the European Union goes it alone, the result will be that flights from Frankfurt to the Costa del Sol, for example, will become considerably more expensive than flights from Frankfurt to Florida."
"That too is an unacceptable distortion of competition to the detriment of European operators."
"I therefore believe that efforts must be undertaken to create an international regime for the taxation of aviation fuel."
"My group and I take the view that unilateral European action would be unwise."
"Mr President, the progress that was made in the domain of European fiscal policy at the EU Summit in Nice was totally unsatisfactory."
"Indeed, the position of fiscal sovereignty as symbol of national sovereignty seems to have been further strengthened by the introduction of the euro."
"Yet we are all aware now that unfettered fiscal competition is detrimental to every one of us."
"By offering short-term location incentives, a government damages the economies of neighbouring Member States."
"The idea of a European fiscal policy is not about levying Community taxes or harmonising tax regimes."
"It is about the coordination of taxes with a view to avoiding fiscal competition and establishing legal certainty, transparency and efficiency."
"This makes the siege mentality that prevailed in Nice all the more regrettable."
"EU fiscal policy remains governed by the consensus principle."
"This has to change if the single market is to function smoothly."
"We are already familiar with the problems in the domains of VAT and energy taxes."
"It will soon become apparent that the European capital market also requires coordination and harmonisation if the financial action plan is to stand even the slightest chance of being implemented."
"Let me now turn to the three proposals from the Commission and its communication. My group endorses the rapporteurs' conclusions."
"It is extremely regrettable that a framework directive on the taxation of energy products has not been adopted to this day."
"Perhaps, as a first step, agreement should be reached on a sort of code of conduct to encourage the use of fiscal instruments in the cause of energy saving and environmental protection."
"Positive discrimination in favour of air transport must be abolished."
"This, however, presupposes an international regime - and I entirely agree with the rapporteur here - otherwise it would unduly impair the competitiveness of the European airlines."
"Consequently, it would be very fitting indeed if the Commission were to present us with reports which included analyses of the relationship between taxation on the one hand and actual energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions on the other."
"Secondly, with regard to the period of applicability of the minimum standard rate, it is sadly obvious that we still await any sign of progress towards a definitive VAT system based on the country of origin, despite the euro having brought price transparency to the internal market."
"So we have no option but to welcome the Commission's attempt to introduce a wide range of new rules in order to improve the present system, which is too complex, bureaucratic, and open to evasion."
"Members of the European Parliament have never been able to understand why governments are prepared to go on tolerating the leakage of billions of euros in tax revenue under the current system."
"It is high time the Commission gathered the various VAT directives into a single regulation so that the VAT regime can at least be uniformly applied."
"That has to be said here."
"There is always a chance, of course, that we might yet receive a Christmas present."
"As far as the VAT arrangements applicable to certain services supplied by electronic means are concerned, the Commission proposal and the rapporteur merit our support."
"It is unacceptable that European companies should be at a competitive disadvantage in relation to non-EU companies in the realm of e-commerce because they are liable for VAT in respect of their transactions in the world at large as well as those within the internal market."
"It is also important that e-commerce is not subject to heavier or lighter taxation than conventional business transactions."
"Registration in a single country is the appropriate, simple and efficient way to achieve this aim."
"However, on account of the wide range of VAT rates, it will be necessary, as our rapporteur rightly proposes, to distribute VAT revenue fairly among the Member States by means of a clearing system."
"Mr President, Europe is to lead the world in the coming decade where use of the Internet is concerned."
"This was proposed at the Lisbon Summit last spring."
"It is both an excellent and necessary ambition."
"If, within the EU, we want to be competitive and stand on the front line, then this is a highly reasonable objective."
"Therefore, we Liberals share the Commission's ambitions, but we find it very hard to understand the specific proposals put forward by the Commission."
"If Europe is to be the world's most dynamic continent and able to surpass the Americans when it comes to attracting the companies of the new economy, we need to provide good e-commerce opportunities."
"VAT-free e-commerce is what e-Europe needs - not bureaucracy and new taxes."
"According to the current rules, companies within the EU which sell music, computer games, software and services distributed electronically are taxed within the EU if these are bought by consumers within the EU."
"Companies from countries which are not members of the EU are not taxed at all."
"These rules lead to a distortion of competition which obviously needs to be remedied, but the Commission's proposal is a step in the wrong direction."
"Companies from countries outside the EU are forced to register a subsidiary company in at least one EU country to be able to carry on business within the Union."
"The report makes certain adjustments, as stated also by the rapporteur, but as we have heard, it shares the Commission's basic position."
"This is not a good solution for Europe."
"It is an old-fashioned way of thinking which does not fit in with the new economy."
"The proposal will put the EU behind in the game and would also be very difficult to control."
"In order to give e-Europe a kick-start, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party proposes that the Commission's proposal be rejected and that the Member States be given the opportunity to introduce zero rate VAT on e-commerce."
"This zero rate VAT should apply until the VAT rules for non-electronic goods and services have been thoroughly examined and an agreement has been reached within OECD or another international forum on a common position on the taxation of e-commerce."
"Mr President, let the experiences from the taxation package serve as an example."
"A global view is required."
"Many are in fact asking themselves, Commissioner, why Europeans are always so quick to introduce taxes and new rules?"
"We do not need higher taxes in the EU, instead we need lower taxes."
"Mr President, I believe that the successive interventions of our fellow MEPs in the Liberal Group show the complexity of the problem."
"It is difficult to understand why the Liberals want to do away with tax on e-commerce and to place a tax on the aviation fuel used in aircraft."
"I think it is important to establish some criteria."
"Aeroplanes are no less modern than e-commerce."
"Compact discs are not exactly antediluvian, and it would appear that these have to be taxed, whereas programmes circulating on the Internet are apparently to be exempt from tax."
"It is important to know, on the one hand, whether a very important aspect of economic activity assists the administration of public services and, from that point of view, taxation (like State funding) is absolutely unavoidable, and e-commerce cannot be exempt from this."
"On the other hand, taxation must be selected in such a way as to deter the consumer from choosing technologies which are the most harmful to the environment."
"That is the situation we are in at present, with the lack of a tax on aviation fuel scandalously boosting air travel at the expense of rail travel, even in circumstances in which, for other reasons such as noise and congestion, rail travel should be given preference in Europe."
"I am thinking in particular of the London-Paris-Amsterdam-Frankfurt quadrilateral."
"I believe that the position adopted in Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil' s two reports, whereby both e-commerce and aviation fuel would be taxed, is excellent and we shall vote in favour of them."
"We would particularly congratulate the Commission for encouraging us to be bold when it comes to internal taxation of aviation."
"That being said, our collective view is that another tax should be contemplated, other than that relating to fuels, a tax affecting all airlines whenever their planes take off and land at European Union airports, so that we can circumvent international regulations and be in a position to tax our competitors too."
"Mr President, since Mr Sj√∂stedt is no longer able to be present in the House, I would like to say a few words on his behalf with regard to the report on the taxation of aircraft fuel."
"Air traffic is increasing sharply."
"Even though the emissions from this source only represent a fairly small proportion of the total emissions of greenhouse gases, they are nevertheless increasing very fast."
"Finding a method for the taxation of aircraft fuel that works is therefore one of the key issues of climate policy."
"It would also create a much fairer situation between the different forms of transport."
"The Chicago Convention has become completely out-of-date on this point."
"We need international agreements on environment taxes, but not, however, the ban on environment taxes which the Convention involves."
"Therefore, point 16 of the report concerning the renegotiation of the Convention is particularly welcome."
"In anticipation of this, a system of environment taxes on aircraft within the EU would, of course, be a positive thing."
"Here we have an opportunity of showing that we take climate policy seriously within the EU."
"We support the report and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens, but we object totally to the amendments proposed by the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal of the European Commission intended to make the purchasing of digital products which can be downloaded directly from the Internet by consumers resident in the Union from extra-Community firms subject to VAT is a heavy blow for the development of e-commerce."
"The goal which the Commission would like to achieve is to eliminate the disadvantage suffered by European e-businesses whose sales to European consumers are already subject to VAT."
"Nevertheless, the solution proposed will prove to be technically unmanageable and a barrier to the development of on-line transactions within the Union, at the very time when everybody is hoping for its expansion."
"The point has been made from several quarters, even within the Council, which has decided to give itself more time, that the proposal is weak, that it leaves gaps and that it is such as to induce numerous objections."
"I will quote but a few: it appears that it would be impossible to apply the measures adopted without active cooperation from the other countries, particularly the United States, which is currently not at all disposed to cooperate."
"What would happen if an Eastern European country failed to register in Europe for VAT purposes?"
"Would the site be blocked or would we prosecute the users who continued to download files from offshore sites?"
"When all is said and done, any benefit would go to the companies who, with relative ease and certain impunity, refused to comply with the registration obligation."
"How can an e-business be certain that its clients have declared their true place of residence?"
"If the European criteria of the registration obligation were to be taken up internationally for e-commerce taxation, the businesses complying with the obligation, including European businesses, would be forced to register in dozens and dozens of countries, incurring increasingly unreasonable expenses, especially where smaller firms are concerned."
"I could say more, for example on the decision to tax the sale of all electronic equipment etc."
"Moreover, this enthusiasm for negligible amounts of taxable income and tax revenue is incomprehensible."
"The Commission should rather endeavour to ensure that a common, definitive definition of the e-business taxation criteria reaches the OSCE or the WTO."
"For these reasons we will vote against the report."
"Mr President, very few issues among the growing band of United Kingdom Euro-sceptics excite as much interest as VAT, this being one of the concrete examples of the European Union interfering in domestic tax matters."
"The tax itself embodies many of the features of the European Union which makes it so unloved in my country: it is complicated, bureaucratic, difficult and expensive to administer and, in the UK at least, enforced by a draconian and unpopular inspectorate."
"On Parliament's report, I find myself in complete disagreement with virtually every single word."
"I cannot, for instance, see why the introduction of the euro should require further or even any coordination of VAT rates."
"I do not see the introduction of a common system of VAT as a priority and I do not agree that the introduction of a common system is long overdue."
"In fact, nothing would please me, my party and the bulk of business people in the United Kingdom more than the complete abolition of VAT."
"We would prefer a simpler levy on retail goods."
"Moreover, we would prefer to determine our own taxes and reject the idea of a common tax system."
"Therefore, as to the Commission's proposal to extend the timescale the reform is introduced, I can only express my neutrality."
"But as to reducing that time, as the rapporteur proposed, I have to oppose."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tax systems of the Union are becoming ineffective and are yielding less and less revenue."
"One reason for this is that the systems have become so complicated that even experts find them impossible to handle."
"There are too many individual taxes, and these taxes are excessively complex."
"Taxpayers feel they are being fleeced by the State; how are they supposed to understand their current tax liability when the system even baffles experts?"
"Burdens which the public do not understand are automatically perceived to be unfair."
"Their logical response is to refuse to pay."
"This refusal need not take the form of tax evasion."
"Very often a taxpayer will avoid taxation by doing less work, but there have also been cases of economic activities being relocated abroad."
"It surely cannot be our intention in adopting new taxes, so-called Euro-taxes, to accelerate this downward spiral in our countries."
"We have to appreciate that the people of Europe will not strive for greater economic success until hard work and efficiency are properly rewarded again in Europe."
"We are familiar with the vital statistics: with taxes and public charges accounting for more than 45% of earned income, many of our Member States have budget deficits, whereas the United States, where taxes and public charges account for less than 30% of earned income, is achieving budget surpluses of several hundred billion dollars."
"We must aim to streamline and simplify our tax systems and to reduce the rate of taxation, not increase it."
"The taxation of aircraft fuel must therefore be rejected."
"The sixth VAT directive must be simplified; if any limit is to be imposed at all on VAT rates, it should be an upper limit and certainly not a prescribed minimum."
"This means that zero-rating of VAT must be permissible for the provision of electronic services."
"I oppose Mrs Torres Marques' call for harmonisation of VAT, but what I would really like to address is the Garc√≠a-Margallo report on e-commerce."
"While I applaud Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo's heroic efforts on aircraft fuel, I am afraid I cannot agree with his stance on VAT in e-commerce because I think that the Commission's proposal sends out the wrong signal."
"We should be thinking out ways to encourage e-commerce and not thinking up new ways in which to tax it."
"The de facto tax-free status of much US e-commerce must have had a tremendous impact in encouraging the new economy and its phenomenal success in the US."
"This tax is unenforceable, why should we spend the time and the money and the effort on creating a tax that we cannot collect."
"The very day a respectable dot.com starts levying VAT, a less respectable dot.com will set up selling exactly the same products without VAT and that is where the customers will go."
"The proposal is arguably inconsistent with the Ottawa Accord because it provides for different rates for on-line and off-line equivalent products such as, for example, newspapers which would enjoy a reduced rate in their off-line physical form."
"It will be almost impossible for e-businesses to work out the VAT status of their customers and impossible to work out whether their customers are based in the EU, whether they are businesses or not. And as we move ever closer towards electronic money, even the comfort of a credit card billing address will no longer be available to e-businesses as they try to ascertain whether they should charge VAT to a particular customer or not."
"The amount of revenue about which we are talking is very small at the moment."
"There is no need to rush into this legislation."
"We are talking about the future of Europe's economy, the future of its e-economy, let us take the time to get this proposal right."
"I would call upon the Commission to rethink the proposal and to think of an alternative way."
"The preferable option by far is to zero rate European e-businesses to put them on the same playing-field as American and other businesses around the world."
"Mr President, this discussion gives me the opportunity to sum up my own position on the issue of taxation."
"The right to levy taxes and other charges is one of the foundations of any organised society."
"Without taxes, there is no State."
"It is no surprise that the Nice Summit has confirmed the principle of unanimity where all decisions about tax are concerned."
"The Edinburgh Summit had limited contributions to the Community budget to 1.27% of European gross domestic product."
"The European Union' s budget for next year will be closer to 1% than to this upper limit."
"That is very little indeed."
"All States redistribute at least 30%, often 40% and occasionally more than 50% of their national wealth created during the year."
"No one can define the optimum level of compulsory levies."
"Liberals tell us that as little State involvement as possible is required."
"The United States are cited as an example of a country which adopts this policy."
"The US Federal budget redistributes only a third of American GDP. In Europe, compulsory levies include large transfers to finance pensions and health care."
"In the United States, however, social protection is largely the province of the private sector."
"Free-market health care therefore costs the Americans the equivalent of 14% of their GDP, compared with 8 to 9% in European countries."
"Ought not these health care costs in the United States to be added on if tax levels on each side of the Atlantic are to be compared?"
"Whatever the answer, the point of this digression is to note that solidarity organised via the American budget is thirty times greater than that organised via the Community budget."
"Unless there is broad Community solidarity of a kind which is only possible on the basis of a federal structure that is unlikely to exist in the foreseeable future, the individual States of the European Union will be forced to retain control of their taxation."
"In acknowledging this state of affairs, the European Union will nonetheless have to, and be able to, fulfil its duty to coordinate taxation in Europe."
"Coordinating and harmonising are not the same as standardising."
"Fiscal competition is in the interests of the people and of the economy."
"The United States and the Swiss Confederation have internal markets in which tax varies greatly between one state, or canton, and another."
"American local sales tax may vary between zero and ten points, although the difference between neighbouring states is generally no more than five points."
"This clearly demonstrates that Europe has no need of uniform VAT rates."
"Minimum rates, and possibly a maximum rate, are needed, but the States need to be allowed room for manoeuvre to enable them to pursue their own microeconomic policies."
"Obviously, any unfair tax competition needs to be combated, especially when it comes to business tax matters."
"The Primarolo group has devised simple rules which must be applied."
"Money laundering must be combated, as must organised crime and tax fraud."
"That is already happening, even in States which practice banking secrecy."
"I am therefore in favour of common rules and minimum tax thresholds."
"Levying tax at source on savings products is acceptable, on condition that they are reasonable and levied at source."
"Many Europeans have difficulty accepting tax on savings because they feel they are being taxed twice over."
"Those who spend their income pay VAT."
"Those who save the yield from their income which has already been taxed ought, on Ecofin' s reasoning, to be subject to a levy at source and will, in addition, be taxed on an assessment basis."
"I would call for uniform taxation at source."
"This could be allocated as a direct resource to the Community budget."
"National contributions to the European Union' s budget should be reduced by the same amount."
"A procedure like that would eliminate the need for the European bureaucratic information exchange system thought up in Feira."
"There is also a danger of the latter system leading to the complete renationalisation of European taxation, because each State will be able, in 2010, to establish its national tax as it sees fit."
"Other States will simply be induced to supply the information needed for the purposes of national taxation."
"As far as I am concerned, Feira does not constitute progress but, rather, a setback when it comes to necessary tax coordination in Europe."
"Mr President, it is truly touching to hear the purportedly angelic arguments in favour of promoting e-commerce, but here the problem we have is the real competitive disadvantage of our European companies, and the problem of correcting that situation by establishing certain rules, so that all services supplied to private individuals by electronic means in the European Union are subject to VAT."
"Therefore, in order to ensure that operators from outside the Union are subject to the same tax obligations as domestic operators when providing services to consumers, they must be registered for VAT purposes in a Member State of their choice, with the VAT rate of the State they choose being the one that applies to their operations."
"We debated this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and some committee members spoke in favour of tax exemption for this type of service, arguing that this would eliminate the competitive disadvantage."
"I believe that this argument is mistaken."
"It is an inappropriate argument and it is not in accordance with European legislation, and furthermore it would do comparative harm to services provided by other means."
"Furthermore, it is not true that a moratorium on the taxation of electronic services has been introduced in the United States."
"We therefore support the Commission' s proposal in its entirety and the excellent work of Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil."
"I personally tabled an amendment on the harmonisation of VAT rates, which would correct the effects of unfair competition resulting from third country operators' power to choose when it comes to registering, since there is a very broad range of VAT rates available to them - between 15 and 25% - while domestic operators have no choice."
"However, I believe that a better solution has been found to compensate the Member States for the loss of VAT income resulting from these differences in rates, a solution which I consider to be satisfactory."
"By way of an objection, the Group that I represent in this House believes that we should correct the fact that, while newspapers normally enjoy reduced VAT rates, this reduction is not applicable to electronic newspapers."
"Mr President, the taxation of aircraft fuel really does seem to be long overdue."
"There is absolutely no justification for imposing high taxes on all fuels except kerosene at a time when the volume of air traffic is rising sharply in terms of both cargo and passenger miles."
"This has been accompanied by a correspondingly sharp increase in emissions of greenhouse gases and noise levels."
"Fuel taxation serves several purposes."
"On the one hand, excise duties on fuel, like all taxes, help to finance national budgets."
"On the other hand, they also have a regulatory function in that they reduce fuel consumption and hence the depletion of carbonised energy resources and the emission of greenhouse gases."
"These taxes therefore confront industry with a constant challenge to manufacture vehicles with lower fuel consumption."
"That is precisely what we want to see for aircraft too."
"So why should aircraft fuel not be taxed now, at long last?"
"We are, after all, anxious to ensure that no mode of transport is treated unfairly."
"But the situation is not quite as straightforward as that."
"Air traffic covers greater distances than any other mode of transport."
"More significantly, aircraft fly across borders, including the borders of the European Union."
"Even now, without kerosene duty, the airports in the EU are locked in fierce competition."
"The main reason for this is the fact that different regions have different rules for night flying, a situation which affects cargo transport in particular."
"This puts enormous pressure on airlines to keep their prices down."
"If we were now to go it alone in Europe and tax aircraft fuel, European operators would scarcely be able to compete with airlines based outside Europe."
"We would destroy our own European market."
"So the taxation of kerosene is only possible on the basis of an international consensus if a level playing-field is to be guaranteed."
"This is what Europe must work towards, even though it will be a long and arduous process."
"Until this goal is achieved, there are certainly other means of regulating air traffic, such as emission-based take-off and landing fees at all European airports."
"That option would affect all airlines, European and non-European."
"It would not distort competition in any way."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his speedy work on this report on VAT and e-commerce."
"I think the comments I have heard around the floor today would almost suggest that we do not need this kind of report, but of course we do."
"It is tempting for us always to compare ourselves with the USA and to say that because they cannot find a satisfactory solution, we should not either."
"But the fact is that VAT on goods and services applies across the European Union."
"This is a tax which already exists."
"It is not a new tax and it should be applied."
"It should be applied to the Internet at well."
"Otherwise, what would happen?"
"Well of course the issue of unfair competition has already been mentioned."
"Why should the retail industry be so badly affected and be made to suffer in order for another industry to grow?"
"If indeed it can be affected that way by what the proposal suggests, and I doubt that."
"Furthermore, this proposal is in line, as I see it, with the principles agreed at Ecofin, which in turn are in line with the agreed principles of the OECD Conference in Ottawa."
"The source where the tax should apply is a matter of concern, and the discussion around the number of countries which would qualify to have companies registered in them is something which I believe will be burdensome and of course provoke the USA to a complaint in the WTO."
"But I do not believe that e-commerce is going to be crushed by VAT being suddenly applied like some evil giant."
"I think that the real problem is that EU retail industries will continue to suffer the disadvantages that they are currently suffering."
"It is amusing to hear some of the comments being made around this Chamber today but it is quite clearly also amusing to remember that the kind of cashless society that perhaps the likes of Trotters Independent Trading Company in the UK were involved in is the kind of society that is being advocated by some over on the other side of the House."
"Are we going to end up with that kind of cashless society, with cowboy e-commerce outfits being able to do what they want?"
"I do not think so."
"That is not how we are meant to organise society, and that is why I think this proposal is an excellent one."
"Mr President, I would like to warmly welcome the report on aviation fuel tax because it addresses head-on the fact that aviation is the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and that far from discouraging these emissions, the current exemption of aviation from a fuel tax actually promotes and artificially stimulates the aviation sector and the environmental damage that goes with it."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the report reinforces one of the key points that I made in my report for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism which this Parliament voted on a few months ago, namely, that since it is undoubtedly politically difficult to achieve international agreement on an aviation tax, at least in a short term, we should look at alternative tools to achieve the same effect, including an emissions charge."
"Such a charge could be levied on all flights coming into or going out of EU airports, on all carriers, and plenty of research has been done to show that this would not have negative competitive effects."
"It could be agreed very swiftly without requiring international consensus, and could help make significant progress towards internalising environmental costs."
"The importance of moving ahead on this issue swiftly is very clear."
"The forecasts for the global growth of aviation are terrifying."
"Official figures suggest a doubling of passenger numbers in just fifteen or twenty years, and if you look at what that means in UK terms alone, in order to meet that scale of demand we would be needing an extra four new Heathrow Airports or an extra eight new Gatwick Airports."
"That would clearly be both politically and environmentally unacceptable."
"So, instead of trying to meet projected demand we need to try to manage and reduce that demand by ensuring that the price of aviation more accurately reflects its environmental cost."
"When air tickets are 42% cheaper today than they were ten years ago, it is clear that the wrong price signals are being given out."
"It makes no sense at all that I can travel from London to Brussels return for just ¬£89 by Virgin Airways, for example, yet when I use Eurostar, which produces far fewer greenhouse gases and is a much more pleasant way to travel, I have to pay the equivalent of around ¬£250 for a similar journey."
"So to conclude, action in this area is overdue and if we do not do something about it very swiftly then our efforts to try to reduce the impacts of climate change are going to be stymied."
"Mr President, I wish to address my concerns this afternoon to the proposed taxation on aircraft fuel."
"Whilst there is recognition in this report that a kerosene tax cannot be imposed internationally due to the exemption in the Chicago Convention, nevertheless the introduction of such a tax, intra-EU or bilaterally, would be severely damaging to the United Kingdom and the entire European aviation industry."
"Not only would our air fares increase dramatically - possibly by ¬£80 per ticket, thereby threatening the very existence of the smaller carriers - but the damage would also affect the aerospace manufacturers, tourism, businesses and, of course, the freight carriers - they now carry a third of freight world-wide by air."
"It is not true to say that aviation does not bear its costs."
"In fact, the industry pays 100% of its infrastructure costs through air traffic control and airport charges, amounting to US $4bn in 1998 - unlike other modes of transport, such as rail and road, which are still heavily subsidised."
"These facts must be recognised."
"In addition, to impose this tax would bring little benefit to the environment, as was proven by the introduction of the air passenger duty tax in the United Kingdom."
"Aviation is in fact responsible for 2.5% of CO2 emissions world wide."
"Other approaches, such as trading and offsets, could be more environmentally-friendly and cost- effective."
"Finally, such measures would ruin the competitiveness of the European industry vis-√†-vis the rest of the world and would also cause massive job losses."
"So I, for one, will continue to speak up for an industry which is often singled out as the big bad wolf."
"This report is badly crafted on the part of the Commission and this Parliament."
"The public at large deserves better."
"Mr President, some old shibboleths have resurfaced in this debate."
"There are those who reject any form of taxation, including tax on e-commerce."
"There are those who, rather than trying to resolve a question at European level, imagine that it is always better to refer it to other fora so as not to resolve it."
"I am thinking in particular of Mr Dell'Alba' s intervention."
"There are those, like Mr Titford, who vigorously defend their own national interest, preferring tax competition to European coordination."
"I am not among these."
"Like Mr Skinner, I think that the proposals from the rapporteur, Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil, regarding VAT on e-commerce are good."
"We do, in fact, think that we must review our tax system in the light of technological developments."
"The current situation is an unfavourable one."
"The facts are that, today, a French person can purchase software from an American company exempt from VAT, whereas an American making a similar acquisition from a French company is taxed at the rate current in France."
"I see this as a double competitive advantage for the American company."
"I am not sure that this is the best way of supporting our own e-commerce industry."
"Now, it seems that very many voices, in this Chamber too, have been raised in support of this industry."
"We think this distortion of competition between Member States and third countries is unacceptable."
"The Commission' s proposals would permit progress towards greater coordination, and they are along the right lines."
"Then, there is the argument according to which a sector should be exempt from tax on the grounds that it is experiencing rapid growth."
"That is not my view."
"Finally, the French Presidency' s proposals were discussed, according to which tax should be levied at the point of consumption, with a requirement for service providers to be registered in all the Member States."
"Our rapporteur' s proposal echoes those of the Commission, favouring one-off registration in a single Member State."
"If this can provide the basis for a compromise, it will probably be a good compromise as long as it is not used to reintroduce distortion of competition due to the different VAT rates applicable in our various Member States."
"The equalisation mechanism proposed by our rapporteur is along these lines. That is why, together with the other members of my group, I shall support the proposal."
"Mr President, I should like to express my thanks to Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil for his work."
"I only intend to speak about the taxation of aviation fuel."
"Parallel to this debate, we have been holding talks with Mr Currie, the Director-General for Environmental Affairs, on the outcome of the negotiations in The Hague."
"In this context, I am sorry to say that aircraft emissions do pose a problem; although air traffic is not responsible for a large percentage of pollutant emissions, its volume is growing very rapidly, and we must therefore avoid any temptation to trivialise it."
"But we must also reach an agreement, because there are widely differing views here in the House about the method we should use to tackle this problem."
"I believe we all agree that it would be very difficult indeed to find a global solution but that a global solution represents the ideal outcome."
"There are now some - and they include a majority of the committee - who say they want a European tax, to which the rapporteur has rightly replied that such a tax could only cover a tiny percentage of the world's air traffic and, more crucially, that it would create a huge problem for European industry."
"This, I believe, gives us good reason to be sceptical about this solution, although views vary, even within the PPE-DE Group."
"I know that my own party at home would support the principle of a European tax, but I believe the time has come for us to make a real concerted effort to identify common ground and to seek the solution that has the greatest possible beneficial impact on the environment coupled with the least possible distortion of competition for European industry."
"To that end, the proposal for emission-based take-off and landing fees ought to be seriously examined, because it offers a means of including aircraft from other parts of the world, such as the United States and Japan, in the taxation regime when they land in Amsterdam, London, Paris or Frankfurt and thus of achieving greater environmental benefit and less distortion of competition."
"There might be problems with the WTO, but I believe it is up to the Commission to seek a solution at the WTO negotiations, a solution which is compatible with the WTO rules and which our trading partners might be persuaded to accept."
"Mr President, I find the idea of a unilateral setting of EU aircraft fuel tax regimes entirely inappropriate, given that globally we are still subject to the Chicago Convention of 1944, exempting kerosene from taxation internationally."
"European aircraft carriers would be disadvantaged compared to carriers from third countries and it would distort intra-EU as opposed to intercontinental fare structures."
"While the expansion of air traffic and the environmental problems of global warming and pollution are serious and important issues, I feel that a more effective approach would be to tackle this within an international framework."
"By focusing our attention too narrowly on only the activities which take place within the EU, we risk harming our industry without achieving much-needed progress in lowering emissions."
"This same problem of trying to impose a regional solution to a global question arises with the difficult issue of VAT on digital electronic services."
"To levy VAT on third-country suppliers, largely American, is not only impractical but, in the case of newspapers and books, it gives rise to inconsistencies between the same products sold on line as opposed to in a shop."
"It is also inherently neither enforceable nor collectable, unless regulated internationally, as undoubtedly servers would be set up offshore beyond the EU's jurisdiction."
"The scheme will be harmful to the development of SMEs, both within and outside the Union, especially in view of the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold to a prohibitively low level of EUR 40 000 annual turnover."
"I personally advocate a VAT zero rating of all digital services until international agreement is finally reached."
"Finally, the Torres Marques report on a minimum standard rate for VAT represents tax harmonisation by the back door and threatens the UK's zero rates on children's clothes, food and newspapers."
"As a British Conservative, I can only regret the high indirect tax rates throughout the European Union and I hope that by promoting tax competition we may bring pressure on our Labour Government to lower them in the United Kingdom."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my honourable colleague Mr Goebbels referred to the Feira agreement, of which he takes a dim view."
"Like him, I am unable to join in the euphoria and applause that greeted it in many quarters."
"I should just like to address two points."
"The first point is that we in Austria have had very gratifying experience of taxation at source in connection with capital-gains tax."
"It creates legal certainty for every individual saver and citizen."
"It seems to me, however, that a solution which will avoid a flight of capital from Europe is only achievable within the OECD framework and not through a collection of individually negotiated bilateral arrangements."
"Secondly, I should like to deal briefly with the proposals on services provided by electronic means, which primarily relate, of course, to services downloaded from the Internet and to radio and television services."
"I believe we must ensure that no competitive disadvantages are incurred within Europe."
"Despite my fundamentally favourable response to the Commission proposal, I have to say that it seems premature and, in parts, underdeveloped, if one considers the many questions it leaves unanswered."
"Moreover, I very much doubt whether the present text will be able to find general acceptance."
"To my mind, it would be wiser to aim for a VAT regime in the OECD framework, even though in all probability it would only take the form of a code of conduct at that level."
"One last point is that the EU should not legislate in haste and should make every effort to strengthen e-commerce and to avoid undermining it."
"Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, it is extremely important for the future of Europe that those involved in the information society in Europe are on an equal footing with those players in countries outside the EU."
"We who make the policy decisions in the EU must not, through our own actions, weaken European competitiveness."
"As, for example, Mr Schmidt said in his speech, we must comply with what was agreed at Lisbon and do all we can to strengthen the dynamism of the European Union."
"If we are too greedy in this matter now under discussion we will really be jeopardising the future of e-business, which is so important for Europe."
"Naturally, I agree with the Commission' s proposal and with all my colleagues who have spoken here today that the distortion of competition that now exists in the market must be eliminated as soon as possible."
"This distortion can be eliminated in two ways: either by imposing the same tax obligations on companies that come from third countries as on their European counterparts, or by also exempting European companies working in this field, which is just being developed, from VAT."
"When we also consider the unsolved problems referred to by many others with regard to the aforementioned Commission proposal, as a result, for example, of monitoring the system, verifying where the assessment of taxes took place, distributing tax revenues fairly, and other factors, I am convinced that, at this stage, it would be more reasonable to adopt the line the minority were in favour of in the committee discussion."
"I therefore support those who want to totally exempt European companies from tax on electronic products, for the present at least."
"Neither do I really understand the argument that products that are supplied electronically should be treated in just the same way as traditional products."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example, said this."
"In my opinion, reading the morning paper in a street caf√© is quite different from reading it on the Internet where you work."
"We are talking about a different product."
"Mr President, I would like to start by commenting on the levy of VAT on electronic services."
"This topic has been given much attention ever since the Commission introduced the proposal on 7 June of this year."
"I am aware that some Members have been swamped with opposing views."
"Since the introduction, Parliament and the Council have shifted a lot of work."
"Although I am convinced that the Commission proposal, which is still before us, forms a sound point of departure, I have also noticed that Parliament and the Council are helping along the thought process in a constructive manner."
"This forms a sound basis for further discussion."
"I would especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil, for his contribution and for the positive ideas which were put forward in his report."
"The Council' s Working Party on Financial Questions also pored over the topic of VAT and e-commerce."
"The outcome of that consultation was discussed within Ecofin at the end of November."
"I think that the conclusions of those ministers constitute a step in the right direction."
"The Council has reached agreement on the following key areas: electronic services must be taxed in the Community if use is made of these within the Community."
"They are not taxed in the Community if they are used outside of its borders."
"The guiding principle that suppliers from outside the Community who supply to customers within the Community need only register at one location must not lead to a shift in tax revenue between the Member States."
"Measures should be taken to avoid this."
"There is general consensus that a solution must be found whereby suppliers from outside the Community need only register at one location, and this is an absolute necessity in the eyes of the Commission."
"I would like to briefly comment on the further detailing of this solution."
"The rapporteur' s idea to develop a mechanism to avoid distortions emanating from differences in rates meets with the support of a majority of the Member States."
"I am of the opinion that this idea can be combined with the original Commission proposal for one single registration without putting up bureaucratic barriers for industry."
"I would like to stress that we are talking about a system of reallocation of revenue and not about the distribution of this revenue."
"The system of reallocation of revenue will need to be carefully worked out."
"It is useful to have an objective and clear criterion at our disposal, namely the Member State where the consumer lives."
"This rules out the complexities which would emerge if macroeconomic or similar criteria were to be applied."
"Although I do not foresee any insurmountable technical hitches, a great deal of time will need to be invested in the next couple of months in the further development of the system, particularly with respect to the legal basis, so as to enable tax to be levied on all Member States by means of one declaration."
"As usual, we need to ensure that the solution we opt for does not give cause for concern outside the Community with regard to discrimination against suppliers who are not based in the Community."
"In this context, I believe that the Council should revisit the issue of threshold amounts for registration and look at whether a fair solution can be found."
"All in all, a number of details still need to be looked at."
"I am of the opinion that considerable headway has been made under the French Presidency, and I am convinced that in 2001, Sweden will continue in the same vein."
"Given that the debate in the Council is still under way and also given the Commission' s wish to bring the topic of VAT and e-commerce to a successful conclusion in the short term, I am of the opinion that at this moment in time, it would be desirable not to accept Parliament' s amendment proposals formally but to try to incorporate these proposals as far as possible in the negotiations with the Council."
"However, I do not share Parliament' s ideas on one aspect, namely the introduction of a reduced rate or even a zero rate for electronic services, an idea which was, in fact, floated by various Members this afternoon too."
"VAT is a general consumer tax."
"There are few exemptions from VAT and where these have been introduced, this was generally for cultural or social reasons."
"Electronic services cannot be brought under this heading and it is unacceptable to stimulate part of industry."
"The intention of my proposal is to iron out any existing inequalities and to create equal conditions for European and non-European companies."
"I would like to emphasise that, apart from the difference in insight to which I referred a moment ago, there is far-reaching agreement between Parliament' s and the Council' s approaches and in particular, about registration, threshold amounts and reallocation of revenue, and that in further talks in the Council, the points which Parliament has brought forward will be taken into consideration."
"I am also prepared, in principle, to accept Parliament' s amendment proposal on administrative cooperation."
"This is a simplification measure which regulates the exchange of information between the Member States on VAT numbers in the electronic trade, and we will take the proposal to heart in our future work in Parliament and the Council."
"Allow me now to turn to the proposal on the minimum level of the normal rate."
"Despite the efforts made by this Parliament and the Commission, as referred to by the rapporteur in his report, little progress has been made so far on the activities to replace the present VAT transitional regulation by a final regulation based on tax in the country of origin."
"However, it should also be pointed out that the current climate, where the conditions are not favourable for achieving further harmonisation of VAT rates in the short term, makes meaningful progress in the near future very unlikely."
"Consequently, without prejudicing the idea of a definitive system but with a view to improving the working of the internal market in the short term, the Commission has drawn up a new VAT strategy which comprises four key goals, namely the simplification and modernisation of the existing rules, more uniform application of the present provisions and stricter implementation of administrative cooperation."
"It is in the light of this that this proposal is seeking to maintain the existing level of harmonisation in the field of VAT rates by confirming the minimum level of 15% for the normal rate."
"The proposed five-year period reflects the stability which the new VAT strategy stands for, and reducing this period to three years, as proposed by the rapporteur, seems too short to enable the Commission to meet its obligations."
"This is why I cannot accept the proposed amendments."
"Should the circumstances take a dramatic and unpredictable turn within the next couple of years, the Commission can always consider submitting a fresh proposal."
"Finally, I would like to comment on the report on tax on aircraft fuel."
"The Commission' s communication regarding tax on aircraft fuel accommodated the request which the Council made in its resolution of 9 June 1997."
"In it, the Council asked the Commission to provide more detailed information on all aspects of the introduction of such tax and especially on the environmental effects, the competitive position and profitability of the aviation industry within the European Union compared to its competitors outside of the Union, and the possibility of applying other instruments which have similar effects."
"This communication took into account the conclusions of an exhaustive study. The upshot of this study was that the environmental effects and the implications for tax revenue and other effects mainly depend on two factors, namely the level and scope of the tax."
"I am delighted that Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo' s report by and large supports the conclusions reached by the Commission."
"The suggestion to extend the scope of excise on mineral oils to include aircraft fuel and thus to end the existing inequality in treatment with regard to different modes of transport has met with strong support."
"Furthermore, this approach was generally well-received during the discussions which were held within the Council."
"The recommendation that future discussions must take place within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the ICAO, namely during its 33rd general meeting in September and October of the year 2001, also met with the same level of support."
"These discussions will prove very difficult, however, since the possibility of levying tax on aircraft fuel was not decided on at the previous general meeting."
"Accordingly, no major groundwork has been done within the ICAO working parties and it is unlikely that the Chicago Convention will be re-negotiated at the forthcoming general meeting."
"Despite this, the Community could urgently request the review of the existing ICAO provisions concerning tax on aircraft fuel to be included in the working programme of that organisation and to underline the anticipated positive environmental effects of such a measure vis-√†-vis other ICAO members."
"A resolution issued by the general meeting of the ICAO which paves the way for an internal solution to the issue of tax on aircraft fuel or the use of other instruments with equivalent effects would be a crucial first step in the right direction."
"Finally, I have noticed that the European Parliament would like to go further than the Commission where the Commission' s opinion is concerned. According to that view, at this moment in time it would be neither viable nor desirable to introduce a tax on aircraft fuel only on flights within the Community carried out by Community aviation companies, for reasons which have been given an ample airing in this House this afternoon."
"The European Parliament is of the opinion that in a fast growing sector, such as the aviation sector, the environmental effects of relatively unimportant measures can never be considered insignificant."
"I would, however, like to point out that current Community tax legislation does not allow for only national and intra-Community flights to be taxed."
"This would become possible after the Council has approved the Commission' s proposal on the restructuring of tax on energy products, which has been before the Council for discussion since March 1997, and concerning which this House is aware that approval is still pending."
"Thank you very much for all the dossiers you have addressed this week."
"You have had a fair number to deal with and you have been very helpful with the explanations on the technical subjects."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken on Thursday at 10 a.m."
"Erika II"
"The next item is the Commission communication on the Erika II package on safety at sea."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, exactly a year ago today, the sinking of the oil tanker Erika took place."
"That disaster led to the pollution of 400 km of French coastline, with serious consequences for the environment, and for the citizens who lived and ran businesses in that area, whether they be oyster farmers, shellfish gatherers, fishermen or simply citizens involved in the tourist sector."
"This accident, which followed many others, gave rise to anger and despondency amongst the communities that were affected and within public opinion in general because of the opacity of the maritime sector and the inability of the legislation in force to prevent problems such as this."
"This feeling unfortunately still persists to this day in the mood of European public opinion."
"The sinking of the Erika had a completely new and surprising effect."
"Never before had there been so much talk about maritime safety in the European Union."
"For the first time there has been awareness of the need to find European solutions to this type of issue related to maritime pollution."
"It is obvious that one State of the Union on its own cannot have any real influence on maritime transport across the world and, on the other hand, the International Maritime Organisation is too slow and lacks effective means to adequately monitor the rules which it lays down."
"The European public has insisted that the European institutions should adopt quick and drastic measures to put an end to the scandal of flags of convenience."
"One year after the sinking of the Erika, we must all ask ourselves whether or not we have really been able to meet the expectations of Europe' s citizens."
"I sincerely believe that, given the progress that has been made quickly in the work of our respective bodies, it is undeniable that all the institutions have understood and fully accepted the importance of this issue."
"For its part, just three months after the accident, the Commission assumed its responsibilities and adopted a first package of measures, which the European Parliament approved fully on 30 November."
"In addition to these first measures, the Commission has just adopted, on 6 December, a second package which I believe will respond even more directly to people' s expectations and will also profoundly change the rules of the game in the field of maritime transport, which will be of great benefit to maritime safety and to the protection of our coasts against the risks of pollution."
"In this respect, I would like today to very briefly present the content of this new package known as Erika II."
"Firstly, we will be implementing a European system of maritime transport inspection."
"As such, the first measure is a proposal for a directive establishing a European system for monitoring, inspection and information with regard to maritime traffic."
"It is clear that inspection by the port State, regardless of the rigour with which it is carried out, only partially protects the States against the risks of accident and pollution, particularly from ships in transit."
"The Commission' s proposal therefore has three fundamental objectives: firstly, to carry out better monitoring and inspection of the traffic of all the ships off our coasts."
"To this end, the ships must be equipped with devices that allow them to be automatically identified and monitored from land."
"Another device, whose importance in the eyes of MEPs is known to the Commission, is black boxes, which are also required by this directive, which must be fitted on board ships which dock in a European port, in order to aid the investigation of the facts in the case of an accident at sea or, possibly, to facilitate inspection by the port State."
"This will oblige the captain and crews to run the ship with more care."
"The second objective is to simplify and speed up, in the case of accident, the communication of detailed information on dangerous and polluting cargoes, obliging ships and authorities to communicate the data electronically."
"And the final objective of this directive is to strengthen the management of emergency situations at sea, through the obligation to designate ports of refuge, the prohibition on taking to sea during high storms and greater powers of intervention at sea on the part of the coastal State in the event of a serious risk of pollution."
"Secondly, another aspect of this package consists of improving the rules in force in the field of responsibility and compensation for damages in the event of pollution by oil or its derivatives."
"We simply need to remember that the case of the Erika oil slick has shown us how slow and insufficient this compensation is, and it is still a long way from being paid to the victims and the people affected by this pollution a year after the accident happened."
"Furthermore, they are unlikely to be compensated for 100% of the damages they have suffered."
"Thus the Commission' s priority is to try to resolve these two problems, and the solution we propose is to supplement the existing funds through the creation of a European fund financed by the oil companies, which would offer the victims quick compensation of up to EUR 1 000 million, instead of the EUR 200 million - USD 180 million - currently granted by the international authorities."
"At the same time, we will be approaching the international bodies in order to try to review in detail the system established by the international agreements."
"In the event that the IMO does not adopt the necessary measures, the Commission would submit a proposal to Parliament and the Council on a Community system for responsibility and compensation in the event of pollution by hydrocarbons."
"Furthermore, any person who has contributed through serious negligence to causing pollution will be subject to deterrent penalties, which will serve to promote responsible behaviour on the part of the maritime industry as a whole."
"The third measure in the Erika II package is the proposed creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency, which will provide the Commission and the Member States of the Union with the technical support necessary to implement the applicable Community legislation. It will also serve as a platform between the Member States and the Commission for the development of harmonised practices and procedures, as well as facilitating the smooth flow of information between the various ports and between the various States and administrations."
"In fact, with more than fifteen directives or regulations in force, it is crucial that we standardise practices and exercise greater control over the implementation of Community rules, in order to prevent significant and unacceptable differences in the field of maritime safety which could arise within the Union."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency constitutes a first stage in the increasing integration of the administrative practices of the Member States, which may one day lead to the creation, as has been repeatedly requested by this House, of a genuine European coastguard organisation."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, we have not reached that stage yet."
"Mr President, I hope that Parliament will take this opportunity, on this highly symbolic date - the first anniversary of the Erika disaster - to remember its determination and give the Commission the support that it will need throughout the legislative process."
"This issue is of crucial importance, since through it the European Union has asserted, in the eyes of the outside world and of its citizens, its ability to impose its own demands, in an international environment which is in principle largely unfavourable, in the field of maritime safety and the prevention of pollution."
"I would like to remind you that the Heads of State and Government, meeting just three days ago at the European Council in Nice, have given decisive political impetus to this second package of measures, recognising that it is aimed at strengthening maritime safety, improving the European system of information on maritime traffic and creating an agency which will improve on the shortcomings of the current international system."
"So much so that they recommended to the States that they adopt the appropriate measures a priori and as soon as necessary, without waiting for the Parliamentary and Council procedure to allow us to definitively approve the directives I am referring to."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, may I congratulate you once again for having outlined the Erika II package in clear and comprehensible terms and especially the need for us to inspect vessels in transit - subject to the international law of the sea - rather than only checking vessels that dock in EU ports."
"These other ships which are only passing through EU waters can cause equally bad and even far worse pollution of our shorelines."
"So I believe this approach is absolutely correct."
"As far as liability is concerned, we must take a very careful look at that."
"The oil companies tell us they have a voluntary fund."
"This raises the question of whether we need a public fund."
"If you tell us that experience has shown the voluntary fund to be inadequate, which would be unfortunate, we shall then try to sort out this issue."
"Madam Vice-President, how do you rate the prospects of the Council taking a decision on the Erika I package in December?"
"Parliament took its decision on 30 November; you presented a good document, and we decided quickly."
"How do you see the chances of the Council managing to adopt Erika I now, in December?"
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her continuing commitment in the field of maritime safety."
"I should like her to answer two points."
"Firstly, how will she persuade the Council to adopt her proposal on black-box voyage-data recorders?"
"We are trying to do that now on the Erika I package."
"We obviously would welcome her support on that issue, but we want to know how she will persuade these Member States to do what up until now they appear to be unwilling to do."
"Secondly, there is nothing in her package to tackle the problem of the blacklisted flag states, states sadly that include Cyprus and Malta, where 50, 60, 70, 80% of ships have defects."
"What measures does she propose to tackle these blacklisted rogue flag states that continue to flout international maritime law?"
"Mr President, firstly, it is essential not only to inspect the ships which come to our ports, but also certain ships in transit with dangerous cargoes or in situations of risk."
"That seems to us to be essential."
"Secondly, I hope that the ministers are capable, even at 4 or 5 o' clock in the morning, of approving the Erika I package."
"I hope that the decisiveness and such a clear statement at the European Council in Nice will serve to break down the remaining resistance on the part of certain countries which were fundamentally concerned because it was going to be more expensive to send more people to carry out inspections in ports, and that was the real problem within the Council."
"Unless this happens, the Council will bear a degree of responsibility, or rather a great deal of responsibility, for this delay and the ministers will have to explain themselves to the public."
"Mr Watts, firstly, I would like to thank you for your vote of confidence and, secondly, I would like to point out to you that we have included the issue of the black box, thereby fulfilling the commitment we gave you."
"With regard to the black box, it should be pointed out that the International Maritime Organisation has laid down an obligation of this type for ships using national routes as from July 2008 and we wish this date to be brought forward."
"I hope that after the impetus provided in Nice, the doubts and resistance of certain countries will have been reduced and that we achieve this."
"In relation to the fund, I would like very briefly to mention two issues: blacklisted ships and flags of convenience."
"Even the countries which have a lesser degree of safety with regard to their ships have some ships which are safe; therefore, in accordance with international laws, we cannot exclude them a priori."
"What we can do is what we have indicated, that is to say, that if a ship belongs to one of those countries which has unsafe ships, not only countries with a flags of convenience, but also those which show little concern for safety in particular, it should be systematically inspected when it reaches a European port."
"With regard to the issue of responsibility, I will only say that the current fund is not sufficient to provide compensation for all the damage caused by the Erika oil slick."
"It is therefore necessary to increase that fund and we are going to try to do that within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation, but if that does not raise the EUR 1 000 million, which is the quantity we believe would be reasonable and which is more or less the quantity currently being considered by the United States, we will have to adopt certain initiatives and create a special European fund."
"I would like to remind Members that, in air safety, the amounts of compensation paid in Europe and North America are not equal to the amounts paid in other countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you have pointed out, next week, a year will have passed since the Erika disaster and the European Parliament and the Council have still not been capable of agreeing on the approval of the initiative for the first maritime safety package."
"In this first package there is a proposal relating to Directive 57/94, which deals with inspections of ships and the classification societies."
"The main difficulty stems from the amendment of Article 6 of that directive; the Commission and the European Parliament propose the introduction of financial compensation to cover the possible responsibilities of classification societies in cases of maritime accidents."
"Since the essence of this issue centres on this compensation, I would ask you, Commissioner, to withdraw the amendment to Article 6 and I would like to ask all the other Members of the European Parliament to withdraw the amendments to Article 6 and let us leave it for the second package which you have just announced."
"Mr President, a year ago, an oil slick polluted the Brittany region and what amounts to the work tool of thousands of people whose livelihood is linked to the sea, the livelihood of an entire region."
"In this case, the body responsible is not a company which is difficult to identify."
"It is Total, whose head office is in the territory of the European Union."
"Now, you say that the compensation fund is insufficient."
"Why do we not, in that case, confiscate Total' s profits until all those who have already suffered, and those who will in future suffer, the effects of the criminal pursuit of profit have been fully and promptly compensated?"
"Mr President, I should like in turn to thank Mrs de Palacio for her comments."
"We obviously have confidence in her ability to ensure maritime safety because she must know that not a week passes without our being asked what, as Members of the European Parliament, we are doing to ensure safety and to change the rules."
"I have two questions."
"Regarding the Erika I package, have you received any replies from the Member States about how precisely they wish to invest and to increase the number of their inspectors, because there is no doubt that, if they do not increase their number, everything that has been decided here will serve little purpose."
"Regarding the Erika II package, I shall confine myself to one question in the form of an observation, although there are so many to be made!"
"I am very happy to hear you speak of a European coastguard service."
"Is this really an idea which has had its day, because there are an enormous number of people who support it?"
"Might the setting up of the European Maritime Agency be regarded as the beginnings or basis of a European coastguard service?"
"Mr Ortuondo, in relation to your intervention on Article 6, on responsibility in the case of less serious pollution, I can tell you that the first thing I am going to find out is what the Council thinks, but Parliament has already adopted a position on this issue."
"In other words, either the Council accepts the position adopted by Parliament or, if not, there will be a second reading."
"These may constitute the current negotiations, but I believe that this is not the only problem."
"I wish it were."
"Secondly, I would say that it is French law which will have the power to confiscate or freeze the assets of a specific company in order to compensate for damages or anything else, and it could establish liabilities beyond those laid down according to the objective criteria provided for in current international legislation on hydrocarbon pollution."
"That does not consider who is liable or not, simply how much should be paid; but there is a maximum ceiling, as you well know, of USD 180 million, some EUR 200 million, which, as I have said, is inadequate."
"This would therefore fall to the French Government, should the need arise."
"This kind of consideration is not the responsibility of the Commission."
"We have received no information so far about an increase in the number of inspectors, but I hope that this will happen."
"It has just been agreed that the directives must be implemented before they enter into force; then, they can take on more inspectors before the directives come into force."
"The Heads of State and Government have said this."
"Let them go ahead then."
"I hope that is the case and of course I will remind all the ministers of this at the next Council."
"With regard to European coastguards, I believe that in order to facilitate the creation of an agency we can at least begin to better coordinate the action of the various bodies which act in the various European Union waters and which are different in each country."
"That concludes this item."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0559/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission."
"First part"
"Question No 33 by (H-0873/00)"
"Subject: UK Pre-Budget Proposal on Tax Disc for foreign lorries Is the Commission aware that the British Chancellor has announced his intention (8/11/2000) to impose a special road tax on all non-UK lorries using roads in the UK?"
"Can the Commission confirm if it has received notification of this proposal and state whether it is in contravention of European free trade policy and whether such a proposal violates any EU legislation?"
"Mr President, the Commission is aware that one of the plans announced by the UK Government on 8 November 2000 was the introduction of some form of road-user charge such as a vignette payable by all road hauliers, British and non-British alike, for their use of the road network in the UK."
"The Commission sees, therefore, no indication that the announced measure introduces direct discrimination on the basis of the nationality of the haulier or the origin or destination of the vehicle."
"Provided that the implementation aspects of the charge in question do not introduce indirect discrimination either and they respect all other relevant specific rules governing the introduction of user charges in the European Union, such a charge seems at this stage to be in line with current Community law, that is Directive 1999/62/EC."
"This directive, adopted by unanimity in 1993, laid down the conditions under which Member States could, if they wanted, apply time-related user charges or motorway tolls."
"The overall aim of this legislation was the elimination of distortions of competition through the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers and the harmonisation of levy systems within the EU internal market."
"Twelve of the 15 Member States have already adjusted their levy systems with more emphasis put on direct charging, user charges or motorway tolls and less on taxes."
"The Commission considers that such adjustments go in the right direction towards the establishment of fairer charging systems which give also an incentive for a more rational and efficient use of the road network."
"The measures announced by the UK signal such a readjustment of their charging system."
"The Commission is following closely the development of the UK scheme in order to ensure its full compatibility with EU general principles and specific legislation."
"The UK government has confirmed it is in the process of preparing its reply to the Commission's request for detailed information on the entire package of measures planned in the UK."
"The Commission will then analyse and evaluate those measures."
"Depending on the outcome of this analysis, the Commission will decide what course of action to take next in view of fulfilling its role to assist Member States to take the measures which are right for them and at the same time respect the rights of the others."
"Mr President, I want to thank the Commissioner for his reply and say that I feel reassured that at least a full explanation will be required."
"My understanding is that in making the announcement the British ministers stated quite clearly that this was a tax on foreign lorries and foreign hauliers."
"The supplementary question I would like to ask is: Is it, in the Commissioner's opinion, in accordance with European law that a haulier, fully taxed and compliant with the legislation of their own country, may not drive across the border into a neighbouring state?"
"I live in a part of the Union where in order to move from part of the state to another it is necessary to drive through the United Kingdom."
"So is it acceptable that a vehicle may be stopped at the border of a neighbouring Member State if they comply with all the legal requirements in their own country?"
"Secondly: If, as the minister originally intended, he proposes to put a tax on foreign lorries to subsidise hauliers of his own nationality, is that contrary to European law?"
"President, the honourable Member will understand that it is difficult and probably inappropriate for the Commission to speculate on hypotheses and possibilities."
"I have set out in the Commission's response the principles and the criteria and assured Parliament that the Commission will analyse and follow closely the development of the UK scheme, including its implementation in practice, and of course the absence of any discrimination be it direct or indirect will be a crucial reference point in such an assessment."
"I have a similar question, number 60 actually, in the order paper."
"I thought mine and this would be coupled together but apparently that is not the procedure in this House."
"I thank Mr Monti for his reply."
"I take some reassurance from it because reading between the lines I think he is getting the message."
"Could I ask him whether he is aware that the announcement made by the British Chancellor on 8 November stated specifically - if he needs copies of the press release we can ensure he gets them - that this haulier 'Brit-tax' as we call it, was for foreign or non-British hauliers?"
"The point is that it was to placate the irate British hauliers who were protesting at fuel prices in Britain."
"Subsequently I asked the Commission if it was aware of this."
"That was changed in the face of criticism, especially from Ireland and France, and a different spin has now been put on it by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer: it is now being portrayed as a user charge for all, including British lorry drivers."
"I am sure in an election year in Britain their own lorry drivers would be interested to know that they have an extra ¬£1 500 a year to pay on top of their taxes."
"Would any attempt to rebate the British hauliers the equivalent be contrary to intra-Community trade?"
"Thank you for the supplementary question."
"I have to stick to the measures as announced and I find it even more difficult to speculate about the ramifications of the subject as I am not the Commissioner specifically in charge."
"I hope you will understand this and I can only refer back to the elements I gave in the reply provided a few minutes ago."
"In reply to the honourable Member who asked how the structure of the charging system in the UK affects competition in the road haulage sector, perhaps I could add that at the moment British hauliers pay road-tolls or user charges - ""vignettes"" - when travelling in other countries such as France or Belgium, while at the same time they pay at home high vehicle taxes through which they contribute towards the infrastructure costs of the road network in Britain."
"On the other hand non-British hauliers pay nothing when travelling in Britain."
"They therefore do not contribute at all towards road infrastructure costs in Britain and at the same time pay lower vehicles taxes at home."
"This imbalance of an economic nature between the charges and taxes imposed on hauliers in different Member States distorts the conditions under which hauliers of different nationalities compete in the UK."
"Question No 34 by (H-0916/00)"
"Subject: New BSE measures and food imports from third countries In the light of the new measures being introduced at EU level as a result of the outbreak of BSE in France and the Council' s confirmation of the need to protect the consumer and win back consumer confidence, and having regard also to Commissioner David Byrne' s White Paper on Food Safety and the establishment of a Food Safety Authority, what assurances can the Commission give with regard to the safety of food imports from third countries?"
"How can we be sure that large volumes of imports from third countries match EU standards and how will the Commission allay consumers' fears in this respect?"
"Mr President, given the evolution of the situation within the European Community, the Commission is writing to third countries drawing their attention to the measures taken in relation to BSE within the European Union and alerting them to the need to consider similar measures."
"In addition, the Scientific Steering Committee is carrying out an assessment of the geographical BSE risk of individual third countries, on which the results are expected in the first half of 2001."
"Policy towards imports from third countries will be decided in the light of this assessment."
"I have recently visited Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic where I have underlined the necessity to be vigilant in regard to the risk of BSE."
"I am committed to ensuring that the food consumers have available, whether it comes from within or outside the European Union, meets the highest standards."
"The Community has several mechanisms to protect the health of consumers with regard to the safety of food imports from third countries."
"The Food and Veterinary Office performs on-the-spot inspections and audits in third countries to verify that exports from these countries meet the EU's animal and public health requirements."
"In addition, Council Directive 97/78 of 18 December 1997 lays down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries."
"Under this directive third country exports of meat are subject to systematic checks at the Community's external frontier to ensure that Community requirements have been respected."
"The Commission is also conscious of the necessity to ensure that exports from the European Union to third countries do not constitute a risk to food safety."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response and for his very positive leadership in this crucial area, and I must say that his response has also been reassuring from a consumer perspective."
"However, the House will be aware of the resistance of some countries, mainly the United States, to conforming to EU standards on food safety."
"Can the Commissioner inform the House of the volume of meat and meat products entering the Community from third countries and the health status of these products - it may be a question that he may not be in a position to answer straight away - and can he also inform the House of the position on the use of meat-and-bone meal in animal feed in those exporting countries and the extent to which this now international problem can be addressed in the context of world trade?"
"We must find an international solution to a problem that is seriously affecting consumers worldwide."
"I am not in a position to give you exact figures in relation to the volume of imports of beef from third countries but I can say that such imports are governed by the appropriate regulations and that food safety considerations underlie that legislation."
"On the question of the use of meat-and-bone meal: their export is covered in exactly the same way by the legislation that governs the production of meat-and-bone meal within the European Union, and also with the requirement for the removal, for instance, of specified risk material from meat-and-bone meal is covered in legislation and will be in operation from 1 March 2001."
"Question No 35 by (H-0936/00)"
"Subject: EU funding for the Palestinian education system It appears that a large number of school books issued by the Palestinian Authority contain anti-Semitic statements and incitement to hatred of Jews that would result in prosecution for 'incitement to racial hatred' , in any EU Member State."
"Under the 1993 Oslo Agreements, the Union and the Fifteen provide large-scale funding for the Palestinian education system."
"The role of the European Union cannot be to fund incitement to hatred and warfare."
"Will the Commission therefore please tell me: how it views these texts, which are worthy of Mein Kampf, whether it intends in the future to make aid conditional on respect for fundamental human rights, and whether it intends to condemn the indoctrination and exploitation of children in the Israelo-Palestinian conflict?"
"Naturally I understand the honourable Member's concern."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, we have never supported financially the production or distribution of school textbooks nor the preparation of school curricula."
"Assistance to the educational system is focused mainly on infrastructure, equipment for schools and direct assistance for school expenses, for example, salaries."
"No request has ever been made by the Palestinian Authority to the Commission to finance school curricula and textbooks."
"The Commission is ready to raise this question, raised by the honourable Member, with the Palestinian Authority."
"I am also happy to draw the concerns of the honourable Member to Member States' attention although bilateral projects are matters for Member States and not for the Commission."
"I should point out, in addition, that Article 2 of the EC/Palestinian Interim Association Agreement clearly states that mutual cooperation between the parties ""has to be based on the respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which guides their internal and international policy""."
"The honourable Member may also be interested to know that we have financed several projects worth about EUR 4.5 million in recent years, designed to foster dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian youth."
"Mr President, the Jews are the enemies of the prophets and believers."
"The Jews are traitors and infidels."
"Students must understand that there is a link between Nazism, Fascism and Zionism."
"The Jews seek to persecute. They conspire with hypocrites."
"Those are a few passages from the Palestinian schoolbooks used to teach children in the territories, an education service, moreover, which we ourselves are funding to a large extent."
"As you said, Commissioner, particularly where wages are concerned, the European Union is funding a form of education which is, in reality, being twisted into anti-Semitic propaganda."
"I have asked you about the Commission' s participation in educational programmes, and you avoided the question."
"I also asked you how the Commission might monitor this aid, and you did not reply to me on this point because there is in fact no real monitoring."
"I am sorry to have to tell you that I am not satisfied with your reply."
"I asked precise questions and I expect precise replies on such a serious subject."
"Are you, yes or no, prepared to make Community aid, and not that of the Member States, conditional upon respect for fundamental human rights?"
"I quoted, as I am sure the honourable Member heard, from Article 2 of our interim association agreement with the Palestinian Authority."
"I also said that we intended to take up the issue which he had raised with the Palestinian Authority."
"I give that undertaking once again."
"We reject any attempt to use the educational system to promote intolerance or hatred."
"That is our view about the situation in the West Bank and Gaza."
"It is our view about the situation everywhere in the world."
"The main focus of our assistance in the region has always been to promote a culture of peace, tolerance and human rights."
"So I repeat, we will pursue the issue with the Palestinian authorities."
"I very much hope that in every country in the region we will find that educational services promote tolerance rather than intolerance."
"I welcome what the Commissioner said about raising this matter with the Palestinian authorities, but I want to take him back to the last part of his original answer which was the dialogue between the youth of Israel and young Palestinians."
"Will he reinforce the Community's efforts in this field?"
"That is where the future lies: to build understanding and tolerance between these two peoples."
"That starts with the young people."
"We spend some money on this but, when you consider the scale of the problem, it is still a relatively small amount of money."
"Will he look at ways of expanding that section of the Community's budget?"
"Yes, I am very happy to give that undertaking."
"The point that the honourable Member makes is an important one."
"We have to look at more projects in this area, not least those run by non-governmental organisations."
"I have seen one or two of them myself."
"Question No 36 by (H-0867/00)"
"Subject: Texaco-Chevron merger Under what framework and in what timescale does the Commission expect to respond to the announcement of a worldwide merger between the Texaco and Chevron oil companies?"
"Is it aware of allegations of serious human rights abuse against Texaco in Ecuador and against Chevron in Nigeria, both leading to pending lawsuits?"
"What part will this play in the Commission' s deliberations, and what evidence will the Commission seek from the companies in this respect?"
"The Commission services are informed by Texaco and Chevron that their announced merger would fulfil the turnover criteria of the European merger regulation."
"Texaco and Chevron have therefore entered into pre-notification discussions with the Commission's merger task force."
"Following notification, the Commission will have to assess, in view of the legal test in the Merger Regulation whether the operation will lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position, as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or in a substantial part of it."
"The Commission's assessment under the Merger Regulation can therefore only take into account competition concerns that affect European companies and citizens."
"The Merger Regulation provides no legal basis to take allegations of human rights abuses into account and the Commission therefore has no powers to investigate such alleged abuses in this context."
"That is not an unexpected answer from Mr Monti."
"However, he and his colleagues should understand that every time one of these mergers takes place we are going to carry on asking the question."
"Mr Patten, sitting alongside him, must have been squirming when he heard that answer, because in the previous question we heard a great lecture on respect for human rights."
"Then suddenly when it comes to the European Union's economic powers, they are blithely ignored."
"Let me say about Texaco that the Centre for Economic and Social Rights says that in Ecuador they are responsible for a high occurrence of abortion and abnormally high cancer rates."
"They have been accused by Ecuador's own national oil company of dominating indigenous peoples."
"In Nigeria, Chevron has been accused by the All-Ijaw indigenous people of instigating violence against them and actually paying Nigerian soldiers to shoot protesters at the Warri naval base."
"Whatever you say about the legal base and concern over competition policy, the public in Europe is concerned about such abuses of human rights."
"If you are not willing to act now, I suggest that you signpost how other action could be taken by your colleagues in the Commission against abuses of human rights which are unacceptable to all of us."
"I can assure Mr Howitt that the Commission, individual Commissioners and I personally, are very concerned about all issues pertaining to possible abuses of human rights."
"Having said that, there are, of course, different instruments for different purposes, and in the Community legal order, the Merger Regulation has the very limited, and yet important enough, objective of ensuring the protection of competition in the interests ultimately of consumers on the occasion of mergers."
"I do not believe that it would be appropriate to aim at more than one objective through a single instrument."
"The Merger Regulation is a powerful tool to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected when companies combine their activities."
"Its efficiency should therefore not be hindered by adding other objectives of a complex nature that are difficult to assess and that would at any rate not be effectively served by this specific legal instrument."
"Conversely, Member States and the European Union have at their disposal other means to deal with human-rights-related issues."
"Question No 37 by (H-0900/00)"
"Subject: Shipbuilding On 15 November the Commission published its third report on the state of shipbuilding in the world."
"The report concludes, inter alia, that the aid received by our industry has not solved the Korean issue."
"Does the Commission believe that without this aid the European shipbuilding industry would have withstood unfair competition from Korea?"
"How does it intend to guarantee the survival of what remains of the industry from January 2001 onwards in the face of unfair competition from Korea, further evidence of which is contained in its latest report?"
"In the light of the report' s findings, what trade measures are to be taken against Korea in the immediate future?"
"In its report adopted on 15 November the Commission concluded that operating aid under Regulation 1540/98 has not provided a solution to the problem of South Korean pricing practices."
"However, among the various actions proposed, it committed itself to examine as soon as possible the possibilities to propose measures to address the Korean problem in accordance with the Regulation."
"At its meeting of 29 November, the Commission reaffirmed that it is against any prolongation of operating aid."
"However, it indicated that it is ready to explore the possibilities for greater use of national support for research and development, including appropriate changes to Regulation 1540/98."
"The Commission also recalled that substantial funding for research and development is available under the Community research framework programme."
"As regards trade actions, on 2 December the Commission published its decision to open an investigation following industry's complaint under the Trade Barriers Regulation (TBR)."
"In the context of this TBR procedure, the Commission can decide to resort to WTO dispute settlement procedure unless a mutually satisfactory solution is agreed with the authorities of the Republic of Korea."
"The final investigation report will be transmitted to Member States by April 2001."
"In addition, if in the framework of the TBR procedure the Commission does not achieve a negotiated solution with Korea satisfactory for the European Union, the Commission will report to the Council by 1 May 2001 and will propose to bring the case to the WTO in order to seek remedy against unfair Korean practices."
"In addition, the Commission will, at the same time, propose a defensive temporary support mechanism, specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices for a period necessary for the conclusion of the WTO procedure."
"This mechanism will be limited to those market segments where it has been demonstrated that EU industry has been directly injured by unfair Korean trade practices."
"On a multilateral level, the Commission will pursue its efforts to establish a level international playing field for the shipbuilding industry within the OECD."
"The Commission's position was presented to the Industry Council on 5 December and the Council welcomed the Commission's determination to tackle the problem of unfair Korean competition and took note of the Commission's proposals in this regard."
"Commissioner, firstly, to a certain extent I feel reassured because I notice that the Commission has been concerned with, and has perhaps also done something about, this problem."
"However, the dates mentioned by the Commissioner - there was a meeting on 29 November, on 2 December it was decided to open an investigation, and then it is said that it may happen within six months, etc. are not very illuminating."
"I believe that the intentions as a whole are hugely reassuring, but the reality is that meanwhile our dockyards are closing down."
"I come from a country, Spain, and specifically the Basque Country, where there is nobody left building ships because we cannot cope with Korean competition."
"The Korean shipbuilders are quite happy to carry out dumping - not only with regard to the European Union, but also the whole world - and I cannot see any solution to it."
"I would be grateful if we could take immediate and crucial measures."
"Commissioner, you know that unfair competition on the part of Korea has been proven."
"The Commission has been there and has seen it."
"We are now facing a long process."
"We will possibly have to wait half a year to know whether or not the World Trade Organisation will condemn the unfair competition of the Koreans."
"And we must not forget that Mr Valdivielso de Cu√© asked you if the Commission believed that, without the aid which the shipbuilding industry had received, this industry would have been able to survive in the European Union."
"This is a dramatic issue."
"Mr Valdivielso de Cu√© referred to Spain, to the Basque Country and I must refer to Galicia, which is an Objective 1 region, with a very important shipbuilding tradition and which is asking, because it is an Objective 1 region, for this aid to be maintained in some way until the dispute in the World Trade Organisation is settled. The WTO will condemn - it must condemn - the unfair competition on the part of Korea."
"That is the question: is the Commission prepared to prolong certain aid, at least in the case of the most needy regions that have a major shipbuilding tradition, so that they can survive in the face of this unfair competition?"
"The Commission report has established that, as operating aid has not been helpful in solving the problems created by unfair Korean competition, we decided not to prolong those operating aids."
"At the same time it was decided that Mr Lamy should in further negotiations and actions vis-√†-vis Korea, have the most powerful and focussed instruments."
"We believe that would not be represented by an across-the-board continuation of the existing operating aid but rather by the Commission being prepared to come up with a focused and specific instrument in the event of the actions undertaken by Commissioner Lamy on behalf of the Commission not being successful for the European Union industry."
"Second Part Questions to Mr Lamy"
"Question No 38 by (H-0868/00)"
"Subject: Anti-dumping duty on import of coke of coal in pieces European foundries and the insulation industry are using coke over 80 mm in diameter and are employing more than 100 000 people within the Community, while Community producers of coke employ no more than 800 people."
"Does the Commission find it in the interest of the Community to protect the EU coke industry, which has already benefited from substantial price increases, and thereby seriously harm the user industries which employ substantially more people?"
"How does the Commission expect the user industry to remain competitive in the face of competition from iron castings from the Far East when the user industry has little or no possibility of increasing its prices?"
"In the light of the foregoing, an increase of imports of coke can be expected from third countries leading to higher emissions of sulphuric acid."
"If so, is the Commission's decision in conformity with the Community's energy and environmental policies?"
"On this issue of coke imports, I should like to begin by emphasising that the Commission services have - as is only right - undertaken a very thorough analysis of dumping on the part of the Chinese, the resultant harm caused to European industry and the possible consequences for users of the coke."
"As a result of the investigations, it was concluded that there is no doubt about the dumping and the damage it causes and that the effect of the anti-dumping measures on the user industries would be limited."
"Particular attention has been paid to the issue of employment."
"Coke-using industry employs a total of 70 000 people, but this product represents only a very marginal portion of its costs, in the region of 2%."
"It has also been established that the coke-using industry was able to pass on a moderate increase in its prices to its clients."
"There are therefore unlikely to be harmful effects on employment and competition in the coke-using industry."
"With regard, however, to the coke industry itself, which directly employs 1 900 people in coke production, the situation has deteriorated to such an extent, due to dumping on the part of the Chinese, that site closures are now envisaged."
"The increase in prices which would result from the anti-dumping measures should enable the coke industry to become profitable again."
"In the light of all the arguments presented, it has therefore been concluded that imposing anti-dumping measures was in the general and overall interests of the European Union."
"Although the investigations into dumping do not consider the environmental aspect, which should, however, be considered in the wider context, I should like to point out that Community environmental legislation sets emission limits which must be respected both by producers and by the user industry, whatever the origin of the coke. So, whether the coke is from China or elsewhere, the environmental consequences are the same."
"This investigation has been carried out according to the usual procedure."
"I believe it to be fair and transparent, and all the arguments put forward by the user industry have, as usual, been duly taken into account."
"Mr Commissioner, I can understand that you do not wish to change your decision despite the fact that ten Member States are against such a duty."
"I strongly disagree with you, Mr Lamy."
"I disagree with you on this matter just as much as I agreed with you this afternoon concerning the Korean shipbuilding policy."
"I believe it is important to emphasise that here we are looking at a coke industry that has only 800 employees, but that we have a user industry with over 6 000 employees that would be adversely affected in purely competitive terms by such an anti-dumping duty."
"I can however understand the fact that you still disagree with me, so I probably have nothing to gain from putting the question to you one more time, but I believe that you should take account of the fact that ten Member States are against such a duty."
"I have nothing to add."
"The proportion of jobs is not in fact the same."
"It is just that in one case the risk is acute and in the other it is not."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 39 and 40 will be taken together."
"Question No 39 by (H-0883/00)"
"Subject: Everything except armaments Is the Commission content that this dramatic proposal - which may well have dire consequences for already hard-pressed sugar beet farmers in the European Union - should be passed without any consultation of the directly-elected European Parliament?"
"Question No 40 by (H-0889/00)"
"Subject: Market access for less developed and developing countries Does the Commission intend to honour its obligation under the Cotonou Agreement to consult ACP countries, and undertake country and sector specific impact studies, before the Council takes a decision on the Commission's proposals to grant duty-free and quota-free access to the European market for all products, except armaments, from the world's 48 least developed or developing countries?"
"I shall answer both questions at the same time."
"The Commission' s proposed regulation which we have designated 'Everything but arms' is designed to give least and less developed countries access to the Community market, duty-free and quota-free, for all exports except for arms."
"This proposal, which follows on from the multiple commitments made by the Community in favour of least and less developed countries, is aimed at promoting the integration of these countries into the world economy."
"We think that it is, indeed, imperative that the process of globalisation should not cause the poorest developing countries to become marginalised."
"This initiative is based upon a Council regulation amending the regulation which defines the current GSP."
"The Commission' s proposal is based upon Article 133 which, as you know, does not at present lay down any legal obligation to consult Parliament."
"I entirely agree that this proposal is an important decision which should be subject to the codecision procedure."
"That is what the Commission proposed to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In tabling its proposal, which was fully supported by Parliament, the Commission envisaged having recourse to the codecision procedure in the case of all standards of general scope, such as this one, defining the essential features of common trade policy."
"The result has now been obtained and you know as well as I do that the Intergovernmental Conference has not taken up this suggestion, since no Member State supported it."
"The Commission cannot contravene current Treaty rules."
"Consulting Parliament on this proposal and taking account of arguments which Parliament might be led to put forward is therefore a political decision which, as the texts currently stand, is solely at the Council' s discretion."
"Out of a concern to ensure effective political scrutiny by Parliament, I have however made efforts to keep the European Parliament informed as far as possible."
"In particular, I informed your Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy of this initiative on 11 October 2000, and I am of course prepared to appear again before Parliament' s relevant committee in order to discuss this proposal."
"Regarding Glenys Kinnock' s question concerning the link between this initiative and the Cotonou agreement, I should like to say again that the Commission entirely respected the spirit and the letter of the provisions of this agreement when it came to informing and consulting the ACP countries."
"We forwarded our proposal to the ACP countries at practically the same time as to our Member States."
"We invited the ACP countries to begin consultations."
"These consultations were conducted within the framework of the ACP sub-committee for commercial cooperation which met on 21 November 2000."
"The Member States intimated that they would like the Commission to present a more detailed impact assessment before taking a decision."
"The assessment is under way and the results will be communicated to the ACP countries as soon as they are available."
"Obviously, the real impact of the initiative in favour of the least and less developed countries will depend upon their ability to respond, something which is extremely difficult to foresee and to model."
"We are therefore prepared to monitor the effects of this initiative and its results very carefully and to examine, if need be together with the ACP States, the measures which might be required in order to preserve their competitive position in the Community' s markets."
"Mr President, may I thank the Commissioner very much for his very positive reply about cooperation with Parliament."
"I am sure all my colleagues are very grateful."
"This particular subject is of great concern to British sugar beet growers as you can imagine, because it is about the only crop that is profitable in the UK at the moment."
"I represent some growers and I am thus very concerned indeed."
"I note, incidentally, that British Conservatives claim to represent the countryside in the UK, yet not one of them is present in the Chamber to ask you a question."
"Would you please tell us what you think the impact on the price of sugar will be in the UK as a result of your proposal?"
"Mr President, may I thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"Would you confirm, Commissioner, that the Coreper GSP Working Group has been postponed for the second time?"
"Is that because they are waiting for a revised proposal from you and for the impact studies?"
"Secondly, you talked about the spirit of Cotonou being honoured."
"That is not the view of the ACP trade ministers who met this week, who said that they would expect the European Commission to honour existing agreements."
"What they feel, Commissioner, is that Cotonou was very carefully negotiated by the ACP and that within five months, almost before the ink is dry, there are proposals without any consultation."
"Of course, you had consultation after the event, but not before, which is part of the agreement under Cotonou, as you know, as is the need for joint impact studies to be undertaken."
"Thirdly, Commissioner, would you agree with me that vulnerable small island economies, particularly of course in the Caribbean, who are dependent on certain commodities like bananas, sugar and rice, should deserve to be a special case?"
"With regard to beet sugar, it has not escaped me that sugar beet farmers and sugar producers were concerned about this initiative."
"It is true that the price of sugar in the European Union is now three times higher than on the world market. This does indeed present a problem."
"I should like, moreover, to reassure you that this initiative is not designed to solve that problem, given that the additional amounts which might be imported into the Community market are so small."
"In fact, it is a question of authorising access to greater quantities which are small as far as we are concerned, and therefore not destabilising, but which represent large amounts for these countries, given the size of their economies."
"The initiative is not therefore of a kind which will destabilise the highly protected Community sugar market."
"If need be, we shall include the necessary precautions in the amendments we are working on."
"This ties in with Mrs Kinnock' s question."
"We are in fact working on a number of amendments with a view to making this proposal acceptable both to the Council and to Parliament."
"We are working on these in committee, but no decisions were taken on the matter this week, as Poul Nielson was absent on a visit to the Balkans."
"Like Mrs Kinnock, I am aware of the difficult situation facing small islands."
"We shall ensure, by means of safeguard clauses or transitional periods, that these proposals do not have too serious an impact upon these regions."
"Finally, I would thank Mrs Kinnock for informing me about the work of the meeting of ACP Trade Ministers which took place in Brussels this week."
"I was present at the meeting and broached this issue with the ministers who, following the meeting, voted for a resolution favourable to the Commission' s initiative."
"Commissioner Lamy, when I asked you about this earlier this year at a previous Question Time you said this was not possible for a further five or six years."
"Can you explain what has changed your mind?"
"There are many cynical people amongst the developing countries who see this simply as a way of trying to buy them off in future WTO negotiations."
"Are you being sincere in trying to help developing countries?"
"Can you comment on the analysis given by some NGOs that the least-developed countries, without capacity-building measures, without a change in the sugar price, given the fact that they are net sugar importers, may not be able to exploit what we are offering?"
"Finally, can you comment on whether this was discussed within the College of Commissioners today?"
"If so, what was the nature of that discussion and would you expect any movement on this issue before you come before our committee on Development and Cooperation next Strasbourg on 16 January?"
"Where the procedural questions are concerned, Mr Howitt, I have just told you what stage the Commission' s discussions had reached, so I will not return to the matter."
"Regarding contacts with the relevant committees of the European Parliament, I am of course available to them in the usual way."
"With regard to whether or not this is a tactical gesture designed to win the favour of least and less developed countries within the framework of a round of negotiations, I would point out straight away that this is not the case."
"In view of their situation, these countries unfortunately have no capacity for autonomous negotiation, and it is therefore a gesture which we ought, in my opinion, to make unilaterally, without anything in return."
"With regard, finally, to the problems it might cause for other economies, we are taking the necessary steps, and it is in this spirit that we are busy re-examining the Commission' s proposal so that the impact on other ACP countries is as limited as possible."
"As my colleague Bill Newton-Dunn said, we have a number of colleagues in the UK who are indulging in fairly standard if facile anti-European scaremongering on this proposal and they have got a large number of sugarbeet farmers extremely worried."
"We need your help to be able to persuade our constituents and our farming community that the claims made by the anti-European wing in our political environment, and indeed others, are wrong."
"To that end, could you perhaps reassure me firstly when the impact assessment will be available to us so that we can cite it to perhaps explode some of the apocalyptic claims that have surrounded your proposal and, secondly, give some more details about the safeguard clause which I think you are considering introducing into this measure and also the transition period before the measure finally gets implemented?"
"The impact assessment, Mr Clegg, is at present being prepared within Mr Fischler' s directorate."
"He has asked them to be as quick as they can, and I hope the assessment will be available soon."
"Let us have no illusions: given the state of the economies concerned, it is difficult to devise models for their ability to respond on these matters."
"On the second point, we shall be issuing background information."
"The safeguard clause is currently being worked upon and, if Mr Clegg needs background arguments in order to talk with the sugar beet farmers, I shall make these available to him."
"As it happens, I myself come from a French region which grows a lot of sugar beet, and I have some knowledge of these matters which I should be very happy to share with him."
"Questions Nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing."
"Question to Mr Liikanen"
"Question No 43 by (H-0917/00)"
"Subject: Combating child sex tourism During the part-session in October, the Commission replied to my question on the EU's continued support for ECPAT in Sweden's campaign against child sex tourism by saying that much of the Commission's work, which is carried out with meagre budgetary resources, will be terminated as it requires a large number of staff to a large extent."
"However, the Commission also promised to continue the campaign against child sex tourism by endeavouring to make funds available for the ECPAT project for 2001 and by continuing to combat child sex tourism in the future through other programmes."
"How will ECPAT be funded during 2001? What is the long-term strategy for its funding, and how will funds be released so that work to combat child sex tourism can also be carried out in countries outside the European Union in the future?"
"Mr President, the Commission has received an application for funds for measures to be taken against child sex tourism."
"These shall be carried out by four international organisations during 2001."
"These funds can be allocated by means of the commitment appropriation under budget item B7-663 in the budget for the year 2000."
"One of the four organisations is ECPAT, whose measures in this area during 2001, which are eligible for aid, are wholly covered by this application."
"The Commission's procedure for granting the desired financial support will soon be complete, and this also includes the funds which ECPAT requires for 2001."
"As from 2001 it is the Commission's intention to finance actions against sex tourism by implementing the on-going programmes against child sex tourism."
"Programmes like Stop and Daphne have been earmarked by the Commission to allow child sex tourism to be fought as a form of sexual exploitation of children and violence against children in the candidate countries too."
"In addition, specific projects financed within the framework of the European Union's policy for development and external relations can also relate to work in the fight against child sex tourism in countries outside the European Union."
"These different instruments are also open to organisations like ECPAT and their partners in the countries concerned."
"Mr President, there are eleven days to go until Christmas, and today in Sweden and Finland they are celebrating the festival of Lucia."
"I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for what was in all respects a very positive and excellent reply."
"May I nevertheless request a few clarifications?"
"Is it certain that ECPAT can continue their project next year, i.e. in 2001?"
"Is it also certain that the budget item used for measures for fighting child sex tourism is not being deleted but can still be used?"
"Do the funds that are being granted involve more money, or is it a question of the same level as before?"
"I would like to say with gratitude that I am aware that you, Commissioner Liikanen, have devoted yourself to this issue with commitment and enthusiasm after Maj-Britt Theorin and myself updated you on it on 4 October."
"Mr President, this year the Commission is making decisions concerning the funds which can be used during 2001."
"This means that measures to be carried out during 2001 can be financed by funds covered by the budget for that year."
"As far as the budget for 2001 is concerned, we must first wait for Parliament's decision."
"Then the Commission must consider the best way to implement the measures for fighting child sex tourism."
"I am prepared to come back to the honourable Members of the European Parliament once the budget has been voted on and the Commission has discussed the issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, this very night we shall be discussing the proposal for a Council Decision on European digital content."
"One of our concerns in connection with this Decision is the need to determine how harmful content can best be kept off the Net in future."
"Are there plans to establish hotlines that would enable European citizens to report discoveries of harmful Internet content to a central agency?"
"What about Internet groups, Internet police units and user groups which are formed with a view to uncovering harmful content on the Net?"
"Are there also plans for technical mechanisms to filter harmful content out of the Internet in future?"
"We have three types of activities in this area."
"One concerns activities which are directly criminal."
"In that area we are working at the moment with Mr Vitorino to produce a communication on cyber-crime."
"I hope that will come to the Commission very soon."
"The second area is technology."
"We need technology, for instance to enable parents who want to filter the content of the Internet to do so."
"We have had a particular project for that."
"The third area has been particular actions like hotlines."
"I will discuss that issue with my services once the budget resources for next year are clear."
"I will be happy to come back to Mr R√ºbig after that."
"Questions to Mr Bolkestein"
"Question No 44 by (H-0872/00)"
"Subject: European Patents Court What is the present stage in preparations for establishing a European Patents Court, and how does the Commission assess the proposed site of Munich?"
"The proposal for a Community patent regulation provides for the setting up of a Community tribunal specialised in patents, which would mainly be authorised to settle disputes with regard to the validity and infringements of the Community patent."
"These new legal powers, however, require a change in the European Treaty."
"A few days ago, the European Council took a positive decision to this effect in Nice."
"A new article in the Treaty provides for a possible increase in the powers of the European Court in this sense."
"The issue of the geographical location of the new tribunal is not discussed in the Commission proposal."
"The new tribunal will be integrated into the Community court, which is, of course, the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"Mr President, I only wanted to ask you to update us on efforts within the Commission to incorporate the European Patent Office gradually into the structure of the European Union. Is this not one of your strategies for the future?"
"Would it not therefore make sense for the European Patent Court to be based in the same place as the European Patent Office?"
"I am grateful for your letter in response to the initiative I took with Mr W√ºrmeling."
"In that letter, you said the Court must be centrally located."
"I should like to point out that Munich is situated in the heart of Europe and is also very accessible."
"I am aware that Munich has seen major economic activity in the field of patents."
"This is why the patent office is based in Munich."
"However, I am of the opinion that it is premature at this stage to enter into a discussion as to where the future Community patent tribunal should be based."
"At present, the efforts of myself and my offices are focused on limiting the effects which the distance between the parties and the future tribunal may have."
"Indeed, we intend to ensure that the centralised jurisdiction is near to all members of the judiciary across the Community."
"I would like to add that it is difficult to have a Community or centralised patent without centralised jurisdiction."
"Because if that was not the case, this would mean that there would be a tribunal in all Member States of the European Union for administering justice on patent infringement procedures, and that could mean that a German company could find itself in a tribunal in country X, far removed from the registered office of that company, and with enlargement in the offing, that could imply far greater distances still."
"It is essential that one judicial body be put in place, both in first instance and in appeal, where patent disputes are settled."
"As Mr Bolkestein is aware, members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, including myself, have expressed a certain concern in our previous dialogue about the risk of a proliferation of Community jurisdictions running alongside and in parallel with those of the Members."
"Hitherto the main thrust has been one whereby litigation is primarily focused in Member State courts but problems of interpretation of Community law are centralised in the sense of references to the Court."
"That has been a way of ensuring that the law is consistent throughout the Union and yet is locally administered."
"I would like to be assured that the Commission will consider very carefully the virtues of such an approach, because I suspect a proliferation of jurisdictions may, in the end, fragment our legal systems."
"I am not sure what the honourable Member means by the word 'proliferation' ."
"Does he mean a geographical proliferation or a functional proliferation, according to various subject matters?"
"If Mr MacCormick means a functional proliferation of courts of justice, I can see his point of view."
"I understand that his concern is that there should not be a proliferation of special tribunals dealing with this, that and the other."
"That is certainly an understandable point of view, which I share."
"However, patents, represent very specialised work."
"Just as the law courts in D√ºsseldorf, Munich and elsewhere in Germany have specialised in the law of patents and there is also a specialised court in London, a Community court to sit upon and judge cases concerning Community patents would have to be very specialised."
"It is not work that could be given to a new judge - if I may put it that way - even though that judge might be very experienced in other fields."
"Therefore, the specialised courts which the European Commission wants to see come into being, to deal with all possible litigation concerning Community patents, would have to consist of specialised judges and would, therefore, perhaps be organisationally a part of the Court in Luxembourg but, as far as its work is concerned, form a specialised part of that Court."
"Having said all that, I agree with Mr MacCormick that one should be very sparing in erecting special tribunals."
"We do not want a tribunal for traffic accidents, international agreements, or for maritime law, etc."
"These matters would continue to be the normal province of the Court in Luxembourg and certainly the Commission would not want any special arrangements for normal cases."
"Question No 45 by (H-0879/00)"
"Subject: Community trade mark courts Article 91 of Regulation (EC) 40/94 requires the Member States to set up at least one court to deal with private disputes arising from Community trade marks."
"Some countries have set up such courts, including Spain, which faces an additional difficulty because, under the provisions of the regulation, it is the Spanish court which has jurisdiction in disputes between non-Community undertakings."
"What measures does the Commission plan to take to ensure that Member States which have not yet done so set up Community trade mark courts?"
"Mr Berenguer Fuster' s question relates to trade marks."
"The Commission empathises with the situation Mr Berenguer Fuster has cited."
"This situation not only applies to Spain, but also to other Member States, such as France, Luxembourg, Italy and Greece."
"This is why the Commission contacted the Member States concerned prior to sending the reminder."
"Those contacts have been successful to the extent that, over the past year, another three Member States have submitted their lists with courts of first and second instance for the Community trade mark."
"Despite this, we are of the opinion that the situation, which has admittedly improved but is still unsatisfactory, cannot continue any longer."
"Accordingly, the Commission will take all measures which it deems necessary."
"Paragraph 5 of Article 91 of the Community trade mark regulation stipulates that, as long as a Member State has not notified the Commission which courts of first and second instance are authorised, each procedure must be instituted at the judicial body of that Member State which is given absolute or relative powers."
"To prevent this provisional situation from turning into a permanent one, on 13 July of last year, the Commission reminded the Member States concerned in a letter, of their obligation to designate courts for the Community trade mark."
"Since then, those countries have still not notified the Commission that they have taken steps."
"Consequently, as the Commission has no information whatsoever on the basis of which it can conclude that these Member States have taken the necessary measures, it recently sent a written reminder to those countries."
"If the Member States do not respond to this reminder, or give an unsatisfactory response, the Commission, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty, can decide to open an infringement procedure on account of non-compliance with Community legislation."
"Commissioner, you say that you are going to adopt the necessary measures, one of which is the opening of an infringement procedure."
"I feel particularly obliged to mention the problem of Spain."
"This is not only for obvious reasons of nationality and concern, but for an additional reason: Article 92 of the Regulation on the Community Trade Mark lays down that certain additional competences created under the Community trade mark will be attributed to Spanish courts and tribunals, for disputes between two companies which do not have effective establishments within the European Union."
"Since the Commissioner has said that Spain is one of countries which is not complying, even though it is the country of the headquarters of the Community Trade Marks Office, this makes it genuinely significant that Spain has not been complying with this obligation since November 1996."
"I believe that the Commission' s patience has run out and, if it must begin this infringement procedure, let it do so straight away."
"I can only agree with the Member who has put the question to me, that enough is enough."
"I thank Mr Berenguer Fuster for making such a strong plea to the Commission."
"I take it as a stimulus to renew our action and to see to it that Spain does what it ought to do just as soon as possible."
"Question No 46 by (H-0875/00)"
"Subject: Thessaloniki underground rail system After more than eight years, the Thessaloniki underground rail system - an infrastructure project designed to promote the sustainable economic development of the city - still unfortunately exists only on paper in the 2nd CSF, the local newspapers and the Ministry for the Environment, Regional Planning and Public Works."
"The Commission's answers to my previous questions since last February (H-0011/00, H-0066/00, H-0513/00 and H-0566/00) are a prime example of evasion and the Community's endless political and bureaucratic procrastination, reflecting as they do the Commission's mismanagement and evident inability to investigate swiftly and effectively the allegations that Community rules have been breached in the performance of the contract."
"How many years does the Commission intend to deliberate over the measures to be taken in response to the allegations and what are the implications of the delay in taking a decision?"
"What stage has been reached in this affair and what does the Commission intend to do if it is established that Community rules have been broken?"
"Can the work go ahead with joint funding from the Community through the 2nd CSF and the European Investment Bank or is there an obstacle in this respect?"
"Have appropriations been set aside under the 3rd CSF to carry out the project?"
"The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that a complaint is pending regarding the Thessaloniki underground rail project."
"The plaintiff claims that Community provisions have been violated with regard to state support and public contracts."
"As the honourable Member of your House is aware, the lodging of a complaint has in itself no bearing on the progress of the project."
"The Commission is of the opinion that questions regarding delays in the execution of the project must be put to the competent Greek authorities."
"As far as those aspects of the case which pertain to provisions on public contracts are concerned, the services of the Commission have made their position clear to the plaintiff in a letter which will be sent in the next couple of days."
"Accordingly, we are unable to provide the honourable Member with the information requested at this moment in time."
"Also, the Commission has assessed whether the funding of the project can be reconciled with the rules of the Treaty in terms of state support and has not reached a verdict yet."
"It appears that the Greek government has not yet reached agreement with the franchise holder on all the conditions for funding the project."
"The Commission has not yet received notification pursuant to Article 88 (3) of the Treaty."
"Consequently, the Commission is unable to examine all the facts of this case and take a final decision in which it gives its assessment of the situation."
"In broader terms, the Commission would like to make the honourable Member aware of the fact that a complaint of such complexity must be investigated very carefully indeed."
"This is why the Commission is closely following the case within the procedural framework which encompasses the relevant provisions of the Treaty and derived legislation."
"With regard to the actual funding of the project, the Commission would notify the honourable Member that the Community has already funded activities leading up to the project to the tune of EUR 5.8 million under the second Community EFRO specification."
"The request to fund the balance has been included in the operational programme proposed by the Greek authorities. The programme, entitled transport axes, ports, urban development, has been submitted to the Commission under the 2000-2006 Community specification."
"It is expected that the proposal will be approved by the Commission early next year, which is very shortly."
"It stipulates that the Thessaloniki underground rail project can be part-financed by the EFRO for a maximum of EUR 122 million, whilst the contribution of the national government will amount to approx. 122 million and the franchise holder must pitch in with EUR 413 million."
"Commissioner, I have to confess that you have not enlightened me, or rather you have not told me anything which I did not know already, because this accusation was laid at the Commission's door a year ago."
"You replied in answer to my previous question that Spain was to blame and that you would do what you had to do, but here it is you who are to blame."
"Because, despite knowing about this accusation for a year, you have not taken a decision."
"As a result, with such a huge matter pending, the European Investment Bank is refusing to grant a loan and I fail to see how you can include the project in the third CSF without taking this decision."
"I should like to point out that the European ombudsman has specifically told me that he will respond to my accusations by the end of this month."
"What I want from you is a specific date by which you will reply to me, together with your interpretation of the European Investment Bank's action and whether its present refusal to fund the project is due to the fact that the project is currently bogged down at the Commission - this too is an accusation which you have not investigated."
"I would very much like to say the following to Mr Trakattellis. As the Commission has already explained and as Mr Trakattellis is aware, I suspect, this is an extremely complex matter and the alleged violations of Community law are not clear."
"Furthermore, the aspects of the case regarding state support cannot be investigated by the Commission before the financial side of the agreement has been completed."
"In this context, I would also like to point out that the plaintiff, from the time that the franchise agreement was made public in Greece, has taken eight months to make up his own mind and lodge his complaint with the Commission."
"In other words, I do not think that the Commission can be accused of any negligence."
"The Commission acquits itself of its duty as quickly and meticulously as possible."
"I would very much like to assure Mr Trakattellis of this fact."
"Question No 47 by (H-0877/00)"
"Subject: Free movement of goods and the right to strike I refer to the answer from the Commission to my question P-3079/00, in which it states that the right to strike has to be respected pursuant to Regulation (EC) 2679/98."
"At the same time, it indicates its willingness to intervene against barriers to the freedom of movement regardless whether they stem from industrial action."
"This is a clear internal contradiction which can be clearly seen in the following hypothetical example."
"In the course of a lawful industrial dispute in Swedish ports the trade unions impose a blockade and the loading and discharging of ships is brought to a halt."
"Would that be a situation in which the Commission would have to order the Member State government to intervene to ensure that the free movement of goods in the internal market is not interrupted?"
"How long could the strike continue before it threatened free movement?"
"How far would the Member State have to go to restore free movement?"
"Would the Member State have to use legislation to oblige the two sides of industry to accept a settlement via compulsory mediation by the government?"
"The previous answer which the Commission gave to question P-3079/00 may well have been interpreted incorrectly."
"This is why, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to make a point of imparting the following piece of information to Mr Sj√∂stedt. All Member States are bound by Regulation 2679/98 which clearly states that the regulation may not be interpreted in a way which could in any way prejudice the constitutional rights as recognised in the Member States, including the right to strike or freedom to strike."
"It is obvious that the Commission respects this principle."
"Having said this, pursuant to the same regulation, Member States need to take all necessary and proportionate measures to restore the free movement of goods on their territory as soon as possible so as to avoid serious disruptions to the free movement of goods when a restriction as defined in the regulation has occurred in the context of a strike or similar action."
"Furthermore, Member States must notify the Commission of any restriction occurring on their territory and of the action undertaken by them."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that Member States must decide for themselves what constitutes a legal strike pursuant to their legislation."
"I would like to underline that the Member States have exclusive authority to define whether, when and to what extent measures are necessary and commensurate so as to facilitate the free movement of goods on their territory."
"This is clear from recital 6 of the regulation."
"The principles which I have outlined apply to all questions raised by Mr Sj√∂stedt."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"It was a fine clarification of the reply I received earlier."
"As I understand it, the Commission guarantees that it neither will, nor can, intervene in legal trade conflicts even if they restrict free movement."
"If this is the case, then I thank you for that."
"I can only reiterate what I said a moment ago."
"It is up to the Member State to decide whether a strike is legal."
"If a physical barrier is obstructing a trade flow, then the Commission, having called upon the Member State in question, expects to be notified of the measures the latter intends to take in order to lift the barrier."
"This means therefore that the Commission will only deploy the legal aids it has at its disposal within the meaning of the regulation."
"Any further legal aids used within the territory itself are to be decided upon by the inhabitants and economic operators of the Member State in question."
"Question No 48 by (H-0880/00):"
"Subject: Degrees awarded by UK universities with branches in Greece, and Directive 89/48/EEC In its answer to my question E-3159/00 the Commission dealt only with diplomas awarded by French universities under franchise agreements with Greek free study centres to students taking courses in Greece in the initial years and usually spending their last year of study at the foreign university, from which they receive their diplomas."
"However, most of the franchise agreements the Greek free study centres have concluded have been with UK universities."
"What is the status of UK university degrees awarded under such agreements? Do they have to be recognised in Greece as falling under Directive 89/48/EEC and, if so, in which subjects, and do they similarly apply in the other countries of the European Union?"
"The Commission' s response to Mr Alavanos' question in writing only pertains to diplomas awarded by French universities in the context of franchise agreements, because the bulk of the enquiries to the Commission concerned those cases."
"In the case of diplomas awarded by British universities in the context of a franchise agreement with a Greek study centre, the validity is established on the basis of the rules which apply in the Member State in which the university which has concluded the agreement is based, the United Kingdom in this case."
"Awarding a diploma in this way does not contravene UK legislation and can thus be deemed legal."
"The diploma is then British."
"Directive 89/48/EEC pertains to higher-education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration."
"Diplomas of a lower level fall within the scope of Directive 92/51/EEC, and these directives apply irrespective of whether the diploma has been awarded on completion of a course at the university itself or at a study centre which has signed a franchise agreement with said university."
"The directives apply to professions which do not fall within one particular directive."
"The principles which I have explained here apply equally to all Member States or in all Member States of the European Union."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for attempting to answer my question, but I should point out that students in Greece are currently somewhat confused because the free study centres are claiming that they are able to issue study diplomas which qualify for recognition under Directive 89/48/EEC, if, and provided that, the course in question is completed in Britain, while the Greek authorities and the competent bodies are refusing to recognise diplomas issued for courses completed in Britain."
"It looks pretty much to me, at the moment, as if the Commission is washing its hands like Pontius Pilate."
"The question is: who should these students apply to in order to confirm that, if they take these courses and complete their studies in Britain, they are entitled to have results?"
"President, may I first of all say that the Commission has no desire to play the role of Pontius Pilate, in particular because of the sequel to what Pontius Pilate did, so I hope that the honourable Member of this Parliament will forgive me for saying that the Commission wishes to play a different role in this whole area."
"As to the matter itself, it is really quite simple."
"A French university and a British university have entered into a contract with an educational establishment in Greece and students from France, Britain or any other country study in those institutions in Greece."
"They take their examinations there under the supervision of the French or British university, and the degrees which are eventually granted are British and French degrees."
"If then the student in that establishment, perhaps a Greek student, does not gain recognition for his diploma or degree in Greece, then I am afraid there is no alternative other than for him to address himself to the Greek authorities saying that he has been awarded a French or a British degree en bonne et due forme, as the French expression is."
"He should therefore address himself to those authorities in order to get redress."
"I am afraid the Commission cannot do anything in that respect, but it will of course follow such cases with extreme interest."
"Question No 49 by (H-0912/00)"
"Subject: Transport links across the straits between Vaasa, Finland and Ume√•, Sweden Shipping in the narrows of the Gulf of Bothnia is to be discontinued, since it is unprofitable now that shipping firms have no opportunities for tax-free sales."
"This is very harmful to the varied relations between the two regions, and I can think of only three ways of helping:"
"obtaining a EU subsidy to support the unprofitable regional traffic network,"
"building a bridge (or tunnel) to cross the straits at a suitable point, or"
"declaring the island of Raippaluoto off Vaasa an independent kingdom, through which shipping firms can pass and thus continue their tax-free sales."
"In the last case, the city of Vaasa which owns the area could content itself with renting out the island for the kingdom' s use, or could even set conditions for its use, e.g. by prohibiting tax-haven activities."
"The king might be elected for a fixed period from among the most deserving Finnish MEPs!"
"Seriously, though, what is the Commission' s view of how to resolve this transport problem which affects many people?"
"The Commission recognises that the Kvarken region and in particular the ferry route between Vaasa in Finland and Ume√• in Sweden may have been affected by the decision taken by the Council to abolish duty-free sales for intra-Community travellers."
"As has been pointed out on previous occasions, several instruments exist at EU level to deal with specific problems that could arise."
"It is, however, up to Member States to identify possible needs for action and to set their priorities for the use of such instruments."
"For the period 2000 to 2006, Finland and Sweden in cooperation with Norway have submitted a programme proposal under the Interreg Community initiative for the Kvarken-Mittskandia area."
"This proposal is currently under consideration by the Commission services."
"The proposal includes actions to examine infrastructure and communications across the Kvarken and also between Sweden and Norway, and it is expected to be approved in the coming weeks, which would allow projects to be submitted early next year."
"At this stage I am not able to assess the impact of this programme, which has yet to be put into place."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I thank you for this reply, which raises our hopes."
"At present we are looking for other more profitable ships and service operators to take the place of those that have now discontinued service, and the intention would be to combine passenger and freight traffic."
"Could you imagine how the Interreg programme you mentioned might help projects like these, which bring shipping services into operation?"
"That project would have a clear impact on employment."
"For example, in Vaasa, the city I mentioned, 550 jobs have been lost in the last two years in the travel and tourism industry alone, which may have been the result of stopping duty-free sales."
"Mr President, as I said a little while ago, at present I am not able to say what will be the outcome of the Commission's deliberations with regard to the proposals submitted by Finland and Sweden."
"What is clear is that future action will include an examination of infrastructure across the narrows of the Gulf of Bothnia and therefore I am confident that due consideration will be taken of the situation faced by the ferry services."
"As to the honourable Member's question about the Interreg programme, I am afraid that at present I am unable to give a proper reply, not only because the business of Interreg programmes does not form part of my portfolio but more particularly because an accurate analysis of the proposal has not yet been made."
"However, I am certain I can say on behalf of my colleague Michel Barnier that the facts which have been mentioned by the honourable Member will duly be taken into account when an analysis is made of that proposal."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the rather hope-inspiring reply that it would be possible to use Interreg funds."
"When this ferry traffic is phased out at the beginning of the new year it will have very serious financial and also human consequences for the two regions of V√§sterbotten and √ñsterbotten."
"This is a direct consequence of the decision to abolish duty-free."
"This can also be regarded as a competition-related issue, as duty-free goods can continue to be sold in the southern part of the Baltic on the crossing between Stockholm and Helsinki, whereas they are not permitted to be sold on the journey between Ume√• and Vasa."
"How does this actually accord with the Union' s policy on competition?"
"Would it not be possible to extend the exception for duty-free sales to the whole of the Baltic?"
"Mr President, the situation is as follows if I may address the question directly: If a ferry coming from and going to a Member State, for example Finland, makes an intermediate call in a third country or a third territory - in this case the √Öland Islands - where the passengers have the opportunity to disembark and to make purchases, then it would be possible to have tax and duty-free sales on board."
"However, when the vessel returns to Community ports, customs provisions including appropriate controls apply and that means that the passengers are allowed to import excisable goods free of taxes and duties up to the limits laid down in the customs provisions governing travellers' allowances."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 50 to 86 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"European digital content"
"The next item is the report (A5-0390/2000) by Mrs Gill, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision adopting a Multiannual Community programme to stimulate the development and use of European digital content on the global networks and to promote linguistic diversity in the Information Society [COM(2000) 323 - C5-0462/2000 - 2000/0128(CNS)]."
"President, I welcome this initiative from the Commission."
"This proposal reflects the goal of the Lisbon Summit by aiming to stimulate the development and the use of digital content."
"In doing so I trust that Europe's position in the knowledge-based global economy will be consolidated."
"Owing to the fast-changing nature of this sector, the EU needs to take immediate and concrete measures since the new communication technologies are already generating demand for content, products and services as well as having considerable social impact."
"If we do not act and tackle the barriers that undermine the potential of European industry, then the European citizen will pay the price not only in terms of slower economic growth and lower employment opportunities, but also in terms of cultural and social influence."
"If I can say briefly what is important in my report and what I believe is the key priority for this Parliament, it is the issue of linguistic diversity."
"We in Europe are lagging behind the US because at present the EU market is fragmented as a result of linguistic and cultural diversity."
"What we need to do is to rectify this situation by fostering and encouraging multilingual content, as this is absolutely crucial to the success of the European content industry."
"Multilingual content should be incorporated wherever possible at the embryonic stage of electronic communication."
"As a result the market position of European companies will be enhanced and at the same time it will prove to be less costly to them."
"That is the reason why I propose the amount of budget earmarked for this sector."
"In my view we must adopt an inclusive approach in relation to languages and a pledge to commit more funding to this area, precisely because European SMEs are dissuaded from setting up websites in different languages by the burdensome cost that they incur."
"I cannot under-estimate the importance of customising our content."
"By ensuring that it is conveyed to each and every corner of the EU we underwrite our goal of a fully integrated and functional information society."
"It should not be necessary to master the English language in order to find interesting content on the Internet."
"The presence of content in different languages will promote citizens' equal access to the information society and therefore prevent the creation of an information underclass."
"Secondly, I believe that the initial proposal of five years is far too long and should be curtailed to four years, especially because of the rapid evolution of the e-content sector."
"Therefore it is necessary to shorten the implementation of the programme and it also enables this programme to have a much greater impact owing to the commitment of more money in shorter timescales."
"Furthermore, I call on the Commission to conceive more efficient and faster implementation procedures in the field of calling in proposals."
"In changing priorities from public sector information to multilingual content, my intention is not to diminish the importance of public sector information."
"My reasoning is that I believe there is a greater potential for public/private partnerships as there is a huge commercial value to be exploited on the market in the interest both of companies and citizens."
"More importantly we need to also resolve the issues of copyright and intellectual property."
"These issues have to be addressed so that all parties are fully aware of the implications."
"Another key area that Parliament is keen to develop further is how we lend additional support to market enablers, recognising that in recent months the sector has experienced a particularly volatile period."
"It is essential that we sell to them the potential gains and opportunities of investing in companies that are taking on board linguistic diversity and exploitation of public sector information."
"The lack of financing for enterprises that want to operate in the digital content sector has to be eliminated."
"The problem I am mainly concerned with is that small enterprises do not always have sufficient guarantees and a proven business track record to offer investors."
"However, if we could make use of expertise already available in terms of business experience by encouraging the establishment of a mentoring service through which successful business people would introduce new entrants to the sources of financing available, we could give Europeans in business the head start they need."
"It is up to us now not to squander this opportunity."
"Seeing that the Americans are not yet out of our sight, Europe can meet this challenge by focusing on this sector: Let us not forget the potential for job creation and economic growth in such a huge and rapidly developing sector, provided we create the right environment for growth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the course of these two minutes, I should just like very briefly to emphasise first of all that this e-content programme is coming about, let us not forget, in the wake of the Lisbon and Feira Councils which, where e-Europe is concerned, concluded in particular that this new economy needed to be founded upon knowledge which favours integration and overcomes the digital divide."
"I should also like us to remember, when devising this e-content programme, that we are concerned not only with information but also with knowledge and, moreover, with knowledge which favours integration and prevents social division."
"That is why I have proposed a lot of amendments to emphasise the importance of access for all."
"As has been said, information ought of course to be available to businesses, but it ought also to be accessible to everyone."
"I therefore want us to emphasise the possible democratic aspect of digital content or e-content."
"Secondly, I should like to point out to the Commission that it chose not to define the term 'digital content' and that this gives me grounds for concern."
"I should like to know what will be included under the heading of 'content' ."
"If we include only content useful to businesses, particularly meteorological and geographical content (as is extremely desirable), it must not of course be forgotten that, where content intended for citizens is concerned, it is a much more complicated matter than of simply taking information useful to businesses."
"Citizens are involved because content relating to the arts, education, sport, tourism and so on, seems to me to be just as important."
"In implementing the programme, I therefore want us to have a requirement for a definition of what may constitute digital content."
"It is in fact necessary to show concern for everyone."
"This means that digital content offers an opportunity to all those who have not had access to schooling, be it lifelong training or because they are handicapped, and I want digital content to make a better approach to such people possible."
"To conclude, why deprive ourselves of digital content?"
"Cultural and linguistic diversity is served by the e-content economic project, and I am pleased to know that we shall be able to support linguistic diversity thanks to digital content."
"I should like to thank Mrs Fraisse and Mrs Gill for their excellent report and their contribution to the realisation of this action programme."
"In order successfully to complete the ambitious development of this European e-content programme, the procedures envisaged need to be simplified and made secure."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has studied this subject in terms of two specific aspects of the report: on the one hand, public access to documents and the commercial exploitation of information originating in the public sector; and on the other hand, the exchange of intellectual property rights."
"Public sector information plays an important role when it comes to citizens' participation and the expression of their freedoms, but it also represents an important potential resource for the European information market."
"The dual use, public and private, of this information justifies introducing a Community regulation which must respect the specific obligations of the public authorities as well, of course, as the confidentiality of personal data."
"Cost must not act as a filter for access to the information from which commercial suppliers ought also to benefit."
"A common basis for billing and a common legal framework governing the right of access must therefore be defined, and this effectively means defining the very nature of this information to see whether or not it can be protected by copyright."
"The purpose of exchanging intellectual property rights is to permit the realisation of digital content involving more than one format (video, music and text), with the payment of fees administered through a single European system."
"The goal is to stimulate the creation of digital content while protecting intellectual property rights in such a way as to ensure respect for beneficiaries and for consumers legally accessing the content."
"Actions taken will have to take account of the future legal framework at present under discussion, designed in particular to define the exclusive rights of descendant beneficiaries."
"- (FI) Mr President, the digital content industry is characterised by a growth in the quantity of information."
"Information is the raw material of the content industry, and, in addition, multimedia fully exploits the opportunities afforded by the entertainment and leisure industry in order to increase production."
"There are no restrictions, as there were previously, to the supply of digital information."
"Digital content, which is more quantity than quality, standardises and prunes cultural and social diversity."
"Seventy per cent of the content of the Internet is in English, but Europe' s challenge is the greater utilisation of our rich linguistic heritage."
"Although linguistic differences might mean extra costs, multilingual content is an important precondition of democracy in the EU."
"To overcome problems we need a language industry which concentrates on customised linguistic services and diversifies the language infrastructure of digital content."
"Similarly, we need localisation of content production, which is a means of adapting products according to linguistic and cultural needs and the liking of consumers."
"Maximising quantity in the content industry might happen at the expense of the existence of linguistic as well as culturally and socially valuable content."
"For that reason, the objective behind public subsidies for the EU' s content industry must also be the achievement of high levels of education and culture in all its diversity."
"Nowadays it is not enough that people can read: new media reading skills will be actually just as important in the new millennium as traditional literacy."
"In the Committee on Budgets we have focused attention on the importance of content production and the utilisation of public information, and we consider that the resources set aside in the budget for the purpose have been very meagre."
"Nevertheless, we think it is a good start."
"At the same time, we would like to thank Mrs Gill for the enthusiasm and energy she has shown in formulating Parliament' s position."
"Commissioner Liikanen, by the year 2003 we shall probably have 1.7 million job vacancies in the information society in Europe which cannot be filled, and I believe that this in itself makes it essential that we devote the utmost attention to the question of digital content."
"We shall be investing many millions of euros in the Net infrastructure; by the year 2003 it is expected that there will be more than a billion mobile phones in the world, and 85% of the European population will be using the Internet."
"The sums that will be invested here naturally bear no relation to the total investment in software, in digital content."
"So there is a huge gap that we must close as soon as possible, because we shall not only create jobs by installing transmitters, by the way we link them together and by the way we develop software; we shall also have to become prolific producers of digital content."
"What do we have to do to encourage such production?"
"First of all - and my thanks are due to Mr Sepp√§nen for this - we took the same view in the Committee on Budgets as has been expressed here and now in the chamber and by the Committee on Industry External Trade, Research and Energy, namely that we need a massive injection of new funding for digital content."
"The PPE-DE Group will endorse Mrs Gill's suggestions, for which I thank her, and we too shall vote for an increased contribution, and I hope that our agreement with the Liberals and the other groups will be honoured and that we shall make a really massive effort to ensure that these budgetary priorities actually receive the volume of additional funding that we have proposed."
"The second point, which seems just as crucial to me, is that we must think about small and medium-sized enterprises, about business start-ups."
"I believe that many young university graduates and well-qualified young people from schools, colleges and companies are well able to start up new businesses in the domain of digital content and that this domain offers us new opportunities, including opportunities for cross-border cooperation with the countries applying for EU membership, because in countries where there are already numerous experts, training standards are quite high."
"We should actively seek such cooperation and develop joint strategies with the applicant countries."
"We also face a huge problem in connection with the conversion of analogue content into digital content."
"We must lend unstinting support to the transfer from analogue to digital."
"It is imperative that we offer our assistance here as a matter of urgency; we must develop career profiles, so that the education system can produce suitably qualified people, we must press ahead with the development of 'learning entertainment', and in the field of health care, we must try to offer structures that will guarantee us good health into our old age."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Gill on her report."
"If we want Europe to be a knowledge society, then we need to use the European digital content programme as our central reference point and as the main platform on which we base our design of this knowledge and information society."
"The European digital content is not wishful thinking or pie in the sky, which is why numerous suitors are currently wooing this dark object of their desire."
"The conflict between the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport over the acceptance of this report bears witness to the truth of what I say."
"Why has this happened?"
"Is it perhaps just a typical clash of powers?"
"Certainly, to a degree; however, beneath it lies the nub of a serious problem."
"The problem, in my view, takes the form of a clash waiting to erupt."
"On the one hand, we have the content and its traditional producers, whose ambition is to bring their platform into the digital age, without their content losing its importance or independence, i.e. without their losing ownership of their production, which they naturally wish to renovate and extend."
"On the other hand, we have the communications networks which need a constant supply of content in order to fill their web pages and which see nothing wrong in subordinating the content, in ransoming it and using it without paying any particular attention to the rules of production."
"The networks have cast themselves in the role of protagonist and are using the content without any discretion and often without any respect."
"Parliament must handle this clash very carefully."
"It is not in the European Union's interests to destroy the traditional structures and rules governing the production of the content."
"On the contrary, these structures and rules need to be upgraded, they need a renewed digital profile if they are to be put to better use and distributed more widely."
"It is important that we promote content in this direction."
"Cultural content in particular is in danger of waking up in a new environment in which literally nothing of the old environment remains."
"Music and the publication of books, for example, obey certain production and distribution rules."
"If we fail to renovate them, we shall end up in a cannibalistic situation in which authors and their works are the victims."
"A Europe of knowledge must not excite competition with the United States and thereby destroy the important structures of its symbolic capital, because this is what differentiates it, this is where its wealth, quality and pluralism lie."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to associate myself with the previous speakers' comments and to congratulate the Commission and the Council first of all on their swift action and then to offer my congratulations to Mrs Gill on her excellent work."
"For all the communication problems between the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Industry, our aim was ultimately the same, namely to secure a speedy, smooth and efficient decision."
"The much-vaunted cultural and linguistic diversity of Europe is indeed a frequent barrier, especially in the context of the single market."
"But if we make a virtue out of necessity and change the minuses into plus signs, if we consider our languages as bridges rather than obstacles, if we recognise and exploit the benefits they offer, they can form the foundations of a European market and lend us a certain independence."
"The oft-invoked closeness to the people can be put into practice to some extent through the use of language."
"The stumbling blocks of modern technology and the possible need to communicate in a foreign language can now be more easily overcome."
"The big questions now are how efficiently all interested parties will cooperate with each other and whether we shall be able to ensure not only that content is produced in sufficient volume but, more crucially, that it is also of a sufficiently high quality."
"The content providers, the creative element, the people who are ultimately responsible for the production of content, the very people who are targeted by the e-content programme should therefore be involved in the consultation process."
"The Greens are in favour of the report as adopted in committee."
"I am pleased with the huge turnout in the Chamber."
"It is a pleasure to see."
"I am sure there must be something going on, but we will find out soon enough."
"Mr President, I very much welcome this e-content programme and should like to refer to two aspects of it."
"First of all, digital technology reminds us that it is high time we dug up a treasure that lies buried within all of us and made use of it in this digital age."
"I refer to the cultural diversity of Europe, and we have the opportunity to safeguard it for future generations with the aid of new technology. Digital content demonstrates that Europe is not only an economic community; it is also bound by common values, and it is our desire and our duty to use this programme to preserve our common treasure for future generations in a highly competitive world."
"The programme therefore presents us with two opportunities: firstly it can help us to secure existing jobs and to create new ones, and secondly it offers us a unique opportunity to exploit to the full that cultural diversity which our language barriers have always prevented us from sharing and to ensure that it benefits everyone."
"Let me turn now to a second aspect of the programme."
"This programme relies to an unprecedented extent on public-private partnerships."
"In the cultural sphere, it is particularly important that we devise new forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors."
"That is why I am campaigning very vigorously for Parliament and its committees - the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - to undertake a thorough analysis of the potential effects of this new form of cooperation between public and private funding bodies on the preservation of cultural diversity in Europe."
"May I conclude by thanking all those whose support has helped to ensure that the programme provides for the reallocation of funds in favour of linguistic and cultural measures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone has been saying this evening, the programme we are debating is designed to help establish a large European market for digital content, accessible to both industry and the general public."
"The programme and the report are therefore very important and, in connection with these, I want to thank the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen, as well as Mrs Gill."
"I shall not go back and discuss all the objectives of this programme which consist in creating conditions favourable to the sale, distribution and use of digital content in such a way as to encourage economic activity, broaden the scope of employment and encourage exploitation of the potential of European digital content over and against that of digital content from the United States."
"I want to emphasise the importance of the objective of promoting multilingualism in digital content on the world networks, particularly for European languages."
"I also want to say how important it is for citizens of the European Union to be able to develop professionally, socially and culturally and how important it is to avoid, in this area, the creation of that digital divide to which we refer so often in our debates."
"We are therefore concerned here with a programme and a report which are very important both from economic and employment points of view and, once Parliament has voted on it, I want to see the programme quickly adopted by the Telecommunications Council which, I believe, is due to meet on 22 December."
"Before I conclude, allow me to raise a final important point, a final question addressed to the Commission."
"If, on this issue of a digital divide, everyone is aware of the risk of seeing rifts open up between citizens, the Commission' s proposals are, in my view, not enough to prevent this from happening."
"That is why I support the amendments calling for specific steps to be taken in the field of new technologies."
"In as much as I too am the rapporteur for one of the reports on the Telecom package, I think it is important for Europe to make arrangements and propose to us programmes for...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of Parliament for their support for the Commission proposal."
"This wide participation of parliamentarians in this late debate is further proof of the interest shown in this important proposal."
"Promotion of European digital content is evidently and rightly a subject of interest to many parliamentary committees."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Gill, has succeeded in bringing together the different opinions in a balanced manner, with an important contribution from Mrs Fraisse and the Committee on Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"Let me first say a few words on why we launched this initiative."
"The key role of content first."
"In order to exploit the strong European position in mobile telephony and digital TV it is key for a new range of services to emerge."
"European firms are in the best position to localise services geographically and tailor them culturally and linguistically to users' needs."
"We have to ensure that there is an environment conducive to these changes in Europe."
"Secondly, the Internet is going mobile."
"This means the appearance of personalised and localised services that respond to what consumers want, where they want, but the consumers are probably only willing to pay for this content if it is available in a culturally customised format and in their own language."
"Thus having the right conditions in place for European multilingual digital content production is becoming increasingly important."
"In response to this challenge, the Commission has proposed a five-year programme with the aim of accelerating the process of transformation and filling the gap open in the mobile services: three specific lines with the help of strategic studies and input from market actors who are identified in the areas where impact at European level can be maximised, namely, stimulating the exploitation of public sector information, enhancing linguistic and cultural customisation, and supporting market enablers."
"The budget proposed by the Commission is EUR 150 m over five years."
"This programme has ambitious objectives and has to have appropriate means to achieve them."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its strong support for the budget of the programme."
"Let me comment on some of the amendments proposed by Parliament."
"First, on the social and cultural function of digital content, the Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament emphasises the social and cultural dimension of digital content."
"The Commission supports these amendments which bring out this dimension even more clearly than in its original formulation."
"Second, on economic dimension content."
"The idea of e-content is to marry the social and cultural dimension content with its economic value in order to maximise its expected value."
"In this respect the report stresses the need to invest in the linguistic and cultural customisation part of the proposal."
"We welcome these elements."
"Thirdly, on the simplification of procedures and payment delays."
"This is an important point and I agree whole-heartedly with the rapporteur."
"We have to have put in place fast and simplified procedures for the execution of programmes."
"In this connection it is worthwhile to notice that as part of the administrative reform, the Commission has recently adopted a communication on the simplification of its decision-making procedures."
"We intend to make maximum use of these measures and reduce as much as possible the time between the presentation of a project proposal and a decision on its financing."
"In conclusion, out of 49 amendments voted by the committee, let me say that the Commission can support 23 as they are, and 15 are acceptable in principle subject to reformulation."
"The remaining 11 are not directly compatible with the objectives of this specific programme, or would stretch its mandate beyond what can be achieved with the financial means associated with it."
"Some of them are indeed very valuable in themselves but are better placed in other instruments than in the present decision."
"Let me thank you once again for the report."
"At this stage it is expected that the Telecoms Council of 22 December will reach a political agreement on the proposal."
"This is necessary in order to start the action early in 2001."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m."
"Assessment and management of environmental noise"
"The next item is the report (A5-0378/2000) by Mr De Roo, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise [COM(2000) 468 - C5-0411/2000 - 2000/0194(COD)]."
"Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order, but first I would like to say how delighted I am that this debate on noise has brought together so many people at this ungodly hour."
"It seems to me - and this was also borne out in the vote of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - that there is a very thin line indeed between the position of the Green rapporteur, Mr De Roo and that of the PPE-DE Group, a People' s Party which stands up against noise."
"Nevertheless, I have to refer to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure, and request a referral back to committee of Mr De Roo' s sound report."
"The reason for this is because, after some investigations, it appeared that a number of amendments, which the PPE-DE Group also supported when they were discussed initially in committee, contain a few technical problems."
"You know how strict noise standards are in the Netherlands."
"If these problems are looked at and it is established that something is wrong, then we would be happy to put them right, together with Mr De Roo and other members of the committee."
"Surely it must be possible for this House to make improvements on this report by means of a referral back."
"I would also add that a number of MEPs did not receive the correct English text until this morning, when we were discussing the report."
"This is why we request a referral back to committee and I would ask you to take a vote on this."
"Thank you, Mrs Oomen."
"You undoubtedly did your homework."
"You know that such a proposal can be submitted either on behalf of a group, or by at least 32 Members."
"My question to you is: do you have a sufficient number of Members behind you or are you speaking officially on behalf of the group?"
"Can you confirm whether there is a group decision or not?"
"Mr President, of course this is a group decision."
"We held a brief discussion on this matter this evening, at 6.00 p.m. on the dot."
"Could I first ask who wants to speak in favour of this proposal?"
"The proposal was submitted by Mrs Oomen, on behalf of the Christian-Democrats."
"Who wishes to speak in favour of the proposal?"
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to express our wholehearted support for Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's motion."
"We all want to ensure that the people in our Member States are not exposed to excessive noise, but we also want this whole question to be regulated by law."
"To that end, I ask you to support the motion proposed by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"Who would like to speak against the proposal submitted?"
"Mr President, this proposal is a case of clashing interests, and as far as that is concerned, it is not surprising that it is attracting attention in this way."
"What I would like to say to the PPE-DE Group is that it should at least not stand in the way of tonight' s discussions."
"The different positions can be articulated, the vote has not been scheduled for this evening, and if the largest group in Parliament is of the opinion that the vote should not take place tomorrow, it seems more appropriate to me to submit such a proposal tomorrow when we have a full House rather than doing it this evening."
"That would be premature and in so doing, we would miss the debate."
"If a group would like to vote against, it has of course every right to do so, but we must also give others the opportunity to vote in favour and let the democratic process run its course."
"What is now threatening to happen is that no viewpoints will be articulated, although I believe that clarity of this kind will be needed this evening before we can eventually take a vote some time in the future, whenever that may be."
"I now give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr De Roo."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak."
"I am indeed grateful for the support which the Christian-Democrats and, in fact, part of the Liberal Group, have lent to this one specific amendment to curb all aircraft noise."
"There is nothing stopping the Christian-Democrats, the Liberals or the Socialists from lending their support to this cause tomorrow by casting their vote."
"I fail to understand, actually, why, if the Christian-Democrats can support this cause in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, they cannot do the same again now."
"Should there be a minor technical hitch, we can rectify it in tandem with the Commission which is to issue a recommendation on these amendments."
"We can then iron out this minor inaccuracy."
"I am therefore in favour of holding a debate today and voting tomorrow, so that the Environmental Council can take a decision this coming Monday and Tuesday and that something can be done as soon as possible about noise, so that our citizens are subjected to less noise than is now the case."
"Thank you, Mr De Roo."
"We will now vote on the proposal to refer the pending report back to committee."
"(Referral back of the report to committee was rejected)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, noise is disturbing an increasing number of people in Europe."
"Ten years ago, in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme, the European Commission estimated that 25% of the citizens of the EU were disturbed by noise from cars, trucks, aircraft, motorcycles, mopeds, trains, factories and boats."
"The Commission now estimates that one in every three Europeans complains about noise."
"In my own country, the Netherlands, this is 40%."
"Noise, especially at night, annoys more and more people."
"More than 10 million citizens in the EU are sleep-disturbed as a result."
"Too much noise from infrastructure affects the health of human beings, and reduces their quality of life."
"Eight years ago, the Commission promised to come forward with legislative proposals for European harmonised noise indicators before 1994 and for EU-wide noise standards before 1995."
"Only this year, six years overdue, and under enormous pressure from the French Government, has the Commission at last proposed European harmonised noise indicators."
"Those proposals are sound."
"Lnight is an efficient indicator for sleep disturbance and the overall noise indicator Lden is probably the best in its field."
"This indicator sets 12 hours for the day, 4 hours for the evening and 8 hours for the night."
"Noise at night is calculated times 10 and noise in the evening times 5."
"The night should be eight hours long and that is of key importance, because at Frankfurt airport, the night is still only 6 hours long, compared to 6.5 hours at Heathrow and 7 hours at Schiphol."
"Most people need eight hours sleep."
"Lden is an annual average."
"The only time when Lden is not the most appropriate indicator is for high-pitched, short-term noise which is often generated by industrial plants."
"That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has suggested introducing the LA-max indicator."
"Subsidiarity - as will soon transpire from the debate - is an important element which the Environmental Committee would like to honour."
"It is left to the discretion of the Member States to determine when evening and the subsequent night fall."
"If people in Scandinavia wish to retire at 10 p.m. and the Spanish only at midnight, then that is not a problem, but those starting times for evening and night should be brought into line for all modes of transport, aircraft, road and rail, as well as industrial noise."
"The Environmental Committee has criticised the European Commission' s hesitation to propose EU noise standards."
"The Environmental Committee proposes turning them into a framework law with four daughter directives which encompass aircraft noise, noise from roads, rail noise and noise from industrial plants, but each time with a combined approach."
"An EU standard for noise as well as EU noise standards for aircraft, cars, trucks, trains and installations in plants."
"The Environmental Committee' s most controversial proposal is to develop a daughter directive on aircraft noise at this early stage."
"In this proposal, the Environmental Committee lays down specific standards for the years 2006, 2012 and 2020."
"Setting ever stricter noise standards must reduce noise levels of aircraft around airports."
"It is a moderate proposal, for Scandinavia already has stricter standards in place than those proposed for the year 2012."
"But major airports, such as Heathrow, Frankfurt and Paris will need to make considerable efforts to meet the initial set of standards by 2006."
"What is required, however, is a level playing field."
"I will give you one example: the Dutch Government introduced the margins of the night at Beek airport, which amounted to a flight ban between 1 and 5 a.m."
"As a result, noisy aircraft took their freight transport to Ostend, the Belgian seaside resort, which met with protest from the people in Ostend."
"At present, exactly the same noisy aircraft land in the middle of the night at the airport of Li√®ge, 60 km south of Maastricht."
"That is not doing the European citizens any good, and that is why these standards are required."
"Mr President, environmental noise is one of the oldest environmental problems we know."
"Despite this, noise was not considered a serious environmental problem for a long time."
"Now that environmental noise has gone through the roof, increased mobility being one of the specific causes, the number of people facing this problem has also increased greatly."
"I therefore welcome the Commission proposal, although I consider it to be an initial and - in my opinion - cautious step."
"The Commission does not have the courage to set European standards but aims in the first instance only to harmonise the noise pollution indicators."
"In his report, Mr De Roo proposes turning the directive into a framework directive."
"Our group has welcomed this suggestion with open arms."
"As far as legislation is concerned, I would, however, like to prioritise and, initially, to opt for regulation of noise around airports."
"After all, wherever we are based, it appears that noise around airports is experienced as particularly disturbing."
"All the more reason, therefore, for a People' s Party such as ours, the PPE-DE, not to let aviation escape European legislation and to scrap the distinction made between military and civil aviation."
"We also need European legislation because, in my opinion, we can no longer allow aviation companies to 'shop around' ."
"Airports such as Orly, Schiphol and Barcelona already meet strict requirements."
"It is no longer acceptable for a market to be disturbed by unequal legislation within aviation."
"Discrepancies may lead to a situation where an airport on one side of the border, for example Maastricht, is not allowed to expand, while 50 km down the road, a new airport is built in Bierset without any restrictions."
"We must also consider the use of the terms of day and night and even margins of the night, concepts which lead to much confusion in the Netherlands too."
"In my opinion, what we need is uniformity for the sake of healthy competitive relations, but also for the people we represent, which is also the purport of this directive."
"However, rail and car traffic noise are issues which can be solved more easily by means of technical directives."
"I would therefore argue in favour of moving away from the idea of noise pollution or standards around road traffic axes but instead promote quieter vehicles and quieter trains."
"Anything above and beyond that is subject to subsidiarity, in my opinion, and should be up to the Member States to decide."
"I will advise my group to vote against Amendments Nos. 36 and 49 because they contain a number of technical problems, not because the goals are pitched too high, but because the technical details cloud the issue."
"I would like to finish off with a word of thanks to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, the Commission's Green Paper on future noise-abatement policy, which appeared in 1996, stated that 20% of the population of Western Europe, in other words almost 80 million people, were exposed to noise levels that the experts deemed to be intolerable."
"The rapporteur has now quoted far higher percentages, but the fact is that ambient noise is a serious and a major environmental problem."
"That is why the reduction and prevention of ambient noise will feature prominently in future European environment policies."
"We welcome the proposal from the Commission, but it does not go far enough for us."
"The harmonisation of noise-measurement procedures and the production of action plans by the Member States are good things but are not enough to satisfy us."
"That is why we are calling for a framework directive as a basis for Community action to assess and combat ambient noise."
"We call on the Commission to present proposals for daughter directives and to do so within 18 months of the entry into force of the framework directive."
"These daughter directives would set quality standards for all sources of noise, and I am pleased that the line taken by our group was adopted by a large majority of the committee and hope that the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange on that basis will also secure the necessary majority in tomorrow's vote."
"My group, however, does not support the rapporteur's intention to use the directive to introduce limit values for ambient noise in the vicinity of airports."
"We have discussed the relevant amendments thoroughly in committee, but we believe that our line of approach, whereby quality standards for all specific sources of noise are to be the subject of daughter directives, is the more logical and consistent strategy."
"Another important proposal we have made, which will be of particular significance in the context of aviation noise, is that there should be an additional noise indicator over and above those that the rapporteur has enumerated."
"I therefore ask for your support for the amendment on the introduction of a noise indicator which defines a maximum level in addition to those which define mean levels."
"Mr President, for years, national and local governments heavily underestimated the effects of noise in the workplace and at home."
"The fact that people became sleepless and stressed out and that their hearing became damaged, seemed to take second place to economic growth."
"Now that traffic noise, especially, is ever increasing, far-reaching measures have become inevitable."
"The largest airports are located in densely populated areas and their environments are becoming less and less inhabitable."
"It is important that, in those areas, everyone is guaranteed at least eight hours of peace and quiet at night and that governments no longer allow hours to be pinched from this total after designating these hours the so-called margins of the night."
"Member States have not been prescribed set times but rather a set number of hours, and quite rightly so."
"The rapporteur has shown great creativity in bringing forward framework directives, daughter directives and noise maps to be made available to the public."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is happy to support him in this, although we would have preferred to take things one step further in our efforts to find appropriate solutions and tackle those making money on the back of pollution."
"Now that it has transpired in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that our more far-reaching wishes cannot count on the support of the two major groups, I hope that at least the rapporteur' s moderate proposals will secure a majority."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many citizens of the European Union for whom quality of life is just a mirage."
"They waste too much time in city traffic and have too little time left to be with their children; they work under terrible conditions and have no green spaces or leisure areas to rest in; they waste days in hospital queues and wrestle with civil service red tape."
"In our cities we rush along and lose sight of our well-being."
"Environmental noise must be brought into this lamentable picture. It is present throughout the day, making life even more tiring, and it is present at night, disturbing our well-earned rest."
"Unfortunately, more and more European citizens are being affected by environmental noise. Despite this, however, the European Union has been slow to apply a common policy on the subject of noise."
"It took five years to put forward a proposal for harmonised European noise indicators."
"It is unacceptable that we should have to wait five more years to set the noise limits to be applied throughout the European Union."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur, Mr De Roo, when he proposes that we should waste no more time and transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise into a binding framework directive."
"The noise that most disturbs people' s sleep is that caused by night-time air traffic."
"The lack of common standards in the European Union has caused situations of clearly unfair competition between airports and a lack of equality among the citizens of different Member States."
"It is, therefore, essential that binding limits should be set on aircraft noise near airports."
"I believe, however, that Amendment No 36 is not the most sensible way to go about this."
"In any case, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr De Roo, in very many ways, this directive is unique, really, for the simple reason that noise and the disturbance it causes are actually being recognised for the first time as a social and ecological problem."
"In line with this directive, noise expressed in decibels is a measure of the standard of living."
"Credit should go to the rapporteur, in the first instance, and the support he has received in committee."
"The aim of this framework directive is to combat noise pollution on behalf of the European citizen."
"This directive contains a number of sound and important proposals: harmonisation, the use of common indicators and parameters, software and such like."
"But allow me to say a few words on the bickering and the battle which has taken place recently behind the scenes, in and around, above and below, the committee, and which we witnessed in this Chamber a moment ago."
"The rapporteur included a number of indicators and aims for airports in his proposal."
"I can understand why he did this."
"This is a very hot topic in my own country too, and it is also keeping the citizens of my own country awake."
"It is our duty as MEPs and as a European institution to do something about this."
"I too would like clear goals, no question about that, but the standards which the rapporteur is proposing are premature at this moment in time."
"Another group may claim that the proposal contains technical problems."
"Or you may put it down to other causes."
"They are quite simply premature."
"We must give the Commission the time to do something about this, providing it does not take too long."
"That is why, in my opinion, the amendments tabled by Mr Bernd Lange are so important."
"I do hope they will meet with support and that the Commission will issue well-founded standards within eight months from now, because that is what it is all about, and I hope that we can reach a compromise in this area too."
"Mr President, Spain has supported and continues to support the policy of combating noise in general and in particular supports this Community directive, as well as the good work of Mr De Roo."
"Despite Spain' s will and interest in establishing Community rules on this issue, there is a basic problem which profoundly affects the way of life in Spain."
"This is the establishment of a nuisance factor for noise after 7.00 p.m., which the proposal for a directive calls the 'evening' ."
"The Commission proposal, in point 1 of Annex 1, intends to systematically add on five decibels for all noise created between 7.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m."
"For climatic and cultural reasons, life in Spain is lived later than in many other parts of Europe."
"It is obvious that the nuisance which may be caused by noise between 7.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m. varies according to the different ways of life in each place."
"In Spain and in many Mediterranean countries, the normal day extends considerably later than the 7.00 p.m. indicated in the directive."
"I will therefore not hide the fact that it will be very difficult for my country to accept the Commission' s proposal, unless it incorporates a sufficient mechanism for flexibility so that we can maintain the way of life that we inherited from our ancestors and, furthermore, which is so valued both by the Spanish themselves and by our foreign visitors."
"So far, the formulae for flexibility that have been proposed consist of transferring part of the four hours of the mandatory evening to siesta time."
"But this mechanism is of no use, since, unfortunately, people do not sleep siestas all year in Spain and it is not even slept in the whole of Spain."
"Elements of flexibility could be the option of reducing either the number of hours or the degree of nuisance which the proposal assigns to those evening hours."
"It would be the Member States who would determine the length of that period, according to their own customs."
"We therefore support Amendment No 48 by Mr Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Florenz."
"Mr President, first of all I must say that I welcome this report."
"The rapporteur has done a lot of work and the Commission has produced an excellent initiative stimulated by colleagues who prompted the Commission during the last Parliament."
"This is a very serious issue affecting the health of millions of people and it requires a careful and thoughtful action to cure the problems."
"It is a complex problem."
"We cannot get away from that and we really require a step-by-step, calculated approach to dealing with the problems of noise in every locality, in every place and in every cultural situation within the Union and elsewhere."
"For that reason the most important elements of this report are the need to have harmonisation of measurement and assessment methods across the whole of the European Union so we can talk in comparable terms about the problems."
"We also need to build noise maps and measure the real problem in every locality to establish what can be done in each case and adopt local measures to do that and eventually, by a step-by-step approach, we can arrive at a real action programme which is cost-effective in the measures that we adopt and which achieves the solution that we are looking for, a genuine reduction in noise levels and consequent improvement in human health."
"Some parts of the report propose too rapid and far too quick an approach to a problem which has not been properly and carefully assessed."
"It seems to me, for example, that the setting of noise limits at this time is presumptive."
"We need to assess exactly what measures can be taken at a local level and whether we need noise limits in future."
"We will have to progress down that road but the present proposal by the rapporteur goes too far in that direction at the moment."
"I would nevertheless commend the report and of course the Commission's proposal to the House."
"Mr President, I cannot but regret that the attempt to remove this report from the agenda this evening has been so thoroughly misunderstood."
"We have no intention whatsoever of pulling a fast one on the House."
"Listening to David Bowe, from a fairly significant parliamentary group, one is made particularly aware that it is not at all easy to rein in the airport operators to such a degree that the people who live close to our European airports, and for whom I have every sympathy, would actually notice any improvement."
"I have certainly been astounded to hear one or two speakers say that we need daughter directives."
"Now daughter directives are a fine thing - don't get me wrong."
"The only thing is that we have been fighting for such directives for twenty years."
"We need an instrument if we are to establish daughter directives."
"That, in principle, was the idea behind Amendment No 36, although I believe the idea has not been fully developed yet."
"That is why we needed breathing space to work on this idea so that it could be implemented."
"One thing is crystal-clear, Mrs Scheele: you are still very young, but however many years you spend in Parliament, you will never get a daughter directive on aviation noise!"
"They will always find a way, be it to right, to left, down the middle or wherever, to wriggle out of it."
"They have economic interests too, and of course I understand that."
"So what we need are parameters."
"We have to establish them here in Parliament."
"That was the idea behind our desire to obtain ten more days or another fortnight."
"At the end of the day, it is not so much a matter of the wishes we might have but rather of the wishes we manage to turn into policies."
"Once a football match is over, only the goals count."
"In that respect I am by no means overconfident."
"I am still quite curious to see how the dice will fall tomorrow."
"But to my great regret, Mr de Roo, I have to say that your good intention is probably dead in the water already."
"Mr President, when I look at the proposal the Commission presented, I cannot help thinking of a scene in which a man is sitting by a stream in Finland, trying to catch salmon with a net."
"But the mesh is so wide that every salmon slips through."
"With that image in mind, I find it commendable that we are trying to tighten the mesh of the Commission's proposal in exactly the same way as we did with air and water quality."
"The first thing we need for this is a framework directive which prescribes measuring procedures and action plans, thereby establishing the basis for a general standardisation of noise-abatement policies."
"Secondly, we need daughter directives which establish quality standards."
"In the realm of noise-abatement policy we must take particular care in determining the quality standards we wish to have; they must provide a basis on which the noise produced by air, rail and road traffic can be compared as well as taking account of the effects of different dosage levels."
"We must know the precise levels at which exposure starts to harm people in the long and short term."
"This means that daughter directives have to be developed very carefully, and this effort must go hand in hand with the development of limit values for particular sources of noise in a combined approach."
"So we do need a framework directive and we need the combined approach, and I therefore regard much of what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has decided as right and proper."
"I have problems, however, with Amendment No 10 and Amendments Nos 36 and 37, which would bring the specific matter of aviation noise into the framework directive, thereby forestalling the daughter directive."
"We should examine that very carefully and then pursue the implementation of both parts of the combined approach, namely the establishment of limit values for the various sources of noise on the one hand and quality standards for noise sources on the other."
"This, I believe, is the way we should proceed."
"Mr President, the approach adopted for this directive reminds me of the Natura 2000 model, which is bound to result in massive restrictions on the use of large areas of land for economic purposes. This is something we should bear in mind during our discussions."
"The European railways alone estimate that they will need to spend EUR 20 million on the noise maps, which is the Commission's assessment of the entire cost of implementing the directive."
"The railways alone expect to spend that amount."
"I should also like to emphasise that small and medium-sized businesses cannot possibly afford the cost of producing these noise maps."
"I believe we should do better to switch to incentives. We ought to think about support initiatives which achieve the aim of restricting noise levels."
"It is also important that we think about the countries applying for accession to the EU."
"They too would like to be able to sleep peacefully but also to go about their work without disruption."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important framework directive even though I would have appreciated a few weeks maybe until the January plenary session to have a proper dialogue with all the parties involved as that would have made for sounder legislation in the end."
"Nonetheless I welcome the framework directive and certainly, before the specific points contained in Amendment No 36 and others were introduced, it would have been welcome all round this House."
"This is the first directive that deals with ambient noise as distinct from noise from a particular common source and that is to be welcomed."
"We all know the health hazards that noise brings to all our lives."
"It is an increasing hazard and how we go about handling it will be a measure of how successful we are."
"We cannot bounce people or communities or industries into specific standards without proper dialogue and consultation."
"Could I also ask whether the Commission could refer to the business impact assessment, which I am assuming they carried out on this proposal as is required under the Treaty."
"I would like to know what the bottom line actually was."
"I would fully support the need to harmonise noise indicators and assessment methods; the whole area of noise maps; the drawing up of action plans to reduce noise and protect quiet areas as appropriate and to broaden the whole scope for information to the public."
"I would also hope that when we get to a daughter directive, rather than this framework directive, in which we have the specific standards for an EU-wide playing field that the terrain and conditions and demography in each area will be taken into account and we will have time to debate that properly."
"That is what we should be doing and how we should be handling it."
"For example, Amendment No 36 cites average measurements particularly in relation to night-time but one aircraft in the eight hours of night-time could come in so loudly and so noisily that it could wake the entire neighbourhood and yet comply with what is required by Amendment No 36."
"That is not what we want."
"It is not averages, it is specifics."
"We needed more time and I regret we did not have it even though I generally support the framework directive."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur; Mr de Roo, for his work."
"Environmental noise reduces the health and quality of life of at least 25% of the EU population."
"It causes illnesses such as stress and increased blood pressure as well as reductions in children's learning capacity."
"Aviation noise probably has the highest profile today in Europe, while locally noise from road traffic and sources such as trains and construction work is usually the biggest problem."
"What should we do in order to deal with this growing problem?"
"It was tempting to use this directive and other directives to set new EU noise limit values as soon as possible."
"That may seem the logical way to control the level of noise but it would be premature to set new limit values in this way for two main reasons."
"Firstly, because we already have market access legislation which set limit values for many road vehicle types and for equipment used outdoors."
"It would be simpler and quicker to tighten the noise standards in the existing legislation than to introduce new daughter directives."
"We will consider what these standards needs to be once we have the evidence from strategic noise maps."
"Secondly, this proposal uses a new approach to assess the overall noise situation in Europe in terms of numbers of people who are disturbed by noise."
"It is impossible at the moment, because we use such a large variety of indicators and assessment methods, to characterise noise in different Member States."
"A particular problem is the noise around airports."
"Because of commercial competitiveness between airports and between aviation manufacturers it has not been possible to obtain correct and verified noise levels."
"Getting comparable information about the noise around airports will be a big step forward."
"The Commission would therefore not be able to support the amendments introducing airport limit values at this stage."
"Once Member States have provided the comparable information then the Commission will consider the question of Community limit values and other measures to reduce the numbers of people affected by noise and report back to the Council and Parliament."
"As a general means of improving the situation, we propose that authorities in Member States should produce action plans in close consultation with the public."
"They should outline any measures that Member States take or plan to take to reduce the noise problem."
"We are not prescribing what measures should be taken."
"This is for the Member States to decide."
"However, the action plans must be published, even if all they say is that no improvements are planned, so that people living locally will know the situation and will be able to discuss the issue with their elected representatives."
"I am grateful to Members for their amendments strengthening the text and public participation, which we wholeheartedly accept."
"Our first priority is to produce strategic noise maps using standardised indicators and assess all types of noise to give us an accurate picture of the number of people who are suffering and where."
"Our first report on the directive is due to be submitted to Parliament in 2007."
"This will include a careful consideration of limit values."
"A five-yearly review process will then ensure that Members have a continued input."
"We value your input and welcome the majority of amendments you have contributed today."
"I hope we can now agree a positive way forward with a view to achieving a common position with the Council next week."
"As far as the amendments are concerned, the Commission has considered 49 amendments and is able to accept 25 of them fully or in part."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 3, 14, 18, 27, 30, 34, 35 and 43."
"The following amendments are acceptable in principle or in part: Amendments Nos 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 21, 22, 25, 28, 29, 32, 39, 42, 44 and 45."
"The Commission cannot accept the other amendments."
"To conclude I would like to thank European Parliament for the detailed consideration it has given to this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been contributed."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m."
"Additives other than colours and sweeteners"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0347/2000) by Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners [9662/1/2000 - C5-0425/2000 - 1999/0158(COD)]."
"Mr President, when it is as late as this, I do not think it is good form to prolong the debate, especially when, in the end, there is little to discuss."
"There is only one amendment, but it is an important one. I shall explain why."
"At first reading, we in fact adopted five amendments, including two that were essential."
"The first was designed not to authorise the use of ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose - rather a complex scientific expression, I am afraid - or E 467 as a new food additive."
"The Council followed our lead, which is very good."
"However, it did not follow our lead in the case of another amendment aimed at refusing to extend authorisation to another additive: sodium alginate (E 401), used for pre-packed, peeled and/or cut unprocessed carrots."
"This may appear trivial, but I shall explain why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was right to propose that Parliament should not agree to such authorisation."
"First of all, there are in general three criteria according to which a new additive is either admitted or rejected."
"The first criterion is technological need. The technological need is difficult to dispute in this case."
"Indeed, it is worth pointing out that sodium alginate is used as a firming agent for peeled, cut, ready-to-eat packaged carrots."
"It prevents softening of the carrot pieces and helps maintain the organoleptic qualities of the carrots."
"The second criterion is usefulness to the consumer."
"It seems that treatment with alginate may mislead the consumer, since the food may appear fresher than it really is."
"Moreover, additives cannot, in general, be used, as in the present case, for unprocessed foodstuffs which have not undergone treatment involving a significant change to their original state."
"There is therefore a second form of deception, and that is why it cannot be said that there is usefulness to the consumer. Instead, there is harm to the consumer."
"The third criterion is harmlessness."
"According to all the scientific literature and the Scientific Committee for Human Food, this additive is innocuous, but it has a laxative effect which is considered to be negligible in the small quantity ingested."
"A problem may arise in view of the number of additives with a laxative effect."
"The synergy between all these additives with a laxative effect has not been assessed."
"There are many such substances, and I would remind you that, in 1992, the Scientific Committee for Human Food recommended that a study be carried out of the contribution of other food components with potential laxative effects to the overall dietetic burden of substances with this biological property."
"This study has never been carried out."
"As a result, it would be only natural, as a precautionary measure and until such time as this study has been carried out, not to authorise new additives presenting this property."
"These are the three criteria."
"Two of them do not satisfy us."
"I think it is perfectly right to refuse to authorise this additive."
"It is not a question of having it in for a particular additive, but of demonstrating a rigorous approach."
"There are at present 307 food additives on the European market, 163 of which are perfectly innocuous."
"That is not bad."
"The others, although not dangerous, may present a potential health risk, especially when they are used in combination."
"There are always problems of synergy."
"We know that the Commission is preparing a new directive on additives."
"I think it would be extremely interesting to show what Parliament' s position is at a time when the directive is being revised so that the additive content is less than it is at present."
"I think that this would be of benefit to public health without causing any damage at all to industry."
"Mr President, the PPE-DE Group voted in favour of the Lannoye report within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and it is, in fact, completely compatible with our wishes."
"I will therefore advise my colleagues to support the report, including the one amendment."
"We would not ask for peeled and cut carrots to be plunged into alginate, and support the rapporteur in his amendment."
"We would prefer it if this provision were deleted."
"Mr President, at this late hour and with a piece of carrot stuck in my throat, I doubt whether I have much else to say to my fellow MEPs."
"I believe I have made the position of our group clear."
"Thank you Mrs Thyssen, I sympathise with you, for while you have a carrot in your throat, I have a frog in my throat, as we say north of the Rhine, but there is a bit of a flu bug going round in this House."
"Mr President, I brought my carrots with me but wisely I did not, like Mrs Thyssen, attempt to eat them, although both would have passed the Lannoye test."
"I never believed that my last speech in this House in the twentieth century would be about sodium alginates."
"But I could have bet that it would be in reply to a debate initiated by Mr Lannoye because he is an indefatigable champion of the consumer in matters great and small."
"In my humble opinion these matters are relatively small - perhaps as small as these pieces of carrot."
"I confess that I have some personal doubts about the dangers of E-401 but the dangers are not really, in the end, what this is about."
"Our food authority in the UK has argued at length to me that sodium alginate is harmless, permitted in the US and many countries, has been around since the 1930s and, as far as laxatives are concerned, has less effect than we would find in fruit or cereal fibre and infinitely less than you would get from a mouthful of seaweed in a Japanese restaurant."
"So much for the scientific approach."
"Why then do I support Mr Lannoye?"
"And my comrades in the PSE Group will do the same."
"For several reasons, and this is where he performs such a singular service in our debates."
"Firstly, he says: ""What is the consumer benefit?"""
"We can see the manufacturer's benefit that this piece of carrot stays orange and does not turn grey."
"But what is the consumer benefit in that?"
"Secondly, where is the preparedness of industry to come forward and accept that some of the many additives we have can be struck off?"
"Nobody says that."
"Nobody comes to tell us."
"Until they do we should support Mr Lannoye and his amendments and wish him a happy New Year."
"Mr President, for my part, I can fully support the common position."
"The argument for further restrictions on food additives has more to do with political assessment of consumers' need of these additives."
"We should however try to avoid this type of assessment."
"In my opinion, we should instead base our assessments on scientifically substantiated risk assessments."
"In anticipation of the Council's discussion of the matter, the Commission has chosen to withdraw permission for the use of ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose."
"Ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose is used in Sweden and Finland almost exclusively by people with an allergy to gluten."
"These people have knowledge, accumulated over many years, about cellulose as a binding agent, particularly in bread."
"If they stop using it, they risk having a poorer diet."
"Poor diet increases the risk of stomach upsets and diarrhoea."
"There is also an increased risk of children suffering from stunted growth."
"Chronic dietary problems also increase the risk of cancer."
"Last weekend I met a number of dieticians who were concerned that the withdrawal of permission to use ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose would lead to those with a gluten allergy having problems with their intake of nutrients."
"My question to the Commissioner is therefore: what opportunities do Swedes with a gluten allergy have for finding bread with this additive even after permission for use has been withdrawn, and does the Commission intend to speed up the consultation in the Scientific Committee on Foodstuffs which will allow the matter to be taken up and the decision changed?"
"Mr President, I have a Christmas message from a 14 year-old boy in Sweden."
"The boy has a gluten allergy and really struggles with his diet."
"He has now found out that the European Parliament wants to ban the cellulose in his diet and also in his Christmas food."
"His Christmas message to you all is: 'What are you playing at in the EU?'"
"Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lannoye, and the Committee of the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on food additives other than colours and sweeteners."
"With regard to the amendment on the use of sodium alginate the proposal to extend this use to pre-packed peeled carrots was made by the Commission in its original proposal in July 1999."
"We have now re-examined this original proposal thoroughly and have come to the conclusion that it is appropriate not to authorise the new use of an additive such as sodium alginate in unprocessed foodstuffs."
"As the criteria for the authorisation of a new additive or additive use go beyond a simple safety assessment the Commission can accept the amendment of Parliament rejecting the extended use of sodium alginate in carrots."
"Official inspections in the field of animal nutrition"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-372/2000) by Mr Staes, on behalf of the Delegation of the European Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the discussion of this report on the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition is much like the end of one stage in some cycle race or other."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that approval of the joint draft text will guarantee us a win tomorrow."
"But that does not mean, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that the yellow jersey is safe or final victory is in sight."
"As I already explained during second reading, there is a crisis underlying this directive amendment."
"After all, a number of years ago, it became clear that citrus pulp from Brazil, which was contaminated with dioxin, had ended up in animal feed in the Netherlands, Belgium and in Germany."
"It then also transpired that the Commission did not have the right tools to tackle the problem adequately."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is about to change."
"I noticed during the trialogue how Member State governments put their own interests above the general interest."
"Discussions with the French Presidency were courteous, yet tough."
"I made every effort to ensure that the European Commission can act independently in emergencies and certainly in cases where public and animal health are under threat, so without having to consult the Member States."
"The measures issued by the Commission apply with immediate effect and these must also be submitted to the Standing Committee on Animal Nutrition within ten days."
"The negotiations also meant that - and I view this as a personal victory for this Parliament - the safeguard measures issued by the Commission remain in force as long as they are not replaced by another legislative decision."
"A second problem was that the Member States rather disliked our requirement to provide for the possibility of unannounced inspections."
"During the trialogue, it became clear that the Council did not intend to shift from this position."
"As a result, I received from the French Presidency a very clear signal, a very clear message indeed, which was 'no pasar√°n' (they will not get through)."
"Member States clearly view unannounced inspections as a violation of their sovereignty, but they did seem prepared to provide the experts of the Commission with all the assistance required to fulfil their inspection task."
"Furthermore, the results of the inspections will be imparted to the European Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I salvaged as much as I could."
"In my opinion, our Parliament is tightening up on the Council' s common position considerably and I recommend approval of the common draft text."
"But as I already mentioned a moment ago, we are about to finish a stage in a cycle race as it were."
"There is another stage scheduled for tomorrow, when Mrs Marit Paulsen from the Liberal Group will be at the helm and she will be given the chance to further tighten the present directive."
"She deserves all our support in this."
"I wish her every success, and she knows she can count on me."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine."
"These mills here, however, are grinding too slowly for my liking."
"For two years we have had the Commission's proposal on the table."
"Its aim is better harmonisation and coordination of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition in the Member States of the European Union."
"Food safety is the watchword of the moment, perhaps even the concept of the year."
"How closely the safety of our food is linked to the feed eaten by livestock has been demonstrated by recent scandals, from dioxins and waste oil in feed mixes to the manufacture of animal and bone meal, which, as we all know, can be a good source of protein if special manufacturing methods are used."
"But methods have also been exposed which are nothing short of criminal."
"Consumers have rightly made a radical response, switching to other foodstuffs that they believe to be safe."
"The political world is called upon to do everything in its power to ensure that the safety of foodstuffs can be guaranteed."
"But how can guarantees be given if inspections have not taken place?"
"In an internal market where there are no border controls, we believe that the European Union has an obligation to conduct inspections. The inspection of foodstuffs and animal feed, however, is the prerogative of the Member States."
"Now, after lengthy negotiations in the Conciliation Committee, an acceptable compromise has been worked out, involving a guarantee that safeguard measures taken by the Commission will remain in force until they are replaced by another act and an obligation on the Member States to provide full assistance to the Commission officials carrying out on-the-spot inspections."
"One thing is sure: only if the Member States and the Commission cooperate and pool all their resources will we be able to achieve a higher level of safety in this sensitive field of animal nutrition."
"The PPE-DE Group supports the compromise that has been achieved."
"We stress, however, that we shall continue to keep a critical eye on developments and that we shall again respond to any problems in the appropriate manner."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for its support of the European Commission's position and the remarkable effort made to meet the concerns of the Council."
"Indeed this conciliation overcomes the technicalities of the legal text and stresses the strong will and the mutual commitment of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to the protection of health and consumers' interests."
"Member States and the Commission now have a better instrument available to ensure that Community legislation in animal nutrition is properly enforced and, in the event of emergencies in third countries, rapid reactions are possible."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"Your remarks are so brief today that we don't even have time for a sip of coffee!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Sustainable urban development"
"The next item is the report (A5-350/2000) by Mrs Lienemann, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a Community Framework for cooperation to promote sustainable urban development."
"Mr President, I welcome the series of compromise amendments that have been tabled in the names of Mrs Lienemann and Mrs Roth-Behrendt on behalf of the Socialist Group and by myself, on behalf of the EPP-ED Group, particularly as the agreement will allow the EUR 14 million budget to be put in place which will ensure that this four-year programme can commence in 2001 without going to second reading."
"In a nutshell, this commitment for a Community framework will hopefully, with the agreement of the Commission and the Council, put a legal base under existing schemes being pursued by networks of local and regional authorities which are actively promoting sustainable urban development."
"This will also provide financially for them."
"We must be careful not to take a top-down approach to what has to be a bottom-up initiative."
"The Commission must not impose priorities from above but must listen to, and facilitate, the work done at local level, as the local authorities are not just facilitators of Commission policies."
"They are the level of government closest to the citizen."
"They have the democratic, financial and administrative responsibility for urban sustainability."
"I welcome this legislation."
"Mr President, there has been so much discussion of this issue, and we are so like-minded with regards to it, that the report does not actually have to be presented in the proper sense."
"But, anyway, the idea of sustainable urban development has grown into something significant in just the last few years."
"It is a question, mainly, of a horizontal approach, namely, that sustainable development is a common denominator for social, economic and ecological work in cities."
"We know that the Commission is now drafting a programme for sustainable development for the whole of the European Union, and that should be ready in six months' time."
"I hope that sustainable urban development will form a vital part of this sustainable development strategy."
"We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities, and, until now, these matters, as far as cities specifically are concerned, have played second fiddle."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, has quite rightly recommended that the Commission' s proposed budget should be increased."
"The sum is not very large even now, but it will definitely enable us to start an inter-city networking programme so that our citizens, in particular, will be able to establish direct contact with the various players in the networks of different countries."
"In this way we can develop the European view on urban development."
"I hope that these resources will be used specifically for developing European cooperation from the point of view of our citizens."
"Mr President, the European sustainable cities and towns campaign, which is made up of an alliance of 540 different local authorities, has committed itself to implementing local policies and actions geared towards promoting sustainability."
"It is really a question of putting in place best practices which can in a real sense develop our towns and cities in a positive manner."
"In Ireland, urban renewal programmes are making a significant contribution to the upgrading of small towns and villages."
"The small town/village renewal programme is an integral part of rural development."
"EU structural funds, mainly through the ESF, as well as national exchequer finances, must always be focused on developing disadvantaged and poorer areas in our society."
"The issue of sustainability does not only apply to towns and cities."
"There are many rural parts of the European Union that need to be developed and sustained in a positive manner."
"Unemployment black spots are both applicable to urban and rural areas."
"As a legislative institution we should not seek at any time to exacerbate the urban/rural divide."
"We need to develop marginalised and disadvantaged areas while supporting economic development and expanding social programmes."
"The planning process must be implemented in a fair and innovative manner."
"Mr President, excuse my being late, but debates at this time are got through more quickly than during the day."
"I am going to explain to you the factors which Mrs Lienemann would have liked to have presented to you herself if she had not been detained by other work."
"The proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council, adopted by the European Commission on 22 November 1999 and on a Community Framework for cooperation to promote sustainable urban development, follows on from the 'European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign' , launched in 1992."
"The state of the urban environment, in which approximately 80% of the European population resides, is a fundamental topic of concern which has repercussions at local, European and world levels."
"It has to be said that the thorniest environmental problems at European level basically concern urban areas."
"They are often closely linked to global environmental challenges, and their impact is such that they directly influence the quality of life for millions of people."
"A coherent and sustainable approach to urban development policies may, however, significantly improve the quality of life in cities and towns."
"Indeed, the concept of sustainable development, particularly in the case of cities and towns, is not, and cannot be, limited solely to the environmental aspect, but also embraces social and economic aspects."
"Europe' s cities and towns are important economic, political and socio-cultural centres."
"They may also represent a major threat to our natural environment, and the current challenge is to facilitate balanced urban development enabling cities and towns to continue to play an important role in contemporary society, as well as in the society of the future."
"One major challenge in creating an urban policy is to find the means of pursuing sustainable urban development objectives within the administrative structure of the city."
"That is why, in agreement with the other institutions, Mrs Lienemann, our rapporteur, has proposed slightly increasing the budget to EUR 14 million in order to promote cooperation in this area between 2001 and 2004."
"The appropriations would be mainly allocated to networks of towns and cities organised at European level and in order to support their activities in the field of development and the dissemination of good practices where sustainable urban development is concerned."
"Mr President, the citizens of Europe undoubtedly demand a more favourable environment and we in this House must reflect those expectations and make it possible for them to be fulfilled."
"The 2000-2004 multiannual programme for sustainable development in the urban environment is an appropriate instrument for achieving this end, and the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordinating and developing actions."
"Nevertheless, we must recognise that there has been no widespread success, either in the implementation of Agenda 21 or in the results obtained."
"Land planning in many Member States still fails to take account of the capacity of the physical environment, the cultural heritage and the resources of local authorities to assume their environmental duties."
"Furthermore, the report on sustainable cities highlights the existence of significant shortcomings in the practice and in the development of environmental legislation at a local level."
"The multiannual plan has ambitious objectives and a very broad scope, which can be extended to the candidate countries."
"Of course, we need a budget which is coherent with the terms of the proposal, but we would be falling into another trap if we did not have much more effective mechanisms for monitoring and assessing the results than we have at the moment."
"To conclude: 'yes' to strengthening the budget, 'yes' to the report and to the improvements which Mrs Lienemann has made to the Commission' s proposal, but also to reinforcing, considerably, the mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of all these programmes, both within the Commission and in the Member States themselves."
"Thank you Mr President. As Mrs Patrie has already said, 80 percent of the population of Europe live in towns or cities."
"The chances of a good life for these people depend entirely on the environment where they live."
"Unfortunately, towns and cities today are associated almost automatically with a bad environmental situation - large quantities of emissions, a lot of traffic and polluted waterways. But it does not actually need to be this way."
"Better knowledge and new technology provides the opportunity for a better environment in Europe's towns and cities."
"Clear legislation and careful control of this are yet other tools."
"The towns and cities themselves have many of the instruments available to them, which help to improve the environment for their own citizens."
"It is often in the municipalities and towns that they are most aware of their own problems."
"With sensible town planning, well-functioning public transport and cooperation with other municipal interested parties, it is possible to provide citizens with a better environment."
"In practice, it is also at the local level that the environmental decisions we take here in Parliament are to be implemented."
"The climate issue is a good example of this."
"Reduced traffic and conversion from fossil fuels at a local level is necessary to achieve a change in the climate threat we are experiencing."
"There needs to be a clear dialogue and good cooperation between the institutions of the Union and those acting at local level, that is the municipalities or towns and cities."
"I believe that Mrs Lienemann's report will contribute to this."
"However, we must also get citizens involved at local level."
"This can be done through cooperation with universities, voluntary organisations, companies and other actors."
"For this reason I feel that, in the definition of who can apply for funds from the framework programme, there must be room for organisations other than those we traditionally regard as municipal organisations."
"There are many good examples of municipalities cooperating with others."
"It is the spread of responsibility that is the important thing."
"This, in my opinion, should be a criterion."
"Therefore, I would like to support Amendment No 31."
"Mr President, let me first even in her absence congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for her excellent work, and express my great satisfaction that, thanks to the constructive work of both Parliament and the Council, we might be in a position to conclude on this important initiative already at first reading."
"This proposal on sustainable urban development has the potential of having a direct effect on the daily lives as many as 80% of the European population."
"It will enable and encourage towns and cities throughout Europe and beyond to come together and learn from each other's experiences, help them to tackle environmental problems and challenges and to work towards sustainability."
"The Commission is also grateful for the substantial support which the European Parliament has provided for this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been put forward."
"The Commission recognises the importance of promoting good governance and transparency in its decision-making process."
"Accordingly, we are strongly in favour of the establishment of a platform of dialogue with the key stakeholders to help determine the priority themes to be supported."
"Its innovative approach will involve cooperation with the city networks, Member States, EU institutions, NGOs and the business community, ensuring that the funds provided from the framework are targeted at those areas of sustainable development most in need of them."
"I believe that this innovative approach will provide an example for others to follow."
"The budget for this proposal has been the subject of some debate with a wide range of views expressed about the appropriateness of the EUR 12.4 m originally proposed by the Commission."
"Many have suggested that the budget is too small."
"The Commission wants to stress however that this framework is not about the implementation of projects at ground level."
"Other Community programmes and initiatives are already in place for this."
"Rather, the framework is designed to facilitate the sharing of information and ideas about the best practice of sustainable urban development so that the solutions identified to problems in one city or town can be shared with the other cities and towns throughout Europe and beyond."
"The quality approach of the framework and its multiplier effects are such that despite the relatively small budget it is expected to have a real impact on the promotion of sustainable urban development in Europe."
"The forty-one amendments have been given detailed consideration and the Commission is able to accept thirty of them, either completely or in principle."
"Amendment No 33 proposes a revised budget for the proposal of EUR 14 m."
"We must make it clear that the Commission's general line on such matters is that no budget increase can be accepted without additional resources being transferred by the Council and Parliament to the relevant budget lines."
"In this specific instance, however, and on the basis that it will facilitate the adoption at first reading, the Commission has exceptionally agreed to accept an increase of the financial scope of the proposal to EUR 14 m without the provision of additional resources."
"While we are willing to support a figure of EUR 14 m we cannot support a figure of EUR 20 m as proposed by Amendment No 14."
"The second issue relates to commitology."
"Given the nature of the activity, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 10 and 23."
"Establishment of a consultative committee would be the appropriate commitology solution."
"So, to conclude, the Commission can fully accept Amendments Nos 2, 5 to 8, 10 to 13, 15, 16, 18 to 20, 22 to 24, 28, 30, 32 to 35 and 37."
"The Commission can in principle accept Amendments Nos 25, 27, 36, 40 and 41."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 9, 14, 17, 21, 26, 31, 38 and 39."
"Amendment No 31 would allow NGOs, universities etc. to be involved as main partners in the networks to be supported."
"It is intended that the main partners in this framework should be the Commission and networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies of sustainable urban development."
"We cannot therefore accept this."
"Finally, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the detailed consideration it has given to this proposal and for the valuable input provided by all parties. It has undoubtedly strengthened and improved the quality of the proposal and, as a consequence, helped to ensure that it will deliver the maximum possible benefit to cities and towns throughout the EU and further afield."
"I am also happy that the spirit of the interinstitutional cooperation has been such that the adoption of this proposal at first reading should be secure."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Precautionary principle"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-352/2000) by Mrs Patrie, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly late for us to be tackling the celebrated precautionary principle."
"I say 'celebrated' because it is a very fashionable subject, and you will no doubt agree with me that not a day passes without the press, at the drop of a hat, running a headline on the precautionary principle, either advisedly or ill-advisedly, but misleadingly, more often than not."
"Public interest in the precautionary principle is not surprising and reflects their legitimate concern, for they have become extremely sensitive to such matters as a result of recent food scandals and cases such as the contaminated blood scandal."
"This interest also reflects the crisis of public confidence in science, which is now recognised as not being infallible."
"Finally, interest in the precautionary principle reflects the crisis of public confidence in governmental and political decision makers, who are suspected of connivance with certain pressure groups, especially industrial lobbies, or simply of culpable irresponsibility."
"All this demonstrates the major political stakes involved in the issue of the precautionary principle and, in this connection, I welcome the Commission' s initiative, as well as the general quality of its communication on this precautionary principle."
"In order to explain the result I should like our Parliament to arrive at, I should like this evening quickly to underline two key aspects of this debate."
"The first issue raised by the report we are debating is of a legal nature. Indeed, even if it is only recently that the media have begun publicising it, the precautionary principle has not only just made its appearance on the international legal scene."
"A good many treaties and international agreements refer to it."
"The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the WTO' s dispute settlement bodies consider that the precautionary principle is applicable in environmental or public health issues, occasionally even against the Europeans, as may be seen from the case (still pending) of cheese produced from milk straight from the cow."
"However, these references in international texts are not enough to specify either its nature or its legal value, especially since such texts do not include any definition of the precautionary principle."
"This gives rise to a degree of legal insecurity unacceptable not only to our fellow citizens but also to industrialists who no longer know what fate has in store for them."
"The first key task of the Commission' s communication and of Parliament' s report is therefore to specify the character and the legal value we wish to accord the precautionary principle, to define the conditions in which the precautionary principle may and must be applied and, finally, to determine the criteria to be fulfilled by the measures taken in application of the precautionary principle."
"The second key task in our work on the precautionary principle is of a more political nature."
"What the European Union has to do is to is to promote a unified conception of the precautionary principle, not only so that this principle may be a part of all policies implemented by the European Union within the scope of its jurisdiction, but also so that reference may be made to this European approach in respect of our partners who often have a less ambitious approach than ourselves where environmental and health matters are concerned."
"In this respect, it is important for our Parliament to express a very clear position so that the Commission may be provided with a sound mandate for defending the European Union' s positions within international bodies, particularly the WTO."
"We are gratified to note that the bulk of the text of the resolution, at which we have arrived after several debates within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, coincides with the Council resolution, appended to the conclusions of the Nice Summit."
"The text produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is the result of an ongoing search for a compromise or, rather, a balance between the maximalist and minimalist tendencies which were expressed in the course of our discussions, both of which result in excesses."
"The maximalists attempt to block innovation and progress, while the minimalists advise having recourse to the precautionary principle only in the case of significant environmental and health risks, that is to say above a certain threshold, although it is not really clear how to define this."
"Faced with these two approaches, I have endeavoured to arrive at a fair balance so that this political tool might be used within a legal framework."
"The European Union' s ambition is to guarantee its citizens a high level of protection where their health and the environment are concerned."
"That is why I invite you to support this reasoned and reasonable concept of the precautionary principle and to reject all the amendments which would depart from it in one direction or another."
"- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Legal Affairs Committee identified a few key points concerning the precautionary principle, reflecting concerns which are also expressed in Mrs Patrie's excellent report."
"It was not our sole intention to deliver a purely legal evaluation."
"On the contrary, our opinion has an undoubtedly political character too."
"I emphasise this because the application of the precautionary principle demands more than perfectly crafted legislation."
"It is a matter of ensuring that the high level of protection which the Treaties promise the people of the European Union is actually guaranteed."
"This can only be achieved if we are really serious about the need for preventive action."
"Damage limitation and compensation must not be our aim; our paramount goal must be to prevent damage to people's health and property."
"We can achieve it by rigorously applying the precautionary principle, as my honourable colleague has explained."
"We as legislators should never lose sight of this, and we should encourage the Commission to apply the principle from the outset when drafting legislative proposals."
"Mrs Patrie's report pledges us to do precisely that."
"In connection with BSE, a great deal of past and future heartache would have been spared if we had armed ourselves with adequate legislation in good time and if we had verified compliance with such legislation, which, as we know, is a matter for the Member States."
"When we banned American hormone-treated meat to protect the health of our consumers, our right to take preventive action was challenged."
"It was even decried as protectionism!"
"In another context too, the sceptics never tire of invoking the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination."
"On closer inspection, it emerges that these scruples are not motivated so much by concern for the rule of law as by concern for money and profits."
"I personally have no fear of excessive statutory protection."
"Nor should the people of Europe have any reason to be afraid."
"On the contrary, when they look at European legislation, they should be able to rest assured that all the Members of their Parliament attach greater importance to public health than to the quest for profits."
"For this reason, I recommend that we follow the line that the rapporteur has mapped out for us."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Patrie for her excellent report on this Commission communication on the complex subject of the precautionary principle."
"There is a crisis of public confidence in science, which is now recognised as not being infallible, and there is also a crisis of public confidence in political decision-makers, who are suspected of connivance with certain industrial and commercial pressure groups or simply of culpable irresponsibility."
"We must ensure that this report echoes public demands for a high level of protection for health and the environment."
"Essentially, use of the precautionary principle can be seen as a risk management strategy in the face of scientific uncertainty or a tool to allow the involvement of the public decision-making authority in managing scientific uncertainty."
"Scientists evaluate the risk and the political decision-makers manage the risk."
"Clarifying who should do what is an essential prerequisite for restoring the necessary public confidence in both the scientific community and public decision-makers - us politicians."
"There is a legitimate role also for peer-reviewed minority scientific opinions."
"After all, let us remind ourselves that BSE was brought to public attention through a minority report."
"There is a legitimate concern felt by public opinion which has become extremely sensitive to such matters as a result of the recent food scandals and particularly the BSE crisis."
"The public no longer wants to bear the brunt of hazardous technological innovations which several or many years later prove to have entailed unnecessary risk to public health or the environment."
"They will not accept that there should be any doubt whatsoever but that the materials used to make their children's toys are completely harmless, for example."
"As long ago as 1996 the European Parliament came out in favour of a ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal throughout the European Union in accordance with the precautionary principle - if only."
"The rest is history."
"The way to restore consumers' confidence in industry generally is to adopt clear and precise rules in the light of the precautionary principle."
"In all cases measures must be taken, must be regularly reviewed in the light of scientific developments."
"There should be an absolute requirement for transparency in all cases involving regular provision of information to the public, including when a project or activity has been given the green light."
"We need to see clearer guidelines on the application of the principle."
"It should be used where there are reasonable grounds for concern."
"Precaution does not equal prevention, nor should the precautionary principle be invoked as a technical trade barrier."
"Mr President, the precautionary principle is gaining more ground in the international Treaties."
"Nevertheless, it remains a source of confusion."
"The message, in short, is: if in doubt, do not do it."
"Doubt has now been cast upon virtually everything, and that would mean that nothing is possible any more."
"That is why the Commission' s clarifications are welcomed and why I am very impressed with Mrs Patrie' s report."
"She has done sterling work and I would like to congratulate her on it."
"A clear distinction needs to be drawn between precaution and prudence."
"Precaution is applicable in situations where science cannot provide a conclusive answer. It is suspected that a certain substance presents a risk, but no proof exists."
"Prudence is called for in situations where the risks are known."
"In those situations, a safety margin is imposed as a precautionary measure."
"The precautionary principle is a political response to the risks within society."
"We must avoid unknown risks."
"The precautionary principle must also apply to products and substances which are already available and in use, as well as to production methods."
"I am in favour of the precautionary principle, but I would like to mention one area of concern."
"I sometimes have the feeling that reference is made to the precautionary principle all the time, whether appropriate or not."
"There is no such thing as absolute scientific certainty about new substances or products, nor can there ever be."
"The present situation is taken as a point of departure and that leads to conservatism and resistance to anything new."
"In this way, we are distancing ourselves from the United States and large sections of the rest of the world."
"That may be the case and so be it, but worse still is that the precautionary principle can produce a whole generation of political cowards, a generation which passes the buck and does not dare to take any decisions out of precaution."
"It leads to the scientification of a policy without ever reaching consensus, for science is unable to offer that either."
"The precautionary principle is therefore a valuable and important principle, but we must aim to use it more sparingly."
"Mr President, No one is in any doubt about the importance of the precautionary principle and I warmly welcome both the Commission communication and Mr Patrie's report."
"In the Committee on Industry, we underlined the importance of having clarity on the modalities for the application of the principle."
"So I am pleased to see that the final report reflects the need for further elaboration of the concept."
"We also called for measures in the World Trade Organisation, perhaps a regulation, which would ensure that it is possible, in the context of the WTO, to invoke other obligations, such as those we have under multilateral environmental agreements, to extend the scope of the precautionary principle."
"In that context it would be helpful if the Commission would confirm its position that withdrawing a product on the basis of process or production methods may indeed be a legitimate application of the principle."
"It is a very positive sign that the Council text says that it considers that the WTO rules basically allow for account to be taken of the precautionary principle, and further that it calls on Member States and the Commission to ensure that, and I quote, ""the precautionary principle is fully recognised in all trade fora to pursue that aim and ensure that it is taken into account at the same time, particularly at the World Trade Organisation""."
"The idea of compatibility between a precautionary principle and the World Trade Organisation seems to be gaining ground and that is to be welcomed."
"There are issues to be borne in mind to ensure that it works well."
"We must ensure for example that the burden of defending precautionary measures, especially for developing countries, does not reduce their capacity to protect health and the environment through precautionary action."
"Finally if the precautionary principle is to be applied effectively and credibly, it is vital to involve all key stakeholders, including representatives of civil society in the policy choices that surround its application."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"I also welcome the Commission's proposal which is an important guideline for the EU and the Member States for understanding and applying the precautionary principle."
"The proposal is of course, from an international point of view, an invaluable tool for decision-making in cases where there is uncertainty regarding risks, products or manufacturing methods."
"I fully share the Commission' s position when it defines the precautionary principle as a general principle with unlimited scope."
"Just like many MEPs, I'm sure, I was pleasantly surprised at the Council's resolution from the European Council meeting in Nice which states that the precautionary principle should be applied as quickly as possible after harmful effects to health and the environment have been established and if reliable conclusions concerning the level of risk cannot be reached on the basis of a preliminary scientific investigation based on the information available."
"This is very far-reaching and, of course, very good."
"I would also like to appeal to everybody here, in anticipation of tomorrow's vote, not to weaken the committee's and the rapporteur's text by adopting the amendments proposed by the EDD and the PPE."
"Instead, we ought to try to strengthen the text further to show that we are at least as progressive as the Council."
"Amendment No 9 is very important."
"This proposes that a reversed burden of proof be applied regarding products with no prior approval, that is to say that producers must prove that the product is safe and not transfer the risks and the cost to consumers."
"It is of course also important to increase the legal weight with the aim of making the precautionary principle an international standard."
"This is dealt with in Amendment No 5 from the Group of the Greens."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur points out very effectively, the cautionary or precautionary principle - even though the rapporteur differentiates between the two - is laid down in several international agreements, ranging from Rio 1992, to the protection of the North Sea and, more recently, in the Montreal Biosecurity Protocol."
"As other speakers have said, it is crucial that this principle should be applied properly and that there are legal guarantees for the parties involved, but I would like to take up three ideas that are in Mrs Patrie' s report and in some of the amendments and which seem to me to be perhaps the most important ideas in the report."
"Firstly, that there is no minimum threshold of risk below which the precautionary principle must not be applied and, consequently, even in cases where there is little risk, it would have to be used."
"Secondly, that transparency and consumer information are very important and necessary to the whole process of assessment and risk management."
"And lastly, that public health and the environment must be given priority over all other considerations, particularly financial considerations."
"If things had been done in this way, Mr President, I do not believe that we would now be lamenting the disease suffered by mad cows, or that we would be lamenting certain other examples of food contamination whose future effects are still unknown."
"There is currently a great degree of sensitivity and concern over the use in foods of genetically modified products."
"Another example is the great sensitivity over the information, whether it has a scientific basis or not, about the possible effects of mobile phones, electromagnetic waves and also masts transmitting electromagnetic waves."
"Mr President, I believe that this is a very important principle if it is used properly and whenever it is necessary."
"Mr President, I compliment the rapporteur on her work."
"I believe it is very timely that the European Parliament is having a debate on the need to ensure that the precautionary principle is enshrined within all EU regulations and directives."
"Events concerning new BSE distortions in Europe have once again put the issue of food safety at the top of the European political agenda."
"The precautionary principle must be invoked at every opportunity when it comes to the enactment of new EU legislative provisions in the area of protecting and improving the food chain in Europe."
"The 370 million consumers of the European Union are demanding action in the area of food safety."
"I welcome the recent statements by the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr Byrne, when he unequivocally stated that the precautionary principle is his guiding point of reference when it comes to the initiation of EU directives and regulations in the area of promoting food safety."
"Mr President, modern society with all its consumer goods, which include many different kinds of appliances, requires materials and substances with very specific characteristics."
"Everyone, or most of us, accept and use these products."
"However, the substances and materials in these products, as well as many kinds of foodstuffs, can carry risks."
"As everyone should know, our whole lives are fraught with risks and uncertainties."
"Life is about being able to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a sensible manner."
"The Commission proposal sets the right tone for clearer guidelines for applying the precautionary principle."
"Mrs Patrie' s opinion that the EU must clarify its stance on the precautionary principle, has my unqualified support."
"Unfortunately, I am bound to say that the draft resolution of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which is too lengthy, does not meet this requirement."
"Its wordy and ambiguous style make it impenetrable as to its actual meaning. This is in contrast to the resolution of the Nice European Council."
"In my amendments which I have tabled, I attempt to clarify these matters and delete a number of redundant paragraphs."
"As science is often unable to establish a direct link between products and their possible harmful effects, we demand more clarity in the matter."
"In order to apply the precautionary principle, it is absolutely essential to provide a scientific basis for the concern about possible harmful effects."
"Both restriction and acceptance of a certain level of risk are important in order to take measures."
"In addition, it is important for us to give due consideration to the protection level we have opted for, which can largely be deduced from the legislation we have drafted."
"Finally, I am of the opinion that reversal of the burden of proof is not appropriate."
"In order to use the precautionary principle correctly, we also need to know what the harmful effects will be of any alternatives, should a prohibitive measure be taken."
"Mr President, the precautionary principle has become one of the citizen' s greatest allies in defending public health and the environment."
"But there is still a long way to go in perfecting this principle."
"First of all, it is still typically European: on the other side of the Atlantic this instrument is seen as obscurantist and even mediaeval."
"Yet the way the European Union itself uses it is both unclear and even irrational."
"Sometimes it overuses it, cheapening it, and at other times it uses it too little and provokes our indignation."
"That is why I regard this Commission proposal, enriched by Mrs Patrie' s report, as being so important."
"By establishing clearly when and how the precautionary principle should be applied, it clarifies its use at a European level, making it more credible, and it mandates the European negotiators in the next round of the World Trade Organisation to inscribe the precautionary principle as basic and universal."
"But allow me to denounce what I see as a flagrant example of the lack of coherence in the use of the precautionary principle in the European Union: I am talking about mobile telephones."
"It is incomprehensible that the European Union should remain insensitive to the dozens of independent scientific studies that point to the possible risk posed by mobile telephones to human health."
"We might even ask ourselves whether this inertia does not derive from the fact that the majority of mobile phone manufacturers are European companies."
"Only yesterday in Lisbon, the American professor, George Carlo, who for the last seven years has been entrusted by the Food and Drugs Administration with a study on the effect of the radiation on human health, revealed at first hand that there is the risk that the use of mobile phones might promote the appearance of brain tumours, Alzheimer' s disease and skin lesions."
"Under these circumstances, I invite the Commission to apply the precautionary principle to mobile phones and to draw particular attention to the dangers of their use by children."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Patrie who has produced an excellent report on the precautionary principle."
"It is no mean task to define the precautionary principle."
"I personally think that it is impossible to create a general precautionary principle which applies in all situations."
"Each situation requires its own precautionary principle."
"This is hard for us to accept, but foodstuffs and chemicals are not the same thing."
"They cannot therefore be dealt with in the same way either."
"Our task is to create the framework required to protect both the environment and the health of people and animals."
"The precautionary principle does not look the same in our respective countries."
"However, what we need to do now is to create a common precautionary principle at EU level."
"The principle must be clear."
"We must be able to uphold it internationally, and it must also be given legal weight."
"Several people in this House have already mentioned the mad cow disease scandal as one of the many scandals we have experienced recently."
"This scandal reveals something extremely important, namely the importance of having the courage to make decisions even when we do not have all the proof on the table."
"But there are more examples than mad cow disease alone, examples which are perhaps not as spectacular, but where it is just as important to make decisions."
"We have the example of phthalates in children's toys and we also have this strange idea of putting toys inside sweets, ice cream and other edible products."
"In the one case, we say that we do not have sufficient proof and, in the other, that there have not been enough serious accidents for us to have the courage to take action."
"It is just a shame that it is not the scientific community but the internal market that controls what is released onto the market."
"This is an untenable situation."
"In reality we cannot have this kind of situation."
"I support the whole of Mrs Patrie's report but I would also like to highlight what Mrs Sch√∂rling said earlier in her speech, and that is that we need a stricter position with regard to the burden of proof, particularly as regards products without prior approval."
"Producers and manufacturers must be able to present proof that a product is in fact safe."
"We must avoid a situation in which the consumer acts as some sort of paying guinea pig when it comes to new products on the market."
"Mr President, the environment and public health are like a complex machine with many functions that we monitor and check in order to be able to intervene to make sure that things do not go wrong."
"The machine has a great number of warning lights; if one of these lights red, it tells us that there is something wrong and that we must intervene immediately if the machine is not to break down."
"We must not wait until several or all of the warning lights are lit."
"This is the precautionary principle in practice."
"However, this is not how it works in the case of public health."
"Here we wait until all the warning lights are lit before intervening, and this is also the problem with the European Commission' s communication."
"In my opinion, the precautionary principle is quite simply about the law and not least the duty to intervene with sufficient and necessary resources on the basis of a suspicion or a probable suspicion that a substance or a process may cause irreparable damage to the environment and health."
"Those who cannot live without the substance or process in question must demonstrate that it can exist without resulting in permanent damage."
"Amongst other things, the Commission proposes that the benefits and costs associated with action or failure to act in an area are to be investigated."
"However, this was precisely what was done in connection with the BSE scandal and that was why the catastrophe hit England and now also France, which had been given all the signals that BSE was present and still did not want to apply the precautionary principle."
"An analysis of the pros and cons is an absurd concept bearing in mind the idea behind the precautionary principle, namely to be able to react to a product before we fully know all the advantages and disadvantages."
"The same applies to the Commission' s requirement of a thorough risk analysis beforehand."
"After all, if we know all the risks, costs, etc., then there is no need for the precautionary principle."
"I also think that far too much emphasis is placed on the assessment of a matter by experts, toxicologists and economists."
"Risk management and enforcement of the precautionary principle are not the responsibility of experts, but a general political responsibility and matter and the Commission' s communication does not give politicians sufficient incentive to live up to this responsibility."
"Mr President, adapted to every contingency, according to the circumstances and interests of the moment, the precautionary principle may be either the best of things or the worst of things."
"I also confess to not quite understanding why animal welfare should crop up in this report."
"What must at all costs be avoided is a situation in which the application of this principle curbs innovation and economic activity, creates undue caution and resistance to change on the part of industry and becomes a means of discouraging competition."
"This principle ought only to be applied if there is real risk."
"Only politicians should have recourse to it."
"It is therefore advisable to come up with a precise definition of the precautionary principle so as to prevent the usual wayward interpretations by the Court of Justice, to handle the principle judiciously and skilfully, to determine clearly the factors which bring it into play and, finally, to integrate it into the talks conducted within the WTO."
"In view of the criteria used - proportionality, discrimination, coherence, examination of the advantages and disadvantages, and examination of the scientific assessment - the measures taken in accordance with the precautionary principle must be commensurate with the seriousness of the risk, unlike what happened in the case of the European Union' s measures to deal with mad cow disease."
"Similarly, in line with transparency, let us ensure that producers on a small or industrial scale have the right to express and defend their views by having their opinions and comments included in the assessment reports, in the same way as those of the scientists whose conclusions appear to have been brushed aside."
"Finally, local produce ought not to have its authenticity sacrificed in the interests of safety at any price."
"If uniformly graded products make for greater food safety, diversity leads to uncertain quality and therefore to a degree of risk."
"By invoking this principle willy-nilly, there is a risk of ending up with products which are all produced in the same way and are so hygienic, odourless and tasteless as to be undifferentiated."
"Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation for Parliament's initiative in addressing the topic of the precautionary principle and for the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mrs Patrie."
"This Commission's communication on the precautionary principle was issued in February this year and it proposes guidelines on when and how to use the precautionary principle."
"The principle and approach is often referred to at national, European and global level when questions related to human health and the environment are discussed."
"The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council."
"The resolution calls on the Commission to use the guidelines adopted and to incorporate the precautionary principle whenever necessary in drawing up its legislative proposals and in all its actions."
"The resolution also highlights the need to work actively for a commitment by international partners to reach an understanding on the application of the principle."
"We now examine how this resolution should be followed up."
"The Commission communication is not the final word on the issue."
"I therefore welcome Parliament's motion for a resolution on this important issue and would like to comment on some of the points it raises."
"The Commission confirms its intention to make active use of the precautionary principle whenever appropriate."
"We consider it as a general principle which should be taken into consideration in the fields of environmental protection and human, animal and plant health."
"Regarding its implications at international level, in particular within the World Trade Organisation, the Commission considers that the precautionary principle is becoming a full-fledged rule of customary international law with all the rights attached to it."
"This entitles the Community to prescribe the level of protection notably with regard to the environment and human, animal and plant health which it considers appropriate."
"It will also raise the capacity of developing countries to ensure protection of the environment and human, animal and plant health."
"Parliament must have noted that the Commission is in line with most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution."
"However, I would like to clarify some points."
"Concerning the eventual withdrawal of a product on the basis of process or production methods, it is not possible to make any general statement on the legitimacy of such an action prior to a comprehensive risk assessment."
"The distinction made in the resolution between the precautionary principle and prudence would need to be more precise."
"The prudential approach is part of risk assessment policy and is an integral part of the scientific opinion delivered by the risk evaluators."
"On the other hand, application of the precautionary principle is part of risk management."
"One consequence of this is that initial suspicions or empirical judgments cannot be used alone as regards the application of the precautionary principle."
"The hazard has to be identified and risk assessment has to be carried out by experts before measures are taken."
"It is important to stress that it is for the decision-makers to define the level of protection."
"It is not possible to provide a general de minimis threshold."
"The Commission considers that the motion for a resolution is balanced on this issue and does not support Amendment No 3."
"Finally, the burden of proof may be reversed on a case-by-case evaluation."
"A general rule is not appropriate."
"To conclude, I would like to thank Parliament for its support in addressing this issue."
"The motion for resolution will help foster a general understanding of the precautionary principle both within the Community and internationally."
"Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)"
"Sakharov prize for 2000"
"May I say to you, Mr Fernando Savater, that it is with deep feeling that we welcome you today to confer upon 'Basta Ya' the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought for the year 2000."
"Through yourself, the European Parliament pays tribute to the victims of terrorism and rewards a citizens' movement which has spontaneously decided to cry 'Basta Ya' , or 'Enough is enough' , to those who deny the right to life, that most precious of commodities for every human being, and who also deny the right to freedom, that is to say the freedom to live in daily peace and security."
"The European Parliament also rewards the physical and moral courage of citizens who dare, at the risk of their lives, to state their refusal to give in to intimidation."
"Through 'Basta Ya' , the European Parliament intends to give its unqualified and most determined support to all the associations and collectives of all ideological tendencies which are committed to peace and to all those who take action, faced with the senseless violence with which the Spanish Basque country is confronted."
"As you know, our Assembly' s support goes back a long way."
"Only recently, the European Parliament adopted a declaration on terrorism in Spain."
"This declaration was signed personally by 413 MEPs of all nationalities and all political affiliations."
"It firmly condemns ETA' s crimes in Spain and invites the institutions of the European Union to adopt effective weapons to combat terrorism."
"In awarding the Sakharov prize for the first time to those who are actively defending human rights within the European Union, the European Parliament is stating formally that any violation of these rights must be fought uncompromisingly."
"For democrats throughout the world, Andrei Sakharov had symbolic status as the man who stood up against dictatorship and resisted the moral blackmail of an oppressive system. All Sakharov Prize recipients since 1988 have embodied this same struggle for freedom."
"The oppression you yourselves are resisting is perhaps of the worst kind."
"It is acknowledged, but has no face."
"It is imposed upon a whole society in an attempt to destroy a political system which has been democratically chosen by that country' s citizens."
"That is also why Parliament sides with your struggle."
"As I had occasion to say on 27 September 2000 in Madrid, at the poignant ceremony at which medals were conferred upon the families of ETA victims, there is no place for terrorism within the European Union."
"It is the very negation of democracy."
"Violence in any form whatsoever is not only to be condemned, but can only rebound upon its perpetrators, since it excludes those who have recourse to it from the democratic world."
"Our European Community is above all a community of values based on respect for the rule of law."
"The European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we proclaimed in Nice as recently as 7 December 2000, bears witness to this."
"Article 2 of the Charter enshrines the right to life, and each time someone is killed by terrorism in Spain, the whole of the European Union senses the relevance of what is one of its most crucial principles."
"The democracy in which we believe is about using language to debate and convince. It involves respect for the other person and submits to the will of the majority of the people in a free vote."
"It does not find expression in the anonymous assassin waiting for his victim in the dark vestibule of his apartment block or in the use of violent terrorism to force a whole people, through fear and blackmail, into silence or passive complicity."
"I could not end without paying tribute to the memory of the hundreds of people who have fallen under the bullets of their murderers."
"These are women and men of all ages, of all social conditions and of all political viewpoints who have been cruelly wrested from those close to them."
"I wish to assure these people, and the approximately 2000 people wounded by this same scourge, of our solidarity."
"I also want to tell them how their dignity in adversity and lack of personal vengefulness merit our deepest admiration."
"I would thank you and, Mr Savater, I would now invite you to take the floor."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the 'Basta Ya' citizens' initiative wishes to express its gratitude to this Parliament for the honourable recognition it is receiving today."
"This distinction is all the more notable given that we are not a prestigious NGO nor a veteran institutional movement, but simply a group of citizens of varying backgrounds, with no bureaucratic hierarchy nor even an organisational apparatus, who began working together a little less than a year ago."
"Our organisation includes teachers and workers, public employees and private individuals, religious and lay people, trade unionists, businesspeople, militant pacifists, artists, people working in the media, very well-known individuals and many who are completely unknown."
"I must admit that we are a bit of an anarchic group."
"We have no desire to make history, nor do we wish to endure at any cost."
"If only our initiative were to cease to be necessary tomorrow and we could all return to our peaceful daily lives."
"We know that we are not important individually, but we believe that what unites and motivates us is important: the rejection of ETA' s criminal terrorism and explicit support for the Spanish rule of law, which today is being threatened by a totalitarian project for violent secession."
"We have taken to the streets and we have raised our voices because we are convinced that, when democracy is in danger, the citizens cannot hide behind their anonymity and wait passively for everything to be resolved within the higher echelons of political power."
"We do not wish to replace the legitimately established institutions, but we wish to persuade them to protect our rights and freedoms without making concessions to terrorists."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have come together out of solidarity with the victims of this murderous ideological fanaticism and also, in self-defence, against that same fanaticism."
"Our tragic situation is unusual in this democratic Europe."
"The Basque Country is not an exotic region strangled by injustice and inequality like so many places in the so-called third world, but is one of the most highly-developed regions in the European Union, and its quality of life is one of the most balanced."
"Within the Spanish State, the Basque region enjoys very broad autonomy, with its own government and parliament, full control of its taxation, bilingual educational competences, two of its own television channels, one in the Basque language, etc."
"There is no question that the Basques suffered considerable violations of their political and cultural liberty during the Franco dictatorship, as did all the other citizens of Spain."
"However, when democracy was established, an extraordinary effort was made to reconcile the whole country, beginning with a general amnesty for political crimes committed during the Franco period, which allowed, more than 20 years ago, any member of ETA who wished it to be legally reintegrated, even if they were responsible for violent crimes."
"Nevertheless, ETA' s activity has not ceased since then."
"There have now been more than 700 people killed during the democratic era."
"Today, in the Basque Country, there is no security or freedom of expression or political association for the majority of citizens."
"Non-nationalist elected officials are murdered, as well as businesspeople, journalists, members of the security forces or private individuals who have expressed themselves in any way against the project to impose independence."
"We are not only talking about murders."
"Numerous establishments, homes and vehicles have been set on fire."
"There is daily extortion of traders and professional people, there are countless forms of harassment and threats against people considered to be 'espa√±olistas' , that is to say, those who dare to publicly express their support for the rule of law that has come into force by constitutional means."
"Many people feel compelled to leave in order to avoid worse trouble or because they cannot bear the pressure of living in an atmosphere of intimidation."
"Many others have to resign themselves to leading their lives accompanied by police escorts and cannot walk around freely with their children or go to public places without taking every type of precaution."
"In the Basque Country, in the middle of a democratic Europe, we currently have dozens of Salman Rushdies. Fear reigns."
"It is a palpable fear which invades people' s daily lives and makes them speak in whispers or hide what they really think, just as people did during the worst periods of the Franco dictatorship."
"We, the members of the 'Basta Ya' initiative, know that ETA is, without doubt, the main culprit behind these evils."
"However, we are also convinced that ETA is not an isolated phenomenon, and that it is perpetuated as a result of a political climate which is partly the fault of the nationalist authorities who have governed the country for more than 20 years."
"The members of ETA are not aliens who arrived from another planet to do evil deeds, but they are young people brought up with ethnic fanaticism, with a hatred of more than half of their fellow citizens and of everything that is considered Spanish; young people who have been imbued with a distorted view of history and crazy anthropological ideas, which makes them feel like victims and thus turns them into executioners."
"Naturally, we accept that Basque nationalists can propose, by peaceful means, the creation of a new independent state that has never before existed, but we reject the idea that this political project from a particular party should be presented as the inalienable right of a whole people, and therefore become an indirect justification for violence."
"Nor does it seem prudent to be permanently searching the historic past - or even the prehistoric past - for wrongs which justify the break-up of current democratic communities, or which are intended to demonstrate the incompatibility of people who have in fact lived together for centuries."
"As experience in other parts of Europe sadly shows, this is always eventually a way to justify violent conflict."
"This is something that one of the first thinkers of a united Europe, Erasmus of Rotterdam, warned against centuries ago, when he said in one of his adages: ""If any title is considered a suitable reason to start a war, then anybody - amid so many vicissitudes in human affairs, so many changes - can hold such a title."
"What people has never been expelled or has never expelled anybody from its territory?"
"How often have people emigrated from one place to another?"
"How often have people been moved around as the chance result of treaties?"
"Let the Paduans now reclaim Trojan soil, since Antenor was once Trojan!"
"Let the Romans reclaim Africa and Spain since they were once Roman!"
"We call inherited property what in fact is an elective administration."
"We do not have the same rights over men - who are free by nature - as we do over cattle."""
"That is what Erasmus said."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as democrats, we are, of course, in favour of dialogue between different democratic parties, because democracy itself is embodied in that ongoing dialogue."
"But precisely because of our commitment to democratic dialogue, we reject the idea that dialogue can be forced through terrorist violence, that the political agenda of the citizens can be established by people who distort the uses of peaceful coexistence and that the laws which have been agreed in parliaments should be changed according to the wishes of murderers as a means of paying them to stop their murder."
"We want to live in peace, but we also want to live in freedom."
"We refuse to replace a state of the citizens with a state of ethnic groups."
"That is why we have taken to the streets: to defend constitutional principles and shout at the terrorists: ""¬°Basta ya!"""
"And, as well as thanking you for the recognition that this Sakharov Prize confers, we also invite the Members of the European Parliament to visit the Basque Country - not the official offices, but the streets, the bars, the shops, the companies, the small towns, the classrooms - so that you can see first-hand and without interference from propaganda how people live under threat and extortion, without the freedom to express their ideas; so that you may see for yourselves the truth of what we are condemning and then that you may not forget it and that you may help us to combat this scourge which the whole of this democratic Europe should feel to be its own."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"VOTE"
"Madam President, I do not wish to hold up the ceremony."
"With all this gratitude having been expressed, I should just like to thank the members of the Sittings Service, who have worked hard to ensure that the votes were taken quickly and efficiently."
"We shall now proceed to the signing of the budget."
"I should like to point out that this document is being signed, for the second time, by three women."
"(Having invited Mrs Parly, President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Schreyer, member of the Commission, Mr Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the rapporteurs, Mrs Haug, Mr Ferber and Mr Colom i Naval to join her, the President signed the budget.)"
"Madam President, I wonder whether I could crave the indulgence of the House."
"I have spoken to Mr Sterckx about Amendment No 60 and the block that relates to it, which is Nos 52, 62, 57, 38 and 60."
"With the agreement of the rapporteur we would like to move my Amendment No 60 to be taken between Nos 52 and 62 if it comes to that."
"Mr Sterckx and the rapporteur are agreeable to that."
"Madam President, I completely agree with what Mr Atkins is saying, but I have noticed to my amazement that, although I, along with 31 other members, tabled Amendment No 62, and although I phoned up the services three times to say that that was my amendment, it is still listed under Mr Robert Atkins."
"I find this very odd, for I think this does have a bearing on the discussion in some way or other."
"I do not think that that is right."
"It is clearly an amendment tabled by myself, along with 31 members, and I therefore want it to carry my name."
"If I phone up on several occasions regarding this matter, then surely it should be possible to have this rectified."
"No disrespect, but this is not how things should be done, in my opinion."
"We shall restore your name as author of this amendment."

"before the vote on Amendment No 51"
"Madam President, if the House permits, I should like to give an oral explanation of my Amendment No 51."
"Some linguistic confusion has arisen, and what I sought to achieve is not reflected at all in this wording."
"Instead of what is suggested by the words ""of producers and artists, especially from the non profit-making sector"", my primary intention was that we should include in this circle representatives of content providers."
"Yesterday, before and after the debate, I discussed the matter with some individual Members of the House."
"Several Members consider that these representatives of the content providers are subsumed under other categories of representatives."
"This shows that the wording is not clear and unequivocal."
"The programme is called eContent."
"We should therefore include content providers in it."
"This ought not to pose a great problem, in my view."
"I should appreciate your support for this amendment."
"(Parliament gave its assent to the oral amendment being tabled) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Joint proposal for a resolution on the results of the European Council meeting of 7-10 December 2000 in Nice"
"Madam President, if I may crave your indulgence, I only wished to comment that the draft Treaty of Nice regrettably still makes reference to the ecu rather than the euro."
"I believe this is something of an anachronism!"
"It is indeed most annoying!"
"Madam President, I wonder whether we can sanction a resolution regarding the Nice Summit at all?"
"I fear that we may have a situation on our hands which is not dissimilar from the American re-count."
"Having read what was in the papers this morning in my country, I have to say that not only was the French Presidency mistaken about Poland' s and Spain' s vote weighting, for which the President has, in fact, offered his apologies, but problems have emerged which are both numerous and embarrassing."
"I quote: annex 3 of the draft treaty stipulates that the majority threshold, which rises as and when new Member States accede, should constitute 73.4% of the votes once all Member States have joined."
"That translates, therefore, into 253 votes in the Council of Ministers."
"However, that also means that the blocking minority - and that is, after all, what this is all about, that is what the Nice Agreement was about - amounts to 93."
"But only one sentence down from this, the number of votes are 91!"
"You do realise that it is difficult for us to discuss a treaty if it contains mistakes such as these."
"You are anticipating the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0334/2000) by Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on the taxation of aircraft fuel (COM(2000) 110 - C5-0207/2000 - 2000/2114(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0352/2000) by Mrs Patrie, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication on the precautionary principle (COM(2000) 1 - C5¬≠0143/2000 - 2000/2086(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Before we proceed to the explanations of votes, I would like to wish all those Members I will not be seeing afterwards a very merry Christmas."
"My vote against the agreement which will allow more lorries on the Swiss roads as from 1 January is unrelated to the number of permits which Dutch hauliers managed to secure in the process."
"Although it is likely that they will consider the number 23 428 far too low, they will nevertheless be pleased with the room for growth provided to them."
"This agreement forms part of an initiative by means of which Switzerland and Norway will increasingly take on the guise of EU Member States."
"The only difference is that they do not pay a contribution and do not have a right to vote."
"As a result, their governments can continue to reassure a critical population of their on-going independence, although that is less and less the case."
"However, far more important is the fact that this agreement will generate a great deal of extra freight traffic on the roads."
"After Austria, the Alps barrier is now also disappearing in Switzerland."
"That country had previously opted for discouraging road traffic and improving rail connections for freight transit traffic."
"Allowing an increasing number of larger lorries on the roads will force Switzerland to invest more in motorways."
"I am not at all convinced by the fact that large Swiss environmental organisations have been sweet-talked into this with the argument that the revenue from levies will benefit the expansion of rail."
"This agreement is attractive to a number of companies but detrimental to the environment and democracy."
"General Budget for 2001"
"At the second reading of the budget, Parliament has just approved the full reinstatement to the Cohesion Fund budget line of EUR 360 million, which it had placed in reserve on the first reading."
"For the Portuguese Socialists, the Cohesion Fund is a mainstay of the economic and social cohesion policy, which was launched by the Single European Act and substantially strengthened by the Maastricht Treaty."
"Since it was set up, the Cohesion Fund has had a considerable impact on two areas of great Community interest - the environment and trans-European transport networks; it has been effectively implemented in the Community budget and has had one of the highest implementation rates in the entire Community budget."
"As our comrade, M√°rio Soares, stated at the investiture of the current Prodi Commission, the most negative point in its programme was the abolition of the Service Directorate for this Fund and its removal from the name and directory of the former Directorate-General XVI."
"This abolition, which began to take place in the middle of last year, as we had anticipated, resulted in a dramatic fall in the speed with which projects were approved and payments made, to the point where the annual implementation of authorisations of this fund at the end of June 2000 was less than one per cent."
"In its proposal to Parliament to cut EUR 360 million from the 2001 payments, the Commission was showing worrying signs of a lack of interest, motivation and will to fully implement the financial package agreed upon by the Berlin European Council."
"After this proposal, the Portuguese Socialists decided to vote against the budget at its first reading if it did cut EUR 360 million from the draft budget, agreeing to vote for the budget only when this position was changed to place this money in reserve."
"In the face of the joint efforts by the representatives of several governments in the Council, particularly the Portuguese Government, and members of various Parliamentary groups, in which it is fair to highlight the Portuguese Socialist members, the trialogue held between the Commission, the Council and Parliament decided to reinstate the whole of the funding laid down in the first Council reading for the Cohesion Fund payments, and Parliament has just ratified this position."
"We are delighted with this decision and now commit ourselves to remaining vigilant over the implementation of the Cohesion Fund."
"In order to make up for the delayed start in the implementation of the Cohesion Fund in this programme period, the beneficiary Member States will have to redouble their efforts and their care and, most of all, the Commission will have to give it top priority, especially by increasing the human and financial resources allocated to monitoring the fund."
"The debate at second reading on the 2001 budget gives rise to the same feelings we had last October and therefore leads us again to voting against the budget."
"As we pointed out at first reading, aid to the Balkans by no means justifies a revision of the financial perspective, and nor does it mean, spuriously, that the fisheries agreements with Morocco should be challenged, by entering EUR 130 million into a reserve."
"We are delighted that this has now been acknowledged."
"The most significant event to have occurred since our previous budgetary debates is, of course, the ""mad cow"" crisis."
"Whilst France must now take satisfaction in the fact that the European Union has finally adopted France' s position in the field of prevention, we remain concerned about the appropriations that these new political choices will require."
"The gravity of the situation has led our group to table a number of amendments highlighting the importance of earmarking the necessary funds for standardising screening tests and for compensation for them, as well as for massive aid to the cattle industry, which has been severely affected."
"The EUR 60 million for the former and the EUR 360 million earmarked for the latter will not be enough for 2001."
"We are asking for a considerable supplementary and amending budget in January to demonstrate the interest that Parliament intends to give to this dossier."
"I voted against the resolution because of the adoption here of paragraph 23, which instructs the Secretary-General of Parliament to continue negotiations with the Government of Luxembourg with a view to allowing the transfer from Luxembourg to Brussels of all officials who are needed in Brussels for more efficient and cost-effective management of Parliament's Secretariat and for an improved service to Members."
"This paragraph is a perfect carte blanche for the effective closure of the Secretariat-General of the European Parliament in Luxembourg."
"In Edinburgh in 1992, the Heads of State and Government decided that the European Parliament had three official seats: Strasbourg for 12 plenary part-sessions a year, Brussels for committee and group meetings and short plenary part-sessions and Luxembourg as the seat of the Secretariat-General."
"At the Edinburgh Summit, the Heads of State and Government were undoubtedly aware that three official seats generate travelling and subsistence costs, so it is not up to the Members of the European Parliament to raise the issue of our official seat in order to press for cuts in administrative expenditure."
"We can certainly call for reduced spending in general, because each of us could list examples of savings that could be made, and these would far exceed the travel expenses of the officials who have to travel from Luxembourg to Brussels or Strasbourg."
"I should also emphasise that it costs far more to travel to Strasbourg from Brussels."
"Many people will be blissfully unaware of the fact that this is actually an indirect attack on Strasbourg too."
"Back in July, Parliament decided by a narrow majority that, during the 12 plenary weeks when we would have to meet in Strasbourg in the course of 2001, the House would only sit from Monday afternoon until Thursday, the Friday sittings being discontinued, a decision which was, in itself, a first tilt at Strasbourg."
"Perhaps the French have even resigned themselves to this, if we are to believe the report in a German newspaper on 13 December, according to which President Chirac, in a piece of out-and-out horse-trading, is supposed to have promised the recalcitrant Belgian Prime Minister (who is now being hailed as the hero of Nice) that in future all summit meetings, as well as an additional week of plenary sittings of the European Parliament, would be held in Brussels."
"This was allegedly the price for the 'hero of Nice' agreeing to accept fewer votes in the Council than the more populous Netherlands under the system of qualified majority voting."
"The adoption of this paragraph will undoubtedly coincide with the re-emergence of the paper produced by a Vice-President of this Parliament who wants to shift all the services and the Directorate-General from Luxembourg to Brussels."
"According to his plan, Luxembourg will continue to house no more than a handful of technical services such as the print shop and the translation service."
"This would clearly violate the letter and spirit of the aforementioned decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government regarding the seat of Parliament."
"The advocates of this relocation of the Secretariat-General from Luxembourg to Brussels are naturally unconcerned about the social and human implications of such a move for the officials and their families, many of whom have lived in Luxembourg for decades and have bought houses there; our officials have children at school there and spouses who work there."
"Here in Parliament we take every suitable opportunity, as well as some unsuitable opportunities, to adopt resolutions about the reunification of families. Yet we want to tear the families of our own officials apart, especially those in the D, C and B grades, who cannot afford expensive removals and all the other financial burdens such moves entail, on the basis of the spurious argument that we have to cut costs in this particular way."
"We cannot and must not allow this to happen."
"This also means, of course, that the Government of Luxembourg is once more being called upon not only to be vigilant but also to guarantee compliance with contractual agreements."
"Mr President, I voted for the budget but this is the last time I shall do so, for I consider Parliament's financial concern for pensioners and the elderly to be totally inadequate."
"Before I left for Strasbourg, the pensioners and elderly people of Bergamo said to me: 'Christmas is coming and we in Bergamo celebrate both Christmas and the feast day of St Lucy."
"Will Mr Ferber prove to be a Father Christmas?"
"Will Mrs Haug be a St Lucy for pensioners and elderly people?'"
"Sadly, the answer is no, for despite the fact that pensioners make up 30% of the population of the European Union, our budget does not set aside commensurate financial support to solve their problems."
"I wholeheartedly support this report by Mr Staes on the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition."
"It allows the Commission to take safeguard measures in emergency situations without consulting Member States, and thus significantly increases the speed and efficiency with which cases can be dealt."
"The change from requiring ""all necessary assistance"" to ""full assistance"" from Member States, and the fact that the European Parliament has to be kept informed as to results, also indicate that this report is of genuine significance for all Member States."
"We, the Swedish and Danish Social Democrats, have today voted in favour of the EU budget for 2001."
"The budget will allow the EU to implement its priority activities whilst, at the same time, maintaining budgetary discipline."
"The EU' s budget for next year is one of the smallest relative to the size of the Member States' GDP."
"The budget for 2001 is largely based on a compromise between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which we support."
"Parliament has succeeded in driving through a number of important prioritisations - including increased efforts in the struggle against unemployment and poverty, a number of important environmental and equality issues, etc."
"We have voted against the right' s attacks on the LIFE programme and the European Women' s Lobby."
"We have thus found the funds required in order to be able to provide strong support to the reconstruction and democratisation of the Balkans, including now in Serbia."
"However, the need for a long-term solution for future budget years remains."
"We are critical of the scope and orientation of the EU' s agriculture policy."
"This needs to undergo more extensive reform in the future, partly so as to provide room for the enlargement of the EU."
"The EU' s agriculture policy is far too expensive."
"Moreover, we are highly critical of the over-production of agricultural produce and of the use of information funds by the EU to sell this surplus."
"We are also very critical of the extensive support given to tobacco production which, in our opinion, directly conflicts with the EU' s heightened ambitions in the area of public health."
"We would also like to emphasise how important it is that the implementation of the EU' s budget is made more efficient, so that we can get a grip on the problem of the substantial backlog that exists in certain areas."
"The budgetary system, along with the methods for openness, auditing and political control, need to be improved and modernised quickly."
"We Scandinavian Social Democrats have also succeeded in driving through a proposal for increased support to local and regional cooperation in the Baltic region, which now amounts to EUR 16 million."
"Parliament has also increased the budget for twin town cooperation, which we consider to be an important programme for promoting local cooperation within the Union."
"I think it would be useful first of all to point out that the minimal increase to the 2001 budget as adopted by the Council compared to the current year' s budget is a vital political message aimed at our fellow citizens."
"If budgetary moderation is to be accepted, it must apply across the board."
"The conciliation meeting of 23 November enshrined the use of all the sums available under the flexibility instrument, totalling EUR 200 million, for Serbia, and this is to be welcomed, even if we must deplore the fact that Parliament has had to reverse the decision it took at first reading, which favoured MEDA."
"In addition to the EUR 200 million of emergency aid deducted from the 2000 budget so that the Serbs are able to get through the winter in as tolerable conditions as possible, following the trialogue held in October, EUR 240 million will be provided in 2001 under aid for the Balkans, whilst the ""Prodi"" proposals ought to enable us to dedicate some EUR 2.2 billion to getting this region, particularly the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, back on its feet over a period of years."
"The European Union is thereby now conceding, admittedly rather late in the day, the importance of substantial aid to the Republic of Yugoslavia, which is at a low ebb, and of doing so whilst respecting its borders."
"The size of the allocation that has been earmarked for Kosovo does not mean that there are not legitimate questions as to the real capacity of this region of Yugoslavia to absorb the EUR 350 million that were initially earmarked to be given to it in 2001."
"A precise and thorough assessment must therefore be carried out of all reconstruction needs in the various regions of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. We must also recognise Belgrade as our only legitimate partner in dialogue, for all future actions; otherwise, the European Union will run the risk of appearing to support and encourage the separatist and terrorist movements in the region."

"Staes report (A5-0372/2000)"
"Lannoye report (A5-0347/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for this report on food additives and, in particular, for the ban on using sodium alginate to preserve carrots."
"We are deceiving the consumer three times: once because carrots picked one, two, three or four years earlier appear to be fresh, next because the carrots appear to the consumer to be as hard as if they had just been picked rather than flabby like old carrots, and then again because, as we are all aware, Mr President, carrots have a binding effect on the bowel and, when sodium alginate is added, they become laxatives."
"Mr President, I voted for the Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil report on the taxation of electronic commerce."
"I must tell you that, last night, I dreamt I was a pensioner."
"I do not actually receive a pension although I am the representative of the Pensioners' Party in Italy."
"Well then, I dreamt that I was a very old pensioner who needed some medicine."
"Instead of having to go to the doctor to get a prescription and then to the chemists' and then having to pay for the medicine to be delivered to my home, as I usually do, I watched the doctor press a key on his computer and, when I got home, I found the medicine already there waiting for me."
"The chemists' had received an e-mail from the doctor containing instructions and had sent an assistant to deliver it."
"I therefore ask you, Mr President, when we will vote on a directive facilitating this type of electronic commerce."
"I hope it will be soon."
"We voted against the Torres Marques report on harmonising VAT in Europe and, incidentally, against the Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil report, which deals with the taxation of electronically supplied services."
"We are against VAT in all its forms, because it is an indirect tax that hits the working classes the hardest."
"Besides, this proposal seeks to define a rate band, in other words, to abolish the lower VAT rates for mass consumption products, such as bread, cooking oil and dairy products, or even for essential medicines."
"This is harmonisation for the sake of it and we are in favour of abolishing VAT at European level and in favour of a highly progressive tax on company profits and on capital income."
"We have voted against Amendment No 13, which was submitted by Olle Schmidt."
"The conclusion he draws from the fact that the USA has exempted e-commerce from VAT for five years is that the EU should do likewise."
"This is a conspicuously weak conclusion."
"There is no reason to give tax advantages to a particular form of distribution."
"Moreover, such adaptation to conditions in the USA would undoubtedly make it more difficult for us to achieve a normal level of tax in both the USA and Europe five years down the line."
"Moreover, we must break the tendency to import American incongruities into Europe in this area as in other areas."
"Ferber report (A5-0361/2000)"
"I suggest that he also sends a copy to Malta, since the only time he has failed to give an explanation of vote was, I believe, when we were discussing Malta."
"I do not think that Valetta has ever quite recovered from this blow."
"Mr President, I will do my best to remedy this before 2004 with a few explanations of votes in favour of Malta."
"I voted for the Ferber report, although I have to say that I would prefer there to be greater liberalisation of the postal service."
"People often say to me: 'Mr Fatuzzo, pensioners and elderly people want their mail delivered to them every day, even if they live in far-away or mountainous places, and you should therefore be wholly in favour of a universal service.'"
"However, I have to say that some elderly pensioners who live in mountain villages have told me that they would rather receive mail once a week and have a higher pension rather than receive mail every day and have a lower pension."
"I am therefore in favour of greater liberalisation."
"We voted against the Ferber report."
"We are against any kind of seizure by private capital of a public service as essential as the post office, whether the weight/price threshold, beyond which we open up the door to such capital is 350 grams, 150 grams or, even worse, 50 grams."
"Whether privatisation is gradual or sudden, it will inevitably mean the destruction of the public service and will have serious consequences for postal workers."
"We do not feel that we should in any way endorse an operation that will only serve the interests of a few capitalist groups that are looking for an area of investment to generate private profit at the expense of the whole population, and more particularly, at the expense of those classes with the lowest incomes."
"The Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament consider that the postal market within the EU should be opened up to competition."
"By gradually deregulating the European market postal services can be made more efficient and the level of service to the customer raised."
"An end date would send a clear message to the players in the postal market and provide better opportunity for the national monopolies to prepare for deregulation."
"For this reason we have voted for an end date for liberalisation."
"We also consider it unjustifiable that countries in the EU compete in Sweden' s postal market, for example, when they are not prepared to allow competition in their own markets."
"We have therefore abstained in the vote on the Ferber report."
"Today I voted in favour of the Ferber report on ""European postal services"" because, given the current balance of power in Europe and within the European Parliament, we obtained as much as we could to prevent the total disappearance of public postal services in Europe!"
"This took intense negotiations and the greatest possible rallying together at all levels, but as of today, the main part has been saved!"
"Nevertheless, I must say quite seriously that this is as much as I can accept from a Europe which I feel to be too liberal!"
"A framework directive on postal services in Europe must therefore be drawn up as quickly as possible, since the Nice Summit gave the ""green light"" to this project."
"Claude Desama is determined to see his proposal through to the bitter end."
"On this matter, too, we have reached a point at which all supporters of public service should find themselves."
"Through the Ferber report, we have shown that this is possible."
"Now we must actually do it."
"I am very pleased with this first reading and with the work that has been achieved by our Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, with the commitment of our rapporteur and, above all, with the skill and constancy demonstrated on so many occasions by Brian Simpson, our shadow rapporteur in the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The liberalisation of postal services is one of the fundamental dossiers connected with the concept of services of general interest and, more generally, with preserving the European Union' s social and territorial cohesion."
"In addition to the technical but necessary vision of what we wish to preserve in the field of universal service and of what we would like to open up to competition, there is the implementation of the ""European social model"" ."
"How far must liberalisation be taken?"
"Why should we try to speed up the process, which is what the executive Commission and Commissioner Bolkestein wanted?"
"Why should we try to dismantle services which are useful and appreciated by our citizens, by denying them adequate financial resources and by making them dependent on an obsolete and punishing system of subsidies?"
"We cannot, of course, undermine the principle of the adaptability of public services, which is what the Commission suggested, since this lies at the very heart of the history of most of our countries and which we consider to be very important."
"I do not think that this is at all reasonable and, fortunately, we were to put things right during the vote in the parliamentary committee."
"This is why I voted for this report as adopted in committee."
"How will the postal sector emerge from this period in which contradictions and controversies have been used to prop up the arguments, which are nevertheless often technical, that have been put together in the context of opening it up to competition?"
"Can we erase, with a simple decision, with a potentially small majority, the entire concept of the postal service, a concept whose roots and forms are bound up with the specific nature of each Member State?"
"How can we not take into account the national differences covered by this quite unique sector, particularly from the point of view of adapting public service to the reality of local situations?"
"How can we talk about public service in countries where this concept is barely acknowledged, if at all, whereas in others, it is grounded in the culture and represents a defining element of social cohesion, particularly in rural areas?"
"We are not asking Sweden to change its system, but we certainly do not want it to impose its system on us."
"Admittedly, Mr Ferber' s text, after much haggling at committee stage, does little more than moderate and delay the Commission' s proposal."
"This proposal is unacceptable because it is based on assertions that have little or no justification."
"But how can we not see this compromise report as a compromise on the postal service itself?"
"It is easy for the supporters of qualified liberalism to be satisfied with a text that waters down Commissioner Bolkestein' s ultraliberal proposal, which is founded entirely on ideological reasoning."
"(The explanation of vote was cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I am truly sorry that Parliament voted to support a policy that is very harmful as far as consumers are concerned."
"In the report now adopted, just a fraction of postal services would be liberalised and no final date has been set for that liberalisation."
"We Members who were in the minority would have liked the final date of 2007 to have been agreed upon. By that time, more than 17 years will have elapsed since this matter was first discussed at EU level."
"A fixed date would act as an incentive for the post office to develop and modernise its services and would make planning and market investment easier."
"Now that Parliament has failed to set a date the imbalance that exists between national post offices will continue, as some markets will be open and some will not."
"As with other markets, traditional, national frontiers in the postal sector have now lost their meaning."
"It is impossible to struggle against this inescapable development and, for that reason, we should start to prepare for it as soon as we can."
"We voted against this report because we refuse to accept further liberalisation of postal services in Europe."
"The sudden and therapeutic introduction of private capital does nothing but protect the interests of a few monopolies that are being established."
"We cannot sanction job losses and further office closures, even if this is carried out in ""a gradual and controlled way"" ."
"This is why we also voted against the amendments proposing to lower the price/weight threshold to 150 or to 50 grams."
"We do not wish to be part of this new sell-off and we will continue to advocate the idea of a new European public service."
"For many years in this Parliament I have supported the principle of gradual controlled liberalisation of postal services with a view to creating an effective single market in the postal domain."
"This support, however, has been conditional on the preservation of a high quality universal service."
"This is indispensable, especially for rural, remote and sparsely populated areas and even for certain parts of towns and cities too."
"In such places, postmen perform what I might even describe as a socio-cultural function, a function that I sincerely hope we can afford to maintain in our affluent society."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I tabled a number of amendments to the Commission proposal. All the amendments relating to the recitals were adopted, but then, all of a sudden, along came a number of my honourable colleagues, some of whom were not members of the committee, and agreed to coordinate their votes, which resulted in the rejection of the amendments to the articles corresponding to the amended recitals."
"This naturally produced an utter shambles, which prompted a majority of the committee members, quite rightly, to reject this half-baked document. For that reason, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was unable to formulate an opinion."
"I am therefore particularly grateful to the rapporteur of the lead committee, Mr Markus Ferber, for having produced an acceptable compromise which largely takes account of the letter and spirit of my amendments. I can live with this, especially since"
"it does not contain a new definition of special services, and"
"the price and weight limits are set at reasonable levels, with weights of up to 150 grams remaining the sole preserve of the universal service, linked with a price ceiling of four times the public tariff."
"The limits of 50 grams and two and a half times the public tariff are truly too drastic and would have had dire consequences for the providers of universal postal services."
"This would also have been the case if outgoing cross-border mail and express services had been entirely liberalised, which the Luxembourg postal service in particular, because of our country's size and geographical situation, could not have withstood."
"The compromise takes account of my amendment to this effect, which means that I can endorse the report with a clear conscience at this first reading."
"However, I repudiate the insinuations made by those who advocate forced liberalisation with no regard for the loss of people's quality of life and jobs, who seek to present me and the honourable Members who share my view as acting on behalf of the post-office lobby which is intent on preserving its monopoly."
"I emphatically reject such insinuations."
"There are all kinds of companies acting on an international plane who are ready to attack Commissioner Bolkestein' s proposal for being too weak and too moderate and who wish to gain increased and swifter access to the coveted market."
"They will keep the pressure on, and they are strengthening their position with the revenue they are generating from delivering mail above 150 grams."
"The debate on the future organisation of the postal services has not entered the home straight by a long chalk."
"We have known that the extreme liberalisation proposal brought forward by the European Commission had no chance of survival since rapporteur Ferber made a few critical proposals with regard to further research, meticulousness and deadlines."
"The situation became even more clear-cut when Christian Democrats and Social Democrats concluded a secret deal on a compromise solution between liberalisation and non-liberalisation which was to be defended jointly by the two groups."
"The 50 and 350 grams weight scales were divided, 150 grams being the dividing line."
"That translates into 100 popular grams gained by the Right and 200 less popular grams going to the Left."
"If the Social Democrat and Christian Democrat compromise had been the main issue from early on in the debate, it would not have received my support, because the drawbacks of any liberalisation outstrip the benefits."
"Although the present outcome constitutes a defeat for Commissioner Bolkestein, I believe I must remain faithful to that guiding principle and I therefore adhere to my no-vote."
"The Commission' s proposal regarding postal services embodies an unrestrained desire to liberalise, threatening an essential public service along with the companies that provide it and the workers that perform it."
"Hence our unequivocal and steadfast opposition to the majority of its aims."
"We believe, however, that the compromise shown in the report now being debated - even if it does not present a clear challenge to the Commission' s intentions to privatise - includes some signs of a reasonable approach that we do not see in the Commission' s proposal."
"We therefore value it and do not reject it."
"Nevertheless, because it does not challenge the final objective of this regulation, we cannot approve it either."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"I think we must ensure everyone has the most efficient postal service possible; to do otherwise would not be in the best interest of our constituents."
"It is not good enough to call for liberalisation without realising the effects of our decisions."
"Rural areas do require the benefit of postal service."
"It is a most important and necessary requirement to ensure and stabilise the rural economy."
"I feel we have achieved the necessary balance and we can allow the service to develop at an acceptable pace that will give everyone what they need and require."
"The liberalisation of postal services on the terms proposed by the Commission is neither appropriate nor consistent, and I therefore voted in favour of the report and all the amendments moved that expressed this position."
"The rejection of that proposal from the outset reflected a generalised feeling of mistrust and was a sign of strength for countries like Portugal against the liberalising tendencies of the Nordic countries and the Commission itself, which tried, absolutely in vain as we have seen, to impose a position that the majority of Member States did not agree with."
"It was thus made clear that an exclusively competitive approach does not satisfy the interests of their populations."
"The social function of public service must not be forgotten, and that is something I have fought for."
"Today, postal correspondence is still the means by which part of the Portuguese population chooses to keep its family ties alive."
"In addition, it still performs an important economic and social role, both in receiving payments for public services, such as water, electricity, telephone, etc., and in paying out retirement pensions, disability benefits and subsistence allowances."
"It is not possible to make a suitable transition to a totally open market without providing for a continuation of these services."
"Furthermore, if approved, the drastic changes in weight and price limits for mail proposed by the Commission would have extremely detrimental effects on the Portuguese postal service, resulting in significant market losses and quite negative social implications."
"The fact that we have voted on this report in the December session is extremely important."
"This is a codecision process which, as well as highlighting the importance of Parliament' s role, will also strengthen its position at the next meeting of the telecommunications Council still to take place this year, on 22 December."
"Parliament is thus sending the Commission a strong signal regarding its reservations on the total liberalisation of the postal market."
"We do not consider that the postal service is an issue to be dealt with by the EU, even if the proposal following processing by the committee looks considerably better than the Commission' s original proposal."
"We feel that the Member States themselves are much more competent to take care of these matters."
"However, we are happy to see inter-state solutions in this area."
"Neither do we feel that there is any need or necessity to privatise, expose to competition or deregulate postal services."
"In Sweden a number of these proposals have already been implemented and we can already see that this has exacerbated the situation."
"Regional inequalities have arisen and the situation within the postal service has deteriorated - not least for the employees."
"de Roo report (A5-0378/2000)"
"At one point in today's sitting, President Fontaine, who presided over the sitting before you Mr President, in an exemplary fashion as usual, remarked that a mobile phone was ringing. This was just after we had voted on a document on the fight against noise pollution."
"Well then Mr President, I had personally tabled an amendment in committee calling for regulation of the use of mobile phones in enclosed places."
"I am afraid, however, that this Fatuzzo amendment was rejected."
"I did nevertheless vote for the document, but President Fontaine's words reassured me that my request was justified, and so I will make it again in the future next time we discuss the fight against noise pollution, which is something I consider to be entirely appropriate provided that it is carried out with due respect for the requirements of industry."
"Lienemann report (A5-0350/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted against this resolution because, I am afraid to say, it shows how the funds available to the European Union are spent unwisely."
"In my opinion, this should be considered to be a waste of resources: in one sense we are throwing money down the drain, for EUR 12.4 million is to be spent over a period of four years - from 2001 to 2004 - to facilitate the application of Community environment legislation at local level."
"Now then, as the report itself says, at best we would be able to finance a dozen or so projects. This is equivalent to waiting for rain in the desert and then one drop falling every square kilometre."
"It would go no way at all towards quenching the thirst of the parched."
"In my opinion, the Union's financial expenditure should be carried out uniformly wherever possible."
"Here, in practice, it is as if money were being given to the first takers out of a crowd of parched, starving people begging for a crust of bread."
"I do not feel that this is the right way to be spending the European Union's funds."
"Dary report (A5-0374/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the report on the common organisation of the market in bananas because, although trade in bananas must certainly be liberalised, pursuant to the Treaty, we must also concern ourselves with the problems of the States making up the European Union."
"We must have the courage to continue to protect those areas of the European Union - and I refer in particular to the most remote areas such as the Canary Islands and other areas - which earn their livelihood from banana production and which need and have the right to be protected by the Union as a whole, including the States who do not produce bananas."
"Mr President, the British Labour Members welcome the passage of the Dary report on the organisation of the banana market."
"We hope there will now be speedy negotiations to agree arrangements compatible with our WTO commitments and safeguard our traditional suppliers."
"We have, however, reservations on Amendments Nos 6, 7, 11, 15, 16, 25 and 26, as we do not exclude the possibility of a tariff-only system in the future."
"We also have reservations on Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 30 and 31, being not convinced that they are WTO compatible."
"We hope the passage of the report will also lead to early suspension of the trade sanctions imposed by the USA, which operate in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the proposal for a common market arrangement for bananas."
"We do not believe that banana producers should be given more assistance."
"The existing arrangement is inadequate and should be changed so as to conform to the WTO provisions."
"We believe that the incentive for sustainable production of bananas - what are known as fair trade bananas - should be increased."
"For us it is crucial that the assistance given to fair trade bananas be maintained and that the incentive for cultivating bananas in a sustainable manner be strengthened further."
"Fair trade is not just about trade; it is also about the prohibition of enforced labour, prohibition of child labour and equal pay for men and women."
"We naturally support these elements, since they are cornerstones of Social Democrat policy."
"We abstained on this vote, which is the umpteenth skirmish in the banana war which pits, on the one side, dollar-supported bananas dominated by three huge American capitalist groups and, on the other, bananas, which have until now been protected, from regions dominated by British or French capitalist companies or by a handful of powerful Creole families."
"We do not wish to favour either the big sharks of the banana industry or the smaller sharks from the area under Europe' s protection."
"We nevertheless feel that the small producers who work their own plantations without exploiting anyone need to be protected from the consequences of this war, as do their incomes, whatever fluctuations may occur in the market."
"It is our view that those in greatest need of protection from the consequences of the trade war on which the capitalist groups have embarked are the banana industry workers, who are exploited when business is good but who are sacked when the big producers decide to invest in other, more profitable sectors when bananas do not bring in enough profit."
"Exactly eight months ago, this House sent a very clear message to the Commission: the adoption of a wholly tariff-based system after a transitional period of six years would inevitably condemn banana producers within the Community and those from the ACP to bankruptcy and misery."
"Unfortunately, the Commission' s declared obsession with finding a system that is both viable and compatible with the all-powerful WTO has won the day over any other consideration."
"Let me make this quite clear: I am aware of the importance of this body, but what I, like others, refuse to accept is globalisation!"
"This is a form of globalisation for the richest few and for them alone."
"This is a form of globalisation that scorns the most basic human rights."
"In short, this is a form of globalisation unfettered by any democratic regulation."
"With regard to the banana dossier, I must once again mention the unhappiness of our small producers in Guadeloupe, Martinique and the Canaries, who feel swindled, abandoned and sacrificed at the altar of a macroeconomic rationale that they do not understand."
"The Commission' s proposal is unacceptable in its current state, as it constitutes an unconditional capitulation to the dictates of the U.S!"
"This capitulation is unworthy of this European project of ours and of the social and environmental model that we claim we want to construct."
"That is why I voted in favour of the report by Mr Dary, who, by opposing this capitulation, does an honour to our Parliament."
"Torres Marques report (A5-0366/2000)"
"For reasons of principle as well as for practical reasons, I felt bound to vote against the amendments to the text proposed by the Commission."
"The smooth functioning of economic and monetary union does not necessarily require the harmonisation of VAT rates."
"In the United States, a perfect example of economic and monetary union, there are considerable differences in taxation between the various states."
"In practice, Amendments Nos 2 and 3 will have the effect of harmonising VAT rates upwards."
"We have only talked about the length of time during which the minimum standard rate is to be applied."
"The maximum rate has not even been mentioned."
"In the interest of price stability and in the interest of protecting the consumer' s buying power, we must take a step in the other direction: in other words, a minimum rate of 15% should be maintained for an indefinite period of time, matched by a voluntary and gradual reduction of the higher rates."
"Gill report (A5-0390/2000)"
"The Gill report has not met with our support. The following observations have played a role in the outcome."
"In an economy where competition is cut-throat, digital information must be able to offer quality."
"When considering what can and must be offered in terms of digital content, the principle of technological neutrality forms part of the European policy - and rightly so."
"Accordingly, rules and regulations on printed information also apply to digital information."
"This aspect has not been sufficiently highlighted in the report."
"In this context, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms forms a framework delineating the content for the sake of consumer protection."
"Pursuant to Article 10, freedom of expression goes hand in hand with duties and responsibilities which can result in conditions, restrictions and sanctions."
"In the light of this, regarding digital content, governments must, among other things, act in the interest of preventing criminal offences (discrimination), protecting public health (for example, provision of badly controlled medicines via the Internet), public decency or the rights of others (copyrights)."
"We must avoid lending any support to content which goes against the said interests."
"The report fails to point this out."
"Secondly, the report takes an approach to linguistic and cultural diversity which is too negative."
"Amendment No 8 reduces these to barriers to industrial development."
"This is said to be in conflict with respect for national identity (Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union)."
"Legislation is different in each Member State so as to accommodate this national identity in terms of society, language and ethics, for example."
"It would, therefore, be useful if the EU Member States were to ponder the question as to whose legislation should apply at European level."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Community activities must focus on those areas where activity at Community level offers added value."
"A lack of resources at Community level should not be the reason behind spurring Member States into action, as is the case in the draft report."
"Finally, digital information offers candidate countries with an ailing rail and road infrastructure possibilities for economic development."
"It is not enough to spread expertise, however."
"Flanking policy is vital if we are actually to benefit from the knowledge society."
"This may comprise organisational and technical structures, as well as training."
"The report does not give sufficient consideration to this aspect."
"This proposal for a Council decision is in line with the action intended to improve the networks of knowledge in Europe."
"The actions that have been planned are designed to address the clear advantage held by the United States in the ""digital content"" sector and in its distribution by various means linked to the Internet."
"Europe is clearly in a position to respond to the challenge of the markets, due to its advantages in economic and employment terms, and, of course, due to its cultural wealth and linguistic diversity - which are shown clearly in the concept of linguistic minorities and regional languages - over the monolingualism that characterises much of the ""Web"" ."
"The variety of languages and cultures - particularly if we also take account of the potential offered by new Member States - also allows us, especially where the SMEs are concerned, to facilitate exchanges and to export Europe' s cultural values, and to do so in multilingual forms characterised by an increasing interaction with translation systems."
"It must be emphasised that linguistic minorities, rather than being overwhelmed by the globalisation brought about by the Internet, have discovered that it opens up new cultural and economic horizons."
"Lastly, our huge heritage of knowledge residing in public archives, which are today often inaccessible, must be put onto the web."
"I welcome this report by my colleague, Neena Gill."
"Although 70% of Internet content is in English, the challenge to Europe is to exploit its linguistic wealth more fully."
"This entails the need for a language industry which concentrates on linguistic customisation and diversifies the language infrastructure of electronic content."
"This report contains many excellent ideas as to how these goals may be brought about for the benefit of all Member States, and I fully support it."
"Contributing to the creation of a programme for developing European digital content on the Internet is, in fact, crucial and the priorities that have been adopted are above criticism."
"What the text says about the necessary linguistic and cultural customisation is, however, sometimes frustrating: the encouragement to produce programmes on regional languages and on the ""ethnic minorities"" that are represented in the Union is a decision whose predictable consequences are the gradual erosion of national identities."
"In the field of digital information, the linguistic vehicle holds a competitive advantage, a style of reasoning and a legal position that favour those in whose mother tongue it appears."
"In these circumstances, it is in large part the coherence and the unity of the United States that have guaranteed that country its pre-eminent position in this market of the future."
"And what are we going to do to counter this American dominance?"
"We are going to ""balkanise"" our cultural products!"
"Faced with this situation, the 'bluecoat' will find nothing but a stream of inward-looking Indian tribes who will take it upon themselves to communicate with the outside world in the only common denominator: their master' s voice, whose insidious totalitarianism gives the impression of having been liberated from the most immediate control."
"We have already heard vivid examples in this Parliament of separatist Members who would rather speak in English than in the official language of their Member State."
"Leaving aside the technical problems that will arise when, in order to respect the text, we will need to find a system for switching from Kurdish to Breton..."
"The most serious aspect, however, is that these measures are an attack on the linguistic unity and therefore on the whole unity of the Member States: citizenship is underpinned, in almost all of Europe' s nations, by several pillars, of which acceptance of one official language in the national community is one of the most important."
"Some Member States, who practise linguistic partition on a daily basis, know that this inevitably leads to political partition and the collapse of a sense of nationhood."
"(The speech was cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Nice European Council"
"Mr President, this is the first time that I have spoken in an explanation of vote, but I have succumbed to the temptation to express my complete disagreement with the fact that the European Council in Nice has determined the number of MEPs in this House and their distribution by state, when that power should logically fall to this House, which represents the citizens of Europe and which holds an important position within the European Union."
"Mr President, I asked my daughter Elisabetta, who, as you know, is the regional representative of the Pensioners' Party for Lombardy - to give me her opinion on the Nice Council and to tell me whether she felt I should vote for the motion."
"She said to me: ""Yes, vote for the motion"" - and I followed her advice - ""but you must call upon the European Parliament to start to be resolute in presenting the proposal that Parliament should have exclusive decision-making powers where certain subjects are concerned."
"The Council has to start taking more of a back seat on certain matters, which must become and remain the exclusive legislative competence of the European Parliament."""
"Mr President, in the absence of any other results, the horse-trading in Nice has at least clearly shown the intentions of the European Union' s key players."
"Institutionalising the laws of the jungle, according to which the strong endeavour to destroy the weak, would inevitably lead to the institutional cobbling-together that we saw at Nice."
"The only thing that reins in the European Union' s four main powers from imposing their joint domination on Europe is the fact that they also see each other as rivals."
"It is worth noting that apart from the British exception on taxation, or the French exception on cultural products, every major state managed to protect the aspects that its elite considers important."
"Therefore, in the social field, it was the United Kingdom, whose legislation is the most inadequate of all the large countries, who proposed the British exception."
"No Member State, however, proposed the social exception to preserve the aspects of its own social legislation that are the least unfavourable to workers or to oppose the privatisation of public services."
"This proves the point that workers and the working classes can expect nothing better from the European Union than from their own national state, in other words, equality to a lower common denominator, weaker social protection, the destruction of public services and a drop in their standard of living."
"I therefore voted against this resolution."
"Mr President, I would like to express the discontent of many citizens at the lack of a spirit of European construction shown, once again, at the European Council in Nice."
"After three years of Amsterdam, it has had to be extended to the whole of the weekend, until the last minute, in order to reach some very limited agreements."
"And these agreements do not include, for example, the Charter of Fundamental Rights which this Parliament approved."
"This demonstrates that the governments of the fifteen Member States do not have much social sense or spirit when it comes to strengthening the rights of citizens."
"On the other hand, I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference announced for 2004, which seems to me to be the only positive outcome of Nice, will deal once and for all with the distribution of competences between the European Union and the governments of the Member States."
"I also hope that the EU' s share of competences is reduced in 2004, applying the principle of subsidiarity so that the regions and autonomous communities may have adequate status within the Union."
"I voted against the joint resolution due to elements it contains which have been consistently opposed by the UK Conservative Party."
"It should, however, be emphasised that the strong endorsement of EU enlargement, highlighted by Amendment 1, which was adopted, I wholeheartedly subscribe to."
"We should be grateful that the government leaders have reached an agreement in Nice. As a result, the balance of power in the European Union is on a reasonably even keel."
"The European Union is now ready for the candidate countries to join."
"Had no agreement been reached, the European Union would have been plunged into deep crisis from which it would have been difficult to emerge."
"In this light, we should be positive about this agreement."
"National interests play their part in determining the balance of power. That is inherent to the problem and does not bear witness to a short-term vision, as Paragraph 5 of the resolution suggests."
"In this respect, the tenor of the common resolution is far too one-sided."
"The resolution is also one-sided in that it takes it too much for granted that the extension of power and authority for the European institutions is, by definition, beneficial."
"What matters in Europe is that different peoples are able to co-exist in peace and cooperate, where necessary."
"The European institutions play a key role in this."
"The European Commission acts as guardian of the general European interest, and the European Parliament as a counterweight to Commission and Council."
"However, this role does not mean that their authority should be extended ad infinitum."
"The Community method is suited to tackling cross-border issues but is no miracle cure to solve all problems."
"Similarly, I cannot back the extension of authority provided to the Chairman of the European Commission, who gains too much power in this way."
"This completely lacks legitimacy."
"I cannot be upbeat about the declaration of the Charter either."
"This Charter only has symbolic value and that is detrimental to the actual protection of fundamental rights."
"Neither will I deny the fact that there is room for negotiation with regard to the outcome of Nice."
"The European Union could have displayed more democracy and transparency."
"The fact that this did not happen is a missed opportunity."
"There was one positive aspect to the Nice European Council: by declaring a new weighting of votes and a new distribution of Members of the European Parliament that includes all of the candidate countries from the East, a powerful signal was given to these countries that we want to welcome them into the Union soon."
"We can only welcome such a move."
"On the other hand, we are much less enthusiastic about the rest of the institutional negotiations."
"The Heads of State and Government locked themselves into short-term haggling, without any great vision of Europe' s future."
"They ""patched up"" the Community machine in order to prolong its lifespan in the face of enlargement."
"They may have succeeded in this, at least for the moment, but at the cost of serious problems, such as greater supranationality, less democracy and greater German influence in the decision-making process."
"With regard to the form of the Council, we note that it ended at dawn on the fifth day of negotiations, amid general exhaustion and uncertainty as to the exact shape that many of the decisions would take."
"The delay in the publication of the written conclusions - which are still not officially available, four days later - is a good illustration of the difficulty in clearly drawing up decisions taken in a state of confusion."
"Once again, in the haste and improvisation of the last night of the Council, very wide ranging measures that had not previously been discussed were adopted, such as the appointment by qualified majority of the President and the members of the Commission, which was not even mentioned for information only in the summary distributed by the Presidency before the Council."
"We wish to state once again that this method of decision making is completely unacceptable in democratic countries."
"The solution, however, is certainly not, as the federalists propose, to have the IGCs prepared by conventions such as the one that drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights, because this would simply increase confusion, one-upmanship and a lack of realism."
"On the contrary, future IGCs must now deliberate on a more solid basis, an agenda consisting of proposals adopted by a minimum number - for example, a third - of national parliaments."
"This is the only way to refocus the discussion."
"With regard to the substance, we can decipher, from the tangled web of commitments, at least two tendencies that have been superimposed on one another. These are firstly the advance of supranationality to the detriment of national democracies and secondly the advance of German positions in the supranational decision-making process."
"With regard to the first tendency, the main aspect to highlight is the immediate or soon to take place extension of qualified majority voting on major issues, such as asylum and immigration policy, international agreements in the field of services and copyright, or even the appointment of Commissioners."
"Despite a slight increase in the threshold for qualified majority voting, the scope of which remains to be seen, this extension is bound to mean that the gap will increase further still between the European institutions and national democracies."
"With regard to the trade negotiations mentioned earlier, for example, national parliaments will lose their last rights of ratification, and if a country is in a minority in the Council, it will no longer be able to say 'no' if negotiations threaten its interests."
"At the same time, we should not be under any illusions about the apparent retention of parity in France and Germany' s votes in the Council: this is a trick of the light, because the new ""demographic net"" rule - the creation of a blocking minority representing 38% of the population - will automatically favour Germany, which alone will hold almost half of this minority following enlargement to 27 members."
"Germany will therefore find it easier than the others to reach the blocking threshold, by adding a few smaller countries to its sphere of influence."
"At the same time, the discrepancy between the number of German Members of the European Parliament and those from other countries such as France is increasing even further, which will have certain consequences in the context of the decision-making powers acquired by the European Parliament."
"Some people may consider this development to be perfectly legitimate, because it tends to transpose the weighting of each country into the institutions according to the size of their populations."
"This method of calculation, however, is based on the implicit assumption that there is a single European people, which is not the case."
"The only way of preventing dangerous conflicts in future is to adhere to the traditional concept, according to which Europe is founded on mutual respect between national communities."
"For example, the new method of appointing the President of the Commission, which is by qualified majority in the Council and simple majority in the European Parliament, leads straight to appointing office-holders who may not enjoy the support of all the countries, whereas they will, almost out of necessity, enjoy the support of Germany."
"Have we properly considered the upheavals that such measures could cause to the philosophy of the European institutions, and the misdeeds that they may produce?"
"The French should also ask themselves whether this new method of appointing the President of the Commission, together with the increased power of that position, is in complete accordance with the Constitution."
"Can this new Europe last?"
"Theoretically, it cannot, because it will, of its own accord, increasingly become cut off from national democracies."
"In practice, however, its proponents have had the skill, by making enhanced cooperation more flexible, to introduce a degree of flexibility, which will make it easier for the shock of enlargement to be absorbed."
"In time, however, this will not be enough, because the ultra-federal hard core will make the democratic deficit in Europe worse."
"That is why we urge the French Parliament to prevent a serious crisis arising in Europe' s future by refusing to ratify the Treaty of Nice."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the joint resolution on the result of the European Council' s Summit in Nice, which took place from 7 to 11 December 2000."
"For us it was crucial in the entire process surrounding this Intergovernmental Conference that the last formal barriers to the enlargement of the EU be removed."
"This aim was achieved in Nice, and seen in this light the summit was a success."
"A number of members of the European Parliament argued in very strong terms for the agenda to be expanded."
"We warned against this on repeated occasions and the events in Nice show with all the clarity one could ask for that a substantially broader agenda could have resulted in no result whatsoever being achieved this year, with catastrophic consequences for enlargement."
"We have also always believed that a balanced solution between small and big countries should be found in connection with the composition of the Commission, voting rights in the Council of Ministers and the composition of Parliament."
"On this point, too, we believe that a satisfactory result has been achieved."
"However, we note that the formal opportunities for achieving qualified majority voting have been restricted and that qualified majority voting has been introduced only in a limited number of areas."
"There is thus a real risk that it will become more difficult to implement essential legislation on the environment, consumer protection and the working environment, and we strongly recommend the states to demonstrate responsibility and to make the decision-making procedures in the Council more efficient."
"Together with the new Treaty of Nice it was decided that preparations should be commenced for the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"We believe that it is important to take plenty of time and find a form worthy of modern, practical EU cooperation, and that a power game such as was played out in Nice must not prevail."
"It does not help to encourage public support for cooperation."
"The Nice Summit concluded on Sunday with an agreement that should lead to a draft treaty."
"Everyone today agrees that this Treaty will be mediocre and that it will fall considerably short of the expectations of the European Parliament and of ""true"" Europeans!"
"The debates in Parliament have made this quite clear."
"Without wishing to deny some positive points of progress that were made, it would be no exaggeration to say that the Treaty of Nice will not guarantee Europe' s institutional and political future."
"Should the blame for this be laid at the door of the French Presidency?"
"I say, quite clearly, 'NO' !"
"That would be too simple!"
"The mediocrity of the Nice conclusions is the sad outcome of the lack of European ambitions of ALL the Member States, and of the stubborn defence of their ""private domains"" and their last illusions of power."
"Given these circumstances, the absence of ""great European voices"" did the rest and that is why I think that the Nice agreement is a lesser evil and certainly the ""least bad"" outcome that could have been achieved in this context."
"We must now focus on the results that have been achieved and, above all, rely on the commitments that have been given in order to relaunch European ambition whatever the draft treaty may be and the future that the European Parliament has in store for it."
"We still have a few months to work on this until the end of 2003 in order to save the European project."
"Today I voted in favour of the resolution."
"Tomorrow we will have to fight, bringing together all the supporters of a political and social Europe and a Europe that exists for its citizens!"
"Given the fundamental importance of the decisions to be taken at the Nice Summit, credit must be given where credit is due."
"Each Member State, big and small, had its own priorities, its own objectives."
"That is natural."
"The fact that an agreement was reached on very difficult issues should not be underestimated."
"It was a huge task."
"The basis for the future enlargement of the European Union has been laid down."
"The negotiations were tough but the strength of the Union was shown in the fact that there was a determination to find solutions agreeable to all."
"In the spirit of compromise, a way forward was found."
"The resolution on Nice, voted today, does not reflect this."
"I abstained on the final vote as I believe Parliament fails to recognise the achievements of Nice."
"The tone of the resolution is negative."
"It does not reflect the positive outcome of the summit."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights was proclaimed."
"Such rights are already very well safeguarded in Ireland's own Constitution."
"Important decisions were taken on social and economic issues, the establishment of the European Food Authority and the impact of the BSE crisis was considered."
"As a result of the intervention of Ireland's Prime Minister, the Commission has been mandated to analyse the situation now confronting beef producers and will make the necessary proposals as soon as possible to find a way to compensate beef producers for the fall in prices."
"The Applicant States were reassured of our determination to advance the enlargement process."
"The text says the Heads of State gave priority to short-term national interests rather than EU interests."
"I do not agree."
"What was agreed was agreed in the best interests of Europe and the Member States."
"Opting now for a Convention or a European constitution is premature."
"A balance was found at Nice and the Heads of Government and State must be congratulated on this."
"This was one of the most protracted issues and difficult elements of the negotiations."
"Despite the successful efforts of the Nice Summit in this area, the resolution expresses dissatisfaction with the new extension of the scope of qualified majority."
"In other words, what Parliament wants is control over taxation and social security issues."
"The Nice Summit properly reflects the interests of the Member States in this area."
"The Greens' amendment makes it clear that what they want is codecision on agriculture."
"This is not our position."
"The Nice Summit has sadly become known as a further step in the militarisation of the European Union and as a major threat to the sovereignty of the small- and medium-sized countries like Portugal, which, in general, are losing power and the ability to influence decisions."
"Those who see their power strengthened are the large countries, especially Germany, France and the United Kingdom, which, in practice, can wreck any decision by forming a blocking minority."
"This situation is exacerbated by the extension of decision making by qualified majority, under which, in certain circumstances, only 14 countries can make decisions on behalf of the 27 or 28, thus, in practice, eliminating the right of veto on policies that are highly important for Portugal, such as the Structural Funds or commercial policy agreements."
"In addition, Portugal also loses members in the European Parliament, because, although the 700 barrier will have been passed for a European Union with 27 Member States, the number of Members per state will be reduced, and this will affect certain countries, including Portugal in particular."
"Lastly a mention of social policy, which France had backed when it opened its Presidency, but which ended up amounting to very little, apart from the declarations of intent and the titles of documents with very vague contents which clearly did not match up to the existing problems and the enormous discontent, of which the workers' demonstration in Nice was also a major expression."
"I have just voted in favour of the resolution of the European Parliament on the Nice Summit."
"What the Heads of State and Government delivered at the weekend is totally inadequate."
"Neither the 'significant added value' nor the 'route map to enlargement' for which Romano Prodi had hoped were achieved."
"On the contrary, the people of Europe and their Parliament have experienced a 'regression from Amsterdam'."
"These Council decisions, cobbled together in late-night sessions, do not constitute solid foundations; they are riddled with holes large enough for concepts such as transparency, the creation of a European identity, more democracy, popular participation and reformism to slip right through."
"The information currently at our disposal suggests that there were some successes, such as intensified cooperation, the party statute and the declaration of intent on eastward enlargement, but the compromises that materialised were mostly minimal."
"As at a Christmas market, Member States set out their stalls on which various national interests were displayed with price tags attached."
"Moves towards greater convergence were blatantly obstructed."
"I was bitterly disappointed by the French Presidency of the Council before and during the negotiations."
"The prompting from the chair was half-hearted; the active contribution of the presidency consisted in proposing a deluge of compromises with only one thing in common, namely their inability to attract majority support."
"This was domestic politicking for the sake of a forthcoming election."
"The engine of European unification was left idling in this very country which, for all its specific national interests, has invariably acted as a grande nation in the service of the European ideal."
"The amiti√© franco-allemande [friendship between France and Germany] has always been the linchpin of the European Union."
"It is sorely missed today."
"Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, who is noted in Germany for his brusque manner, for bringing discussions to an abrupt halt with the word Basta! ('Enough!'), a graceless and uninterested player on the European stage, omitted to consult his neighbours from the Seine in good time."
"Instead, he trumpeted his intentions through his favourite mouthpiece, the media."
"The high public profile of his call for more German influence in the Council, in other words for more votes than France, which has over 20 million fewer inhabitants than Germany, totally devalued its substance, making it appear like a bargaining chip in a thinly veiled tactical manoeuvre."
"Unanimous decisions, and hence an inherent incapacity to act, remain largely the norm in the Council."
"Qualified majority voting has been extended to more than 30 additional provisions, but these provisions cover matters of minor significance."
"In the really important areas such as taxes, public levies, social policy, asylum and immigration, the old order has evidently survived."
"We are further than ever from generalised qualified majority voting in the Council, which would have led to codecision rights for the European Parliament."
"In the realm of structural policy, which accounts for three quarters of the total volume of the Community budget, Parliament is totally excluded from the legislative process!"
"Decision making in the Council has become more complicated."
"A threefold majority must be achieved before decisions can be taken, and the required quotas of votes have been increased."
"Not a single iota of transparency in sight!"
"I believe there is an urgent need to revise the system of Intergovernmental Conferences where the participants endeavour to hold each other in check and acclaim the assertion of petty national interests as great triumphs."
"These conferences should be replaced by a convention, similar to the one that was established to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Under the excellent chairmanship of Roman Herzog, the convention held open and constructive meetings, involving national and European parliamentarians; non-governmental organisations, business and labour organisations and interested individuals were not sidelined but actually felt involved and knew that their opinions were valued."
"All that remains for us now is to subject the details of the summit agreements to careful scrutiny over the coming weeks."
"In the post-Nice process, major changes must be achieved in the decisions as they now stand."
"The people of Europe deserve a substantially improved outcome."
"We are aware that this European Council in Nice was perhaps the longest and most difficult summit in the history of the European Union."
"In fact, no other summit has ever had to face the prospect of such a vast expansion as this."
"We must therefore see its conclusions as the result of a compromise in which nobody was entirely the winner or entirely the loser."
"In my view, the Fifteen managed to agree on certain institutional changes that are indispensable if the Union is to function with a substantially higher number of members."
"Two changes that stand out are the commitment that each Member State will retain the right to appoint a commissioner and the adoption of better rules for access to the closer cooperation mechanism."
"Other positive aspects of this summit are the fact that the unanimity rule has been kept for decisions on both the Structural Funds and taxation, key areas for countries like Portugal which still need the solidarity of the European Union and the use of the tax system for a policy encouraging investment and saving."
"We cannot, however, ignore the fact that the solutions found for the complex decision-making system in the Council and the corresponding vote weighting increase the gap between the more and the less highly populated states, which is something we regard as less positive because of our concept of a Europe of sovereign nations."
"The resolution that was approved in this Parliament does not reflect these positions and concerns of ours, and even sends out an appeal for the current method of Intergovernmental Conferences to be abandoned in future."
"In our view, for as long as Europe is what it is, questions of a constitutional nature or of fundamental interest for the States, such as those that were debated in Nice, should not be resolved by any other means; that is, they should require unanimity."
"That is why my vote on this matter was negative."
"The amazing thing about the debate on Nice is the image that, when all is said and done, the Treaty has no father or mother but is nobody' s child: the French Presidency has fallen over backwards giving excuses instead of plainly accepting the results of the IGC and the reasons for them; the political groups corresponding to the Member States' governments have done all they can to criticise."
"It is obviously a political pretence: the true democracy of Europe is what happened there and not what was artificially planned by a majority in this House which is out of touch with the feelings of the peoples of Europe."
"It is the same pretence which accompanied the earlier debates and which explains this resounding 'failure' ."
"The 'failure' arises basically from the unrealistic way in which they represent the process of building Europe. I refuse to recognise that this Parliament has some higher legitimacy; instead, I recognise in the Heads of State and Government of the Fifteen meeting in Nice the full democratic legitimacy of representing their respective peoples and nations, resulting from high-turnout elections."
"Thus, notwithstanding reservations about the Treaty, I above all oppose the sentiments expressed by the majority of this House, which, unfortunately, has still failed to learn from the facts and instead insists on approaches that will simply lead to more frustration."

"Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil report (A5-0334/2000)"
"Mr President, this time I did not consult my daughter but I did ask a pensioner who, as usual, came to see me off at the airport when I left for Strasbourg what he thought of the report on fuel taxation."
"He replied: 'Mr Fatuzzo, fuel tax should be as low as possible so that aeroplane tickets cost as little as possible."
"We pensioners often travel and, to tell the truth, train and car journeys are tiring: for us, aeroplanes are a dream come true."
"You must therefore vote for this measure which further reduces taxation on aircraft, for this will bring the price of aeroplane tickets down and we will be able to travel much more frequently by plane."
"And while you are there, ask for a reduction in the price of aeroplane tickets for the elderly pensioners who travel.'"
"Flying used to be expensive."
"The spectacular growth of air traffic over the past couple of years is the direct result of the proportionately lower price which consumers pay for this mode of transport."
"Not only reduced staffing levels and other cuts, but also government policy have brought the prices down."
"From a taxation point of view, air traffic is given preferential treatment compared to land-based transport."
"If those effects had been foreseen in the year I was born (1944) when the Chicago Convention was concluded, it is unlikely that tax exemption for fuel and other aircraft necessities would have been agreed upon."
"The growth of air traffic is at the expense of rail traffic and the environment."
"It would be desirable if aircraft were no longer used for relatively short distances up to 1 000 km and if air traffic were restricted to intercontinental transport."
"I am indignant at the largest group and its attempt, within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to keep taxation on air traffic out of the equation as much as possible at a time when other groups were under-represented, because this did not do justice to the actual relations within that committee."
"Patrie report (A5-0352/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the document on the precautionary principle but I do have some reservations."
"I would not like the precautionary principle to lead to a repetition of what happened to a friend of mine when he went out with his wife."
"His wife said to him: 'Don't cross the road or you might get run over' ."
"'Okay, I'll walk.'"
"'Don't walk near blocks of flats or something might fall on your head!'"
"'I'll take the underground then.'"
"'Oh no, God forbid!"
"You might be pushed under a train!'"
"'I'll go home then and watch TV.'"
"'Don't turn the television on: it might explode!'"
"'Well, let's go to bed and make love.'"
"'And what about Aids?'"
"I abstained during the final vote on this otherwise excellent report by Mrs Patrie because I feel it is politically and scientifically irresponsible to refer to the precautionary principle, even on the basis of ""incomplete, inconclusive or uncertain scientific information"" and even ""in the case of a low risk"" ."
"As there is no such thing as zero risk, scientists - or at least politicians - should apply the criterion of proportionality, consider there to be risks and assume their responsibilities."
"It goes without saying that citizens must, in any event, be fully informed."
"I think that Parliament should also apply this precautionary principle to its explanations of vote."
"Guidelines for innovative ERDF measures"
"The next item is the report (A5-0354/2000) by Mr Markov, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission' s draft communication to the Member States: ""The regions in the new economy"" - Guidelines for innovative measures under the ERDF in the period 2000-2006."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since 1988 the European Union has been supporting studies and pilot schemes designed to foster regional development at Community level. These studies and pilot schemes subsequently developed into a laboratory of innovative measures."
"Two of the products of this development are the Community initiatives Interreg and URBAN, both of which have exemplified how experience can be amassed through the testing of new strategies and methods and then used to improve existing regional policies."
"Effective social partnerships and closer local and regional cooperation are among the main fruits of this innovative activity."
"The basis of my report is a proposed communication from the Commission to the Member States setting out the implementing provisions for the financing by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of innovative measures for the period 2000-2006, for which guidelines were agreed in Berlin."
"I should like to focus particularly on two aspects of the Commission proposal."
"The first is the substantive realignment of the initiatives."
"In accordance with the proposal made at the Lisbon Summit that support be given to promote the transition to a knowledge-based economy and society within the Community, the ERDF-sponsored innovative measures are to be restructured, the eight subject areas being concentrated into three priority areas of technological development."
"This approach should have our support, because the gap between developed and backward regions is far greater in terms of technological development than in terms of Gross Domestic Product."
"To illustrate this, let me say that spending in recent years on research and development in the 25 least-developed regions of the EU has amounted to only a quarter of the European average."
"This is reflected in the percentage of the working population who are employed in the various fields of new technology, namely 14.6% in the 25 most highly developed regions as opposed to 4% in the 25 poorest regions."
"The complexity and diversity of technological change and the structural adjustment processes demand the involvement of all relevant players at the local and regional levels in development partnerships, rooted in strategic policy blueprints that must be drawn up for the development of each region."
"I attach particular importance to the inclusion of young people as one of the target groups of the innovative measures defined in the guidelines, since they are the future engines of development."
"For that reason, we should endorse the call for the responsible authorities at national, regional and local levels to ensure, by their own efforts and with the aid of all available EU support mechanisms, that the same terms and conditions are created throughout the EU for the acquisition of modern information technology by educational establishments."
"To my mind, a major and unacceptable defect in the support policy of the European Union is the disparate administration of programmes."
"While the Commission proposes a switch from project-based to programme-based funding, on which opinions may well be divided - I, for one, believe that it represents a loss of European added value, visibility and closeness to the people and, moreover, not all Member States have established the requisite regional authorities - the financing of innovative measures from the European Social Fund remains project-based."
"Accordingly, when one and the same programme is financed from both funds, it will be subject to two diametrically different implementation mechanisms."
"This situation impairs efficiency, creates incompatibility and undermines efforts to cut red tape."
"And so to my second point, namely the funding of innovative measures."
"Although only one per cent of the total ERDF budget was available for innovative measures in the period from 1994 to 1999, the Commission has now reduced the funding for the years 2000 to 2006 in what can reasonably be called a drastic and intolerable manner."
"First of all, the funds estimated at EUR 800 million which were originally earmarked for Agenda 2000 in the Berlin guidelines were cut to 400 million at the last minute because of an appropriation to the URBAN programme, admittedly at the insistence and in the interests of this Parliament, which had fought to save the URBAN initiative."
"The House had also fought, however, for the reduction of the funds available for innovative measures to be offset by means of resources from the flexibility instrument, a demand which is recorded in a declaration on the financial perspective in the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"And there is more to come."
"Although the letter sent to Parliament by the Commission on 5 September 2000 proposing the guidelines for innovative measures under the ERDF still referred to EUR 400 million, back in May 2000, in its review of the use of the Structural Funds during the period from 1994 to 1999, the Commission had proposed the withdrawal of EUR 160 million from this allocation to cover outstanding liabilities for the period from 1994 to 1999."
"This need had arisen because of the Commission's failure to make timely provision at the end of 1999 to cover this particular commitment."
"As the Court of Auditors noted in its annual report, other options were available which would have avoided the need to resort to the allocation for the current period from 2000 to 2006 in order to meet this legal obligation."
"This is an absolutely improper piece of cross-subsidisation between the Berlin and Edinburgh packages."
"In its proposal 40/2000 for a transfer of appropriations, the Commission reshuffled its resources in an extremely opaque manner in order to authorise the payment of these missing appropriations at the expense of the present programme of innovative measures and technical assistance."
"Not even a letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Hatzidakis, was able to prevent the Committee on Budgets from giving its consent."
"All we can hope for now is that the Commission will honour its pledge to use the flexibility instrument to replace these diverted funds over the coming years and make them available once again for innovative measures under the ERDF."
"But I do not believe this will actually happen."
"Indeed, the Commission, having initially cut the budget on its own initiative, will find it almost impossible to secure the replenishment of these funds at a later date."
"Lastly, I should like to say that I am able to support all the amendments, since none of them are inconsistent with the general thrust of my report."
"Mr President, I should like to comment in a very favourable light on Mr Markov's report and to congratulate him on putting such a constructive report before the House."
"I find I am in very substantial agreement with most of the points he includes in his document. There are, however, a number of issues on which I would wish to comment."
"Firstly, the whole of this report is based upon innovation - and innovation relies on three very important prerequisites."
"It relies on individuality, inventiveness and initiative."
"We must therefore strive to avoid anything which would stifle or detract from these important three prerequisites."
"The report unfortunately refers to many aspects which could be seen as just such interference and over-regulation and therefore as over-complicating the approach to the use of innovation funding."
"We must avoid being too prescriptive and thus putting up artificial barriers which would prevent us reaching our goals."
"We need to give incentives to enable new innovatory enterprises to flourish but we must not go down the path of over-interference."
"Innovative businesses and innovative projects, by their very nature, involve risk and here, the EU, national governments, regional and local agencies can help, but, as with many innovative ideas, some are destined to fail."
"Many we hope will succeed."
"The trick is to know which will succeed and flourish but we should also have the strength to know that when something has failed we should not prop it up at public expense and develop a strategy that takes this into account."
"I would also like to flag up that business itself should take the lead in this sort of issue, backed up, of course, with sufficient skills training provided by our universities and colleges."
"All have a role to play in this important area for, in the truly global market which is now upon us, it is the new ideas - properly resourced, cogently and realistically supported - which will ensure that we in Europe can maintain our place at the forefront of technological development in the new industries and in communications technology in particular."
"It is my belief that an innovative strategy such as conceived in this report and as implemented by entrepreneurs at an individual level will be the key to economic prosperity in this new millennium."
"I commend the report to the House."
"Mr President, we are dealing with a good Commission document and a good document by the rapporteur."
"From a theoretical point of view, I can only welcome them, because I believe they are well thought out and that they correctly mark out the direction which these funds should take."
"Now, the problem does not exactly lie with the text, but with the budget, on the one hand, which is a reduced budget, slimmed down compared to the one which the European Union has dedicated to such an important area on previous occasions and, on the other, with the lack of prestige which this budget seems to have, which means that one can dip in and out of it and that it is not clearly consolidated."
"I make this comment so that the Commissioner can take it into account."
"However, we are, of course, talking about the European Regional Development Fund."
"This Fund was created for very real and substantial policies, investments in roads, investments in direct infrastructures, and it must now be brought up to date with the new economic situation and the new competitive circumstances."
"That is a fundamental objective for the Commission: that the ERDF, which has had its time and whose influence has been very positive, should become the motor for an increase in the competitiveness of our production system, particularly in the least-favoured regions."
"Therefore, innovative factors like this one, however humble, must not be undervalued by anyone."
"It could be said that innovation is within reach of all the operators involved in the production process."
"For certain regions it will possibly be very difficult to have real research or development systems."
"But innovation is the basis of competitiveness and it must exist even where there is no capacity for research, and this objective is therefore important."
"We are logically talking about 0.4% of the ERDF."
"There is a passage in Mr Markov' s draft, Commissioner, which I would like you to take into account and which says, and with this I shall end: ""suggests likewise, given the scant budgetary allocation set aside for innovatory measures, that the Commission encourage the incorporation of this type of project in the regional operational programmes"" ."
"Mr President, I too wish to congratulate Mr Markov on drafting a successful report, and thank him for it."
"Our Group is in favour of adopting it."
"The report has quite rightly stressed the importance of including the participation as well as the cooperation of regional and local players."
"Innovative measures can also help us to strengthen special regional and local features."
"In my opinion, it is important to create conditions that are as equal as possible in the different areas by exploiting modern technology."
"Teleworking can also create new job opportunities in sparsely populated areas."
"For that reason, broadband networks, for example, should be established to cover the entire Union area as much as is feasible, including those regions in which the markets do not create networks."
"The basic idea behind innovative measures is the creation and utilisation of new operational models."
"To this end, we must develop monitoring and evaluation systems."
"We have to focus attention on exchanges of experience and compliance with best practice."
"Tourism is an important means of livelihood in many remote areas as well."
"Innovative measures would, for example, help to promote the cooperation of travel companies in marketing and reservation systems."
"As has been said here, innovative measures should not just play it safe: they must also involve trying out risky projects."
"The measures must also serve the interests of regional sustainable development."
"Regarding the budget, some serious words were said here in the previous speech: EUR 400 million is really just the minimum for financing, and we will have to utilise the additional financial possibilities offered by the flexibility instrument in the second half of the period, as the report states."
"I would also like to ask how the Commission intends to ensure that the money that was agreed at Berlin will be available for innovative measures, and how the money that has been lent to the URBAN initiative is to be returned during this period for use for innovative measures."
"Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are appropriate, as the Commission should not use appropriation reserves for unexpected projects, as was the case a few weeks ago."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my remarks today are chiefly addressed to the Commissioner, because, as we know, innovative measures have always been the Commission's main instrument of progress."
"They have been the testing ground where the EU institutions have been able to observe how progressive structural policies can best be implemented."
"If the Commission's proposal on these innovative measures were used to measure the rate at which EU policies are progressing, the result would be similar to that of the Nice Summit, namely a huge embarrassment."
"However, EU policies in the fields of the single market, employment and cohesion have been considerably more innovative and sophisticated in recent times."
"That is precisely where the Commission proposal falls down, for it is confined to only two areas of innovation."
"I say two because, although the proposal identifies three areas, two of them quite obviously belong together and will have to be jointly funded."
"Such a severe restriction as this has certainly never been imposed in recent years."
"Moreover, the area of activity in question is one that we have already been supporting over the past few years. So where is the innovation in that?"
"This, I must say, is a great loss, because we shall need to draw on past experience for the new support period, and this experience will be unavailable to us if we take such a cautious line."
"Major assets, such as the experience gathered in the course of energy-saving schemes for small- and medium-sized businesses, will be cast aside."
"I could produce a far longer list."
"Why do we not use innovations to generate real innovative activity? The measures that are proposed are measures which we could support within the framework of the normal programmes."
"I believe there is no case whatsoever for allowing Member States to support non-innovative measures from the Structural Funds instead of fostering the policy and development of our Union."
"We have another problem too."
"The idea of programming rather than selecting projects is not bad."
"I would even support the idea, but it has not been fully developed. How are local players supposed to find their way through the administrative jungle if the same authorities that are making a hash of structural planning are now expected to take on this responsibility too?"
"How is the Commission supposed to find out where local innovation is really happening if it does not have any control over the system?"
"For that reason, I believe it is absolutely essential for us to ensure that the Commission finds a mechanism with which it can check whether truly innovative local projects are actually featuring in the programmes."
"I must say that I have looked in vain for this sort of mechanism in the draft communication, which is why this draft is a great disappointment to players at the local level and to me."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order to bolster the competitiveness of Europe in the world economy, the Union supports the transition of businesses and regional authorities to operational methods based on knowledge and technological innovation."
"The immensity of this task must not be underestimated, since the less prosperous regions are already lagging far behind in innovation, research and development in the various fields of new technology."
"This very technology, on the other hand, presents them with a means of making up the leeway, provided that the economic players in the regions are capable of using innovative measures to grasp the opportunities available to them."
"The fact is that the technological gap between prosperous and backward regions is considerably greater than the difference between their respective Gross Domestic Products."
"Unfortunately, as in the last planning period, expectations will far exceed the available funding framework of EUR 400 million. Without adequate funding, these measures simply cannot achieve the desired results."
"For that reason, the allocation must not, on any account, be reduced further still."
"The innovative measures would then generate more frustration than enthusiasm."
"We should spell that out very clearly."
"The main aspects of the Markov report, which analyses the situation properly and arrives at the right conclusions, can be commended to the House."
"It is a good report, based on a good paper from the Commission."
"On one point, however, I tend to support the line taken by the Commission."
"I cannot endorse the rapporteur's expression of regret that the Commission has opted against a project-based approach and in favour of a programme-based approach, to be implemented by the national and regional authorities."
"On the contrary, I see this as an opportunity to shift a greater share of responsibility to the local level and to allow project operators more latitude."
"Contrary to what the report concludes, I do not believe that this would automatically result in a loss of any European added value."
"With these guidelines, an experimental laboratory, as Commissioner Barnier put it, really can be developed, enabling the regions to test new ideas and to convert the most successful of these into standard practices."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as someone who lives and works in an Objective 1 region, and on an island to boot, I am obviously well qualified to understand the importance of the initiative and appreciate the objectives of the European Union."
"I and my fellow islanders are delighted that an effort is being made to improve conditions in the fight to close the gap and reduce the distance between us and the developed regions."
"Europe needs to achieve cohesion for obvious reasons."
"Throw in the ""difficulty"" of globalisation and it becomes apparent that, in addition to traditional forms of work, we must be able to apply innovative practices in order to take advantage of the opportunities which the new economy has to offer."
"To judge from my own country, the region has what it takes, from the point of view of human resources and from the point of view of instruments which can bring suitable partners together, to promote innovations by finding new solutions and new ways forward."
"Of course, the budget is relatively small. However, the facility to increase appropriations through the flexibility instrument provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement improves things somewhat."
"I must also confess that I was particularly pleased in the Commission communication by the call for more daring measures, even if this involves a certain risk of failure, and for more experimentation beyond the standard framework of ERDF programmes."
"Of course, if we want to be consistent, this call needs to be accompanied by a restriction on tiresome bureaucracy, Commissioner, at all stages of the procedure for including and implementing programmes."
"As we all know, any bureaucrat's basic argument is the risk of error."
"So, from now on, special care must be taken when selecting the proposals submitted, so as to ensure that the relevant provisions are applied, especially those relating to transparency and avoiding cover-ups, and the proposals are implemented correctly, naturally with greater involvement on the part of the regional authorities."
"Finally, may I too congratulate Mr Markov and wish everyone a Merry Christmas and an Innovative New Year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my support - in common with that of our Group - for this report by Mr Helmuth Markov."
"I particularly agree with his consideration that regional policy instruments should be directed towards sustainability, strengthening economic and social cohesion and, above all, creating skilled, economically viable, lasting jobs."
"This last condition is indeed fundamental for the proper orientation of the Structural Funds."
"As we all know, unemployment in the European Union is concentrated in the least economically and technologically developed regions, especially Objective 1 areas, and it is necessary that innovative measures should not just simply be technological in nature but that they should also be governed by an explicit desire for economic development and job creation."
"If this does not happen, we shall be unable to avoid the paradoxical situation in which the less well developed countries, having borne the effects of a substantial, dramatic migration, now see their technicians - trained at the great expense of their populations and perfectly able to work in the field of the new economy - forced to emigrate to richer countries with higher employment levels because of the lack of industries and businesses in which they can practice their professions in their own countries."
"Consequently, the innovative measures must not ignore economic and social development. In this context, the ERDF must also continue to perform its function of supporting the construction of modern infrastructure and the creation of businesses as necessary conditions for the development of the new economy and, indeed, the job creation associated with it."
"Mr President, the support funds allocated by the European Union within the framework of its regional policy are not alms from the rich to help the poor."
"Nor must they become a permanent financial crutch."
"They are actually intended to help the poor regions to help themselves; investment in a better future is the name of the game."
"It is therefore gratifying that the communication from the Commission on the regions in the new economy pursues this very aim and does so more effectively than many of the traditional mainstream Objective 1 to 3 programmes."
"It is a matter of increasing the competitiveness of the European economy and, as has already been emphasised several times today, of ensuring in particular that appropriate initial support is given to those parts of our regions which do not enjoy the same starting conditions as the metropolitan areas and large conurbations."
"What is rather less encouraging is the fact that the amount of money to be injected into these measures is very modest indeed."
"The Markov report rightly calls for an increase in this allocation."
"By earmarking EUR 400 million for this important purpose we are sending out a very weak signal."
"I also find it less than satisfactory that there is no provision for direct project funding and that programme-based funding has again emerged as the preferred option. The reason for my disapproval is that it removes yet another link that might enable the people of Europe to identify in some way with Brussels."
"There is also a danger that politicians will engage once more in the traditional game we call Schwarzer Peter in Austria - you may know it as Old Maid - in which local, regional and national politicians try to claim credit for all the good things and to pass the buck to Brussels whenever something goes wrong."
"In organisational terms, I believe that it makes good sense to focus special support on a small number of aims."
"I also believe, however, that the division into three priority areas envisaged in the Commission report is somewhat artificial; like the rapporteur, I am inclined to think that we should include more innovative measures in the domains of energy efficiency, propagation of renewable forms of energy and practical implementation of climate protection measures in our catalogue of eligible activities."
"I consider it especially important that schools and other educational establishments should be involved with these new forms of technology, and I hope they will find a suitable way to make their voices heard here."
"On this basis it is generally gratifying that we shall be able to continue good pilot projects."
"I am pleased to report that we in Styria have already gathered very worthwhile experience in the last couple of years with Risi, an information offensive launched by the new provincial government."
"One especially good feature of this initiative is that it has enabled women in particular to familiarise themselves with new information technology and its applications."
"I do not know whether it is a direct consequence of this Risi initiative that three ladies signed the European budget today, but I should be delighted if this Christmas present on which we are deciding today could also continue to benefit women in the future."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur who dealt with the innovative measures in the former Parliament, in relation to the former Article 10 initiative, I wanted to take part in this debate to remind the new Commissioner of some of the points surrounding this which Parliament has been consistently pressing for and which we do not want to see forgotten."
"We fought hard to keep the innovative measures within the new round of structural fund programmes and I am really pleased that we are here today, both confirming this and the EUR 3 million that is going to be available through agreeing the new guidelines."
"I particularly want to record two findings for the Commissioner."
"One is that we - and the people out there - see that the innovative measures have been a very important stepping stone for local authorities and local communities who are not really into the Structural Funds, but should be, to learn how to do it through small-scale projects and then be able to become more effective parts of mainstream programmes in future years."
"We came up with a ten-point programme to say how that could be done."
"When I go back to my own region, east of England, and find that not one local authority used this money in that last period, I doubt whether we have been as effective as we need to be in the future to ensure those new communities are welcomed in."
"Secondly, we talked about the need to work in partnership with local government and local authorities including, for example, through the Directoria event."
"Some of your officials are not so comfortable about that and I detect a moving away from it within this new set of proposals, but I warn you that that would be a step in the wrong direction."
"These people are our partners."
"They help us reach the people in most need within the disadvantaged regions and it is no good us making speeches about the democratic deficit in Europe and then ignoring the contribution that local authorities can make at the local level."
"Finally, however, I welcome the proposals."
"I believe you are trying to be flexible."
"You are trying to allow regions to go away and come up with their own proposals and to come back and submit them to you."
"You are right to do that and I welcome what you are seeking to do."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the year 2000 is coming to an end and we are still debating the main guidelines, that is to say, the priorities in terms of innovative actions financed through the European Regional Development Fund."
"If the Berlin reform for the 7 years dealt with by Agenda 2000, that is to say for the period 2000-2006, reduced the budgetary contributions for these actions by half in comparison with the previous period and, to that, we add the inevitable slowness with which we adopt decisions at a Community level, as a result of our complex institutional structure, it is not surprising that we are in a situation where we have not even been able to spend the budget laid down for the current year for innovative regional policy measures, and this is an example of political irresponsibility."
"It is also a mistake to reduce the budget in a chapter such as this which was being dedicated to pilot experiments, to new ideas in the field of local and urban development - with some more than satisfactory results - which have formed the basis of Community programmes as cherished at local level as URBAN and INTERREG."
"If we have still not realised, in this increasingly globalised world, that the progress of any country or region depends on its investment in research and innovation, we are providing our voters with a bad service."
"Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to another aspect of the new policy proposed by the Commission."
"Now, the local authorities, the municipalities and the mayors of the least-favoured urban areas can no longer go to Brussels to seek solidarity and aid from the European Union."
"The door is closed to them and we have lost that added value provided by the direct relationship between the European capital and the public institutions closest to the problems of the citizens."
"I have nothing against the regional authorities, which will channel the proposals and will take the decisions on the funding of the new programmes, but I believe that this a step backwards which destroys some of the freshness of the proposals born of the local bodies' intimate knowledge of the real difficulties."
"Commissioner, I would like to know your views on this."
"But I must say that it is not all going to be negative and, in this respect, we are pleased that our proposal to also introduce measures relating to energy efficiency and the diversification of renewable energy sources, as well as measures relating to climatic and environmental protection, has been accepted."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate Helmuth Markov on his constructive, extremely competent and serious presentation of the draft communication on these innovative measures under the ERDF for the period 2000-2006."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have noted very closely the ideas and suggestions which many of you have put forward and I shall come back to them shortly."
"However, I shall start with Mr Markov's report which, in many respects, mirrors, supplements and strengthens the Commission's approach and objectives, especially on two points, Mr Markov."
"The first is that we need to ensure that the poorest or less developed regions are not sidelined from technological progress and are integrated into the information economy on an equal footing."
"You yourself referred to the gap between the poor regions - between the ten poorest and the ten richest regions - but if you analyse the figures, you will be forced to see that the gaps are even wider in these regions when it comes to simple criteria such as the number of Internet connections."
"We have noted these gaps and diagnosed the risk of a digital divide, as it is referred to in the current debate raging in America, which is why, ladies and gentlemen - and I shall perhaps come back to this later - I chose to propose, on the Commission's behalf, that two out of three innovative measures, two major priorities, should be geared to this digital divide, mainly by taking account of the poorest or most remote regions."
"That is the first point on which we concur."
"The second point, which you have reiterated in your report, is that our common objective is to integrate innovative measures into a regional policy which has economic and social cohesion and sustainable development as its priorities."
"Having obtained plenary's opinion during this part-session and the views of the Member States, these guidelines are due for final adoption right at the beginning of 2001, meaning that we can start preparing regional programmes of innovative measures ready for approval and submission on 31 May 2001."
"Allow me, ladies and gentlemen, to remind you of our objectives in these guidelines."
"Compared with the priority topics which were selected and which I wanted to present personally to the Committee on Regional Policy on 11 September, I should like to remind you that these innovative measures are first and foremost a regional development instrument."
"As Mr Rack quite rightly said, I have never construed this regional policy and this cohesion policy as some sort of alms to the poorest regions and I never shall."
"We are talking solidarity here, we are clearly stating and making it clearly understood that access to new technology and to the information society is not a luxury for the richest regions and you will never stop seeing me act or hearing me voice the demand that the poorest and most remote regions - which are often one and the same - have just as much right as everyone else to join the information society on an equal footing."
"So these are the priorities."
"I repeat - as Mr Berend reminded us earlier - that the Commission hopes to use these innovative measures as experimental and good practice laboratories so that, in time, the quality of the Structural Fund programmes cofinanced by the ERDF are improved."
"That is why we selected these three priorities - technological innovation, the information society and regional identity and sustainable development - as our strategic priorities."
"Separately or combined, these issues will have a major contribution to make to regional development over coming years, especially - and I say this for a third time - for the poorest regions."
"Mr Mastorakis and Mr Nogueira have stressed this point."
"I should now like to respond in greater detail to the points touched on or raised in the draft report and in your various questions."
"First, energy efficiency."
"Mrs Schroedter or Mr Rack raised this point."
"As you know, I too am acutely aware of it."
"Do not forget that I have long been committed to ecological questions."
"I had the honour of serving as Minister of the Environment for my country and I bear this concern in mind as a priority in the measures taken under the Structural Funds."
"Energy efficiency and aspects of environmental policy have not been overlooked in the guidelines and may give rise to innovative measures relating to the third issue, which is regional identity and sustainable development."
"I would add that the European Commission, as you know, is already supporting energy efficiency through the SAVE programme and through one of the thematic programmes under the fifth framework programme for research for 1998-2002."
"In addition, the purpose of the Alterner programme is to support renewable sources of energy That is all I have to say on this point, to which I shall continue to attach a great deal of importance."
"As far as the scope of regional partnerships is concerned - Mr Bradbourn again stressed this point, and I know how tenacious he can be - we agree on the need to strengthen our links with the private sector and, beyond the private sector, with universities, research centres and non-governmental organisations."
"In this respect, the steering committee which we have planned for each programme will play a key role in stimulating cooperation and defining regional innovation strategies."
"And I also apply what I say here about partnerships on innovative measures as a reality check for these partnerships when it comes to the programming documents of the Community Support Frameworks or the Structural Funds in general."
"The third point is the need to stress the education and training opportunities which you mention in your report, Mr Markov."
"Of course, I agree that it is important to improve professional skills in Europe."
"We have taken certain aspects on board in order to help SMEs find ways of meeting their needs for staff with computing skills."
"That is why, when I am involved in negotiations - as I am currently with regard to SPDs - I take great care to check, over and above the innovative measures - and I refer here to the mainstream - that each programming document includes a regional information society access plan, and I check the quality, over and above the scope of the regional programme, especially as relates directly to SMEs, education institutes and even farm holdings."
"That is what we wanted to highlight on this point."
"However, I understand that this concern needs to be coordinated with other instruments, especially - as you suggested earlier Mr Markov - with the European Social Fund."
"I should now like to comment briefly on the disappointment which several of you have expressed, as does the report, at our approach in this programme, as proposed in this report."
"I understand your wish to maintain direct links between the European Union and regional and local players."
"That is why we have instructed the competent authorities in the regions to submit regional programmes of innovative measures."
"However, we wish projects to be selected at regional level, as Mr Berend understood in his intervention."
"Regional and local players are obviously better placed to respond to grass roots expectations and it is certainly easier for small- and medium-sized enterprises to discuss their funding requirements with regional authorities than with Brussels."
"This concern reflects that expressed by Mr Howitt."
"I am also positive that, because they are innovative, these programmes will be visible and will have an effect on the mainstream."
"I see these measures as laboratories and I am very interested in their impact and in their future as part of the mainstream within the framework of the Structural Funds."
"I fully share your interest in cooperation networks and activities between regions."
"This aspect is important and I am happy to inform you that, following your observations, we have amended and corrected the guidelines with a view to improving the potential for the regions to take part in inter-regional networks."
"Several of you voiced your concern over the financial package."
"I must be content, as must you, with the funds provided in the Berlin guidelines and the Agenda 2000 package."
"Mrs Schroedter, Mr Izquierdo Collado and Mr Ortuondo Larrea quite rightly raised the issue of financial packages."
"I must remind you that most of these measures relate to investments in intangibles and to a limited number of issues and measures."
"I am also positive that, even with these necessarily limited sums, we may still exercise a significant leverage effect and impact on all the Structural Funds programmes."
"I also share your wish to take recourse to the package of appropriations decided within the framework of Agenda 2000 in order to implement innovative measures."
"I have also taken note of your interest in the opportunities offered by the flexibility instrument."
"The Commission's response to Mr Pohjamo's question on the same subject pointed out that this package could be increased if there was felt to be a need for Community action and if the funds available, the budgetary conditions and the capacity for implementation so allowed."
"In this context, the Commission shall examine closely the possibility of taking recourse to the flexibility instrument."
"I would like to assure you, as far as the transfer number 42 000 is concerned, that this transfer will not affect my intention or the Commission's intention to earmark EUR 400 million for innovative measures under the ERDF within the terms of the regulation."
"Thank you for your suggestions."
"Thank you, Mr Markov, for an excellent report which allows us to improve and gives a better understanding of the guidelines which have been proposed to you and which we are now ready to implement, as quickly as possible, following Parliament's vote."
"May I take this opportunity to wish you a Happy Christmas and to thank you for the quality of our joint efforts throughout 2000."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I am sure the House would like to join me in wishing you too a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"World shipbuilding"
"The next item is the report (A5-0371/2000) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the second report from the Commission to the Council on the situation in world shipbuilding."
"We are now discussing our report on the situation in world shipbuilding."
"We have two documents from the Commission before us, namely the second and third reports on the situation in world shipbuilding, both of which have been presented in the past six months."
"The opinion which we unanimously adopted in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy related to the second report."
"The third report had not appeared by that time, and the Commission and the Council have subsequently reached a decision on whether the deadline for phasing out aid to shipyards can be extended beyond the scheduled date of 31 December 2000."
"To our deep regret, the Commission and the Council have not decided to extend the provision of aid to shipyards, even though the plight of the shipbuilding industry has not become any less desperate."
"This situation stems from the fact that South Korea has been employing aggressive methods and offering its vessels at dumping prices in order to increase its share of the world shipbuilding market."
"South Korea has received more than 40% of all the shipbuilding orders that have been placed in the year 2000, according to the Commission report; it has been able to do this on the basis of loans from South Korean banks, some of which are state-owned, by virtue of state guarantees which are tantamount to subsidisation."
"The prices of new ships have plummeted in recent years, reaching an all-time low in 1999 because of this policy that South Korea is pursuing."
"Europe, including Norway, only has a 16% share of the world shipbuilding market."
"Japan, with a 25% share, lies in second place behind Korea, while the rest of the entire world, including the United States, accounts for no more than 19%, and that in an industry in which labour costs have long been supplanted by technology as the main production factor."
"It is this capital-intensive structure of the industry which enables outsiders to check pricing calculations and make comparative assessments."
"We in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomed the fact that the European Commission has taken steps to have the issue resolved by means of a dispute-settlement procedure before the World Trade Organisation."
"At the request of the European shipbuilding industry, this procedure has now been initiated, as Commissioner Lamy emphasised yesterday in talks with South Korean parliamentarians in this House."
"And rightly so!"
"But despite the Agreed Minutes of 22 June 2000 on the technical issues, on accounting transparency and banking operations, there has been no sign of willingness on the part of the South Korean Government or of the shipyards and the shipbuilding industry to reach a consensus with the European Union on pricing."
"One reason for this is the fact that the 1996 framework agreement on trade and cooperation has still not been ratified by all Member States."
"The Commission's target of January 2001 can only be met, in my view, if the Republic of Korea finally demonstrates willingness in the coming weeks to stop selling ships below local cost price; to put it bluntly, it must raise its prices."
"The decision taken by the Council and the Commission to negotiate for four months without continuing the payment of aid and then, after 1 May 2001, to reconsider, on the basis of the progress achieved in these negotiations, whether there are grounds for resuming aid payments for a further period will mean that European shipyards will receive virtually no new orders in the first four months of the year 2001, at least not for the shipping categories in which competition is fiercest."
"Even in our own area of specialisation - the construction of cruise ships - the South Koreans are able to offer ships below the prevailing international market price."
"That is why, in this report and the three additional motions on the table, we have called on the Commission to intensify its efforts to ensure that an international dispute-settlement procedure is initiated before the WTO."
"But we are also calling for a two-year extension of aid to shipyards in order to ensure that a major industry in the European Union is not wiped out by state-aided Korean dumping practices."
"If the aid arrangements are not extended - and we are not talking here about EU aid, as you know, but national aid, which the Union need only approve - then we shall have to think about the fact that the European shipbuilding industry has already reduced its capacity and that the present limits will then have to fall still further."
"These are the main demands we make in this report, and I thank my committee colleagues for their unanimous support."
"I ask for your support again tomorrow morning when the House votes on the report, and I urge the Commission not to abandon the shipbuilding industry and those who work in it."
"At least 10 000 jobs are at stake, with the United Kingdom poised to bear the brunt of the cuts."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mr Langen, on his excellent report which, as he says, was carried through the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, unanimously."
"I concur with his observation that we must take account of the third report that the Commission has drawn up on world shipbuilding."
"I hope that the timing of the presentation of that report to Parliament was not a ploy to encourage us to take this item off the agenda."
"The committee had to vote especially to ensure that this item was on the agenda for debate today."
"I am grateful that the Commissioner is here, and I hope he takes note of all the points made."
"There is clear evidence of a crisis in the EU shipbuilding industry and this has been the case for some time."
"The evidence is set out very effectively in the Commission report."
"The conclusions seem quite clear that the principal culprit is predatory pricing from the Korean shipbuilding industry."
"It is doing this to gain market share to our detriment, but not only to the detriment of the European Union industry."
"Other countries - Japan for one - are also suffering from this."
"Action clearly must be taken."
"It seems to me that the Commissioner must show the industry that he is doing all he can in this context to deal with this external threat to our industry."
"The trade-barrier regulation route is perhaps an incomplete or insufficient instrument for taking action: there has to be more bilateral pressure from the European Union on Korea to press it to come up with solutions, such as pricing its ships properly and fully."
"In the third report there is a list of actions proposed by the Commission but its observations are rather disappointing: to continue with monitoring, to examine industry's complaint, to remain open to eventual proposals, to pursue efforts, to continue to encourage, to continue to work closely with the industry or to examine the possibilities of measures."
"I submit that we need more than just examining possibilities and monitoring the industry situation around the world and in Europe."
"In that context, it is important that the Commission reconsiders the view about extending the time period for temporary support or for permitting temporary support for shipbuilding industries in the European Union until a solution is forthcoming in talks with Korea."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I say, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that it gives us some satisfaction to see the Commission and the Council finally recognise what we have been repeating for years and especially over recent months: first that, in shipbuilding, Europe has set itself more constraints more quickly than its main competitors and, secondly and more importantly, that South Korea is guilty of blatantly infringing the rules of competition with its outrageous financial dumping."
"That is why we welcomed the Commission's recent efforts, even if I do take issue with the calculation methods used to show very high levels of European aid in chapter 5 of the Council report of 5 December."
"Due to a lack of time today, I shall explain myself directly to the Commissioner in writing on this point."
"More importantly, we have also taken note of the Council's conclusions of 5 December, a Council which agreed to safeguard the future by standing its ground with South Korea and not dismissing the possibility of reintroducing shipbuilding aid in May for the specific market segments hardest hit by Korean competition."
"This approach is also in line with the Treaty, although I do not have time to go into this in greater detail."
"Another positive outcome from the Council meeting was that the 'ships arrangement' for export credits dating from 1981 was updated at the SBT."
"Finally, we were interested to note the Council's willingness to consider aid for research and development."
"This point is very important to some enterprises, to enterprises which are, in fact, highly innovative."
"What we are calling for, what I am calling for today is the full and - more importantly - the immediate application of the Council's conclusions."
"If it should prove necessary to re-introduce aid in May 2001, we must do so without delay."
"We are also worried about the sixth framework programme for research and development: the 'marine technology' line in the fifth programme appears to have disappeared in the draft programme."
"I personally find this unacceptable; it should be reinstated in terms of quantity and in terms of the method for using these appropriations so as to simplify them."
"Finally, as from 18 December, we are, of course, counting on the 'ships arrangement' being examined at the OECD Group 6 meeting."
"I shall finish by congratulating Mr Langen - I appreciate his support for workers and for the need for state intervention in order to defend the economy - and by advising the Commission to make good use, in the future, of the lesson which it has been given in shipbuilding and in the shameless competition of certain countries of the world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Langen for preparing this report on what is a difficult subject."
"As the report states, important restructuring of the shipbuilding industry has come about by adjusting quantity and quality."
"Shipbuilding, however, is still in a serious crisis, as a result of dumping by the Koreans."
"We must attend to the competitiveness of European shipbuilding by creating equal opportunities for shipyards on the world market."
"Improvements to the competitiveness of shipyards must be extended with the help of internal measures and agreement procedures."
"Operating aid has not, however, solved the problems of the shipyard industry."
"Shipbuilding is a sector that demands high technology and whose competitiveness can be improved through cooperation with a view to specialisation, as well as through continued technological development, research and development."
"Neither will operating aid, not even specifically-channelled aid, solve the Korea problem: that has to be firmly dealt with by means of trade policy, for example."
"Mr President, Mr Langen' s report deals with numerous issues but, nevertheless, here the speakers are naturally focusing on the issue of whether or not to have an extension of subsidies and on the unfair competition on the part of Korea."
"Those of us who live in a region such as Asturias, which has suffered four significant cases of restructuring - in mining, in steel, in shipbuilding and in weapons manufacturing - believe that cutting these subsidies, even until May to see whether Korea is condemned by the World Trade Organisation, is very dangerous for the sector."
"It is true that Europe is suffering from unfair competition because in Korea, above all, very low salaries are paid and workers are forced to endure abysmal working conditions and, under these circumstances, European workers have no way of competing with them."
"However, the Commission' s proposal, which includes aid for research and development, the condemnation of what is happening in Korea to the World Trade Organisation - since they are working with prices which are even below cost - and the possibility that there be transitional aid measures until the case is settled, seems to us to be perhaps a rather weak solution, but at least it is a solution."
"In any event, it seems to me, Mr President, that if we cut off subsidies and if the unfair Korean competition continues, the European shipbuilding industry will be fatally wounded."
"And I do not believe that we are exaggerating because the different workers' groups have been claiming that over recent years thousands and thousands of jobs have been lost as a result of the restructuring of the shipbuilding industry."
"I believe that there are various countries such as Spain, Germany, Italy, Greece and Portugal which, within the Council, and despite the final decision, have asked that aid be continued, and we feel that this aid should be continued in one way or another if we do not wish, once again, to lose thousands of jobs in shipbuilding."
"Mr President, it seems to have become an end-of-year tradition to hold a debate on the situation in the shipbuilding industry."
"In terms of merchant shipping, there is still a subsidy race being held at world level."
"This is at the expense of shipyards in the EU Member States, as well as yards based in Norway, Japan and the United States."
"We are in complete agreement on this: the subsidy race should end as soon as possible."
"However, it looks very much as if the goal posts are being moved each time, so that we will never reach the finishing line."
"The Commission and Parliament' s criticism is levelled at Korea because it still provides by far the highest subsidies to shipyards, with painful consequences for yards in European countries and Japan."
"But nearly everyone knows that within the European Union too, there are large discrepancies in terms of subsidy level per order."
"On paper, the highest level of support per order amounts to three and a half times the lowest level, but in practice, it appears that a number of EU Member States are giving extra hand-outs to their maritime industry in a non-transparent manner."
"Moreover, Article 7 of Regulation No 1540 from 1998 is still in force."
"This provision contributes in its own way to the unequal growth in support levels."
"This leads to sound, efficient yards being punished, whilst inefficient ones are given an injection of money."
"If we provide extra funding to the weaker European yards at the expense of the stronger ones, how can we survive Korean and - no doubt soon to follow suit - Chinese subsidisation of their shipyards in the long run?"
"This is a question from which the Commissioner cannot run away."
"I therefore urge the Commission and MEPs not only to point the finger at Korea, but also to examine the situation on their own home turf."
"Why does the Commission not institute an inquiry into the actual subsidy level per order within the European Union?"
"Where is the proposal to abolish all kinds of non-transparent support schemes in relation to research and development, environmental and regional support policy?"
"If there is no level playing field in the shipbuilding sector within the European Union, how can we expect to fight competition from Korea and elsewhere?"
"I share the rapporteur' s view that, as long as Korea does not act pursuant to the WTO provisions, it is justifiable to provide yards standard support for each order as an emergency measure."
"This transparent form of support discourages European yards from applying all kinds of reduction or marketing methods which do not conform to the market."
"At the same time, pressure on Korea must be stepped up, and we must involve the OECD if necessary, by taking anti-dumping measures."
"These will preferably be measures which hit conglomerates such as Hyundai and Daewoo where it hurts, at which point we will have a chance of breaking down the closed Korean front."
"I would like to thank Mr Langen for his work and hope that we do not have a re-run of the same debate at the end of next year."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Langen on the sound report which he has produced on the issue of shipbuilders."
"I would like to remind you that the issue we are dealing with today is an old one. It has been a recurrent theme."
"Specifically, it is now more than two years since we condemned the unfair practices which essentially take place in South East Asia, and which affect our shipbuilding industry."
"In recent weeks, the Commission has told us that the system of subsidies, thanks to which our industry is subsisting, must be removed as from January as a result of a supposed improvement in competitiveness."
"On the other hand, after more than two years of ferocious unfair competition on the part of Korea, the Commission has decided, after receiving a formal complaint from all our shipbuilders, to take the case to the World Trade Organisation."
"As you all know, it will take more than six months to carry out this procedure."
"Furthermore, if successful, the creation of a group of experts within that organisation will mean that it will take at least two years."
"In the meantime, it is intended that what remains of our shipbuilding industry will subsist thanks to a package of aid to research and development, which will enter into force in January, as Commissioner Monti pointed out yesterday afternoon."
"We have held a meeting with him, in which I asked him a series of questions."
"It can be deduced from the conclusions of the meeting that the aid received by our industry has not resolved the problem of Korea."
"I pointed out to him that the European shipbuilding industry is unprotected."
"He then said that after 2 December an investigation would perhaps be opened, and that after that investigation we would have to wait and see what happened, etc."
"I believe that the honest ones, the Europeans, are being left to fend for themselves."
"Meanwhile, the pirates, to put it in realistic, if pejorative, terms, have the advantage within this competitive world."
"It is we who play by the rules and it is we who end up losing."
"I, for example, am from the Basque Country, and I live close to Bilbao."
"There, these days, what were once shipyards are now concert halls, maritime museums etc. In these shipyards, 4 000 people once worked, and now just a couple of doormen work in each place, and that is what is happening in the European countries."
"That is, while we are enduring unemployment, the Koreans are doing good business in their shipyards."
"Both the author of this report and the authors of the proposed amendments belong to political schools which put the market economy before all else and cry excessive state intervention whenever it comes to supporting public services or giving workers some sort of social protection."
"But as soon as the capitalist groups whose interests they defend are in trouble on the markets, they call for governments or the European institutions to intervene, subsidise and protect the sector under threat."
"Alstom-Atlantique, which has just landed a contract to build a luxury liner, will collect the equivalent of 9% of the contract price in subsidies."
"In other words, the state is paying a large chunk, if not all of the company's profits."
"Meanwhile, the British company Harland and Wolff, from which Alstom pinched the contract, is blaming its government for failing to back it sufficiently."
"When big trusts and their political advocates call for less state interference, what they mean is that the state and its money should be solely at their disposal."
"For my part, I am against all forms of subsidy for private firms and in favour of governments using the money saved to create jobs directly, especially in the public services and, more to the point, without generating private profit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures that have been taken and the position adopted by the Commission on the European shipbuilding industry do not, in my opinion, reflect the serious and indeed critical nature of the situation in that industry, and the same applies to the transactions and outcome of the meeting of industry ministers on 5 December."
"May I remind the House that the results of what has been a highly successful adjustment process are now being put at risk."
"We have had a process of quantitative adjustment, in which capacities have been reduced."
"We have had a process of qualitative adjustment, involving modernisation, the introduction of state-of-the-art technology and high productivity, and I can assure you, Commissioner, that shipyards are one of the areas where advanced technology is of the essence, not only information technology and related domains but production technology too."
"In short, a generally successful process is now being placed in extreme jeopardy."
"I also wish to remind you that many of our shipyards are in remote regions with structural weaknesses - regions that are undergoing radical adjustment processes."
"Shipbuilding is often the key industry in such regions."
"The process has not yet been completed, and the situation remains delicate."
"Insufficient progress has been made towards diversification; consistent adherence to the present course is essential."
"The line being followed by the Commission can only be detrimental to the shipyards of Europe."
"Further investigations are planned, but not until next year."
"So is the situation insufficiently clear?"
"Have there not been enough detailed analyses?"
"Have visits not been paid to Korea?"
"Has the Commission not received unsatisfactory information?"
"Is the present situation really so shrouded in mystery that we have to wait until May 2001 for a more detailed review?"
"The Commission knowingly tolerates the exposure of the shipyards in the European Union to unfair competition for almost six months."
"This brings additional pressures and dangers to a situation that is already complicated."
"It will inevitably push individual companies over the edge."
"Allow me to make one final remark. It is surely the height of inconsistency to proclaim such dedication to free external trade that we are even prepared to tolerate an unfair partner and yet, at the same time, to maintain internal restrictions on competition such as the artificial ceiling on our shipbuilding capacity."
"Our internal and external policies are clearly at odds with each other, and this must be corrected."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Langen on the quality of his report."
"I feel that he has produced an excellent X-ray of the shipbuilding industry in Europe, a true X-ray."
"And a summary would be that the shipbuilding industry is being threatened from all sides."
"There is a crisis in the fishing industry, and we Spaniards and Galicians know that only too well."
"Furthermore, we have flags of convenience in the merchant navy, and ships flying Community flags are being built, or are in danger of being built, outside Europe."
"And that is due to the fact that we are incapable of condemning a situation of unfair competition."
"It has been said already here; Korea, Japan, or the threat of China are involved."
"Mr President, I therefore wonder whether the European Union is opting for a shipbuilding industry which is strong, dynamic and competitive."
"Of course, the shipbuilding industry also has to achieve the objectives of the European Union, specifically the rationalisation of the industry, an increase in productivity, an improvement in the competitiveness of the existing shipyards and the defence of the environment."
"But in order to achieve that, so that the process may consolidate the shipbuilding industry and its jobs and calm the fears of the families which depend on it, aid will still be necessary beyond 31 December 2000, because the market situation is not one of equality, but of unfairness and of dumping."
"We expect decisions from the Commission and the Council which are profoundly political, courageous and decisive, and which, in cases such as Spain, allow the integration of civil and military shipbuilding, and reassign the different areas of the industry in accordance with the needs of each country."
"It is necessary to provide new stimulus in terms of a sufficient quantity of research and development and also to maintain the operating aid in a way that is legally possible."
"Our shipyards can survive, but support is necessary and, in the European context, now is the time to appeal to the solidarity and understanding of the countries which do not have shipyards and for which, in many cases, the sea, and its shipbuilding industry, perhaps have less importance."
"Finally, we have to make decisions which will allow us to confirm and maintain a strong position for the European shipbuilding sector."
"It will be of little use to us to pursue an objective if, in pursuit of it, shipyards disappear in Europe, suffocating on the way."
"The example not to follow would be that of Buridan' s ass which, while trying to decide whether to eat rye or barley, ended up dying as a result of its doubts."
"I therefore call for the defence of the sector, combining the objectives demanded by the European Union with the survival of the industry, making it stronger, more dynamic and more competitive, thereby creating jobs and wealth."
"Mr President, I thank you for the opportunity to update Parliament on the market situation in world shipbuilding and on the conclusions of the Council last week."
"I want to thank Mr Langen for his report."
"Although the report refers to the Commission's second shipbuilding report of May 2000, it has been noted here that the third report was done by mid-November and I limit my comments to that third report in this delicate issue."
"The market analysis contained in the third report does not indicate improvement in the market situation."
"South Korea has continuously increased its market share, both to the detriment of the Japanese and EU yards, and despite strenuous efforts by the Commission, including contacts at the highest level, the bilateral negotiations with the government of South Korea have not yielded concrete results that could remedy the market situation."
"This is despite the conclusions of accurate minutes in June which pointed to the way forward."
"As a result of this failure, a complaint by industry under the trade barrier regulation has been launched in October this year and Commissioner Lamy announced on 4 December the Commission's decision to open an investigation."
"This process will not give quick results and if it goes to its ultimate conclusion, it will take up to two years."
"Under Regulation No 1540/98, the Commission is obliged to propose measures."
"In reality, there are limited instruments available to the Commission and Member States in order to defend the EU shipbuilding industry."
"The potential of trade principles has not yet been seen and their effectiveness needs to be proved."
"Discussions in the OECD have made little progress, very little progress, and the possibility of an internationally binding agreement on shipbuilding seems remote."
"The IMF is also cautious on the issue of Korean shipbuilding, as it sees itself as dealing only with macroeconomic conditions rather than with sectoral problems."
"Improving competitiveness of the EU yards is encouraged by the Commission but, in the face of massive price undercutting by Korean yards, the achievable progress in productivity is not sufficient."
"Nevertheless, all the available instruments should be used better, including aids for research and development."
"In the light of these factual elements, the Commission concluded at its meeting of 29 November that if the Commission does not achieve a satisfactory negotiated solution with Korea in the framework of the TBR procedure, the Commission will report to the Council by 1 May next year and will propose to bring the case to the WTO."
"In addition, and importantly, the Commission will, at the same time, propose a defensive temporary support mechanism designed to counter the unfair Korean practices."
"The Commission is also ready to explore the possibilities of greater use of national support for research and development and it is noted that the general operating aids will expire after 31 December 2000."
"I would like to explain the rationale behind the position adopted by the Commission."
"The Commission believes that the Community should seek to strengthen its negotiating position vis-√†-vis Korea by providing an incentive to reach a rapid agreement that would resolve the current problems."
"This is why the Commission decided on a defensive temporary support mechanism designed to counter the unfair Korean practices."
"This would be proposed if a satisfactory agreement with Korea cannot be achieved during the course of the investigation procedure under the trade barriers regulation."
"The mechanisms would apply until the outcome of that WTO procedure is decided."
"The details of the mechanisms will need to be further elaborated."
"They would be limited to those market segments where it has been demonstrated that EU industry has been directly injured by unfair Korean practices."
"On the question of research and development in the shipbuilding sector, the Commission concluded that in addition to the substantial Community funding available under research framework programmes which provide EUR 130 m in five years, the possibility of improving the aids allowed for this purpose should be explored."
"Industry should seriously reflect about how these instruments can be used to adapt their activities in a way which will ensure the future of the sector on a lasting basis."
"The Industry Council of 5 December this year discussed at length the shipbuilding issue based on the Commission's third report and its decision of 29 November 2000."
"It requested the Commission to continue with its market monitoring, to follow up closely on the TBR case with a view to bring the problem to the WTO if required and to address the issue in all relevant international fora."
"The Council also took note of the Commission's initiative to propose a temporary support mechanism for EU shipbuilding in case no progress is made with Korea by 1 May 2001."
"The Council emphasised that such a support mechanism must not distort competition inside the EU."
"The Commission will be reporting on this situation again in April and, of course, we are also available in the European Parliament."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.25 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I simply wished to inform the House that this very morning the Popular Party Councillor, Francisco Cano, was murdered in the town of Villadecavalls, in the province of Barcelona."
"Francisco Cano was 45 years old, married with two daughters and was an electrician by trade."
"He was a worker and, like those who accompanied us yesterday when we awarded the Sakharov Prize, he was a private citizen who served the democratic system which the Spanish have chosen."
"I am sure that we are all now united in our vigorous and forthright defence of freedom in Europe, but I wish to say that, more than the solidarity of the Members of the European Parliament, we in Spain need their commitment."
"I would like to ask you if you agree to our holding a minute' s silence in memory of Francisco Cano."
"I do not think there is any need to add anything to what Mr Galeote has just said other than to assure him of our support and solidarity and I agree that, in future, we need to look at ways in which we can perhaps assist our colleagues in Spain."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"British submarine at Gibraltar"
"The next item is the joint debate on four oral questions to the Commission on the British nuclear submarine at Gibraltar."
"Mr President, Commissioner, please bring some order here, if you can. I believe that you can."
"The presence of a broken down nuclear submarine in the waters of the Bay of Algeciras has now unfortunately become a diplomatic conflict between a colonial and nuclear military power and a second category Member State, according to the latest classification in Nice, which does not demand its rights and gives in to infantile explanations."
"Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty is not being complied with, nor are important directives on radioactive protection, and you, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, know this and merely look the other way."
"It seems that you do not want internal conflicts, so why sign Treaties?"
"Where, here and now, is the Charter of Fundamental Rights for the citizens of Gibraltar and Algeciras and the Andalusians of the area?"
"Have you received the general information relating to the evacuation plan of the British authorities, which they are obliged to produce?"
"The plan should include the evacuation and the possibility of an accident which contaminates another Member State, a possible cross-border contamination."
"You know this."
"What are you doing?"
"Have you replied to the complaint of the Association of Municipalities of Campo de Gibraltar?"
"When is the Committee on Petitions going to reply to a communication presented and signed by more than 35 associations - collectives, unions and municipalities - from the area?"
"Let us forget about the yellow submarine and other tomfoolery, which has no place here."
"This is now real."
"Let us be serious."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your initial jeers, when I condemned this case on 5 July, and your laughter, have simply increased the desire of the Andalusian people to be respected and not to be humiliated with shameful explanations and to be obliged to endure an unnecessary situation of risk."
"Finally, do not allow the repair of this submarine in an inappropriate base."
"Ask and demand that it be removed when the technical and climatic conditions allow it."
"Commissioners, do not allow our gorgeous bay to become nothing but a workshop for nuclear junk."
"Mr President, I will naturally begin by reiterating our solidarity with the Members from the Popular Party, while at the same time - although I find it difficult to say - pointing out that our democratic response today in the face of this latest murder should be to overcome our grief and continue working in this House, as we are at the moment."
"Once upon a time there was a British nuclear submarine called the Tireless."
"While sailing through Sicilian waters, back in the month of May, its nuclear heart showed worrying signs of deterioration."
"Those in charge of the submarine tried to have it admitted into a hospital, classified as suitable for providing treatment, of which they were coproprietors, at that time a NATO base."
"But the director of the hospital did not authorise the admission."
"The submarine sailed on, infecting the waters of the Mediterranean on the way, until it arrived at an agreed hospital called Gibraltar."
"There, showing themselves to be fully in charge, they parked it."
"In order that it might be admitted, they said that the illness was not serious."
"When, by means of the medical dispatch which they distributed in the country where the owner lived - that is, by means of the British press - it was discovered that the illness was serious, instead of changing hospitals, they changed the classification of the hospital."
"A patient was admitted to a first aid centre and, when it was discovered that it did not have flu, but a serious illness, a painter was employed to change the sign on the door and put 'Hospital' where before it had said 'Health Centre' ."
"However, that strategy was not enough to prevent all the patients and their families from finding out that they had admitted an infectious patient and from knowing that there was a risk of catching the disease."
"Then the lies and manoeuvrings began: the lies - or silences - of the person who had admitted it and the lies and silences of the person in charge of health in the area."
"Because, while the owner of the submarine told us something different every day, the person in charge of health in the area did whatever he wanted."
"He even told us jokes about the yellow submarine or about jurisdiction in the area."
"To top it all, it was at that time that the population most directly affected discovered that, some time before, that same country which owned the submarine had, for ten years, deceived all Europeans about mad cow disease."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this situation cannot be allowed to continue."
"Citizens' associations, social organisations, local authorities and autonomous communities have asked both this Parliament' s Committee on Petitions and the Commission to intervene and protect them."
"Europe and its institutions cannot remain on the outside."
"There is considerable and understandable alarm, the consequence of a perverse double combination of stubbornness and incompetence: The stubbornness of those people who refuse to alter their initial position and the incompetence of those who are unable to vigorously defend the health and safety of hundreds of thousands of European citizens who live in the area."
"I am not being alarmist."
"It would be alarming if we failed to act immediately in this situation."
"Every day there are statements to the effect that there are reasons not to authorise the repair of the Tireless in Gibraltar."
"Let us not wait any longer."
"Let us accept the situation once and for all and take the submarine, with every possible safeguard, to a British port which fulfils the requirements for its repair, before it is too late; before the Tireless ends up wearing all of us citizens and Europeans out."
"Mr President, with regard to the repair of the British submarine Tireless in Gibraltar, we should remember what we want from the Commission."
"What the various parliamentary Groups have expressed in their questions is that we want the Commission to inform us about their representations to the Government of the United Kingdom with a view to ensuring compliance with the obligations contained in the legislation in force and, secondly, to inform us about its initiatives on this issue, in accordance with the powers attributed to it, where relevant, by the Euratom Treaty."
"Of course, we await the Commission' s reply with great interest, in order to see whether the objective has been fulfilled."
"We do not doubt the Commission' s good intentions, but we all hope that we do not have to regret ending this debate with the same information with which we started it."
"There is no doubt that very diverse interests are at play in this debate - and this is also the case within my Group."
"However, we have made an effort to achieve dialogue and mutual understanding, which I believe could allow us to broaden this consensus on the basic issues to a majority in this House."
"Furthermore, that is what can be deduced from a careful reading of the motions for resolutions of the Socialist and European People' s Party/European Democrat Groups."
"In both, I truly believe that we agree on the essential issues."
"In both, we express our understanding of the natural concern of the local population."
"In both, we ask for the greatest degree of transparency, in order not to promote unfounded fears."
"In both, we ask the Commission to examine the possibilities contained in the current Treaties to ascertain what opportunities it has to contribute to this issue."
"In both, we express the need for the two Member States involved, the United Kingdom and Spain, to work together closely to find a safer solution for the repair of the submarine, while keeping the public fully up-to-date, of course."
"If, in the light of the texts presented, we agree on this - and this is a lot - I wonder why we have not been able to produce a joint motion for a resolution."
"I can assure you that it was not due to a lack of will on the part of my Group."
"The fact that the Socialist Group presented an urgent motion for a resolution in the last plenary session; that it then voted in favour of a proposal from my Group to remove that point of order; the fact that it did not attend a meeting called by all groups to try to produce a consensus text; and that then the main signatory of the Socialist resolution and various others also signed the joint motion for a resolution of the Green and United Left Groups, no doubt sends us all into confusion."
"And what is the Socialist Group going to vote for now?"
"That is anyone' s guess."
"I would modestly like to suggest that they vote for our motion for a resolution."
"And I would humbly like to advise my Spanish Socialist compatriots to be guided by the general interest."
"Mr President, I would also like to start by offering my condolences to the family of the murdered councillor and to the Members from the Popular Party, and I wish to reject this fascist barbarity of ETA and of the groups which support it."
"I would like to stress the warranted importance of the pact against terrorism agreed between the Popular Party and the Socialist Party, and I believe it is important that, from the European Union' s point of view, progress is made in this direction."
"With regard to the issue we are dealing with - the anomalous situation of the British submarine Tireless in the only British colony in the Mediterranean, Gibraltar - on 7 September I asked an oral question about it."
"In this, I pointed out that the fault with the submarine which, since 12 May, had been in Sicilian waters, could not be repaired in the port of Gibraltar, since the Italian and NATO authorities had refused to receive the submarine in its ports."
"In that intervention I also pointed out the lack of seriousness and respect shown by the British authorities in reclassifying the role of the port of Gibraltar, moving it in the best colonial fashion from category Z to X for the purposes of being able to carry out repairs."
"I also pointed out the alarm amongst the 200 000 people who live in the area, within a radius of 10 kilometres."
"The evasive response that I received from the Commission on that occasion forced me to ask a second question, on 21 September, urging the Commission to ask the British Government to remove the Tireless to a British port, and also to monitor this issue."
"The reply received from the Commission was disappointing and unsatisfactory."
"I hope that that feeling of dissatisfaction with the reply has nothing to do with the fact that Commissioner Patten is British, but, on the other hand, on the most important issue - the repair of the submarine in a European Union port which does not meet the minimum requirements - he said that this was an internal issue for the United Kingdom, when, according to the Euratom Treaty, this is not the case; and, on the other hand, he simply said that he would keep Parliament informed."
"Nevertheless, since that moment the European Parliament has received no information from the Commission, despite the fact that it has promised to provide it."
"So, over these months, we have been on a wild goose chase."
"We have had statements from the responsible parties in the British army to the effect that the fault was not significant, and others saying the complete opposite, that it was serious and required long and difficult repairs."
"We have heard statements from the Spanish Government to the effect that there was no cause for alarm, and others, recent ones fortunately, from Minister Piqu√©, urging that the submarine be taken away as soon as possible - although they have given a time period of three months - so that it may be repaired in the United Kingdom."
"After visits to the submarine by Spanish nuclear safety experts, we have heard that there is no danger, but we have had later statements indicating that they were not allowed to see, observe or inspect the actual site of the fault."
"For all these reasons, I believe the Commission must be aware of what an anomalous situation we are dealing with and that, firstly, it must demand an immediate halt to any repairs taking place in Gibraltar."
"Secondly, it must demand that all possible information be given to the population, as laid down in the Euratom Treaty."
"Thirdly, I believe that the British Government should be taken to task for the irresponsibility and flippancy it showed in carrying out this reclassification, so that the port of Gibraltar may return to its original category."
"I also believe that the submarine Tireless should be taken to Great Britain to be repaired as soon as possible, as soon as the weather conditions are suitable."
"I believe that we can reach the conclusion that there is general alarm about this type of atomic submarine in all the countries of the European Union and throughout the whole world and, therefore, I believe we should recommend that this type of nuclear submarine disappear from the map and from the oceans."
"I would also like to point out, given that the Commission has been so ineffective, that a delegation of experts should be sent to view the situation on the ground, since so far we cannot have confidence in what the government has done."
"Lastly, I believe that the British Government should compensate the area economically, since there have been losses in terms of tourism and fishing for which the British Government is responsible."
"Mr President, first I would like to associate myself and the Commission wholeheartedly with the moving remarks made by the honourable gentleman, Mr Galeote Quecedo at the outset of this session."
"I would like, as well, to salute the courage of all those in Spain like Basta Ya and those involved in the democratic process who resist terrorism in all its cowardly and vicious forms."
"I was here yesterday during the presentation of the Sakharov Prize to listen to Basta Ya."
"I agreed entirely with everything that was said yesterday and I too would like to offer my condolences to the family and friends of the murdered democratically-elected official."
"I have had some experience of dealing with terrorism myself in another environment and I very strongly support those who resist terrorism."
"I am grateful to the honourable Members for their questions to which I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m."
"She regrets that she cannot be here to answer the questions in person because she is engaged in meetings in Brussels to prepare for next week's important ministerial meeting on climate change."
"I know the House recognises that she would have been here if possible and it falls to me to answer in her stead."
"I just want to say one thing to the honourable Member who spoke a moment or two ago."
"When I became a Commissioner I swore an oath to be completely independent in the performance of my duties in the general interest of the Communities, to neither seek nor take instructions from any government or from any other body in the performance of my duties."
"I would not take an oath lightly."
"Honourable Members have asked a number of questions relating to the presence of the British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless in Gibraltar for repairs to her nuclear reactor."
"I know the Commission knows how concerned they are about this issue and I hope that this debate is heard and read elsewhere."
"Honourable Members have asked whether the Commission considers that Directives 89/618/Euratom, on informing the public in the event of radiological emergency, and 96/29/Euratom on basic safety standards, apply in relation to the submarine and what steps have been taken accordingly."
"Honourable Members have also asked a question concerning Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty in relation to the presence of the submarine in Gibraltar and, naturally, I have carefully read the terms of the joint motion for a resolution."
"I want to make a few remarks now and since this is an extremely important debate and important issues will be raised, I hope that I will be able to intervene again briefly at the end of the debate to pick up any points which have not been resolved."
"I can confirm that the issue to which honourable Members refer has indeed been the subject of complaints to the Commission and I will come back and talk about those complaints at the end of my remarks."
"Let me set out the position under the Euratom Treaty."
"Chapter III of the Euratom Treaty headed ""Health and Safety"" is the legal basis for the three directives that are potentially relevant, Directive 89/618/Euratom on informing the public in the event of radiological emergency, Directive 96/29/Euratom on basic safety standards and Directive 92/3/Euratom on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste."
"Article 37 of Chapter III concerns plans for the disposal of radioactive waste."
"The procedure under Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty relates to the submission of plans for the disposal of radioactive waste so as to enable the Commission to determine whether the implementation of such a plan is liable to result in the radioactive contamination of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State."
"The Commission has taken the following action entirely in line with its legal competences."
"A letter was sent by the Commission to the British authorities on 10 October 2000. This requested information on: firstly, the existence of an intervention plan for the area of Gibraltar and for the Port of Gibraltar under the terms of Article 50 of Directive 96/29/Euratom; secondly, measures taken to inform the public in the event of a radiological emergency in connection with the repairs being carried out to the submarine in the Port of Gibraltar; thirdly, whether these measures take into account the possible impact on Spanish territory; fourthly, whether there are any plans for shipment of radioactive waste resulting from the repair of the submarine from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom."
"The United Kingdom authorities replied by letter on 14 November and 1 December."
"These replies are currently under technical and legal assessment by the Commission's experts but, at this stage, the Commission can give the following information."
"In reply to whether an intervention plan exists for the area of Gibraltar and the port of Gibraltar, the British authorities have drawn the Commission's attention to the existence of the Gibraltar public safety scheme, known as ""Gibpubsafe"", which is the intervention plan for Gibraltar."
"The Commission is analysing this plan."
"The British authorities state that Gibpubsafe provides background information and guidance on action to be taken in the event of a nuclear accident in Gibraltar."
"The intervention plan is ""drawn up by the interested parties, which include the British Ministry of Defence, the Gibraltar Government and the emergency services and is issued by the Chief Officer, Gibraltar City Fire Brigade, and the Commander of British Forces, on behalf of the Gibraltar Local Liaison Committee."""
"Gibpubsafe is apparently a public document and is freely available in the Gibraltar Public Library - but I will come back to that in a moment."
"The British authorities state that there will be no shipment of radioactive waste that will transit through any other Member State; they also state that they are in regular contact with the Spanish authorities."
"Honourable Members also asked if the port of Gibraltar meets the technical conditions needed for the repair of nuclear submarines."
"The Euratom Treaty does not enable the Commission to offer any judgement on the United Kingdom's decision in that regard."
"That is a matter for the UK authorities."
"(Protests from Ms Izquierdo Rojo) I state what is the law."
"With regard to Article 37, the honourable Member can work to change the law and change the Treaty."
"I am telling her what I and my colleague Mr Wallstr√∂m are legally advised is the position under the directives and Treaties."
"If she is a better lawyer than them, then I look forward to hearing from her."
"With regard to Article 37, then, due to the fact that a submarine is concerned for the first time, further assessment of the general applicability of Article 37 to such cases is being carried out by the Commission's services."
"It is clear, however, that Article 37 relates to the disposal of radioactive waste in general."
"The Community competence does not require general data to be submitted for the specific repair operations being undertaken."
"I again stress that every word I am delivering in this Chamber is what I am told by our legal advisers."
"I have made it absolutely clear that we have to base our response to the legitimate concerns raised with us on the basis of Community competence."
"Pursuing Community competence, we have received a letter from the UK authorities in response to a letter of our own to which I referred earlier."
"Under the usual complaints procedure, we are not entitled to make this reply public, although we can say broadly what it says."
"What I am doing and saying about public access to documents is, as the House will know, entirely within the rules on public access, when there has been a complaint and when there may be, as a result of the complaint, infraction proceedings."
"Under the usual complaints procedure, as I have said, we cannot make the reply public - although we can say, as I have, what, broadly speaking, is in the reply."
"Now I want to go beyond the legal."
"Speaking personally, I would encourage the British Government to make that reply public."
"I want to underline that point."
"As I mentioned, the reply makes reference to the nuclear intervention plan for Gibraltar."
"This is a public document available in the Gibraltar Public Library."
"I therefore asked my office last night to contact the Chief Secretary's office in Gibraltar to ask for a copy."
"I have a copy here and I am happy to provide it to the House straight away."
"I will respond again at the end of the debate, if I may."
"I am sorry for taking rather longer than my allotted time, but it is an important subject."
"I just want to say one final word about the complaints so that Parliament knows exactly what the situation is."
"We have received four complaints so far."
"The first two have been registered with the Secretary-General, and the first reply has been sent."
"The last two complaints have only been received in the last few days and have been sent to the Secretary-General for registration."
"When the information in those complaints has been assessed by Commission officials and when more information has been sought and obtained from the United Kingdom, we will reply substantively to those complaints."
"I repeat that the information which we are able to make available on that process will be as is set out in the existing code on the public access to documents."
"I want to repeat again that the more information that is provided by the British Government on this issue, the better."
"Thank you, Commissioner, in particular for your opening remarks and the clarity of your response."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first may I also associate myself strongly with the remarks made by my colleague, Mr Galeote, with regard to terrorism."
"I too have had some experience of that in another place."
"The first point I would like to make is that the repairs to the cooling system of this submarine are already under way."
"It is already happening, so let us be realistic about what options face the UK and Gibraltar authorities in dealing with it."
"Let us please be realistic about the notion of lifting this submarine, waiting for weather conditions to be favourable and somehow transporting it back to the UK."
"It needs to be repaired in situ."
"You have just heard the Commissioner say that defence issues in general, and in particular nuclear defence issues, are a matter for national sovereignty, not for this Parliament, but that the concerns of the public in Gibraltar and the adjoining areas are a natural and legitimate cause for debate in this Parliament."
"One might well ask whether the government of the United Kingdom has exercised its responsibility in that regard to keep its defence equipment properly maintained, and indeed whether people in the UK are aware that, because of this incident, and the withdrawal of other nuclear submarines, our shores are currently being defended - rumour has it - by a U-boat from Germany."
"I think it is very important to keep this matter in proportion and to avoid crying wolf with alarmist statements which are not supported by the facts."
"This is a technical problem with a technical solution and the sooner the repair is completed, the better it will be for all."
"Mr President, I would like to join with the condolences which have been expressed already this afternoon."
"Hay unas palabras espa√±olas muy bien conocidas en mi pa√≠s que son las palabras ""¬°No pasar√°n!""."
"Y el mensaje que debemos mandar de esta C√°mara es simplemente a los terroristas que no pasar√°n nunca jam√°s."
"[This Spanish phrase is very well known in my country ""¬°No pasar√°n!"""
"(There is no way through!). The message that this House must send the terrorists is simply that there is no way through.]"
"If I could pass on to this issue, which is also a very sensitive one, I was interested in Mr Patten's response because, as I see it, the Euratom Treaty deals purely with civilian matters, not military matters, and this is a military matter."
"There is one aspect of the Euratom Treaty which is the transport of contaminated waste between Member States of the European Union; but, of course, Gibraltar is part of the United Kingdom and any contaminated waste will go from one part of the United Kingdom to another part of the United Kingdom, without passing through any other Member State in the European Union."
"Therefore, the Euratom Treaty does not apply."
"Before us we have a green, gooey, compromise resolution and rarely in my time in the European Parliament have I seen a resolution which is more wrong, more deliberately inaccurate and more designed to scaremonger than this particular resolution we have before us."
"Let us deal with the details."
"The reactor is shut down."
"The submarine is entirely safe."
"It is a fault to the coolant circuit only."
"There was no over-heating."
"There was no danger and there was no contamination; and no, the submarine was not refused permission to enter Naples because it never asked for permission to enter Naples."
"What is the alternative?"
"Do we see a nuclear-powered submarine being towed through the Atlantic in the middle of winter in order to return to the United Kingdom?"
"I can think of no more dangerous scenario, as we have seen in relation to submarines in the former Soviet Union."
"The only time we can do this is June or July, and yet the British Government said clearly that this submarine will be repaired by the end of March."
"So it would be better to repair it than to try and tow it through the Atlantic."
"And no, the classification of the port was not changed by some sleight of hand."
"This is a category Z berth, a berth for nuclear submarines where nuclear submarines can be repaired, provided the nuclear authorities give permission."
"And the independent nuclear authorities have given permission."
"There is no permanent change to this berth. This is a temporary measure to repair this nuclear submarine, and I will recall that there are three category Z berths in Spain designed for the berthing, and presumably the repairing, of American submarines."
"And, of course, any repairs will be to the same standards as they are in the United Kingdom and in 40 years of having nuclear submarines the United Kingdom Navy has never had one incident."
"There is a public safety plan, to which the Commission has drawn attention."
"The experts say that we need to have a public safety plan for a two-mile radius which does not come into Spanish territory; and yes, the public have been informed."
"There have been meetings of trade unionists, there have been meetings of the public, there have been public statements, there have been meetings with ministers of the Government of Spain and the Government of Gibraltar and they have entered the submarine; and our experts have gone off to Madrid in order to give information."
"Never in the history of the Ministry of Defence has there been so much openness in the United Kingdom."
"And on that my case rests, Mr President."
"Mr President, my Group wishes to associate itself with the other supportive remarks made following Mr Galeote Quecedo's shocking announcement of the latest murder."
"We are fully in sympathy with the Spanish people and very sorry to hear about it."
"This problem with the submarine has to be settled calmly and with full cooperation between all interested, relevant authorities."
"Calm cooperation is the method which our Union uses."
"Hence I am happy to support the call by the Commissioner for as much transparency as possible and the publication of the British Government's letter."
"I felt, listening to the Commissioner's excellent report, growing confidence that the matter is being handled in the proper way."
"The two major criteria which we have to study are the question of technical safety - a number of Members have spoken about that already - and gaining the full confidence of the public that everything is being handled in the way it should."
"I am a Member who once used to represent Gibraltar as well as the constituency which I was elected to."
"So I would like to say something about the overall problem."
"We are all democrats here by definition."
"In the Union we all try to look forward and not back to disagreements in the past."
"We all support the right of self-determination."
"I count my very dear Spanish colleagues among my best friends in Parliament."
"Mr Galeote Quecedo and I shared a delegation earlier this year and got on very well."
"So I should like to say to them that the way is open, in my opinion, for Spain to regain the sovereignty of Gibraltar if it really wishes to."
"All they have to do is to gain the confidence of the Gibraltarian people who live on the Rock."
"At some point there may be another referendum among the people on the Rock asking: ""Under whose sovereignty do you wish to live?"""
"The key is to win their votes."
"The way to do it is to make the Gibraltarian people feel entirely comfortable with the idea of being part of Spain."
"So do not create difficulties at the frontiers and slow things down; do not create difficulties with air transportation; let there be free movement of people by road, sea and air and let us solve this problem in a calm, cooperative manner and not - as one has seen in some of the resolutions tabled by the smaller groups - in an emotive manner."
"I am full of confidence concerning what the Commissioner has said so far and look forward to his winding-up remarks."
"Mr President, obviously the best way to avoid the threat of radioactive pollution is to do without nuclear installations entirely."
"However, given that the submarine exists and is facing repairs after having undergone an extensive refit which finished just over a year ago, it is obvious that a number of important issues have been raised for the Union, not least within the context of the development of a common foreign and security policy."
"Setting aside the operational purpose of the Tireless being in the Mediterranean when the leak in the pipe work of the reactor cooling system was discovered, let us look at some of the issues."
"What duty of care and information is owed to a neighbouring Member State when such an incident occurs?"
"Do we have the effective protocols in place?"
"Should there not be a principle of access to information and the supply of information for populations potentially at risk, whether in one Member State or across borders?"
"It is no longer sufficient for an educated public to simply be reassured that all is well."
"They want to know on what the information is based and the nuclear and military industries have a history of paternalistic reassurance which means it is not surprising if they are not believed."
"Information on this has eventually been forthcoming and independent assessment permitted, but that has been forced as a result of public intervention and the actions of the Governor of Gibraltar rather than of a feeling of responsibility due."
"How are our governments to cope with their wider responsibilities in this new European architecture and the development of a common foreign and security policy?"
"Do we actually have the necessary instruments, if we are being told that Euratom is not enough?"
"Are military matters going to take precedence over our responsibility to our common environment and the threats to the health of our citizens?"
"I would be very interested in the Commission's perspective on that particular point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not particularly qualified - in fact none of us is - to deal with this question which is, as the Commissioner has said, a technical problem."
"After all, we are lacking information because the British Government appears to be covering up the major part of the matter."
"Maybe the incident is serious, maybe it is not."
"The British Government is acting just as the Russian Government did recently when one of its submarines was damaged."
"Perhaps both governments were right to do so."
"But I must still point out that, however worrying, this affair also has its amusing side and, if nothing else, illustrates the current state of Europe, the Europe of Nice."
"Obviously, it is a cause of concern to the bordering countries of Spain and Morocco, and also to the people of Gibraltar, who are rightly worried about the implications of this affair, especially as information seems to leaking out more slowly than water from a frozen pipe."
"It is significant first and foremost, and this is the point I should like to stress, because it illustrates the current state of our so-called united Europe and, from this point of view, sovereignists may even find it amusing."
"We keep on being told that there is a European people."
"Well, here is an example of one Member State treating public opinion in another Member State just as it would in any other country in the world, just as if, at the end of the day, there were no affectio societatis fifty years after the start of the European project, just as if European solidarity had made no progress whatsoever."
"And we also hear voices being raised, all highly official and all very pro-European voices, taking advantage of the situation to call for nothing less than disarmament of nuclear submarines, just as if Europe should give nuclear monopoly to other powers."
"And all this against the rather mediaeval backdrop of territorial dispute between two Member States, a dispute which is far from being settled."
"What we are in fact seeing here, in both the minor and major incidents, is the extent to which the Europe of Nice, designed to be a driving force, has in fact broken down, irretrievably broken down, for the reasons clearly described by Mr Bourlanges the day after the Nice Summit."
"These reasons stem quite simply from the fact that it is running on empty and it has no men of vision capable of seeing the world and history as one."
"In fact, it was inevitable in such a serious period of ebb or breakdown in Europe, that obstacles of the scale of the Rock of Gibraltar and all sorts of problems such as terrorism would rear their heads."
"Because we have destroyed any sense of national identity and have failed to replace it with the strong sense of identity which European citizenship should have represented, regional idiosyncrasies are bound to take root."
"Mr Bourlanges' finding is correct."
"For him it is cause for complaint, to us it is cause for satisfaction: that is the only difference between us."
"Mr President, I too would like to extend my deepest sympathy to our Spanish colleagues in the face of the latest terrorist murder by ETA."
"I agree that more resolute action is required against terrorism."
"It is worth bearing in mind that those responsible for the 28 murders in Omagh have still not been brought to justice."
"Turning to the problem of HMS Tireless, it seems to me that this is indicative of a more widespread difficulty in the equipment of the British armed forces as a direct result of policies pursued by the Labour government."
"On the one hand we have a government with no connections to the armed forces and with a card-carrying member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, using the armed forces as a political tool to further its ambitions in Europe and apparently realising rather too late that the European Union defence scheme would indeed damage the NATO alliance and transatlantic relations."
"On the other, the Labour government is not prepared to ensure that the armed forces are provided with the resources to carry out the increasing burden of commitments being placed upon them."
"It is scandalous that, at this moment, 11 out of the 12 hunter-killer submarines in service in the Royal Navy are non-operational, with four in refit and 7 showing signs of the defect which afflicts HMS Tireless."
"The recall of the submarine fleet has robbed the Royal Navy of a quarter of its fighting vessels and left the Trident and carrier forces with much reduced protection."
"It is a fact that at one stage the only submarine operating in British waters was a German U-boat."
"Last year, much of the Royal Navy was forced to stay in port because it had overspent its clearly inadequate fuel budget."
"Meanwhile, at a time when flexibility and rapid response are military watchwords, the Navy's frontline strength is being slashed."
"The submarine fleet is being cut by almost 20%, the frigate and destroyer fleet, already too small, is being cut from 35 to 32%."
"I point all this out because the maintenance and repair problem of Tireless is a reflection of a wider malaise affecting the Royal Navy through cutbacks which have gone too far."
"And, as we have already heard, it has provided those that do not really have the wider, democratically expressed interest of the people of Gibraltar at heart with an opportunity to make mischief."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply which contains new and very important information for us."
"The situation we are talking about is extremely serious."
"A nuclear vessel, suffering a fault classified as serious, is going to be repaired in a small port which is not equipped for the purpose, when more than 300 thousand people live in the vicinity."
"And the decisions on repairs and safety are to be taken by a government which is foreign to those inhabitants."
"There is no way that this situation can be treated as a bilateral affair between two Member States which belong to a political union."
"The Commission, in its clear response two months ago and in its reply today, has been responsible enough to recognise this, although it has not been recognised in the Group of the European People' s Party' s motion for a resolution, a fact which, together with other trivialisations of the affair, has prevented us from supporting it."
"Commissioner, with this same sense of responsibility, the Commission must exercise its powers and not hide them behind an approach of diplomatic prudence and submissiveness towards the Council."
"I am not being alarmist, I am not against nuclear energy, I would never defend, as I believe nobody in Spain would, the idea of a submarine being moved at any cost if that meant an increased risk, but it is not in the spirit of European democracies, nor of the European Union Treaty, for decisions to be taken which jeopardise human safety and cause a population to be put at risk for the sake of greater technical, budgetary and diplomatic comfort."
"Until now, despite the information provided by Mr Patten, the citizens have not been aware of the risks in scientific terms, the date of repair or what the repairs are going to consist of. They are not aware of any plans in the case of a radiological emergency and they do not know whether moving the submarine presents more risks than repairing it there."
"Can the Commission allow a situation such as this?"
"I am not turning this into a matter of national honour, nor is this the moment to condemn the territorial anachronism represented by Gibraltar."
"This specific issue is more serious than all that, since it affects hundreds of thousands of human beings on Community territory, not only Spaniards, but people of all nationalities and British people in particular."
"We believe that these citizens have found the protection which is their right in their most modest territorial representation, that is to say, their local authorities."
"In fact, the municipal and social representatives of those citizens are with us today."
"Whether or not they have found that protection in their national government is a matter for the Spanish Parliament."
"A debate is taking place there, but the citizens, on the basis of their knowledge or intuition, are turning their attention to the European institutions."
"It is the responsibility of those institutions that the citizens, in relation to the European Union, should stop thinking simply in terms of when their agricultural subsidies will arrive or when their Community funding will arrive and start thinking about what degree of safety the Community institutions can offer them."
"I therefore ask you to adopt the proposals contained in the joint motion for a resolution which will be voted on first, or at least those proposed by the Socialist Group."
"In any event, I trust that the Commission will not only fulfil its obligations but that it will persuade the two Member States involved to fulfil theirs."
"Mr President, my colleagues and I extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim of the senseless ETA terrorism in Spain."
"As one of the six MEPs nominated to represent Gibraltar until direct elections are held in four years time, it has been partly my responsibility to liaise with the Gibraltar authorities and the London Ministry of Defence to establish the truth of the situation regarding the repairs to the nuclear submarine HMS Tireless."
"The facts are that a single crack in the cooling system was discovered with a leak of water, described in the Spanish press rather inappropriately as radioactive."
"Although this is technically correct, the level of radiation is so low that it is actually fit to drink."
"The reactor has been fully shut down as preparations are made to cut out a circular section of the main pipe and to return this to the UK for thorough examination before coming to a final decision as to how best to weld or remove it in the defective pintle area of the ship."
"There is absolutely no immediate danger or emergency of any kind, or any threat posed to the surrounding population of Spain."
"The interests of the people of Gibraltar and southern Spain are identical in this regard."
"Chief Minister Peter Caruana has wisely asked a panel of experts to report directly to him."
"The panel has recommended allowing the next stage to proceed, while stipulating that the Ministry of Defence must fully understand the cause of the defect before commencing the essential repairs."
"Repairing a submarine in situ remains by far the safest option available: towing it would not only be dangerous but would, in any event, require considerable repairs to be done beforehand."
"The Spanish Government has until now shown considerable maturity in its response to this situation."
"I would point out with regard to references in the motions for resolutions to the role of the Commission that it is not the view of the UK Government that the Euratom Treaties are applicable in military situations of this kind."
"Nevertheless, the British authorities have endeavoured to be as open as possible with their Spanish counterparts."
"Lack of spending on new military hardware because of defence cuts by the British Labour government will no doubt in future result in more frequent episodes of defective military equipment being taken out of service for essential repairs."
"That said, I hope that this debate will not degenerate into an attempt to attack either Mr Aznar or the Royal Navy, whose resolve this century against threats of tyranny from the right and the left is an important reason why all of us in this Chamber are able to enjoy the freedoms that we share."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the people of Andalusia, who are seeing Aznar' s weakness in resolving this problem, trust in, and wish to trust in, the European Union to guarantee their safety."
"Commissioner, please make your replies specific and guarantee safety in the face of the danger to the Andalusians and the whole population, both the safety of the inhabitants of the colony and that of the citizens of Spain."
"It is believed in Andalusia that it was a very grave error to take this nuclear submarine there."
"It is considered even more grave that it is being kept there."
"Through me, the people are telling you that it should be taken away, please."
"It should be taken to hell."
"Mr President, I will begin by saying that I am Andalusian and that I live in Andalusia, though I am not so arrogant as to claim that I represent the entire Andalusian people, as Mr Bautista has done - although that arrogance is based on very few votes."
"The truth is that I would have liked him to have felt so vehemently Andalusian when it came to signing this House' s condemnation of terrorism - and this must be said this afternoon more unequivocally and with less reticence - especially given that more than 70% of the members of the security forces murdered by ETA have been Andalusians."
"Having said this, we must remember that there has been a lot of contradictory information since May when the nuclear submarine Tireless, belonging to the British navy, chose the port of Gibraltar - which flies the British flag - to have repairs carried out on the cooling system of its nuclear reactor, which, according to the British authorities initially, presented no special difficulty or any danger to the inhabitants of the area."
"Further explanations have followed and concern about what was happening to the Tireless has been increasing."
"The Spanish Government, from the outset, has held a position based on two points: the need for transparent information, based on technical and scientific criteria, in order to assess the scope of the repairs and their potential risk; and also, the view that any decision, either on its repair in Gibraltar or on its removal to a naval base in the British Isles, be taken in accordance with rigorous technical principles."
"This has been and, in our view, remains, the most coherent position and the one which safeguards the interests and safety of all the parties involved."
"Of course, what has been neither coherent nor appropriate has been the deliberate creation of social alarm in the area, with the clear purpose of turning this problem into an attack on the Spanish Government."
"In this event, we must tell our Spanish Socialist Members - with the greatest of respect - that they have allowed party interests to be placed above State interests."
"This is demonstrated by the curious agreement which they reached with British Labour Members to take responsibility away from the people who own the submarine, the people who are responsible for its mooring and remaining in Gibraltar and who are responsible for its repair, and who are also in charge of the port in which it is anchored."
"The important thing at the moment is to ensure that we are provided with good, transparent information, with a sufficient scientific basis, on the scope and consequences of the repairs, and that there be a serious study of the possibilities and risks involved in a possible removal of the submarine, if that becomes necessary."
"What we do not need are demagogic attitudes, which can only be explained by pure party-political opportunism and which create, amongst other things, alarm and concern within a population which has every right to safety and information, but which need not endure, as well as all this, being manipulated."
"I will be brief but I would like to clarify once again some of the extremely important points that were raised in the debate."
"I was well aware, from reading the newspapers and listening to the radio and television, of the passions engendered by this important issue."
"Those feelings have understandably been reflected during this debate, but honourable Members know that in responding on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m, I have to restrict myself to setting out as clearly as I can what is and what is not Community competence: what we can do and what we cannot do."
"I just want to rehearse the arguments again so that we are all absolutely clear."
"Commission competence under the terms of Chapter III, Health and Safety, of the Euratom Treaty covers the following issues which are relevant to this case."
"First, informing the general public about health protection measures to be applied and the steps to be taken in the event of a radiological emergency."
"Second, the availability of an intervention plan to deal with various types of radiological emergency."
"Third, the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste."
"All these issues are being assessed further in detail by Commission officials."
"This competence enables the Commission to ensure that Member States first inform the public of potential risks and the steps that should be taken should a radiological emergency occur; and second, adequately control and supervise shipments of radioactive waste."
"Community competence, however much some people may wish it otherwise, does not extend to the classification of ports to carry out repair work on submarines, questions of technical safety of nuclear reactors and requirements on a submarine to be removed for repair elsewhere."
"The honourable Member, Mrs Lambert, raised the question of cooperation between Member States and it is an important question."
"I want to make it clear that under Article 51, subsection 5 of the Euratom Basic Standards 96/29, cooperation is obligatory, and I quote: ""each Member State shall, in the event of a radiological emergency occurring at an installation on its territory or being likely to have radiological consequences on its territory, establish relations to obtain cooperation with any other Member State or non-Member State which may be involved."""
"An additional point which has been raised, it came up both before I spoke previously and since - an additional point in this context is the applicability of Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty concerning the submission of general data relating to plans for the disposal of radioactive waste."
"The relevance of the Community competence in this case is frankly not clear."
"The general question of submissions of plans for nuclear-powered submarines is being studied by Commission officials."
"Community competence does not require general data to be submitted for the specific repair operation being undertaken."
"Let me just say one other thing."
"I assume that if any Member State had any doubts at all about the way the Commission has handled its competence in this matter, it would have let us know."
"Speaking, finally, not as a Commissioner but as a politician who was once also an environment minister, it seems to me that the important thing in cases like this is to make as much information public as possible."
"I would urge the British authorities to do exactly that."
"For its part, the Commission undertakes to keep honourable Members who have raised these important questions with us fully informed of developments in the coming weeks."
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"50th anniversary of the UNHCR"
"The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0901/2000 by Sylla and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0908/2000 by Maij-Weggen and Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0913/2000 by Mendiluce Pereiro and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0921/2000 by Muscardini and Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"B5-0922/2000 by Wuori and Lambert, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0928/2000 by Watson, on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"on the 50th anniversary of the UNHCR."
"Mr President, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the UNHCR is a way of paying our respects to the men and women who offer non-partisan help to freedom fighters throughout the world under what are often very difficult circumstances."
"If we want to help them even more, we should call on the Community institutions to increase the financial, human and material resources of the UNHCR."
"However, I deplore the way in which several countries, including certain Member States, have attacked the 1951 Geneva Convention."
"Must we remind them that 50 Roma families from Hungary, having had their village ransacked, have been waiting here in Strasbourg for a decision on their application for asylum since July?"
"We must also bear in mind the fact that southern countries and poor countries are getting poorer, thereby paving the way for repressive regimes followed by waves of refugees, and the fact that governments no longer have a monopoly on persecution."
"That is why we should also grant asylum, for example, to women who are the victims of sexual mutilation or sexual violence and all the men and women who are the victims of tribal or ethnic violence, as in Algeria or Afghanistan."
"Allow me to finish by saying more generally, Mr President, that the European Union should promote asylum and immigration policies which respect human rights."
"Mr President, the UNHCR celebrates its fiftieth anniversary this month."
"This cannot, of course, be a reason to submit a resolution on urgent topics."
"The real reason is not so much the anniversary as it is the UN refugee organisation' s current plight."
"In 1980, the UNHCR looked after five million refugees."
"In 1990, this number rose to fifteen million and in 2000, the UNHCR cares for twenty-two million refugees worldwide."
"Of this number, there are 170 000 in Yugoslavia, 1.5 million in Eritrea/Ethiopia, 170 000 in Chechnya, 2 million in Sudan, 1.8 million in Congo, 200 000 near Burma, 130 000 in Timor, 300 000 in the Moluccas, 400 000 in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and the list goes on."
"What makes it so difficult for the UNHCR is that whilst the number of refugees is rising, the resources required by the UN refugee organisation to coordinate the aid are falling."
"At the same time, fewer and fewer countries are abiding by the agreements of the Geneva Convention."
"The reception of refugees is not always secure, not by a long chalk."
"Violence, hunger, poor housing and other violations of human rights often play their part in the process."
"When I recently paid a visit to the Burmese camps on the border with Thailand, and asked what claimed most victims in those camps, the answer was: violence and suicide."
"The suicide rate is particularly high among young people who can no longer endure their bleak situations."
"The UNHCR is also asking for help from the Union, which has reduced its financial aid by more than 400% over the past few years."
"I would ask the Commission to re-instate this aid to the UNHCR and also to designate the UNHCR as the coordinating body in all its contracts with NGOs."
"The UN refugee organisation has an enormous task ahead."
"Let us give this organisation more support, enabling it to better fulfil its role over the next fifty years."
"Let us hope that after this Christmas period, those millions of refugees and aid workers can look forward to better times."
"Mr President, over the 50-year span that has passed since the UNHCR was founded we have seen that, on both sides of the Cold War, a system for aid for refugees is needed more desperately than ever."
"The century that has now begun will unfortunately become known as the century of exile."
"The reasons are, to some extent, different to those of half a century ago, but the need for aid is crucial and, furthermore, more globally spread than it was then."
"Since the European Council in Tampere, the EU has made headway in the development of measures connected with asylum and immigration policy and, obviously, the EU must achieve a common strategy to eliminate the reasons why people become refugees and guarantee their humane treatment, irrespective of the country that is taking them in."
"That is not enough, however: we must give our determined support to the UNHCR, both in political and economic terms, to ensure there is a balance between the issues of predictability, flexibility and geographical location."
"We are paying our respects today to the UNHCR and to all humanitarian workers."
"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organisations work together, helping refugees to start a new life in a new country or, where possible, to return home."
"The UNHCR is currently helping 5 million displaced persons and some 11.5 million refugees."
"The UNHCR has always fought for the protection and welfare of refugees and displaced persons."
"It has taken part in specific operations when asked to do so by the Secretary-General or another authority of the United Nations, in agreement with the countries concerned."
"In the former Yugoslavia and Timor, the UNHCR has decided to protect all displaced persons and provide humanitarian aid for them, irrespective of whether or not they are refugees."
"It should therefore have access to civil victims and its teams on the ground should be able to work in complete safety and with all the resources needed to carry out their mission."
"On the fiftieth anniversary on Thursday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stated that the long life of the UNHCR gave little cause for celebration and that it was more important to pay homage to the millions of refugees, to their courage and to their contribution to the entire world, stressing that refugees were entitled to everyone's respect."
"We should view the speech made by Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as a challenge; basically what she said was that the long life of the UNHCR reflected the international community's inability to prevent prejudice, persecution, poverty and all the other reasons which result in conflict and movements of populations."
"Mr President, I too wish to express my group's appreciation of the valuable work done by the UNHCR, both on the ground and in policy terms."
"There is a desperate need for a body that defends the individual right to asylum and actually looks for best practice in terms of treatment for refugees, not the lowest common denominator and policies of deterrence, which some Member States and political parties seem determined to follow."
"There are arguments for including the UNHCR in the formal policy process of the Union to make the best possible use of their advice and experience."
"As others have said, we also need to ensure adequate funding for this organisation."
"Our own contributions have fallen in recent times as have those of our Member States and yet, as others have said, the need grows."
"Anyone who was at the recent exhibition in the European Parliament and who studied the pictures and the script dealing with the work of the UNHCR in the world at the moment I think would agree that it is one of the saddest exhibitions that we have ever had the misfortune to see in our Parliament."
"Mr President, the Commission of course wants to associate itself with the support given by Parliament to the UNHCR for its 50th anniversary."
"I should like personally to associate myself with that support as well."
"I have worked closely with the UNHCR as a development minister; I worked closely with the UNHCR when I was in Hong Kong and I work closely with the UNHCR in my present activities."
"As one or two speakers have said, it would be a happier world if the vitally important work that the UNHCR does was unnecessary."
"The UNHCR is a key partner for the establishment of an asylum policy in Europe."
"That is why a declaration was annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty which foresees consultations with the UNHCR on asylum policy issues."
"The Commission and the UNHCR therefore demonstrated, on 6 July, the strengthening of their partnership on asylum and refugees through an exchange of letters between Commissioner Vitorino and Mrs Ogata."
"As the House knows, the Commission is engaged in the field of asylum in an important legislative effort to implement Treaty and Tampere European Council commitments on the basis of the calendar included in the scoreboard."
"Against this background, the Commission has regular consultations with UNHCR."
"It was the case, for example, when we prepared our proposals on temporary protection in case of mass influx of displaced persons, on asylum procedures and, currently, on reception conditions for asylum seekers."
"We will continue to follow that model for our proposals on the successor instrument to the Dublin Convention, conditions to qualify as a refugee on the basis of the Geneva Convention, and on subsidiary forms of protection."
"The inclusion of high-level protection standards in our proposals is of prime importance to the Commission."
"On 22 November the Commission adopted a communication on a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for those granted asylum valid throughout the Union, which is the final aim fixed in Tampere for the common European asylum system."
"Our proposals fit into the Tampere political guidance, in particular the need for a full and inclusive implementation of the 1951 Geneva Convention for maintaining the principle of non-refoulement and a balanced approach between the absolute respect for the right to seek asylum and the legitimate aim to control migration."
"They also fit into the comprehensive approach to strengthen partnership with countries of origin."
"On the same day the Commission adopted a communication on a Community immigration policy which complements our thinking on migration issues."
"The Commission entirely shares the importance attached by the European Parliament to addressing the particular circumstances affecting women seeking international protection in the context of preparing a common European asylum system."
"These issues are reflected in the different instruments that we have been tabling."
"The UNHCR is the Commission's main single partner in the humanitarian field."
"The Commission has traditionally worked closely with the UNHCR and it is further enhancing our collaboration."
"The first of what is meant to be a series of regular, strategic programming meetings with the UNHCR took place in Brussels on 6 December."
"The European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) presented its strategy for next year, including funding criteria and priorities, and exchanged views with UNHCR on humanitarian needs and horizontal issues of common concern."
"These meetings should help the Commission provide the more predictable and transparent funding that UNHCR requests and has long called for, while at the same time assisting UNHCR in rendering a better service to those in need."
"I want to refer to a broader issue that is very relevant to what the honourable Member said earlier."
"Because of our existing financial regulation, it is extremely difficult for us to provide support to UN organisations for example, for programming - we have to focus on projects - and that means that there is sometimes an extremely uncertain profile in our funding of organisations like the UNHCR."
"That is why I am extremely keen to see appropriate changes made in our new financial regulation to ensure that we can support programming so that UN bodies and other similar organisations can be sure some time in advance of a flow of funds to support work we are doing in common and to which we both attach priority."
"The Commission is firmly committed to strengthening the UNHCR's unique protection mandate and to working with the UNHCR in enhancing the security of relief workers."
"The Commission is also working closely with the UNHCR in trying to ensure a smooth transition between relief and development."
"In this regard, the Commission participates actively in the UNHCR-sponsored Brookings Process, which will be an important element of the communication on linking relief, rehabilitation and development which is currently being finalised."
"Finally, I should like to pay a tribute to all the work that has been done by Mrs Ogata for the UNHCR and to wish Mr Ruud Lubbers well in his new post."
"The UN system should be very pleased to have attracted as outstanding a candidate as Mr Lubbers and I am sure he will do very distinguished service for the UNHCR and for the whole UN system."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"Political prisoners in Serbia and instability on the borders of Kosovo"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0899/2000 by Depuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group;"
"B5-0902/2000 by Morgantini and Frahm, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0909/2000 by Pack and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0914/2000 by Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0920/2000 by Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"B5-0923/2000 by Staes and Frassoni, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0929/2000 by Haarder and Malmstr√∂m, on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"on political prisoners in Serbia and instability on the borders of Kosovo."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to express my support for this joint motion for a resolution for the European Union to favour the recuperation and promotion of democracy in the Balkans, specifically in Yugoslavia."
"It seems to us important that we are promoting a political amnesty in Yugoslavia for that recuperation I mentioned, but it also seems to us very important that we roundly condemn the recurrence of incursions and terrorist activities on the borders between Serbia, Albania and Kosovo, because that is a worrying reminder of what happened during the Kosovo conflict, where Western powers held responsibilities."
"It is therefore important that this condemnation be accompanied by a promotion of democratic and economic consolidation in Yugoslavia, with regard to which the European Union has much to do and much to say."
"Mr President, we welcomed the installation, or election, of Vojislav Kostunica as the new President of Yugoslavia."
"We very soon had him here before the House, as you all know, and we have naturally become aware, as he too is aware, of the dreadful legacy he has inherited, of the economic situation confronting Yugoslavia, and we hope, of course, that he will be able to surmount all these difficulties with our help."
"But there is another point to be made: we must judge Yugoslavia by the same standards that we have applied to its neighbours and that we shall continue to apply to them."
"That is why we simply must ensure that the problems arising there are not simply settled with a nod and a wink or put on the back burner for possible consideration in the distant future but are resolved in an appropriate manner as soon as possible."
"There are still political prisoners in Serbia today; they are actually the prisoners of Slobodan Milosevic."
"There is surely no reason at all why Milosevic's political prisoners of yesterday should be Kostunica's prisoners today."
"Sadly, Mr Kostunica missed his opportunity, on becoming President, to free these political prisoners - the Albanians in particular, but the Serbs too."
"He let the opportunity slip, but at least the Albanian political prisoners from Kosovo could have been released if he had handed them over to UNMIK in Kosovo."
"In that way he would have been able to comply with Resolution 1244 and release them from Serbian prisons, and Dr Kouchner and his people would have had to take care of them."
"Now President Kostunica has tabled an amnesty law, but our House is not the only place where legislation takes time, and while the legislative wheels are turning down there, hundreds of young people - innocent young people - remain in custody."
"We expect this problem to be solved quickly."
"We also expect joint efforts to be made so that the many missing persons - Serbs and Albanians from Serbia and Kosovo - can soon be found; whether they are dead or alive, people want to know what has happened to them."
"That is the second problem."
"And the last problem to which I wish to refer relates to the dreadful occurrences at the border between Serbia and Kosovo."
"The fact is that we have a confrontation there between two adversaries, neither of whom has any desire for peace."
"On the one side there is the Albanian UCK reserve, and on the other there is Slobodan Milosevic's secret service."
"Neither side wants peace, but we must help to ensure that peace is established in that region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on 25 December - Christmas Day - of last year, three prominent Albanian Kosovars started a three-week hunger strike in Brussels to bring to the attention of the international community the fate of these prisoners and especially of the many thousands of missing persons."
"In mid-January of this year, a few thousand Kosovars held a demonstration in front of the Brussels Council building and a delegation was received by the services of Mr Solana and the Portuguese Presidency."
"We were told that Mr Solana was understanding of these demands but it was also pointed out that - and I quote - the fact of the matter is that it is difficult to do business with a regime such as that of Milosevic."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Milosevic has now been replaced by Kostunica and I was in Kosovo when Kostunica received a very warm welcome at the Biarritz Summit, and was given several millions of EURO aid unconditionally."
"However, what has Kostunica done about the problem of prisoners in the meantime?"
"It is true that by way of a symbolic gesture, one of the prisoners, Mrs Flora Brovina has been freed, but that cannot be the end of it, ladies and gentlemen."
"Our compromise resolution is clearly stipulated in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3."
"We demand a swift release of the political prisoners and an impartial inquiry into the whereabouts of the missing persons."
"Mr Solana, Mr Patten, I ask you both to put the Kostunica regime sufficiently under pressure to ensure these demands are met."
"I would like to say the following to Mr Kostunica: you would gain in credibility if you were to take advantage of the forthcoming Christmas celebrations to carry out such an act of goodwill, which can only benefit stability in the region."
"Mr President, it is precisely because Serbia has chosen the democratic path that there is reason for the European Parliament to remind everyone of two fundamental requirements that are made of any democratic state governed by law, namely that political freedom must prevail - one must not be able to be imprisoned for one' s political views or for the ethnic group to which one belongs - and that persons suspected of crimes - whether political leaders or common villains - must be put on trial so that their guilt and responsibility can be examined."
"Consequently, all political prisoners in Serbia must be freed."
"The injustices committed by Milosevic must now come to an end."
"It is worth repeating that we make the same requirements of the political leaders in Kosovo."
"The persecution of minorities can never be justified."
"The new political leadership in Serbia must act in such a way, and I would like to point this out, Mr President, so that the former president and dictator Milosevic, together with his partners in crime, can be brought before the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague."
"It is there that Milosevic belongs and not at party conferences in Belgrade."
"Mr President, any objective observer of the situation in Yugoslavia is compelled to conclude that the criminals continue to move about scot-free while their victims are locked up in prison."
"For all our delight at the changes in Belgrade, we still have to press for the earliest possible release of these victims."
"This has nothing to do with an amnesty, because it stands to reason that an amnesty can only be granted to prisoners who have been justly convicted; what we are demanding is quite simply the release of unjustly convicted people."
"That may be linked with an amnesty, or their release may precede the amnesty."
"It is my view that the political prisoners, not least the many hundreds of Albanians, must be released without delay."
"I also appeal to President Kostunica to find out what happened to people such as Mr Ukshin Hoti, with whose fate we have concerned ourselves on several occasions here without ever obtaining any information on his whereabouts."
"So there is a need to investigate the fate of those who were abducted, whether they were murdered or whether they are still being held somewhere."
"All those who are being illegally detained or who are in prison for political reasons must be released without delay."
"That is the first step towards the establishment of the rule of law."
"I do have to say that this is not much to ask in return for the substantial aid which the European Union has already pledged."
"We expect action as soon as the elections are over."
"Mr President, the situation in Yugoslavia has still not been rendered safe and stabilised."
"Following the hugely important step of electing Kostunica, many other important steps need to be taken in future."
"That also includes an unequivocal return to the rule of law, democratic values and a sound handling of the legacy of the Milosevic regime."
"In order to establish truly lasting peace between the different groups, it is also necessary to shed light on the fate of the prisoners who have been imprisoned by Milosevic simply on the grounds of ethnicity or political views."
"We either expect a clear amnesty law in the short term with specific details or, and preferably in combination with, a concrete date for the release of the political prisoners."
"We believe that within Kosovo too, the mentality of ethnic groups which are still fighting each other should make way for mutual respect."
"The way in which Kosovar-Albanians are currently harassing Serbs on Serb territory is not helping to defuse the situation on either side."
"What we need now are concrete steps to reach lasting peace."
"Mr President, I would like to comment on two points of the joint draft resolution which, incidentally, receives my unqualified support."
"The request to President Kostunica to release all political prisoners from the Milosevic era, requires, as before, unrelenting diplomatic effort on the part of the European Council and Commission in Belgrade, especially since most Serb political prisoners, if not those of Albanian origin from Kosovo, have, as far as I know, now been released."
"An extremely harrowing detail in this respect is that many of these were taken hostage at the time the Yugoslav people' s army withdrew from Kosovo last year."
"I also agree with the request for help from KFOR to thwart further violence in the Presevo valley."
"This, evidently, is a case of imported Albanian aggression, as this part of Serbia had not experienced any acute ethnic tension in former days."
"Finally, I noticed that the draft resolution does not cover the complex issue of the Kosovar Roma gypsies, unlike the draft resolution which was brought forward by the Liberal Group."
"The unscrupulous Milosevic regime has heavily compromised this entire population group in the eyes of the Albanian Kosovars."
"However, this fact does not in any way justify the dreadful reprisals on the Albanian side, such as the violent killing of four Ashani-Roma in mid-November when they returned to their burnt down homes, nor the burning alive of a fifteen-year-old Roma boy in Orahovac."
"Such serious crimes cast a cloud over Kosovo' s political future."
"Mr President, I am pleased, as I am sure is the whole of Parliament, that there has been considerable progress in the political situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in recent months."
"I am sure we are all pleased about the progress throughout the region in the course of this year, beginning with the electoral change in Croatia at the beginning of the year, continuing with the change in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and culminating in the extremely successful conference which was quite properly held in Zagreb a few weeks ago."
"So much has changed since the autumn: the new authorities in Belgrade have moved fast, for example to restore international contacts; they have moved fast to enable the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to take its place at the United Nations and, as well, to take its place in the OSCE."
"Without blowing our own trumpet, we can also say that the European Union has responded very rapidly to the new situation."
"Our EUR 200m emergency package has been under way for the last month, delivering huge quantities of fuel and other urgent supplies like medicines and food, to help Serbia to get through the winter."
"The issue of political prisoners remains, however, as several members have pointed out, an extremely important one."
"The European Union has consistently raised the plight of Kosovar Albanians in prison in Serbia."
"I have done that myself."
"We have also raised the position of individuals like Flora Brovina and the very brave Serbian journalist Miroslav Filipovic."
"I am pleased that there has been some progress."
"Brovina and Filipovic have both been freed."
"Indeed, I met Miroslav Filipovic when I was in Belgrade in October - we spent part of an evening together."
"I know that Members of this Parliament welcomed Flora Brovina to Brussels last month."
"Despite this, many Kosovar Albanians remain in prison in Serbia and there remain many missing Kosovar Albanians and Serbs whom the ICRC is still attempting to trace."
"We have tried to display understanding for the new government as it seeks to consolidate democracy in Yugoslavia."
"But the issue of detainees is plainly extremely important."
"There has been some movement on the general issue."
"The Federal Government is working on a general amnesty, not just for Kosovar Albanian prisoners, but also for other political detainees."
"Contacts have been established."
"A special envoy of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ambassador Amneus, has been appointed and the ambassador has opened offices in Pristina and Gracanica."
"I raised the issue of Kosovar Albanian prisoners with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities during my visit to Belgrade on 23 October and will continue to raise these issues with the Yugoslav Federal Republic authorities."
"I can assure honourable Members that it is an issue which I will take up - not least as a result of this debate - on the next visit I make to Belgrade after the elections on 23 December."
"I share honourable Members' concern about the situation in the Presevo valley."
"We strongly condemn recent violence."
"The attacks are attacks on democracy: the new democracy in Serbia and the prospects of democracy in Kosovo."
"I welcome steps now taken by KFOR to tackle the problem and continue to urge restraint on all sides."
"The Community is, of course, playing its role, for example, by ensuring that the Presevo valley benefits from our assistance programmes for Serbia."
"We are running three schools for democracy projects in the area and we are looking to help with fuel supplies in the area as well."
"But, I repeat, we know how important this issue is; it is an issue that we have raised consistently in the past and we will continue to raise it with the new authorities in Belgrade with, I hope, happier consequences."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"Human rights"

"Mr President, the third generation agreements between the European Union and the countries of Latin America are characterised by the existence of a democratic clause that is the basis for, and supports, all relations."
"This clause was agreed in the Palacio de la Moneda in March 1990, and I am well aware of this because I had the privilege of being there when President Alwyn took over, following the vote which put an end to General Pinochet' s regime."
"There is no need to say that the logical consequence of this clause is the affirmation of the principle of separation of powers as an essential element of the democratic system and of the Rule of Law, and that this principle means and implies the independence of the judicial powers in their actions."
"However, Mr President, I think that today the best support that the European Union can give to the process of consolidation of democracy in Chile and to the civic maturity demonstrated by the citizens of the country in its transition process, is to have an ambitious agreement for political association, economic coordination and cooperation between the European Union and Chile."
"In order to do this, Mr President, and I am particularly addressing the Commission, in my opinion we need to modify the current negotiation directives and overcome a blatant discrimination compared with other geographical areas, which links the conclusion of this agreement with the completion of the negotiations of the new round of the World Trade Organisation."
"I think, Mr President, that it is now time that we moved from words to actions and that we stopped making purely rhetorical statements."
"The best way to express our solidarity and our support for the process of democratic consolidation in Chile is clearly, Mr Patten, and you were there recently chairing the negotiations, through the European Union offering our Chilean friends an ambitious cooperation agreement."
"Mr President, any dictatorship leaves behind it a trail of victims, murdered people, tortured people, people who have spent years in prison and many people who have had to go into exile."
"There are many Chileans, for example, who now live in Europe as a result of the dictatorship of General Pinochet, who came into power by overthrowing a democratic government, who established himself over the dead body of President Allende and who, after a long dictatorship, lost power because the Chilean people were not prepared to continue supporting him."
"And, on one occasion, General Pinochet decided to come to Europe and, as soon as he set foot here, the European judicial authorities set out to ensure that General Pinochet took responsibility for his actions."
"The Chilean Government guaranteed that in Chile General Pinochet would have a fair trial and General Pinochet has indeed now lost his immunity and the Chilean judicial authorities are initiating proceedings against him."
"Here we cannot replace the judicial authority once it has legal power over the case of General Pinochet, and we welcome the fact that the Chilean Government has also decided to allow the judicial authorities to operate."
"The only thing we can do here is to support the Chilean Government at this time and, taking advantage of the presence of Commissioner Patten, to ask him, as the previous speaker, Mr Salafranca, did, for a new agreement to be sought with Chile which will help continue to strengthen democracy in that country."
"I think that it is a good opportunity to strengthen our links with the Chilean Government, to enable the Chilean Government to authorise the judicial authority to bring proceedings against General Pinochet and, at the same time, to take advantage of this opportunity to give our support to the Chilean Government."
"I recall that in the European Parliament mission to Argentina, former President Alfons√≠n said to us that sometimes democracies only remember other democracies post mortem, that is, when there is no longer democracy."
"Now that we have democracy in Chile, let us help that democratic government and democratic nation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the joint resolution, which will, of course, be passed."
"First, I want to express our regret at the euphemistic wording adopted."
"To talk of human rights violations, refusing to set words such as assassination, torture and disappearance down in black and white, is a serious matter."
"You all know full well that, for the victims, an official institution' s refusal to acknowledge the atrocity is, in a way, another sort of torture because it prevents them from mourning, from recovering from this period in their lives, as every post-traumatic treatment centre for the former victims of Latin American dictatorships will tell you."
"Secondly, it would be unacceptable if we failed to call on the Chilean army to stop interfering in the judicial process in Chile."
"Some groups have argued that we should not be talking to the Chilean army."
"That is not correct."
"Unfortunately, we still need to talk to the Chilean army because the current Chilean constitution gives it the right to take part in the work of the Senate in Chile."
"Mr President, before I begin, allow me to mention the attack that took place today in Spain, specifically in Catalonia, ten kilometres from my own home."
"Allow me to express my rejection of this attack and also to express my respect for the victim' s party colleagues and his family, and the conviction that dialogue and democrats working together is the only hope."
"Going on to the subject of Chile, I would like to express the confidence, the approval and the satisfaction, on the part of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that the resolution contains some important points, such as respect for the power of Chilean justice, for the Government, for allocating responsibility and, above all, being able to provide support from the European Union for the democratic process with real and positive agreements."
"I also express the support of our Group for the amendment from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left on the non-interference of military powers in the process."
"And allow me to point out that it is important that we approve this joint resolution, now that Pinochet is in Chile, something that we were not able to do when Pinochet was in the United Kingdom."
"At the time the Liberals and Greens tried, but the members of the People' s Party and the Socialists were not in favour, in order not to affect the judicial process."
"We are happy that the situation has now changed."
"Mozambique"
"Mr President, although this Parliament is bringing southern Africa back to our agenda and particularly Mozambique, one of the poorest countries in the world, which, as we know, was devastated exactly a year ago by a huge natural disaster."
"As you know, Mozambique is situated in one of the hottest and most sensitive spots on the African continent, where any spark may trigger off another war with unimaginable consequences."
"The international community must exercise its right of democratic vigilance, not in order to interfere in the internal affairs of an independent country but as a precautionary and preventative political procedure."
"Therefore, this joint resolution, which is objective, clear, shows genuine concern and is not demagogic, has the earnest support of my political group; sharing an economic, social and political diagnosis in which its concerns are well-founded, it does not allow any other interpretation of its text that may divide the Mozambican people."
"This Parliament agrees not to forget any factor that may jeopardise the peace and the democratic future of Mozambique. However, responsibly, it does not side with any factions seeking power or position; instead it sides with the Mozambicans and their right to a better life."
"With time we all learn something and, in this exercise of political common sense, Parliament forgets nothing but remembers everything, and believes that those responsible in Mozambique will read and understand the essence of this resolution, in the certainty that we remain ready and willing to help them without any paternalism of any kind. This resolution, ladies and gentlemen, is to be read, not misread, for that would be a perversion of the genuine concerns to uphold essential principles in which it is rooted."
"The opposite of this would be to encourage violence and threaten the peace which is contrary to the safety and democracy that the Mozambicans are entitled to win for themselves every day."
"Mr President, what a dreadful day."
"Another assassination in Catalonia, an assassination in Mozambique, damage and injury to the democratic process."
"We in this group extend our profound solidarity and sympathy to the people of Mozambique as we did earlier this afternoon to the people in Spain."
"It is significant that paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution before us read that Parliament condemns any use of violence in political disputes and calls for respect for the rule of law and calls on all the democratic forces in the country to consolidate peace and the democratic process."
"These are words that we should bear in our hearts."
"The peaceful and democratic pursuit of political ends is not just a means to an end; it is intrinsic in any worthwhile end itself."
"I say that in the knowledge that these are foundational beliefs for the parties of the European Free Alliance and for the Greens in this House."
"I have great honour in commending this motion."
"Turkey"
"Mr President, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left would have liked to have approved a resolution on the human rights situation and the situation in the Turkish prisons following this debate."
"We regret that the other political groups were not willing to do so on this occasion."
"As we all know, the serious and systematic infringements of human rights in Turkey are continuing."
"The situation in prisons and police stations is entirely unacceptable and includes extensive abuse and torture."
"In recent times a number of people have died as a result of abuse in Turkish prisons."
"An extensive hunger strike is currently underway in the prisons to protest against these inhuman conditions."
"Turkey is infringing international conventions on human rights to which the country is a signatory."
"The oppression of the political left and national minorities such as Kurds is particularly intense, but other national minorities such as Assyrians are also being oppressed."
"Unfortunately we will be able to see a new example of this on Wednesday next week, when the Assyrian priest Yusuf Akbulut will be brought before a military court in Diyarbakir."
"His only crime is to have spoken the truth when he spoke about the genocide of Armenians and Assyrians in the 1920s."
"If he is convicted then Turkey' s regime will again have shown its contempt for human rights."
"So long as this situation prevails the country cannot be considered for membership negotiations with the European Union."
"Mr President, before beginning my speech I would also like to join in condemning the attack that cost the life of someone elected by the people, and of an activist and councillor of the Partido Popular in Catalonia in Spain."
"Having said this, I would like to talk very briefly about a delicate situation, because in this debate we can be carried away by our emotions and talk forever about the little respect that there is for human rights in Turkey."
"But it is also true that the hunger strike is taking place at a time when reforms are under way in the Turkish regime, and specifically in the area of prison policy."
"That said, however, I would also like to say that we should not trust the fine words and good intentions, that Turkey - as has been said here - is still giving no unequivocal signs of respect for human rights, that it has just pronounced an amnesty law that does not deserve that name, that it is still failing to respect the rights of the Kurds, that it violates international conventions, that it persecutes leftwing activists, that it tries people for the things that have been mentioned here."
"Therefore, what we are kindly asking the Commission here is that there should be strict monitoring of the conditions in that country which, of course, does not deserve to be considered to be respecting human rights."
"Mr President, the present crisis is founded upon the Turkish proposal to transfer prisoners from large wards to smaller prison cells."
"This treatment would be exactly like we see in Western Europe and, faced with the protests, the Minister Hikmet Sami Turk has postponed the transfer so that a social and political consensus upon prison reform be developed throughout Turkey."
"This is surely the correct approach and fully consistent with the government's expressed wish to meet the political requirements for the accession partnership with the Union."
"For that reason, we oppose the GUE/NGL resolution."
"Mr President, every country in Europe, and France in particular, needs to respond to the distress of prisoners by considering how to reform the methods and structures which govern penitentiary administrations so as to show greater respect for the dignity of prisoners, irrespective of the seriousness of their crime."
"The desire to create prison conditions which are as humane as possible, without resorting to demagogy, is broadly shared and strengthened as and where necessary by the vigilance shown by all the associations working to defend human rights."
"It would therefore appear to be perfectly logical to call on all countries, especially those who are candidates for membership of the European Union, to support this move."
"Having said that, our debate here today was provoked by our reaction to the hunger strike currently taking place in Turkish prisons."
"However, I am pleased that it will not culminate in a righteous recommendation by Parliament, which is often perceived to be overly keen on preaching and which would do well, from time to time, to put its own house in order."
"I am pleased because I think that, when it is not a vulgar sham, a hunger strike is a suicidal undertaking which my personal beliefs forbid me from encouraging."
"That is why I welcome the fact that my political group and, I think, the majority here in the House, will not be tempted to bang a drum in order to milk the current crisis for all it is worth."
"Naturally, I hope that the Turkish authorities will resolve this crisis quickly, but I would hate an irresponsible attitude on our part to have a domino effect and set off a series of equally distressing crises."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I express the solidarity of my Group with all those who are on hunger strike in Turkish prisons."
"Nevertheless, I wish to urge them to call off their strike, because we in the European Parliament, and the Council of Europe too, are trying to improve the situation together with the Turkish authorities; we are certainly being critical of the Turkish Government, but we are working with them to try and ensure that the new prisons improve rather than exacerbate conditions for prisoners."
"May I also take this occasion to say that it is, of course, not only a matter of there being too many political prisoners - the fact that a country applying for membership of the European Union has any political prisoners at all merits outright condemnation - but that we are also aware of the way in which the existing prisons and the conditions that prevail within them have led to various criminal activities emanating from Turkish prisons."
"Turkey has every right to prevent such activities but, at the same time, it must ensure that all prisoners in Turkish jails are treated humanely, decently and as individuals, and we are utterly uncompromising in our commitment to this principle."
"Tunisia"
"Mr President, allow me to start by welcoming Imen Derwiche and Nourredine Ben Tisha to the public gallery; they are young Tunisian students who were tortured and imprisoned for several months."
"Action is needed quickly, which is why we decided to include this item on the agenda."
"The very existence of the oldest human rights league in Africa and the Arab-speaking world, the Tunisian League, is under threat, despite being recognised by President Ben Ali."
"Judicial proceedings to have it wound up were instituted following its last congress, which appointed directors who are obviously not to the Tunisian authorities' liking."
"Its fate is to be decided at a hearing scheduled for 25 December, which is surprising, because this date is also a Muslim public holiday this year."
"As we speak, police forces have surrounded the premises of the Tunisian National Council for Liberties and even the private residences of some of its members."
"This police operation has already used force to prevent the National Council of the League from meeting in Bizerte and the Tunisian National Council for Liberties from meeting in Tunis."
"Its spokesman, Moncef Marzouki, risks being sentenced to over 10 years in prison at a hearing the day after tomorrow, on 16 December."
"Finally, political prisoners have been on hunger strike in prison, some of them for two months."
"Some, such as B√©chir Habid, are in a critical condition."
"Their very life is in danger."
"Repression is on the rise, arrests and intolerable cases of torture are increasing in number."
"This is no longer a question of attacks on the freedom of expression, association or assembly; now, freedom of movement, freedom of speech and the freedom to receive persons of one's choice are difficult to exercise in Tunisia."
"Men and women are harassed daily and their families harassed as well."
"One example is Mehdi Zougah, a French-Tunisian citizen, who was arrested at Tunis airport on 11 August."
"For four months his wife and children have been waiting for him at home in Marseilles."
"He will stand trial on 8 January on charges of having attended a meeting of the Tunisian opposition in France, which he denies."
"It is a case of the most blatant arbitrariness."
"The Tunisian authorities should pay heed to the concern and outrage being expressed in this Chamber."
"They should listen to the representative of the UN Secretary-General for human rights who expressed her acute concern on 7 December, calling for an end to the practice of harassing defenders of human rights."
"The Tunisian authorities should realise once and for all that we are determined not to relax our vigilance and to continue to press for fundamental rights to be respected."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Tunisia has undertaken, within the framework of its association agreement with the European Union, to respect human rights and democratic principles."
"Following numerous violations of human rights in Tunisia, Parliament adopted a resolution on 15 June 2000."
"But the facts remain."
"Even if a few passports have been returned, even if President Ben Ali delivered a speech on the freedom of the press and improved prison conditions on the anniversary of his taking power, there has been a marked deterioration in the human rights situation in Tunisia."
"The human rights league has been suspended, its premises placed under seal and its president, Moktar Trifi, has been summoned to appear in court, as you have just heard, on 25 December."
"The Secretary-General of the league, Khema√Øs Ksila, who has already spent two years in prison, has been sentenced to a heavy fine which he cannot afford to pay and therefore risks another spell in prison."
"The spokesman of the Tunisian National Council for Liberties, Professor Moncef Marzouki, is due to appear in court this week, on 16 December, and risks ten years in prison."
"The civil association RAID ATTAC Tunisia, the leaders of which were imprisoned at the beginning of the year, has still not been authorised."
"The Aloes publishing house, which has been closed down several times, is prevented from publishing freely."
"The lawyer acting for many political prisoners, Radhia Nasraoui, cannot visit her clients in prison."
"When militants and those in charge of these associations decide to meet in order to celebrate the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their houses are surrounded by police and anyone trying to enter is harassed in the street by men dressed in civilian clothes."
"These men and women are the Sakharovs, the Vaclav Havels, Abraham Serfatis and Nelson Mandelas of our times."
"We should be at their side because they are defending the values which we hold dear and which the Tunisian Government and authorities have promised to respect under the association agreement."
"We therefore call on the Commission to ensure that the terms agreed and undertakings made under this agreement are respected."
"We call on it to intervene as a matter of urgency in the cases which we have cited and which give us the greatest cause for concern."
"Finally, we call on the Commission to re-examine the conditions under which the MEDA Democracy programme is being applied because we find it incredible that the Tunisian authorities have retained a right of control."
"As with the countries of the former Yugoslavia, we think that the Union should be able to provide direct support to newspapers, publishing houses and independent democratic associations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the situation in Tunisia gives real cause for considerable concern."
"At least 1 000 people are still imprisoned for the sake of their views."
"Human rights activists, trade union members, academics, journalists and students report constant harassment by the authorities."
"Despite the fact that Tunisia signed up to the UN convention against torture as far back as 1987, torture is becoming increasingly widespread and institutionalised in the country."
"We in liberal camps are very concerned at this development."
"We wish to highlight three specific problems."
"The legal proceedings against Professor Moncef Marzouki and the lawyer, Nejib Hosni, have been mentioned here."
"These will now be started at the weekend and on Monday."
"The reasons for prosecution are very unclear."
"The legal proceedings must naturally be made open and just."
"The second problem is actually only part of a pattern of harassment."
"It concerns the dissolution of Tunisia' s League for Human Rights."
"This organisation is the very oldest in the Maghreb region and the action has given rise to protests the world over."
"Ambassadors have protested on behalf of the UN."
"Members of the organisation are harassed and have been prevented from meeting, with disproportionate police action."
"Sympathisers with the movement abroad have been prevented from returning."
"What crimes they are guilty of is unclear and the action should be dropped."
"Finally, we are greatly concerned at the condition of those prisoners who are on hunger strike."
"Last week one of the prisoners, Rached Jaidane, fell into a coma."
"His family have been given no information as to his condition."
"The young student B√©chir Habid has been on hunger strike since 18 October."
"His condition is very, very serious."
"He needs to receive care and be released immediately."
"The cooperation between the EU and Tunisia is positive."
"It must be maintained and developed."
"However, this requires Tunisia to respect agreements entered into, including those which encompass clauses on human rights."
"To discuss these matters I would like the Commission to take the initiative to convene an extra meeting of the council on EU-Tunisian association in order to discuss the matter of human rights as soon as possible."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to express my thanks for the solidarity expressed by other colleagues due to the recent assassination by the terrorist group ETA."
"I can inform you that, at the beginning of this afternoon' s session, a minute' s silence was kept in his memory, and I would also like to point out that he was a councillor from the Partido Popular, who, like so many other socialist activists and many other servants of the State, can be counted amongst the people murdered by ETA.."
"My Group, like this Parliament, is particularly sensitive about the human rights situation in Tunisia and in the rest of the world."
"This concern is behind the fact that, in recent weeks, I have met twice with the chairman of the Tunisian human rights league."
"I have also, Mr President, had the opportunity to visit the country - which I did not know - and during this visit, I have been able to observe that Tunisia is a country that has made considerable progress in the economic sphere and in fighting poverty, promoting the emergence of a prosperous middle class."
"There have also been considerable improvements in the access and incorporation of women into political, economic and social life, and I also do not think that we should forget the element of stability and moderation that the country represents in the face of fundamentalism."
"All this does not mean, of course, that this economic progress should not be followed by more progress in the political sphere and that there should not also be progress in the uncompleted reform process, particularly in terms of rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The reforms announced by President Ben Ali in November are precisely in the spirit and the letter of the last resolution adopted by this Parliament, and what is needed now is for them to become a reality."
"For all these reasons, Mr President, as well as our irrevocable and undeniable commitment to human rights and to the Tunisian league, I would like us to also be capable, in a balanced manner, without being overly positive or negative, of considering the general situation of the country in an objective manner, and of comparing the situation with what other African countries are experiencing, and in particular, its immediate neighbours, Algeria and Libya, which are not exactly a model of respect for human rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is six months since the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on the Tunisian government to stop violating human rights and to work in support of fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the development of the civil society. And still the Tunisian regime is committing one violation after another and sinking deeper and deeper into generalised police repression."
"I personally attended a parody of a trial on 24 November, at which the accused, who had been on hunger strike for three months and were unable to move or speak, were sentenced to 17 years in prison."
"I stood in front of the prison in Tunis on 9 April and watched hundreds of policemen breaking up a demonstration of solidarity organised by democrats."
"I witnessed powers being handed over within the human rights league a week before it was placed in official receivership."
"Daily harassment and beatings of democrats are a standard occurrence."
"These people are hounded - such as Hamma Hammami, sentenced to 9 years in prison, or Moncef Marzouki who, as you have heard, is due to go on trial the day after tomorrow."
"Any meeting, any gathering, such as the national conference organised by the Tunisian National Council for Liberties on 10 December, is effectively banned due to police violence."
"Any free and independent expression is censored, as is illustrated by the seizure of the books of Taoufik Ben Brik."
"What can we say, what can we do to meet this challenge, our challenge, the challenge of our international commitments?"
"The vote by the House on the demanding motion before us will show that, no, we have decided not to throw in the towel."
"The call for a meeting of the Association Council on the human rights situation in Tunisia should be followed by real action..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not get carried away, please."
"This is the second time that Tunisia has stood in the dock before this House and one might well wonder what is behind this tenacity, especially as there appears, in the final analysis, to be almost no justification for it."
"Of course, the democratic process is far from complete in Tunisia, just as it is in a great many countries in the world, just as it was far from complete a century ago in our own countries if it comes to that, and we would never have brooked constant intervention by third parties."
"And yet, here is a country which can lay claim to many spectacular successes during its development - which is perhaps the first human right."
"Growth here hit 6% in 1998 and the benefits of it were spread fairly since poverty levels, as defined by the UNO, are running at less than 10%."
"Not every rich country can say as much."
"80% of Tunisians are homeowners, a third of the budget goes on social payments and another third goes on education."
"Plus, Tunisia is the first country in the Arab League to have abolished bigamy."
"This is the country which we keep on attacking for reasons which sometimes border on the ridiculous - and, Mrs Flautre, our attacks even include Mr Ben Brik, who should be considered as one of our main partners."
"One cannot help but see all this as some sort of strange put-up job and I should like to say to Tunisia that, even if Europe appears to be turning its back on it, France shall continue to treat it as one of its main partners."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, let me respond briefly to the four important debates which we have just held on human rights issues."
"First on Chile."
"The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament for the initiative taken in proposing various draft resolutions on the Pinochet case and the consolidation of democracy in Chile."
"I hope that in this case the Chilean justice system will continue to demonstrate independence and effectiveness."
"The Government of Chile has very wisely refrained from intervening in the independence of the judiciary."
"The Commission is, and always has been, fully committed to respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights and that is why the Commission has lent substantial and tangible support to the process of transition to democracy in Chile."
"Budget line B7-703 - democratisation process in Latin America - was created in 1990 in order to support the transition processes in Chile and also in Central America, and was later extended to all of Latin America."
"Our experience in Chile in the field of democracy and human rights has therefore been crucial for later projects in other countries."
"As the House knows, the European Union is in the process of negotiating an agreement establishing a political and economic association with Chile."
"I went to Santiago myself a few weeks ago just before the third round of negotiations with Chile."
"We had a large team of officials there."
"The negotiations went extremely well and I am delighted that we are picking up momentum in those negotiations, which I hope will have the conclusion which the honourable Member referred to."
"This agreement will, as he said, encompass the areas of political dialogue as well as trade and cooperation."
"In accordance with our negotiating mandate, we will insist that the agreement contains a democracy clause which will define respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights."
"We will also ask for the principle of the rule of law to be the basis of the agreement."
"I can already say that the Chilean Government seems in full agreement with this approach to our negotiations."
"Both the President and I spoke at the same conference in Chile and, I am pleased to say, made remarkably similar speeches on what should be the main focus of our efforts in following up the Rio Summit before the summit in Madrid which will take stock of the progress that has been made in our important relationship with the countries of Latin America."
"On Mozambique, a country which I visited a number of times when I was a development minister, the Commission is aware that Mozambique is at a crucial stage in the consolidation of its democracy."
"The tragic events of last month took by surprise not only the international community but also most of Mozambican society."
"The Commission has taken a number of initiatives calling for dialogue and conciliation."
"These included the discussions with President Chissano on his 16 November visits to President Prodi and Commissioner Nielson followed in Gabarone at the European Union SADC meeting with conversations with the Minister of Foreign Affairs."
"Public declarations were made after these events deploring the use of violence and supporting measures to bring to justice those found to be responsible for it."
"We understand that the European Union heads of mission have been following the political situation in the country closely."
"They met the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 8 December and we have been in contact with the presidency both in Europe and in Mozambique to gauge the appropriate level of European Union political initiative."
"Although I would not want to downplay it, the situation, despite being serious, does not appear to be out of control and there is some concern that outside interference could harm the chances of the two sides reaching some form of negotiated settlement."
"On the other hand, it is important that we insist that the results of the inquiries on all the deaths should be made public and the responsibilities made clear."
"We will, over the coming weeks, have to take account of the results of the dialogue between the two political leaders, or of the absence of such a dialogue."
"Obviously, we hope that the political leaders can meet and find a way out of the current impasse and we will be ready to support any useful forum for mediation in order to prevent future conflict."
"Several honourable Members referred to the situation of prisoners in Turkey."
"The Commission shares the concern expressed about the situation of those Turkish prisoners who are currently on hunger strike."
"The health situation of some of these prisoners is extremely alarming."
"The Commission urges the Turkish authorities to do their utmost to put an end to this worrying situation."
"We welcome the recent decision by the Turkish Minister of Justice to postpone the transfer of prisoners to F-type prisons, which were well described by the honourable Member, for an indefinite period of time and his wish to reach what I understand is called a ""social compromise"" on this question."
"The opposition to F-type prisons is one of the motivations of the prisoners currently on hunger strike."
"The Commission finally recalls that the improvement of detention conditions in Turkish prisons is addressed in the accession partnership for Turkey which was adopted by the Commission on 8 November and it is a condition therefore for accession."
"In the accession partnership document, the adjustment of the detention conditions to bring them into line with the UN standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners and other international norms is considered as a medium-term priority."
"Finally, honourable Members gave me the opportunity to present last June the Commission's position on relations with Tunisia during the plenary session."
"I was able to explain the reasons why the Commission considers it appropriate at this stage to make use of the positive instruments available under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, namely political dialogue and Community finance, in dealing with human rights in Tunisia."
"Since then there have been a number of developments, some good and some undoubtedly bad."
"Responsibility for prisons has been transferred to the Justice Ministry, certain political prisoners have been pardoned and the congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League passed off without incident."
"On the other hand, we have been informed of allegations of hunger strikes by political prisoners, the legality of elections to the new governing board of the Tunisian Human Rights League has been contested and action has been taken - as was mentioned during our debate - against Professor Marzouki and others."
"As to what we can do, I remain convinced, as I said last June, that we should use properly our positive partnership instruments to support all those working to improve human rights in Tunisia, and the honourable Member made an important point on this subject."
"Our heads of mission in Tunis are following the current court case closely and stepping up contacts with the Tunisian authorities on these cases."
"We are intensifying political dialogue with the country."
"On the financial front, and this responds directly to the important point made by the honourable Member and it is an area where we have some experience in other countries, Commission representatives in Tunis are stepping up their efforts to launch very soon two programmes: one in support of journalists and the other in support of non-governmental organisations."
"Lastly, I would like to mention the crucial role played by Parliament, which has contributed to raising awareness and intensifying dialogue in these issues through parliamentary visits and through public debates like this one."
"I hope this leads to an increasing convergence of positions on human rights with our Tunisian partners."
"Whatever the economic progress made, whatever the social progress in Tunisia, I know that Parliament will return to its concerns on these subjects as long as it has reason to express them."
"C√¥te d' Ivoire"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions."
"B5-0906/2000 by Sylla and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0912/2000 by Van Hecke, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0919/2000 by Mart√≠nez Mart√≠nez and others, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0927/2000 by Maes and Isler-B√©guin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0934/2000 by van den Bos and Dybkjaer, on behalf of the ELDR Group,"
"on C√¥te d'Ivoire."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, C√¥te d'Ivoire has got itself into a vicious circle and the situation is going from bad to worse."
"By playing with the concept of Ivorian identity in order to exclude Mr Ouattara from the political scene, the powers that be are paving the way for ethnic conflict."
"It is not just Mr Ouattara; rather all the people in the north, all the Muslims and anyone with a name which sounds vaguely foreign are subject to persecution and violence."
"The dozens of deaths over recent days make me fear the worse."
"If this policy continues, there will be a bloodbath, just like the bloodbaths we have seen in other countries."
"Laurent Gbagbo needs to introduce a real policy of national reconciliation by ending the discussion on Ivorian identity, revising the racist constitution and holding democratic elections open to all candidates; otherwise the risk of secession and civil war can only grow."
"How can a legislative election in which only 34% of the population voted and which millions boycotted claim a legitimate result?"
"We were delighted, Commissioner, at the departure of General Guei."
"If we wish to safeguard our credibility, we must be firm with Laurent Gbagbo in refusing to sanction this dangerous, uncontrollable slide off course."
"It is no coincidence that the OAU and numerous African Heads of State have condemned the concept of Ivorian identity outright."
"They know full well that an ethnic or separatist conflict in C√¥te d'Ivoire could throw the entire region into a state of unrest."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we must not stand by and watch."
"Mr President, as the honourable member, Mr Sylla, has just said, it was with relief that we welcomed C√¥te d'Ivoire's first steps on the path back to the rule of law with the recent presidential election and the failed attempt to keep General Guei in power."
"This hope was matched by the tremendous concern with which we have followed the recent events which have again plunged this beautiful country into bloodshed, with the threat of an ethnic and religious divide between the north and the south."
"We cannot but condemn this step backwards and call on the present leaders to allay fears before the violence and vengeance spiral out of control and cause the sort of devastation provoked by similar forms of discrimination at other points on the planet, including within the very heart of Europe, at the end of this century."
"The purpose of the European Union is to extend the area of peace and stability which its founding members set up on either side of the Rhine fifty years ago to the entire Union."
"This has only been possible through reconciliation and by respecting the identity of each of the communities which were once antagonists."
"What was once a dream has become reality."
"This is the challenge which now faces those in power in C√¥te d'Ivoire."
"Let us hope that they will have the courage to take it up and we shall spare no effort in helping them do so."
"Mr President, for months the news from C√¥te d' Ivoire has been causing justified alarm within European public opinion and the corresponding concern in our Parliament."
"That turbulent situation surprised many because it was taking place in a calm and relatively prosperous country, with institutions that functioned reasonably well and with a society living in a satisfactory degree of harmony."
"The traumatic events that have occurred there are a clear demonstration of the process of degradation that the whole of the African continent is experiencing."
"In C√¥te d' Ivoire the degradation has been dramatic in terms of the economy."
"The collapse of cocoa prices, the crushing weight of foreign debt and the increase in fuel prices, among other factors, have led to an internal situation of growing tension, a notable decline in the social climate and an increase in unemployment and poverty."
"Xenophobia found a good breeding ground in that environment with political forces prepared to use it for their own ends, focused around the concept of ivoirit√©, and making immigrants that had been established for decades the object of their hateful hostility."
"It was in this context that the military took power, which, as ever, only helped to aggravate the situation."
"Violence became widespread, particularly towards the immigrant population or towards natives of the north or neighbouring countries."
"The political process put together to recover democratic legitimacy did not fulfil the hopes that some had placed in its procedures."
"After a more than dubious presidential election, the European Parliament was determined to call for the legislative elections of 10 December to be free, fair and pluralist."
"We must now recognise that our demands have not been complied with."
"The most serious thing is that, in 32 constituencies, elections did not even take place, which makes the crisis of legitimacy even more obvious."
"We therefore need to create the political conditions to put an end to exclusion, to facilitate the participation of the RDR and other political forces in the democratic process and to ensure, at least, in these circumstances, while awaiting the elections in January, that a path can be opened up towards democratic normality."
"The problem is not to hold general elections at any cost."
"In order for the elections to really unblock the current situation, we first need to create the conditions for those elections to be held in a climate of civil peace and reconciliation."
"The conditions for this are: that no one should feel excluded, that the Supreme Court established by the military powers should disappear, and that the Head of State should be unequivocally involved in the process of restoring democracy and that the opinions of the Committee for national reconciliation should be heard."
"Mr President, as Mr Justice Stevens remarked only yesterday, it is not a good thing for the rule of law or democracy if judges intervene in the judicial process and rule out of account the votes for one side or another."
"That is exactly what has happened also in the C√¥te d'Ivoire, and in an even grosser way, as I understand it."
"We have seen an extremely unfair intervention in, and disruption of, a proper electoral process there."
"We in this Parliament must stand up for the rights of the people of C√¥te d'Ivoire - and everywhere else - to a fair and properly organised democratic system with a non-partisan judiciary."
"We are aware that in this case the European Union has some purchase through Article 96 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement."
"We are, with this motion, urging the Commission to use that leverage, and we hope they will."
"Mr President, we cannot subscribe to this condemnation of the xenophobic and ethnic racist policy of the C√¥te d' Ivoire administration without, at the same time, condemning the unspeakable policy of the French government authorities, which not only support the Ivorian president and his policies but which are also making diplomatic overtures to various governments on his behalf."
"This attitude is descended directly from France' s imperialist policy."
"Its leaders, whatever their political hue, have supported in turn the dictatorship of Houphou√´t-Boigny, the authoritarian and corrupt B√©di√© regime, the leader of the putsch, General Guei, and today Gbagbo, a would-be Socialist but in fact an out-and-out xenophobe."
"The French state could not care less what Ivorian leaders impose on their own people, provided that they faithfully serve the interests of the major French companies in C√¥te d' Ivoire which, both during and after colonialism, have always made huge profits by plundering the country and exploiting its working classes."
"Mr President, I am delighted at this opportunity to discuss Africa, something we do far too rarely."
"So for once, for pity's sake, let us refrain from highlighting, or even exaggerating, the rivalries which exist within young, vulnerable African nations."
"The democratic process in C√¥te d'Ivoire is well under way."
"The leader of the coup d'√©tat in December 1999 has been beaten in general elections - a remarkable feat which would have been unheard of twenty years ago - by a candidate who may rightly call himself the legitimate president of the Republic of C√¥te d'Ivoire."
"We should therefore regard those who contest the legitimacy of President Gbagbo as subversive elements and the Ivorian government is entitled to take this into account."
"Mr Ouattara is not Ivorian and it is perfectly normal, as it would be in each of our own countries, for C√¥te d'Ivoire to refuse to allow people who are not Ivorian citizens to hold office."
"The concept of Ivorian nationality would appear to me to be perfectly well founded."
"I would add that the third countries taking advantage of this situation to destabilise C√¥te d'Ivoire - presumably because they cannot control it - will not prevent democracy from making headway in Africa, especially in French-speaking Africa and C√¥te d'Ivoire, as it did in Senegal at the beginning of the year."
"It is to France's credit that it is supporting its partners and allies in this healthy development."
"This is an important debate."
"I want to make it clear that the Commission shares Parliament's view that the process of transition from military coup to elected government in C√¥te d'Ivoire has fallen, to put it mildly, far short of the sort of democratic standards that we want to see."
"The Commission deeply regrets that the presidential elections, which were already lacking in credibility following the declaration of ineligibility of some of the major candidates, were not at least partially compensated for by more open legislative elections which could have allowed all the population to express their democratic vote."
"This was certainly what the European Union had hoped for."
"After all, we had put out a statement on 28 October which calls on Mr Laurent Gbagbo ""to bring about the opening up of democracy for which the citizens of C√¥te d'Ivoire are clamouring""."
"The Commission is also very concerned by the recent violence."
"We are very concerned about the massacres which took place around the time of both elections, in October and at the beginning of December."
"We believe that there can be no national reconciliation until the responsibility for these acts is clearly established."
"The Ivorian authorities have promised to launch legal inquiries into October's events and an international investigation committee has also been constituted."
"In our view the same approach should be adopted to the recent violence and the inquiries should be pursued without delay."
"In view of the current situation the Commission intends to propose the opening of consultations on the basis of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"So I hope that will satisfy Mr MacCormick, although I thought that the shades of Mr Justice Brandeis and Mr Justice Frankfurter would have been slightly disturbed by the comparison between the Supreme Court and the judicial bench of C√¥te d'Ivoire."
"The purpose of these consultations will be to assess the situation in detail with our ACP partners, including C√¥te d'Ivoire."
"We will be aiming for an outcome which works to include all parties in the political system and reconciles the various sectors of the population, north and south, Muslim and Christian."
"These consultations will include a reassessment of the terms of European Union cooperation with C√¥te d'Ivoire."
"For the time being cooperation has been confined to direct support of the population and to civil society, especially through non-governmental organisations and by means of humanitarian aid."
"EUR 300 000 was allocated in the wake of the events of last October."
"We believe that this should be sufficient to cover medical needs related to the violence at the beginning of December."
"I hope that makes clear our concern about the situation."
"I want to assure Parliament once again that we will keep it fully involved with the outcome and the progress of the discussions on Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"You have covered many subjects this afternoon."
"We are extremely grateful to you."
"During the debate on the British submarine in Gibraltar you indicated that the Gibraltar Public Safety scheme document would be made available to colleagues of the House."
"Some half-a-dozen copies are now available from the President."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken in a few minutes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, please accept my apologies for the attitude that I have shown during the debate."
"As for the slanderous allusions directed at me, I have to say that it is not my normal attitude and that at no time did I wish to alter the normal conduct of the debate."
"Thank you, Mr Bautista Ojeda."
"The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Relating to the motions for resolutions on the Turkish prisoners"
"Mr President, I would like some clarification."
"We were completely in favour of passing a joint resolution at the close of this debate on Turkey."
"But, according to my information, all the other groups have withdrawn their motions."
"If that is the case, maintaining a single motion would be a mere formality, in which case I withdraw our group' s motion for a resolution."
"Please be so kind as to confirm that the other groups have indeed withdrawn their motions."
"Mr Wurtz, I too should like to be as sure as you would like to be, but, in the absence of any written document, I can only be sure they have been withdrawn if each of the political groups formally declares whether or not it is withdrawing its resolution."
"Mr President, I wish to follow the example of Mr Wurtz and formally withdraw our motion for a resolution as well."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Greens, we also withdraw our motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, formally, and not in writing, I withdraw the resolution."
"In that case, ladies and gentlemen, it is confirmed that the draft resolutions mentioned by Mr Wurtz have been withdrawn, and therefore this vote lapses."
"VOTE (continuation)"
"Mr President, I wonder if Commissioner Patten can explain to me how the Commission is going to help repair a submarine, which is what we really just voted on."
"As the honourable Member knows, I have already addressed the Parliament twice this afternoon on this issue, but what I discussed was the Commission's competence, not its omni-competence."
"Thank you, Commissioner Patten."
"EXPLANATION OF VOTE - Langen report (A5-0371/2000)"
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the report by Werner Langen on the global shipbuilding industry."
"We have done so because we believe that it is important that fair competition be established within the global shipbuilding industry, and that the way in which countries such as South Korea subsidise their shipyards is contributing to the destruction of shipbuilding around the world."
"Unfair competition could help destroy good shipbuilding environments and lead to the loss of know-how and jobs; in the long term it could result in a monopoly situation, which would not be beneficial to world trade."
"However, we cannot support the specific proposal to extend the scheme of operating subsidies for up to 2 years."
"We do not fundamentally believe that the problems of the shipbuilding industry can be solved by continuing to compete on the basis of the size of the public purse."
"However, our lack of support for the extension of the operating subsidies for up to 2 years is politically dependent on there also being fair competition internally within the EU."
"It is therefore important that the Commission monitors decisions very closely and intervenes if there are still cases of illegal state subsidies to shipyards internally within the EU."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.10 p.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats for what is practically a historic sitting, the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg."
"Indeed, it is my very great pleasure to chair this, the last sitting in the millennium, as the next time we meet within these walls it will be both a new century and a new millennium."
"Mr President, I should just like to make a slight correction to what you said: this is not our last Friday sitting in Strasbourg but our last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being."
"We decide our calendar of sittings each year, and I hope that this costly and erroneous decision will be reversed and that we will once again use the full five days in Strasbourg and do away with the expensive mini-sessions instead."
"I sense that we are going to have a whole new debate on the issue."
"Mr President, I can confirm what Mr Posselt has just said."
"This is not the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg."
"I deeply regret that the French Government has not appealed to the Court of Justice against the European Parliament decision, but I have no doubt that this decision will be overturned sooner or later."
"I imagine it refrained from taking action purely because such action was not timely under the French Presidency."
"The 1997 ruling, which re-established the annual timetable after an attempt by the European Parliament to withdraw one of the monthly sittings, was perfectly clear."
"The European Parliament has no sovereign right to determine its timetable."
"It must respect the Treaty, and the Protocol appended to the Treaty states quite clearly that the twelve monthly part-sessions are to be held in Strasbourg."
"The Advocate-General at the time clearly stipulated ""the 12 periods of monthly plenary sessions""."
"This phrase means that we must adhere to existing practice, which must not be changed."
"To put it in terms that we can all agree on, let us say that this is the last Strasbourg part-session of the second millennium, and we shall see what happens in the third."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, in the Minutes I am recorded as having voted in favour of paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Theato report."
"I did not, I abstained."
"I should be grateful if that could be corrected."
"The Minutes will be corrected as you suggest."
"Mr President, we had a group of visitors yesterday, and this group also attended the vote in the visitors' gallery."
"In the evening, we were unable to explain to them why this Parliament voted with only 170 Members in attendance."
"If, as a Parliament, we want to be taken seriously by the public, we will need to be present."
"Again, this morning, only a handful of people are attending."
"That is no reflection upon those present."
"Yesterday afternoon, too, only a handful of Members attended."
"I do not blame those present but rather those absent."
"At this rate, we will soon be unable to meet on a Thursday afternoon if so few people take part in the votes."
"I believe we need to do a bit of soul-searching here, and find out how we can ensure that at least a sufficient number attend when we meet on a Thursday afternoon."
"I shall take your speech as an appeal for more assiduous attendance."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Prosperity and intergenerational solidarity"
"The next item is the report (A5-0319/2000) by Mrs Sbarbati, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication 'Towards a Europe for all ages - promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity' ."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it was with great pleasure that I agreed to be the rapporteur of this major European Parliament resolution which deals with one of the greatest problems of our European Community: the ageing of the population."
"This issue requires considerable sensitivity on our part, and we must strive to create that intergenerational solidarity which is essential if we are to produce worthwhile, substantial holistic policies and bring about social security and social protection and, most importantly, to ensure that the idea that elderly people are not a burden on society becomes part of the cultural consciousness of society and that they are regarded as a resource: first and foremost a human resource but also a social resource, a cultural resource and, lastly, that it is recognised that the elderly have a great legacy of experience to pass on to future generations."
"These are the factors that motivated the entire Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and I to develop this resolution and enabled us to approve the result unanimously."
"I therefore thank all my colleagues for their contributions, including those made at the amendments stage, and also the committee's experts, for these contributions were very valuable for the finalisation of the resolution."
"The European Union took the problem on board in 1999, the year in which the United Nations proclaimed the International Year of Older Persons."
"We have now reached the stage of a Commission communication and are here today to vote upon a resolution."
"This stage is extremely important."
"We feel that a policy which actively tackles the issue of ageing population, which regards the elderly not as people who are about to die but as people who want and intend to remain alive - alive in their affections, alive in their professional capacities, alive in the will to communicate at all levels not just their feelings but also their professionalism and their experience - is the best way to create and develop new policies, in particular to encourage social cohesion and intergenerational solidarity."
"Clearly, there are complex issues to deal with: the issue of security, the issue of pensions and also the issue of care of the elderly which we have attempted to tackle, which I have attempted to deal with in this resolution as calmly and effectively as possible."
"The Member States must therefore make greater efforts: they must unite and tackle this issue together."
"Above all, they must ensure that the future of the third and fourth ages is guaranteed."
"The future may consist of a single day, minute or second, but it must be a day, minute, or second which is lived in the knowledge that the life before an elderly person is a whole life, not half a life. An elderly person is a worker who has ceased to work, the elderly are men and women who have reached the point where they are navigating their way through the final stage of their lives and who must be able to do so with the necessary serenity and with the recognition from all of us but, most importantly, the recognition from the world of politics and authorities that they are people."
"This must not be forgotten."
"This is the central theme of the resolution, which tackles different aspects of the issue ranging from leisure time to employment."
"In effect, when we talk of attitude, of learning and therefore of the willingness to be retrained and benefit from life-long training, we must ensure that this is a reality for the elderly as well, for older workers are often excluded from new working procedures and new technologies by technological progress."
"We therefore need extensive training to be available, non-discrimination in the workplace and non-discrimination during the time after retirement as well, when these workers, these people can enjoy the new wealth and new opportunities provided by all the time now available to them and live more serene lives."
"This is why we are moving in this direction and, in particular, why we are considering the older and very old people who, sadly, are liable to be affected by physical problems."
"Indeed, as we are aware, health does not last forever."
"The Member States must implement different policies to support these people, tackling both the issue of the care necessary and the issue of the reimbursement of expenses, especially for those invalids whose families are, in effect, unable to bear the whole of such a burden in the long term."
"Mr President, because of the demographic changes taking place in European society, we are forced to reconsider the role of older people, taking a holistic and long-term approach which aims to keep the elderly active or reintegrate them into working life, be it in a productive process or in the form of social action."
"This approach must include the guarantee of a dignified, independent, self-sufficient lifestyle."
"This sort of strategy calls for well-coordinated objectives and is based on intergenerational solidarity, respect and recognition of the different roles which citizens play."
"The problem which arises and the political action which we need to develop in this sector are particularly important at the present time, as the European Union endeavours to modernise its social model and fuse economic development with social progress, the quality of life and the social integration of all its citizens."
"These challenges are common to all European societies, albeit to some more than others; this applies in particular to my own country, Greece, which has the highest proportion of poor pensioners: around 31% according to Eurostat."
"We were delighted that the European Council in Nice adopted the social agenda and we hope that the Member States will take this opportunity to promote the development and coordination of social security and welfare systems for the elderly and to promote other measures, such as lifelong learning, which ensure that they have an active lifestyle."
"My political group has worked closely with the rapporteur, Mrs Sbarbati, and we are grateful to her for that."
"The report contains numerous common positions."
"We felt that it was particularly important to study the ageing phenomenon within various categories of older persons, because we realised that the elderly in towns face different problems from the elderly in island or rural areas of the European Union."
"We particularly supported the involvement of the elderly in various forms of voluntary work, without overlooking the need for social security in these areas, and we believe that the European institutions and the Member States should not miss the opportunity of conducting a broad information and awareness-raising campaign directed both at the government agencies responsible for applying social policy and society as a whole, because the citizens themselves must realise that a society needs intergenerational solidarity."
"Supporting the European Commission's initiative and enriching it through dialogue with Parliament will, I think, send a message to the people of Europe that the European Union is in a position to forecast change and crisis and to create a society of participation, cohesion and solidarity."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur."
"We agree largely with her ideas and we are satisfied with the result of the work of the committee."
"It is set against the background of the 'International Year of Older Persons' , as proclaimed by the UN, and it is also very important that attention has been focused in various places on how the situation of the elderly will develop in the future, for example, in the countries of the European Union."
"In my opinion, it is of primary importance that the elderly are seen as independent people and that they are supported as far as is possible in their independent active lives."
"All the countries of the European Union have the same problems and the same prospects."
"For us, the question is how we can keep elderly people in the job market and what that requires of the labour market in general."
"On the other hand, we see that, while the population is ageing and ageing in better health than ever before, there is a growing desire generally to stop work earlier."
"This means, then, that we have to take account of how the job market works for different people."
"How do we support older people so that they can remain in the job market for longer?"
"How do we organise life-long learning in such a way that older people also acquire the new information, new skills and, furthermore, motivation they need to remain in active employment?"
"In other words, there are complex factors involved that have to be considered when dealing with this issue."
"Very specifically, I would like to express a few views on ageing women."
"Everything that now concerns women in the labour market will obviously be visible in the future when they are getting older, for example in pension plans. As piecework, for example, is on the increase at present, this will be reflected in the fact that pension cover will decline in value."
"Although we have eventually reached a position where we have the same pay for the same work, we must remember that women need special treatment when it comes to social security as they have a different work history, and this must be taken into account as it will have implications later on, for example for their future pensions."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to speak on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"This is a most important topic, especially with a growing ageing population in Europe."
"The solidarity of different age groups and actors involved in this field is vital in this regard."
"One should emphasise that unity, not only between nations and regions but also between people, is an area in which the European Union has a very proud record, and this report emphasises that fact."
"Low employment of ageing workers is a matter that the European Parliament should have tackled far earlier."
"I am very pleased with the emphasis in the report on reviewing the tax and benefit schemes to provide incentives to take up job offers: this is an initiative that is welcome."
"Promoting life-long learning - a topic that has already been mentioned by another speaker - is a matter I also support."
"With new technology and distance-learning possibilities open to older people, real, new opportunities offer themselves to them and they should be allowed to take advantage of this."
"On social protection policies: in its work programme for 1999, the Commission paid particular attention to ways to reverse the trend towards early retirement, to explore new forms of gradual retirement and to make pension schemes more sustainable and flexible."
"On policies against discrimination and social exclusion: the social action programme sets out the Commission's intentions to explore the possibilities for developing new Community action programmes based on Articles 13, 129 and 139, as modified in Amsterdam, and that is something we all welcome."
"The attention given to medical and social research related to ageing is an excellent emphasis in the report."
"Perhaps - and I say this as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport - sport and exercise should have been given more emphasis to keep ageing people fit and healthy - but that is something I am sure the rapporteur is well aware of."
"I welcome the excellent initiative on the part of the rapporteur and give it every support on behalf of my Group."
"Mr President, 100 years ago, two of my relatives lived to be almost 100 and, in those days, the age of 110 was also reached, albeit sporadically."
"Those were the exception to the rule, for the large majority of people died at a relatively young age due to adverse conditions."
"Nowadays, an increasing number of people live longer thanks to better health care, provision of information, care, housing and pension schemes."
"Some researchers anticipate that people could actually live up to 120 years, but they invariably die earlier because a vital part of their body ceases to function."
"Provided we organise our care and social security well, we can allow an increasing number of people to reach the maximum age."
"Collective expenditure on public services prolongs our lives."
"Over the past decade in Central and Eastern Europe, we have seen a fall in life expectancy as soon as governments have withdrawn and left elderly people to their fate."
"The shortage of employees in a growing economy puts pressure on older people to stay in their jobs for longer."
"In fact, this shortage is being seized upon as an argument for increasing the pensionable age and for nipping in the bud such initiatives as there have been to lower it."
"That is a development in the wrong direction."
"Needless to say, people above the age of 60 or 70 can still do many useful things, but it is wrong at that age to make their income dependent on completed working hours."
"These people are far more useful as a bonding agent in society who help others function more efficiently."
"It is precisely in voluntary work that they can pass on their life experience and promote cooperation in their own living environments."
"By forcing them to continue in paid work, they cannot fulfil those useful tasks, and it is likely that their life expectancy will be reduced if we impose obligations such as these on them."
"I have a feeling that the aspects which I have mentioned, namely the importance of collective care and the importance of timely retirement, are considered to be of slightly less importance by the rapporteur and that, moreover, she is too optimistic about the possibility of the elderly thriving without our creating the social conditions to match."
"One way in which we could strengthen their position would be to adopt Amendment No 4, tabled by my colleague, Mr Alavanos, which aims to better adapt housing and transport to the needs of the elderly."
"I hope that the House will adopt this amendment."
"Mr President, I have to say that, although Mrs Sbarbati' s report contains valuable recommendations, it is your typical Friday morning report."
"But these recommendations continue to miss the mark."
"She urges Community action, whether that is appropriate or not."
"In this area of policy, European institutions hardly have any authority."
"It is mainly the Member States' governments at federal, provincial and local level which can put many of these recommendations to good use."
"We should not burden the European Commission with atypical work."
"In the next few decades, an ageing and greying population will emerge, caused by a falling birth rate and an increase in life expectancy."
"As a consequence, expenditure on health care and pensions will soar dramatically."
"The OESO has been carrying out research into this area for some years now and has published reports on this topic."
"Research in the Netherlands has shown that, up to the age of 50, the average cost of health care is approximately EUR 1 000 per person per year. This amount increases to EUR 4 000 for 75 year-olds and to around EUR 25 000 per year for 95 year-olds."
"To buck this trend will take time."
"After all, by excessively promoting the trend towards individualism, we have created a situation for ourselves where the elderly rely on care institutions to a far greater extent."
"By the same token, the cost of pensions in a number of Member States has grown out of all proportion."
"In its monthly report for July 2000, the European Central Bank as already issuing serious warnings."
"In some EMU countries, the cost amounts to twice the GDP."
"This is in addition to the government debt, which is already very high."
"To my great surprise, the report does not contain any specific recommendations on this matter."
"Many Member States will need to go on a serious economy drive and prioritise the setting up of funds in order to keep the cost of pensions affordable and to keep the rise in gross average earnings within limits."
"If this is not done, we will have no choice other than to reduce pension payments."
"Raising the pensionable age, as proposed by the European Commission, will certainly not prove sufficient as a measure."
"I share the rapporteur' s view that every elderly person deserves respect and appreciation."
"Unfortunately, we are up against it on virtually every score."
"A person only counts for as long as they are young, progressive and fashionable. It is exactly the life experiences and wisdom of the elderly which we need in our here-today-gone-tomorrow society."
"We need to change our pattern of thought right across the board."
"People need each other' s care and attention; they rely on each other."
"The basis for this outlook on life is the family, in which each human being grows up."
"What is bizarre is that, these days, the family is generally no longer considered to be the nucleus of society and appreciated for what it is."
"Here, too, individualism has taken its toll."
"Add to this the undervaluing of nurturing and caring responsibilities, which feeds the absurd thought that housewives are less productive."
"Their valuable contribution to our society is hugely neglected in this report."
"The plea to combat age discrimination at the workplace has my support although, once again, I wonder if an EU Directive is necessary."
"In my opinion, it would be preferable for Member States to address this problem by using their own legislative instruments."
"Finally, although the elderly can count on my sympathy and appreciation, I will vote against this report for the reasons cited above."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Sbarbati, for, as I have already said in committee, she has produced such a perfect report that even I would not have been able to improve on it."
"I therefore congratulate her, as do all the pensioners and elderly people to whom I owe seat no 274 in this Chamber!"
"I would like to draw your attention to paragraph 18 of the report, which calls upon ""the Member States to undertake the task of caring for older people who are in hospital and unable to look after themselves, or to reimburse the expenses of doing so to families who help them""."
"This amendment was tabled by myself, Carlo Fatuzzo, and accepted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I would stress the importance of this paragraph."
"In many of our Member States - in Italy, certainly, and, I am sure, in the United Kingdom, Greece and other States - we work extremely hard: we work from morning to night, getting up at six o'clock in the morning and returning home, tired, worn out, at eight or nine o'clock at night."
"The years go by: our work causes us to fall ill, we pay pension contributions and national insurance contributions; we pay rates and taxes."
"It is a common occurrence, in the latter years of life, for a worker to become very seriously ill, often a total invalid, needing assistance from everybody."
"And the State provides no financial assistance at all, not even for those who have no property and no income."
"And the worker, who has given everything to society, has to sell his house to pay for healthcare, to use up all his money and to see his family reduced to scrimping and saving, at the very moment when one would expect the State and other people to be supportive, during the last years of one's life, when everything looks black and the only ray of light is the help of one's neighbour."
"Let us therefore give hope to the elderly citizens throughout Europe by voting for this report, including paragraph 18."
"Mr President, the Commission communication is, I think, a milestone in the history of social policy because it marks the end of a period in which senior citizens were seen as a generation of outcasts or veterans."
"The rapporteur, who has examined the subject with a great deal of sensitivity, points out that we need to combat negative stereotypes and consolidate equality between the generations as a basis for a European social model."
"Thanks to her proposals for an active old age, society is enriched by a whole generation."
"Encouraging the elderly to take up roles which they can fulfil on a voluntary basis will help overcome the objections of trades union, which view any extension of working life with suspicion."
"At the same time, the report encourages us to revise other policies designed solely for younger generations and aims to awaken the interest of other age groups by redefining the participation of all ages in local economic and social life and redistributing income between them."
"This ambitious objective calls for a radical change in practices and the active involvement of the social partners."
"However, because the elderly do not form a homogenous group, as the communication rightly points out, it is mainly up to the social partners to put forward a system of classification of elderly people which meets modern requirements."
"It quite rightly combines this policy with the policy for the viability of pension systems."
"The redistribution of resources implied in the policy to modernise pension systems, an explosive problem, represents a further aim of the new policy for all ages."
"The proposal to make pension systems dependent upon demographic change in order to create a self-sustaining system is linked to a high level of employment among the elderly."
"However, extensive early retirement and various graduated terms of retirement presuppose a massive revision of these policies because not all of them are socially inspired."
"I should like to close with a word on medical care."
"A quality of life policy depends directly, especially in the case of the elderly, on the quality of medical care."
"The communication needs to clarify the problem of the increased cost of services from new medical technologies which create new forms of inequality in the face of illness and death."
"Mr President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has prepared an important report on the Commission communication."
"As the markets are only interested in young people and their purchasing power, it falls to politicians to attend to the issue of older people."
"In many EU countries it is being discussed whether existing pension rights and benefits can be safeguarded in the future."
"In many countries pensions have been promised although there are not the corresponding funds to pay them."
"When the single currency is introduced in the form of the euro and monetary policy is the same in all countries, those countries will be subjected to an enormous amount of pressure to cut pensions."
"Promises regarding pensions must be kept, but pensions must be secured with those countries' own funds without payment of the pension being protected at the expense of the EU' s common monetary policy."
"It is a guaranteed income that will give older and elderly aged people the greatest sense of security."
"Employment is also one of the basic human rights, and Mrs Sbarbati' s report has rightly brought attention to age-based discrimination and ageism in working life."
"It is politicians who must safeguard the notion of equality in employment: the markets cannot."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most important part of this report is where it calls on the Commission to table a proposal for a directive, implementing Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which would make discrimination on the grounds of age impossible. Discrimination does exist."
"There are countries in the European Union whose national health services will no longer pay for operations on people above a certain age, as if to say what use is this operation to this old person now?"
"In many cases rehabilitation following illness is no longer available to old people under the national systems."
"This is discrimination on the grounds of age."
"There is one Member State whose parliament has discussed whether voting rights should not be removed from the over seventies."
"The debate is over now, but this was discussed."
"In all of the Member States there are laws which quite simply forbid people above a certain age from working."
"This is discrimination on the grounds of age."
"Please do not come to me with the popular cry: ""But surely, then, we are taking away jobs from young people""."
"That reminds me of the debate in the sixties about keeping us women out of the labour market."
"Then, people also said that women must not work so that the men could."
"This was the line of argument taken by the unions for a long time."
"And they are still banging the wrong drum today."
"Can we not please finally put a stop to this!"
"Almost all of the speakers have mentioned the ""ageing workforce""."
"Mr Blokland has even spoken of ageing and greying."
"One colleague has said that it is not we who are living for too long, it is not our society which is too old, but that centuries ago people had to die much earlier than the good Lord had preordained in our genes."
"110 or 120 years is quite right!"
"Over the last 100 to 150 years we have experienced the greatest social revolution of all time, for our human life span has doubled."
"We have been given a second life."
"150 years ago, our average life expectancy was 40 years; today it is 80 years."
"A girl born today is likely to live for 100 years or more."
"We should not call this ageing or even ""greying"" ."
"Stop using these words, because that really is discrimination."
"The future of all of you is old age."
"I would advise you to make provisions for your future!"
"Mr President, like the rapporteur, whom I must congratulate, I too shall take as my starting point the obvious statement that, in terms of the population pyramid, Europe is an ageing continent."
"That may appear to be a handicap as far as many people are concerned, in the first analysis."
"My own personal opinion, and that of an increasingly large number of people, is that this may be an advantage if we can manage to do what is necessary in order to ensure that every citizen, regardless of age, remains a full citizen and that experience becomes once again a key value in a society which, in recent years, has favoured what is speedy, ephemeral and fashionable over what has lasted, time served and wealth of experience, not to mention what is human."
"Consequently, I can only be delighted, today, at the issue of this communication and this report aimed at building a Europe for all ages and promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity."
"The challenges, particularly the economic ones, are well known."
"I shall not harp on that subject."
"To face up to these challenges and transform these very real problems into real assets, I believe we need great determination and great moral, philosophical and political commitment. We also need considerable financial resources."
"This last point, of course, runs counter to the fashionable individualist ideology which advocates less public expenditure and less taxation on the working population."
"This is a miscalculation, considering the current and future demographic situation, and also considering the fact that today' s working population will be tomorrow' s non-working population, in economic terms."
"Finally, as far as I am concerned, and this is no doubt the most important aspect, investing in life is, in any case, a good economic investment, and adding life to the extra years is an approach which provides a foundation for human dignity."
"This alone gives meaning to the mathematical prolongation of life made possible by medical progress."
"The report is entitled 'promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity' , an aim we can only endorse."
"Unfortunately, apart from affirming a number of good intentions, for which we shall vote, there are several convoluted phrases which suggest that the elderly must attain this prosperity by working past the normal retirement age."
"Now then, it is not up to the workers to work for longer so that their contributions might compensate for the miserliness of the bosses who wish to stop the employer' s share of old-age pension contributions."
"We are absolutely opposed to anything that postpones retirement age, as we particularly have in mind the factory workers, many of whom are worn out well before the legal retirement age, even in countries where this age is relatively low."
"Indeed, how is it possible to promise the elderly prosperity and solidarity without affirming the right of every worker to have a decent retirement pension, and what I mean by a decent pension is their full wage?"
"We shall therefore abstain from the vote on this report."
"Mr President, I am pleased to be able to speak here during the last Friday sitting of this year, which will hopefully not be the last ever in Strasbourg."
"As a member of the Friday Club - which admittedly is not an official group but in practice does exist - I am one of the hosts of the Members present today, as you are, and I hope that we will also manage this next year."
"We really will have to find the ways and means to achieve this."
"As someone who is not yet a senior citizen, the following struck me about the report on a Europe for all ages, including the elderly: neither of my committees - the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities - lament the fact that our society is ageing; they welcome it."
"Mrs Flemming has rightly pointed out that it is positive that people are able to live for longer and at the same time stay healthy."
"What is negative is that many of them are sidelined, and it is also negative that many of them are forced to feel marginalised."
"The fact that people are discriminated against on the grounds of age was, of course, confirmed in my report on Article 13, which I was able to present to the House in October."
"Older workers are prevented from going on to further education and training courses; they are also prevented from acquiring new technical skills even though they would be capable of doing so."
"Their ability to learn and even their ability to innovate are denied."
"They are harassed at work, with the result that, in the end, they give in and allegedly retire from their job voluntarily."
"Measures need to be taken to combat acts of discrimination."
"These must be developed through model projects which, in turn, need to be supported by Community initiatives such as EQUAL."
"Mrs Sbarbati is right to call on the Commission to support the proposal to limit compulsory early retirement."
"I can amplify what she said with some comments on the German experience."
"The rules on early retirement, which were initially well intentioned on the part of politicians, were seriously abused by some companies."
"They accepted payments - the whole of society was therefore involved - and older workers retired, but younger workers were not taken on and many jobs were shed."
"If we talk about finance, anyone who retires from working life is entitled to a pension and not to be discriminated against with people saying, ""You are getting a pittance""."
"However different the national pensions systems are in Europe, they should all be earnings- and performance-related."
"I hope that there will be information campaigns in the Member States encouraging older people to get involved in society, in cultural and social activities, in community centres, in caring for children and the elderly, in associations and clubs."
"We need these people and not only the young, dynamic and successful people!"
"Another part of an effective strategy is to foster an intergenerational dialogue."
"I am thinking of encounters in seminars and evaluation of best practices, where older people can pass on their knowledge and experience to younger people in the company."
"Many people are younger at 70 than others are at 17, who only want to go with the flow and not upset anyone or attract attention."
"Anyone who is satisfied with the average will never embark on the adventure of a committed life."
"The countless active elderly people should motivate us all to fight for a society in which the phrase intergenerational solidarity is not just empty words!"
"Mr President, the report which we are discussing here bears the attractive title, ""Towards a Europe for all ages - promoting prosperity and intergenerational solidarity"", and concerns the Commission's communication on this matter, which is already one and a half years old."
"Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs worked very hard to table its very long motion for a resolution."
"At my advanced age I am, of course, pleased that it says in the motion that the vast experience and skills of older people need to be used; this means that even when people are over 75 they should not be consigned to the scrap heap."
"As part of efforts to combat discrimination on the basis of Articles 13 and 137 of the Treaty, there is a campaign for measures to be introduced to ensure that older people are no longer excluded from the workplace, which is actually saying that the obligatory age limit and also compulsory early retirement are discriminatory."
"In this context, the Commission is then even called upon to draft a proposal for a directive which should make it possible to combat discrimination specifically on the grounds of age."
"Obviously we need to be careful that we do not contradict ourselves in the many long resolutions which we adopt here."
"You see, on the one hand, we are saying that we wish to use obligatory age limits to get rid of the elderly so as to free up jobs for young people, but, in other areas, we are almost demanding the abolition of obligatory age limits."
"I do not necessarily think that all women should go out to work either, because we are after all calling for the labour force penetration rate of women to be increased through changes in family and tax policy."
"I do not believe that all women - or all men - should have to go out to work if they decide to have a career break or to stop working in order to devote themselves to their family."
"Family and tax policy should be designed to ensure that men and women who have family commitments are free to decide whether they wish to go out to work or not."
"I am glad, however - and Mrs Flemming referred to this case of discrimination - that women are no longer discriminated against in this way now."
"When I started working for the unions I was told that I would be dismissed if I were to get married."
"As a result I am unfortunately still single today!"
"If we really want to do something for older working women, then the pension companies in the Member States should be called upon to rectify the disastrous consequences of the wage discrimination which women were exposed to until 1975 by virtue of the fact that they were paid - entirely legally - only 80 or 90% of men's wages. They should be called upon to eradicate this discrimination, which has a knock-on effect on the pension, by using 100% of a man's salary at the time as a basis for calculating the pension."
"This really would be a good thing, and in so doing the consequences of such dreadful discrimination would be removed."
"I have one final point: I should like to distance myself from paragraph 18 of the motion for a resolution."
"Surely we cannot call upon the Member States to undertake the task of caring for people in nursing homes."
"I believe that it is for the Member States to decide - in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity - how to resolve this problem, whether it be through a nursing insurance scheme or in other ways."
"I will, of course, be voting in favour of the report, but I thought it important to clarify these points."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Sbarbati, on her excellent report."
"This is a serious, thorough study of the problems faced by the elderly, but it is also a bold, innovative report in terms of the proposals it puts forward to promote the active participation of the elderly in working, social and cultural life."
"The ageing of the population is, today, an indisputable fact which places considerable pressure on the social security systems of some Member States."
"Enabling our citizens to age in an active and healthy way is one of the great challenges of our times and requires Community policies to match national social security and public health systems."
"We cannot simply limit the issue of intergenerational solidarity to the financial sphere. We must foster a global vision of support for the elderly and for their families, particularly for women who look after elderly people."
"Our current social model makes a cult of youth."
"This is a deeply ingrained idea, which thoroughly pervades all areas of social life and which must be combated through the effective practice of intergenerational solidarity."
"Given the significant increase in life expectancy as a result of the enormous medical progress that we have seen, particular attention must be paid to demographic developments in the population."
"We must produce a coordinated strategy for employment in conjunction with measures to counter discrimination on the grounds of age and modernise pensions and health schemes."
"It is crucial that we develop concrete policies and specific programmes for the various categories of elderly people."
"These measures will have to be appropriate to the different specific circumstances of elderly people in terms of standards of living and financial self-sufficiency."
"Because we cannot treat unequal situations equally, Member States will have to provide a response to the situation of elderly people who are completely bereft of savings and who are completely dependent on the help and care of relatives or others, and they will also have to ensure that a form of insurance is created that guarantees the elderly the right to see out their days with dignity and serenity."
"Mr President, my father, Robert Purvis, is 90 and not too well just now."
"He is much of the reason why I am here - an MEP, a Scotsman, a European."
"In the early 1930s he spent much time in Germany."
"He had good German friends."
"He witnessed and worried about the rise of Nazism."
"While I was very small he was away for long periods, parachuted into southern Serbia to support the brave fight of the royalist Serbs against Nazism."
"Next he parachuted into the Hautes-Alpes of France to fight with the Maquis and prepare that part of Europe for liberation."
"I have photographs of him as the tricolour was raised anew in Mont-Dauphin and Brian√ßon."
"Immediately after the war he went back to Germany to help restore agriculture and food supplies in North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein."
"My brother and I joined him there."
"We played in the rubble of Hamburg, we made good German friends in our turn."
"On my first day in this Parliament, in 1979, one of our then German colleagues approached me. ""Are you Purvis?"""
"""Yes."""
"""I remember rocking you on my knee in your kilt in Hamburg in 1946."
"We so respected your father,"" he said."
"""He could have taken advantage of us but he didn't."
"He did all he could fairly to share out scarce resources and restore our country."""
"Father is in his 90s."
"I am in my 60s, my children in their 30s, my grandchildren between 0 and 5 - four generations of a Scottish and a European family."
"It is this European Union, this Parliament, that are our families' guarantee that the peace and security for which my father has fought and worked in his lifetime will indeed continue for future generations - the solidarity of generations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like on behalf of the Commission to congratulate the rapporteur and the two committees on this report."
"I am particularly pleased because it shows that the Commission and the European Parliament are to a large extent in agreement and have developed a common understanding of the challenges of ageing."
"The debate has shown that there is broad agreement on the appropriate political response to this in the fields of employment, social security, health and social integration."
"We are certainly facing tremendous challenges."
"Only a sustained and joint effort can help us to meet them."
"I think that it is important to preserve a high degree of consensus so that we succeed in adapting to the process of ageing in our society in an appropriate way."
"Secondly, I should like to stress the significance of this communication."
"It is true that the communication contains few specific proposals for measures and initiatives."
"However, it does offer an innovative diagnosis of the greatest challenges of ageing, out of which emerges an extremely important compilation of suitable political responses, responses to issues relating to employment, social security, health and social integration."
"Ensuing Commission proposals have adhered rigidly to this roughly sketched out agenda."
"It will undoubtedly also provide further information about political trends in the future."
"Concerns about closing the age gap in Europe's performance balance sheet have been reflected very strongly in the employment process, from the guidelines to the recommendations to the NLP and peer review procedures."
"They were also plain to see in the plans for the Community initiative EQUAL and in the allocation of ESF funds from 2001 to 2006."
"What is more, age-related issues are amongst the most important objectives setting the agenda in the new process of cooperation in the field of social protection."
"In the most recent communications on pensions, the central idea has been ""mobilising society's full potential"", because raising the employment rate of older people who are fit to work is crucial to providing sustainable pensions in an ageing society."
"Initiatives in areas such as equal opportunities, equal treatment and social integration are similarly outward signs of aspects of an active ageing scenario."
"At this stage, I should like to emphasise that the directive on equal treatment in the workplace, which was adopted on 12 October 2000, bans discrimination on the grounds of age."
"Future initiatives in the field of public health are directed more at health- and care-related issues in old age and at promoting healthy ageing."
"Finally, part of the fifth framework programme for research provides for investigations into issues associated with old age, including the effects on health of an active lifestyle in old age."
"It is therefore clear that the political paradigm of active ageing is reflected in many important initiatives and we can safely assume that it will inspire a raft of further initiatives in the future."
"With your permission, I will, in conclusion, respond to a number of points where Parliament has expressed concern about the effects of the measures proposed by the Commission."
"A constantly recurring concern in your report was whether an emphasis on political measures promoting active and healthy ageing did not necessarily mean poorer conditions and fewer rights for people in need of care, for the very old and for those unfit for work."
"I should like to give you explicit assurance that this is certainly not the Commission's intention."
"Quite the opposite: in the communication, the Commission has laid great stress on the assertion that political measures should address the differences between people."
"Early retirement must remain an option for those who are no longer fit to work."
"Not everyone can or should retire voluntarily from working life."
"There must be discretionary powers for individual preferences and decisions."
"Furthermore, in our view, over-emphasising active political measures has precisely the opposite effect."
"In fact it is a precondition for our ability to find sufficient resources for those in need of care, so that the wealthy amongst us are willing and able to pay higher contributions and become more independent in old age."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Relating to Amendments Nos 2 and 3:"
"Mr President, I have accepted both Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 3 tabled by Mr Pronk, in which he calls for the text to be amended and insists on the concept of development of the population rather than ageing of the population."
"The problem is that, insofar as we as the European Union are concerned, we cannot talk about development because we do not have genuine population development: the birth-rate is extremely low while the proportion of elderly people is increasing."
"Therefore, the proposal - which I think Mr Pronk has accepted - is to talk about a rise in the average age of the population, as this will avoid a concept which might appear negative and describe the notion in the most precise and most appropriate terms."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATION OF VOTE"
"Mr President, this is the last explanation of vote of the year 2000 and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and the other Presidents for your patience in listening to me throughout the year."
"The year 2000 did not start off on a good note for Carlo Fatuzzo: in the spring my wallet and credit cards were stolen in Barcelona, during the summer my new bicycle was stolen in Strasbourg and in the autumn my diary and address book were stolen in Brussels."
"However, today the Sbarbati report which helps the elderly has been adopted, and this has raised my spirits and brought a smile back to my face."
"I would like to close by saying to Mrs Flemming, sitting here next to me, that the fact that we are living longer does not mean - as you so rightly said, dear Mrs Flemming - that we get older. It means that we get younger!"
"In fact, once upon a time, a 40-year old would have been considered to be old, and today they are young."
"You are a young woman, Mrs Flemming, and if I were not married I would ask you out!"
"(Laughter and applause)"
"If anyone finds any of these missing objects, would they please return them to Mr Fatuzzo, especially his glasses, because, Mr Fatuzzo, Mrs Flemming was sitting behind you."
"Promoting agricultural products on the internal market"
"The next item is the report (A5-0385/2000) by Mr Dary, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion for agricultural products on the internal market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Commission proposal aims to bring together under a single instrument the twelve promotion schemes which are currently applied on a sector-by-sector basis with each following its own rules."
"This approach is a welcome one, and is similar to that already employed to promote agricultural products in third countries."
"The proposal concerns both product information and production methods."
"It avoids overlap with the advertising and promotional activities of businesses in the sectors and of public authorities."
"The idea is to emphasise areas where a European approach is appropriate such as the provision of information on the intrinsic characteristics of products, including quality, nutritional aspects, organic production, etc. This should enable complementary measures to be taken, inevitably producing synergies."
"The proposal has certain immediate advantages: a single system providing information and promotion for all agricultural products and production methods; measures enabling the rationalisation of proper consumer information on foodstuff products; the decentralisation and general use of specifications for the sectors concerned."
"However, whilst the proposal as a whole appears relevant and well structured, I consider that it may be appropriate to clarify and improve certain aspects in order to enable the potential benefits to be fully exploited."
"My fellow members of the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on the Environment did as much, and the text has been enhanced by the proposed amendments which have been adopted."
"Let me list some of these. We thought it important to include production methods in this information campaign as they are crucial to product quality."
"I also think it essential to provide for a greater financial contribution by the Community in the event of certain specific circumstances which would justify this, for example, a serious market crisis or marked Community interest."
"As regards the procedures to be followed in applying this regulation, calling on the various existing competent management committees does not seem to me to be the most appropriate approach, given the horizontal nature of this initiative."
"The establishment of an ad hoc management committee has been proposed, which would have competence for the promotion of agricultural products."
"Lists and guidelines should be drawn up more regularly."
"A period of two years has been suggested in order to ensure that the system retains a certain flexibility, the same interval as that proposed for the Commission to issue a report to the Council and to Parliament, assessing the implementation of the proposal and examining, among other things, the utilisation of appropriations and possible budgetary requirements."
"Moreover, given that it is for the trade bodies to take the initiative with regard to the measures to be proposed, the latter should not be confronted with guidelines that are too inflexible and would them in a straitjacket rather than providing them with a framework."
"The new arrangements should therefore not become effective until 2002."
"It would therefore be appropriate to set as the date of entry into force of the regulation the date of adoption of the implementing regulation, so as not to lose the appropriations available in 2001."
"Finally, a reference to the possibility of actions to promote products of the most remote regions and their logo should be explicitly reinserted into the text."
"Thus amended, the proposal would deserve our support."
"A coherent product promotion policy is one of the tools making it possible to put European farm models into practice effectively."
"It is also a major tool for communication with consumers who, these days, no longer know what food they can trust."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, our chairman today reminded us that he was chairing the last sitting of this millennium."
"Let me draw your attention to the fact that the vote on this report will also be the last one this year."
"Perhaps this fact will instil a spirit of unanimity in us, which would, doubtless, knowing the great-heartedness of the Commission, lead it to accept all our amendments."
"Thanks you, ladies and gentlemen, and may I wish everyone in the Chamber today a very happy festive period."
"Mr President, in principle, the Committee on Budgets backs the Commission proposal too."
"It is still necessary to promote agricultural products, particularly as the price of agricultural products has fallen, and this price reduction has certainly not been fully offset."
"The opinion of the Committee on Budgets differs from that of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on a number of scores."
"First of all, the Committee on Budgets is of the opinion that agricultural products not intended for consumption should be promoted as well as those intended for consumption."
"All agricultural products will need to be promoted."
"Unfortunately, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has rejected this proposal."
"My group has re-submitted it under Amendment No 27, and I would like to recommend it to you warmly."
"In addition to the standard promotion activities, we believe that a number of aspects will need to be highlighted."
"Firstly, it should be pointed out how good agricultural products, such as fruit, milk etc. are for you."
"Another aspect to be highlighted is the animal-friendly and environmentally-friendly production methods used in Europe."
"How can we explain to European farmers that they are to be ever more restricted in their activities and that they should employ animal-friendly production methods, while at the same time our borders remain open to products from farmers who do not need to use these methods?"
"We need to emphasise the European aspects to the general public."
"The Committee on Budgets already holds the view that if, in the context of the WTO negotiations in 2003 or later, a number of export refunds and other export amounts are reduced, the European Commission should ensure that a portion of those refunds and amounts are ploughed back into further promotion activities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the WTO working group and as someone responsible, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, I can only congratulate the Commission on this report and on this initiative, because it is far-sighted in already anticipating developments, which bodes well for the future."
"In the WTO negotiations we will come under strong pressure to reduce export refunds, and cuts in this sector will be very likely."
"That is why it is very important to achieve a balance here, and this can be developed very effectively through the promotion and publicity measures."
"This sector is, of course, included in the ""green box"", and it would, of course, make it possible for us to present European products on the world market in an entirely new and much more intensive way."
"I see great opportunities for quality European products here."
"Ultimately this is also support for rural areas, on which, after all, we spend 10% more today, a sign that these regional economies should also be receiving more support, so that, on the one hand, the theory ""think global, act local"" can very well be asserted but, on the other, the world market is not disregarded either."
"It is precisely in the food sector - but also in the agricultural non-food products sector - that we have good opportunities in the future here, and we should therefore make the most of them."
"This means, then, that, in the future, the existing 12 categories of products will not be the only ones to be the subjects of promotional campaigns but that the arrangements will be extended to all agricultural products."
"So, Mrs Lulling, there will be opportunities here in the future not only for grape juice but also for wine."
"We should also set ourselves a target."
"We ought, in fact, to ensure that food production in Europe has an aim, and this actually follows on very well from the preceding debate."
"You see, we want to use our food to keep people healthy into old age."
"We want to stay healthy, and food is the overall basis for healthy living."
"That is why I am also pleased that, this week in the European Parliament, we have set up a working group on biotechnology."
"We want to address health-related issues in detail."
"We also believe that particular account ought to be taken here of organic farming and production and that, of course, Europe will be able to make considerable progress on the international scene with its brands and designations of origin."
"A trend which has become increasingly pronounced recently is e-commerce."
"I believe that here too there is scope for us to take action with agricultural products."
"It is expected that, by the year 2003, 80% of the European population will in all likelihood be connected to the Internet."
"Obviously, this represents a great opportunity for rural areas because the physical distance separating them from the large centres will become insignificant, and new opportunities are emerging which, at the end of the day, need to be taken."
"Another important area is, of course, further education and training."
"I believe that where marketing, sales and training programmes are concerned, life-long learning ought to take centre stage much more, because it is precisely the new technologies - handling product promotion using modern logistics - which will open up entirely new possibilities."
"Cooperation between industry, agriculture, trade and consumers is therefore of paramount importance here, and I would be glad if we were able to achieve new standards of cooperation in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to pay tribute to Mr Dary' s feat: he not only succeeded in having his report on bananas adopted yesterday, but has also managed today to bring the last five-day part-session in the second millennium to a close."
"Mr Dary, bravo, you have mastered the art of communication, and this is precisely the reason why you were appointed to draw up the report before us right now."
"On a more serious note, I should like to emphasise the value of this proposal for a Council regulation on information provision and promotion for agricultural products on the internal market."
"The rapporteur presented the main points just now."
"I should just like to add, at this time when BSE is highlighting a number of abuses in forms of agriculture which place the emphasis on high productivity, that it is especially appropriate to raise the profile, within the internal market, of the specific qualities of agricultural products by including, as the rapporteur suggests, indications of production methods."
"For, while European agriculture may reasonably expect to be a force to be reckoned with on international markets, the fact nonetheless remains that its future is still linked to a greater extent to penetration of its own internal market, which comprises 370 million consumers today and will probably number almost 500 million tomorrow."
"From this point of view, campaigns for information provision and promotion, cofinanced by the European Union and the Member States, are essential both to help restore the somewhat tarnished image of agriculture in the eyes of consumers and, moreover, to bring about recognition of the excellent quality of the very great majority of our agricultural products."
"Of course, such institutional information campaigns must rather complement the advertising activities undertaken in particular by major distributors."
"There must be periodic campaigns targeted at specific populations or consumers in general in order to highlight aspects relating to, for instance, food safety, traceability, nutritional quality, the specific characteristics of production methods, or indeed the efforts made to promote animal welfare."
"And while such campaigns may achieve the desired objectives in relation to consumers, we must not for all that underestimate the concomitant impact they will have on the producers themselves, who will see them as a reward for their efforts and an incentive to continue them."
"Mr Dary, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has complied with your various recommendations."
"We now hope that Parliament will fall in line with them across the board, and I, of course, urge my own group to give you its complete support."
"Mr President, first of all, I want to make it clear that I am not speaking on behalf of the whole of my group, but only on my own behalf."
"I fear too that I am going to disappoint the rapporteur, for there is no unanimous backing for this report."
"It is about how the system of sales promotion measures is to be changed."
"I think it is wrong in principle to have such measures in the European Union."
"It cannot reasonably be the taxpayers' and the European Union' s business to finance advertising campaigns to encourage people, for example, to buy tulips or eat more apples."
"This is properly a matter for producers, retailers and trade associations, not the European Union."
"I think we ought now to have taken the opportunity to phase out the system rather than change and consolidate it."
"It is also important to point out that there are serious faults in this aspect of agricultural policy."
"At present, so much support is being given to production that an enormous volume of certain articles is being produced, for which there is no market."
"There are no purchasers."
"If agricultural products are not quite simply to be destroyed, this leads to export subsidies having to be introduced, which destroy the agricultural market in other countries, or advertising campaigns financed by taxpayers."
"The system of sales promotion measures is part of what is wrong with the system for the EU' s agricultural policy."
"I believe it is the fault in the system that ought to be tackled."
"No special payments must be made for products for which there is no demand, and the latter must not be advertised."
"There are too many elements of the planned economy in this system."
"I shall therefore be voting against this report."
"Mr President, if I read it right I am the last speaker in the debate from the floor of the House."
"As a child, my father was quite fond of talking himself."
"He used to accuse me of wanting to have the last word."
"It appears that I am having the last word here not only in this debate but in the millennium from the floor of this House, so he would be quite proud of me if he was still alive."
"In any case, we have had widely divergent views expressed here."
"I want to congratulate the Commission on bringing forward this proposal."
"The rapporteur has researched this area very thoroughly and made an excellent report even if I might not agree with all of it, and he pointed out that it seems we did not do so well in the past."
"Spending under the last programme actually fell between 1997 and 1998."
"We have to ask ourselves why we failed in the past to get industry in the European Union to take up the money that was available."
"Obviously, we have some learning to do."
"I agree that we should spend money on this subject."
"The consumers need correct information and they need reassurance."
"I sincerely hope that it is not anyone's ideological view of what is safe and right that will be put forward, but information with a proper scientific basis."
"Organic farming is fine as far as it goes."
"I have nothing against it."
"I was an organic farmer myself at one time, because everyone was an organic farmer when I started farming at 15 years of age, which is some time ago."
"What the consumers of Europe should understand today is that food was never so cheap as it is now."
"It was never so plentiful as it is now."
"It was never as safe as it is today in spite of some of the problems that still exist and will probably continue."
"There is another point we should remember."
"Everyone in Europe has enough to eat for the most part."
"Everyone has sufficient food, so if we advertise one product it will obviously militate against the consumption of another product."
"The European Commission has to be extremely careful."
"If dairy products and beef, on which we spend an awful lot of money and indeed sheepmeat as well, although we do not have surpluses of it, are advertised with public money to compete with products which are not subsidised like pig meat and poultry meat, then obviously we are upsetting the balance of the market and doing an injustice to some of our producers."
"We must be extremely careful about that."
"Mr R√ºbig points out that there are so many things we can sell abroad."
"That is extremely important because, as time goes by, we will not be allowed to continue our old practice of producing low-quality products and selling them highly-subsidised, unprocessed and with no value added on foreign markets."
"In a world where the population is growing by 80 and 90 million a year, there must be a market for European food, because no place in the world is better suited to the production of food and no farmers in the world know better how to respond to opportunities than European farmers."
"There must be a future there."
"Mr Mulder is right when he said that the common agriculture policy is designed not only for food but also for the social objective of keeping the maximum number of people in rural areas."
"By using modern technology and using modern science and modernising our industry, we have made food available to the poor at the right price."
"This was never done when we were producing organically."
"Of course, if we can produce and promote food that is better for the environment and takes animal welfare into consideration, and sell that on world markets, then we will be really fulfilling the vocation for which the common agricultural policy was intended."
"Mr President, before I move on to speaking about the report, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dary, very warmly."
"My thanks also go to the other Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as well as to the other committees which have worked on this."
"The proposed measures are intended to replace the 12 sectoral promotional schemes which the Council has adopted over the years."
"The existing schemes, which lacked uniformity, will thus be harmonised and simplified."
"We are adopting the same concept of promotion here which is already applied outside the European Union."
"The Union is thus providing itself with a flexible promotional tool in the internal market too, which can be used across the board."
"This means, therefore, that the old product-based strategy is being replaced by an approach with a greater thematic emphasis."
"These promotional campaigns at European level can usefully complement Member States' measures by taking up the following themes: for example, quality, nutritional aspects, food safety, labelling, traceability, protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications, organic or integrated production methods, and so on."
"This concept of thematic information provision and promotional measures complementing national and regional measures requires strong commitment on the part of the Member States, in the form of co-financing and support for administering and monitoring the measures to be implemented."
"Having analysed the amendments, we can distinguish three groups: firstly, amendments which the Commission can accept; secondly, amendments which are superfluous because the proposal is worded in such general terms - as befits a framework regulation - that they are actually already covered; and thirdly, a group of amendments which the Commission also rejects because they either do not fit into this proposal or would have undesired consequences."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 10, which call for information on the production methods used for agricultural products and foods to be included in campaigns of this kind."
"As regards Amendment No 5, which calls for general guidelines by means of which only the essential elements of the programmes concerned are defined, the Commission is open to the possibility of including this idea in the wording of Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the proposal."
"It can also accept Amendment No 18 and the first part of Amendment No 24, which reduce the time interval at which the eligible themes and products are reviewed from three to two years, so as to improve the efficiency of the promotional tool."
"These are the amendments which the Commission can accept."
"I now turn to the amendments which are already covered by the proposal and are therefore not accepted."
"These are the second part of Amendment No 2 and Amendments Nos 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31 and 32."
"The Commission quite understands the thinking behind these amendments, but we feel that the general nature of this draft regulation is sufficient."
"Moreover, some of these ideas will be taken up again in the implementing provisions."
"I should like to comment briefly on the second part of Amendment No 2 and Amendments Nos 11, 13 and 28."
"An explicit reference to regional origin or other specific information would excessively limit the scope of the regulation."
"Amendment No 25 must also be rejected."
"Regarding the issue of when the new arrangements should come into force, the Commission is, however, prepared to consider transitional arrangements."
"The final group of amendments which the Commission cannot accept are amendments which are at odds with the proposal, those which could have unwelcome consequences and those in which administrative procedures are proposed which are not customary practice."
"I will take the amendments one by one. Amendment No 1 is legally incorrect because Article 299 of the EC Treaty can only be applied for derogations from other articles of the EC Treaty."
"This is not the case here."
"Amendments Nos 3, 16 and 17 and the second part of Amendment No 24 could give rise to misunderstandings about the aims of our promotion policy."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 33 cannot be accepted because, given the limited funds available, they would make the EU share of the co-financing simply too great."
"They would also reduce the other partners' share of the responsibility."
"All we can say to Amendments Nos 9 and 22, which call for a special management committee to be set up, and Amendments Nos 7, 19, 23 and 27, where further procedural changes are sought, is that the Commission has to be consistent with its procedural provisions."
"Overall, I am pleased that the proposal has met with your broad support."
"Consequently, thanks to your help and your opinion, the Community will soon be in a position to implement an important new promotional tool."
"Mr President, my apologies for interrupting you."
"I appear to be the last speaker in the year 2000, although not by design."
"I noticed a rather unusual mistake in the second part of the report by the Committee on Budgets which should, I think, be corrected."
"In the Greek text Mrs Jutta Haug is referred to as a male rapporteur and Mr Markus Ferber is referred to as a female rapporteur."
"I should imagine that this double sex change in a day and without surgical intervention is the first of its kind and it deserves a mention in the Guinness Book of Records, unless of course the necessary corrections are made and all changes of sex avoided."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES"
"Mr President, in my speech I simply ran out of time before I could wish colleagues a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."
"I should like to do so now."
"The second point that I wanted to make is that despite the critical remarks which, as you know, I also made clearly in my speech, we are glad that this report has been adopted and that the Commission is getting this scheme off the ground."
"Because it is actually true that it is certainly necessary, but also right, to promote the European model of agriculture."
"All those who say that you can still tuck in in style in Europe are right."
"And people should do so on special occasions."
"But this does not in any way change what I said clearly just now, that we also need to pay attention to the small details, that we must not forget the superior culture of a European agricultural policy which is geared towards social and ecological concerns, and that we should always check measures to ensure that they are also having the desired effect."
"I should like to follow up on one further point."
"To return to set-aside, if you looked, you would be able to see that, in practice, set-aside is not caused by crop rotation, but that farms are leasing poor land to use as permanent set-aside and are farming the other crops in the rotation even more intensively and with even greater use of chemicals."
"This means that the whole point of set-aside, which was originally intended in 1992 to make crop rotation more environmentally friendly, is turned completely on its head."
"Here we can see how small changes can yield considerable results in practice."
"That was my petition this morning."
"I wanted to point this out."
"Now that we are all convinced that we need to reach a turning point in agricultural policy, I hope that we will also sit down together and do our homework so as to put right these small details, something which is urgently necessary."
"Season's greetings to you all!"
"Thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for your good wishes."
"Mr President, as the chairperson of the European Parliament Intergroup on Wine: Tradition and Quality, I am obviously especially pleased that information provision and promotional activities in favour of agricultural products may also now apply to quality wine-growing products."
"When we discussed the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine in this House, we tabled amendments in an - unfortunately unsuccessful - attempt to insert a chapter on the promotion of wine products into this organisation of the market."
"I now have some small consolation, because we must not, in third countries where there is a demand backed by purchasing power for high quality wine products, leave the field clear for the wine producers of some third countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States, to name but a few, who have considerable amounts to spend on promoting their products, with far fewer constraints and regulations than those we impose on our own wine growers, who are occasionally victims of unfair competition, especially with regard to registered designations, even when they are not, as in some Member States, subjected to a policy of exorbitant taxation on alcoholic drinks."
"We must promote the moderate consumption of wine, whose medicinal properties have been known since ancient times."
"In those times, the Rule of Saint Benedict required monks to drink one 'hemina' , or about half a pint, of wine before meals in order to awaken the spirit and aid digestion."
"Mr President, there is scientific proof that moderate consumption of wine is one of the best ways of preventing cancer, strokes, Alzheimer's disease and many other illnesses."
"Any money will therefore be well spent, and I hope that the Commission will not be so stingy with these appropriations as it has been, once again, with the appropriations for honey and for bees, when my amendments, even though they had been adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, were not adopted by the Commission, the Council or our own Committee on Budgets."
"I really must protest about that, as it was only 15 million."
"This is really peanuts, and I therefore hope that the Commission will not prove to be as stingy with its funds in this instance."
"Please think of the extra few seconds that I gave you, Mrs Lulling, as your Christmas present."
"Mr President, today's vote actually shows that important issues are also dealt with on Fridays."
"This is the last Friday sitting in Strasbourg for the time being, which means that Strasbourg will lose 12 days of parliamentary sittings."
"I believe that the issues which have been debated at these Friday sittings have definitely been of strategic significance for Europe."
"I should like to make one further request of the French Presidency: that Mr Moscovici - because he has given really extremely brief and sometimes imprecise answers to questions here - answer these questions fully and in writing for the European Parliament, because for us, good cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament means that we face each other as equals and that each takes the other seriously."
"That is why I would also be interested to know whether the issue of Friday sittings was discussed at the Nice Summit, that is whether it was of importance or insignificance to the French Presidency."
"Finally, I should like to extend my warmest thanks to the House, to all of my colleagues, to all of the ushers and also to the President."
"I wish all of you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and hope that we will all meet again next year in good health."
"Mr President, I can already answer Mr R√ºbig's question."
"In a bit of horse-trading, Mr Chirac promised the Belgian Prime Minister that, from now on, all summits will be held in Brussels and that there will also be an additional plenary week in Brussels."
"I find this really quite dreadful: it contradicts the letter of the Treaty, and I hope that it will not happen."
"I would like to commend the rapporteur on his work."
"It should not just be edible agricultural products which are in the limelight."
"We must continue to refer to the Internal Market principles in our policy, including public health."
"I am pleased with the fact that non-food products, in addition to food products, are now being taken into consideration."
"I can fully concur with the view taken by my colleague, Mr Jan Mulder, in this respect."
"However, in the long run, we will need to aim for an independent agricultural sector which can survive on its own within the market."
"Finally, I would like to extend seasonal greetings to everyone, especially those few who have taken the trouble to attend this last Friday session of the year 2000 in Strasbourg, and to wish you all a good and, above all, wise new century."
"I can see that these debates of the second millennium are certainly going to provide fuel for the debates of the third millennium."
"That concludes the explanations of votes."
"I shall therefore consider Mr Fatuzzo' s silent presence as his Christmas present."
"It only remains, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, friends and all those people who work with us here in Parliament, to wish you all the best for the festive period concluding this millennium and to remind you that we are to reconvene here in the third millennium, an age which promises to be eventful for our continent."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 15 December 2000."
"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday, as you know, an earthquake struck Central America once again, with tragic consequences. This is an area which has already been seriously affected on a number of occasions since the beginning of the twentieth century."
"The latest, provisional, figures for victims in El Salvador are already very high."
"There are 350 people dead, 1 200 people missing, the area is completely devastated and thousands of homes have been destroyed throughout the country."
"The European Union has already shown its solidarity by sending a rescue team to the area, whilst financial assistance from the Union and Member States has been, or is in the process of being, released and I am able to inform you that some groups in the European Parliament have requested that this issue be included in the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance on Thursday."
"However, I should like to inform you that I have, of course, on behalf of the European Union, expressed our sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the President of El Salvador in the tragedy which has struck his country."
"I would ask you, as a mark of respect for the victims and for the immense suffering of their families, to observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"President."
"Tragically, on 31 December, a day that most of us commemorate with celebration, became a day of mourning for the families of Volendam, in the Netherlands, who lost 10 of their young people on New Year' s Eve."
"I should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to express our sympathy to the parents and families of the victims."
"I should also like to wish the 180 people injured in this awful fire a speedy recovery."
"I should not forget that many places, where joyful celebrations are also held, are all too often transformed by sadness and mourning, due to a lack of adequate safety measures."
"It is in the same spirit that I should like to express my condolences to the families of the 309 victims of the fire at a disco in Luoyang, in China, and I would ask you to observe a minute' s silence in honour of these victims."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I had wished, as everyone had, that we would be able to open our first part-session of the year without having to mention further victims of ETA terrorism."
"Unfortunately, on 20 December, Juan Miguel Gervilla, a police officer in Barcelona, was killed by terrorists."
"He had disturbed his killers as they were preparing an attack."
"His courageous actions unfortunately cost him his life but undoubtedly also saved many others."
"This is why I would like to pay tribute to him in particular and I would ask you again to observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Referral back to committee"
"With regard to the report by Mr Cashman on public access to Parliament, Council and Commission documents, for which the vote on the draft legislative resolution was postponed on 16 November, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has informed me that it is not yet able to meet the two month deadline laid down in the Rules of Procedure."
"This is why it has requested that it be referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 144(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I shall now give the floor to Mr Watson, Chairman of this committee, so that he can present the request on its behalf."
"Madam President, the House kindly agreed on 16 November to a request from the committee which I have the honour to chair to delay the final vote on Mr Cashman's proposed legislative resolution."
"That delay was intended to allow time for the other institutions to consider our amendments and for the Commission to formulate amended proposals."
"Since our November part-session, we have had contacts with the other institutions, though as yet no agreement has been forthcoming."
"Therefore, we would ask the House for a prorogation of the delay of a maximum of two months in order to conclude the dialogue and, we hope, present to you compromise amendments for voting at our part-session on 28 February."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Agenda"
"The next item is the final draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Tuesday 11 January."
"Sittings from 15 to 18 January in Strasbourg President."
"I have received no requests for amendments to the agenda for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday."
"Madam President, I would like to point out to my fellow Members and to yourself, that, whilst I understand the reasons which led you to go over the top and set such a full agenda for Wednesday, with regard to the political topics due to be discussed between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., the Council and the Commission have exactly the same speaking time as all the Members of the European Parliament, i.e. 90 minutes for the Council and the Commission and 90 minutes for the MEPs."
"I am sorry to have to point this out, as I know we have a very busy day on Wednesday, but let us try to change this, as, after all, parliamentary debate should take precedence over the institutions."
"Thank you, Mr Dell' Alba."
"I will, of course, take note of your comment."
"Madam President, I would like to take up some points made by Mr Dell'Alba and also say something about Wednesday' s sitting."
"Not only is Wednesday' s agenda completely overbooked, but important reports - such as the Sj√∂stedt report on natural habitats, as well as others - are being handled without debate, which is wrong to my mind."
"This can be put down to the disastrous decision to cancel Friday sittings, which I would like to take this opportunity to highlight."
"Madam President, I have requested the floor in order to speak about Tuesday' s joint debate on fisheries."
"A major debate has been scheduled for that day and the Conference of Presidents has decided to include a Commission statement on the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco without a resolution."
"As you know, this is a very sensitive issue and I would ask you to clarify a few things, as the inclusion of this issue may somewhat distort the overall debate."
"I would ask you first of all to state at whose behest this was included, in other words, whether it was the Commission itself that made the request or one of the political groups."
"Furthermore, in accordance with the debate' s agenda, the normal course of action would be for the joint debate on the four reports to take place and then for the Commission' s statement to be made and a further debate on this to take place."
"Since it no longer appears possible for events to take place in this way, because the political groups have already distributed Members' speaking times, I would ask that, in this case, the Commission statement should be the first item so that Members may speak in the debate and so that the Commission statement is not made in the middle of the debate, which would prevent all Members from being in an equal position to respond to this statement by the Commission."
"Madam President, I shall be delighted to reply to Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna."
"The Socialist Group requested this Commission statement - I do not know if any of the other groups made the same request."
"We did so for a very simple reason: in the last few days we have seen Commissioner Fischler suspend negotiations on live television;"
"Mr Prodi - I do not know if he is still in Morocco - has submitted a new proposal and restarted negotiations; some Ministers for Agriculture or Fisheries, including the Spanish Minister, have also made statements, and it makes sense that we should be able to debate this issue and that we should be at least as well informed - we are not asking for a resolution - as television newsreaders."
"This really is the most appropriate time, when we are discussing the future of our fisheries policy on the basis of four reports, for the Commission to make this statement."
"This is the thinking that led the Socialist Group to make this request."
"Thank you, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo."
"Mr Varela, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo has given you your answer."
"The request was made by the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, but I can inform you that it was approved unanimously by the Conference of Presidents."
"Madam President, I asked for clarification;"
"I have absolutely no intention of arguing about the appropriateness of a Commission statement."
"It clearly is appropriate."
"I want to make it clear that we support it, and I believe that it was also supported in the Conference of Presidents of political groups, but today I have a meeting with the Committee on Fisheries, an extraordinary meeting, and this issue will logically be dealt with. As Chairman of that committee, I wanted to have all the information so that I could communicate it to the other committee members."
"The statement is therefore welcome."
"In no way do we oppose it. Far from it."
"Our group has also supported it."
"So that the debate may be held in an ordered fashion, which is what most concerns me, because this issue could distort the four important fisheries debates which we have on the agenda, it would be normal for this statement to be made after that debate, and that would then give us time to continue discussing this issue, although it seems that that will not be possible."
"The competent services had informed me that the order of interventions would be as follows: firstly the four rapporteurs of the reports, and then the Commissioner would be given the floor to make the aforementioned statement."
"In that case, the rapporteurs would not be able to reply to the Commissioner during the joint debate."
"What I therefore ask is that the Commission statement be made first and that then the speakers should take the floor, so that everybody might have the same right as MEPs to hear, and be able to reply to, the statement by the Commissioner."
"Madam President, I wish to inform Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna that these are the terms of the Conference of Presidents, but I see that the relevant services have already explained this to him."
"The idea - at the request of most group Chairmen - was that the four rapporteurs would speak first, and then the representative of the Commission would follow."
"This was what happened in the Conference of Presidents, at which I had the honour of representing you, Madam President."
"Mr Varela' s request is out of place."
"Madam President, I would like to explain very briefly why my group has tabled this motion which, relates to what is becoming known, in the French newspapers in particular, as the Danone case."
"This is an important issue that goes beyond the limits of responsibility of one group."
"As it happens, it concerns the policy of a large food processing company which has recently achieved financial results described by the president of the company himself as excellent, and which, at the same time, decided to shed 3 000 jobs and to close several sites in various Member States of the European Union."
"It seems to me that we cannot, on the one hand, make full employment a priority for European Union action and work on drafting a European Company Statute to lay down new rights for employees and, on the other hand, calmly accept this type of strategy, which puts the interests of shareholders before everything."
"This is why I propose an urgent debate on this matter."
"Madam President, my group will be voting in favour of this proposal because, to take up Mr Wurtz' s arguments, this is not just a French issue, but a European issue, both because of the size of the Danone Group and because of the potential repercussions of the measures proposed in various countries."
"Furthermore, because the European Company Statute has been approved by the Treaty of Nice, we feel that this is an extremely topical issue and one that also needs to be addressed by the Swedish Presidency."
"Bearing in mind the fact that my group has also brought up the situation of other multinational companies that operate across Europe or even worldwide in the car and steel manufacturing sectors, we feel that this issue should be given substantial consideration in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Maybe this could replace another item, because the issue is serious enough to warrant a more in-depth and detailed study."
"Madam President, we do not doubt that it is an important issue we are discussing here, but this is something that crops up time and again."
"In the past, we always agreed that we would deal with such issues as part of a more comprehensive debate."
"It is therefore inappropriate to invoke the urgent procedure, particularly as the issue which is to be left off the agenda, is so important."
"I would also like to point out - although I was unable to participate in the Conference of Presidents in person, owing to our European People' s Party Congress, my colleague, James Provan, was there to represent me - that the issue has already been voted on in the Conference of Presidents and so there is no need for it to be raised once again."
"We are against invoking the urgent procedure on this issue."
"Madam President, first of all, Mr Poettering can be forgiven for his mistake since he was absent."
"However, Mr Poettering, I would like to tell you that the Conference of Presidents certainly did not vote for or against this motion and it was suggested that I should table this motion in Parliament, which I have done."
"Regarding the proposal by Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, I am in complete agreement with the proposal to refer the whole matter, i.e. Danone and similar situations, to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs so that we can then conduct a more general debate on this."
"I do not necessarily wish that this be treated as an urgent topic, but I do think that we should take note of this grave inconsistency which is stirring up considerable feeling amongst the general public in all our countries, and which, in actual fact, concerns the European Union."
"Therefore, if all Members are in agreement, I would certainly wish to refer this matter to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Mr Wurtz, should I assume then that you wish to withdraw the current proposal to replace item 5 in the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance with this point?"
"May I conclude that there is broad consensus on Mr Bar√≥n Crespo' s proposal?"
"I can see that this is the case."
"Does any Member of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wish to present the request to replace the item with ""Situation in Algeria"" ?"
"Madam President, you mentioned earlier the horrors that have been reported, which are related to terrorism."
"Consequently, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wanted the House to be able to hold an urgent debate on the situation in Algeria."
"Last week, we were all able to witness the television broadcasts of the unbearable images of recent massacres carried out in Algeria by Islamist terrorists who keep pushing back the limits of atrocity."
"We cannot, therefore, understand why Parliament, which is always so particular on human rights issues, should remain silent following further evidence of fanatical madness."
"Holding this debate would allow us to reaffirm that all the measures that have been adopted in North African countries, Algeria in particular, to fight relentlessly against child murderers and their accomplices have the overwhelming support of the Members of the European Parliament."
"We see it as our duty to send the Algerian people a message of our sympathy and solidarity and to encourage the Algerian Government to implement, with the support of the European Union, the policy in this area that is awaited by the vast majority of its citizens, who, like us, are not used to this indiscriminate violence that is ruining their country."
"I believe that anyone who has had the opportunity to visit Algeria during recent months or years can make a better assessment of what this terrible outbreak of terrorism means to the Algerian people and, indeed, I believe that it would be to our credit if we dealt with this issue in an urgent debate."
"I therefore believe that this is a good suggestion."
"Madam President, the big problem is that so much is happening on the world stage."
"Looking at the instances individually, we wonder why they are not given the highest priority."
"This is the case for Algeria."
"But then there is also the visa obligation which Russia has unilaterally imposed on Georgia since 5 December 2000."
"Whoever is acquainted with the situation across the entire region, knows that this is a burning issue, and we can thus expect conflicts to flare up once again."
"Our parliamentary committee has explicitly asked to prioritise this topic, which was shelved last time."
"So I think it is only fair that we should turn the spotlight on this region, so as to avoid conflict at a later date as far as we can, and also to bring it to the attention of the Russian authorities."
"Madam President, in order to avoid competition arising between these two issues, would it perhaps be possible to discuss the situation in Algeria in the 'human rights' section, in which case, all the issues proposed could be dealt with."
"Madam President, I would like to continue with the subject of the Thursday sitting."
"I would like to draw your attention to the plan for Thursday' s sitting, which has the debate on reports continuing after 5.30 p.m. until 6.30 p.m.."
"Surprisingly, the report to be discussed at that time concerns the competitiveness of forest-based industries, which I tabled for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"After that, at 6.30 p.m., there is the vote on this report, which affects the jobs of four million employees in Europe and competition in this industry and other related industries."
"In my opinion, if we have to debate a report like this one, which affects the jobs of four million people, at 5.30 p.m., then the plan for Thursday' s sitting has run up against very big problems as a result of the Friday sittings being discontinued."
"I know that a few dozen people at most will remain to vote."
"It is degrading for Parliament that we should adopt a position on a report on such a wide issue with such a small group of Members."
"For this reason I would prefer it if Thursday' s evening sitting could be used just to vote on urgent matters, and voting connected with actual reports could be switched to the agenda for the next Brussels part-session."
"Thank you, Mr Sepp√§nen."
"I shall certainly take note of your comment."
"We have seen from experience that participation in the Thursday evening vote was always very high and was enough to outweigh the concerns that you have just expressed."
"I sincerely hope, of course, that we can continue to guarantee the same attendance in future."
"Sittings of 31 January and 1 February in Brussels President."
"I have received no requests for amendments to the agenda for the Brussels part-session of 31 January and 1 February."
"The agenda is thus adopted."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I draw your attention to the fact that alarming events have been taking place in Moscow in the past 24 hours, mainly aimed at the independent media and the freedom of the press."
"Media-Most runs the independent television of Russia and its organisation has a number of radio stations and independent magazines."
"Mr Andrey Tsimaylo, the deputy chairman of Media-Most, was yesterday arrested and subjected to five hours of interrogation, following which Mr Anton Titov, the financial director of independent television, was arrested at the home of his mother, the door having been broken in by the security police."
"A number of other junior employees of independent television are being arrested and interrogated as we sit here now."
"This is an alarming development and it goes beyond the personal question of Mr Gusinsky, which I have raised before and, as is well known, I am an adviser to him."
"Madam President, could we take this matter into consideration?"
"You met the deputy chairman of Media-Most in June, Mr Malashenko."
"You spoke to him about this problem of government pressure on freedom of the press and you suggested that something should be done."
"Can we try to find some way of conveying our views to the Russian Government and sorting out this question of freedom of the press and expression which bedevils relations between the Russian Federation and the European Union?"
"Madam President, if I recall correctly, following the resolution on Tunisia which we adopted in December, President Ben Ali was supposed to have sent you, shall we say, a letter of courtesy."
"If this is correct, would you share the contents of that letter with us?"
"I have not received any such letter."
"If I had, I would naturally have informed the House."
"Madam President, in recent days, even as we speak, reports have been flooding in of the increasing number of cases of young soldiers and many civilians who have fallen victim to extremely serious illnesses linked to radioactive pollution caused by the use of weapons with depleted uranium warheads."
"Firstly, Madam President, I am sure we would all wish to send our deepest sympathy to the families of the young soldiers, the European civilians and the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the death of their loved ones following radioactive pollution from NATO shells."
"Secondly, I must tell you that I greatly welcome your statements on the depleted uranium issue. In particular, I support your call for an urgent ban on the use of these lethal shells."
"I am quite aware that some people deny that there is any association between the deaths and ill health and the use of the shells, but I also know that no military authority is able to prove the contrary."
"Therefore, if it is not possible to obtain an immediate ban, it is essential to impose an immediate moratorium, for although these shells are not currently in use in war they continue to be used in exercises."
"I trust that you will pursue this matter."
"Madam President, at 8 a.m. this morning, I found myself in the good company of 24 other MEPs, staff and one Commissioner at Schiphol airport."
"We were really looking forward to spending another week in Strasbourg after the holidays, but our flight was cancelled, unfortunately."
"This is not the first time."
"We fly to Strasbourg with Regional Airlines."
"Since this aviation company was taken over by Air France this year, one in two flights has been cancelled."
"That means that each time we try to make our way to Strasbourg, in good spirits, we stumble across yet another hitch."
"Today too, we had to fly via Paris to Strasbourg."
"So, although I was at Schiphol in Amsterdam at 8 a.m., I, along with 24 others, did not arrive in Strasbourg until 4 p.m."
"At present, Air France is still 100% state-owned, and the French Government has assured us that it will bend over backwards to make our Strasbourg experience more bearable."
"That is why I would ask you to pass this complaint on to the French Government, because we would simply like to catch our direct flight to and from Amsterdam every Monday and every Thursday on time."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I am extremely concerned by what you have told me and I can assure you that I shall most certainly convey your justifiable unhappiness to the appropriate parties."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I wish to draw the attention of the House to an unfortunate incident which has occurred since our last part-session, and that is the case of Mr Panikos Tsiakourmas."
"Many of you may be unaware that part of Cyprus is already part of the European Union because Great Britain retained sovereign bases on Cyprus and Mr Tsiakourmas was seized from one of those bases shortly before Christmas."
"That seizure was an illegal act."
"Mr Tsiakourmas is now being held in North Cyprus."
"I would appeal to the House to express its sympathy with Mr Tsiakourmas and his family."
"He has been accused of a crime of which I do not think he is guilty."
"However, whatever the merits of his case, the circumstances of his abduction were unacceptable."
"He was abducted from the territory of a European Union Member State."
"I would ask the President to express our concern to the Ankara Government about this incident and our hope that this unfortunate incident will not affect the solution to the Cyprus problem and the peace negotiations which are continuing at this moment, and to express our hope that Mr Tsiakourmas will be released as soon as possible."
"Madam President, may I start by saying that I agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Cossutta just said, although that is not why I asked for the floor."
"I asked for the floor on the matter raised by Mrs Villiers, in order to decry yet another act of terrorism on the part of the Turkish occupying forces in North Cyprus."
"My fellow Member has described the circumstances and I need add no further details."
"I would just point out that not only was Mr Tsiakourmas abducted on soil belonging to the British bases, he was abducted and is being held by the military of a country which is a candidate for membership of the European Union."
"Consequently, every avenue for taking action against Turkey is open to us and I call on you, Madam President, and all my fellow Members of the European Parliament to show compassion and demand the immediate release of Mr Tsiakourmas, who is diabetic and unwell."
"In fact, the whole business appears to be a set up, the sole purpose of which is to exchange Mr Tsiakourmas for a Turkish drug smuggler arrested by the Republic of Cyprus police force."
"Mr Alyssandrakis, we shall see what we can do about this."
"I listened closely to both your speech and that made by the Member before you."
"With regard to Mr Cossutta' s speech, he is aware that I made a statement which fully supports his own sentiments."
"Madam President, I too wish to add to the protests voiced by Mrs Villiers and Mr Alyssandrakis at the premeditated abduction of a Cypriot citizen. Not only is this man ill, but a bag of hashish was planted next to him so that he could be accused of drug smuggling, even though the abduction was carried out on a base belonging to Britain - a guarantor power and a member of the European Union."
"We need to act fast because I am afraid that, now that Turkey has been accepted as a candidate country of the European Union, it thinks it can act with impunity in these matters."
"It has already advanced to positions at two points on the border with the buffer zone in Cyprus, in violation of UN arrangements, and the protests emanating from the UN and from us and from the members of √ç√Å√î√è are so ineffectual that it pays no attention to them whatsoever."
"Moreover, Mr Denktash, the leader of ""North Cyprus"" which, I would remind the House, is under Turkish occupation, has refused to take part in further talks on the Cyprus problem because he feels he is in a much stronger position than before, now that the European Union - without, I believe, a great deal of forethought - has accepted Turkey's candidature for membership of the European Union."
"Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Council - not for the first time, I might add - has contravened the Rules of Procedure."
"The point being that we MEPs have the opportunity, once a month, to submit a written question, for priority consideration which, according to the Rules of Procedure, must be responded to within three weeks."
"Now what we are finding is that increasingly often, the Council is failing to keep to this time scale."
"Here is the latest example: I submitted a question in October, to which I have not received an answer to this day, namely when is the Council going to get round to implementing the salary increase promised to the Europol staff?"
"This is not an isolated case, rather such instances are mounting up."
"I would urge you to press the Council to observe the Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, I take the floor in order to point out yet again - having written to you repeatedly on the matter - that for months now, since 20 October in fact, hundreds of political prisoners living in wretched conditions in Turkey have been on hunger strike, which they intend to see through to the bitter end - some have in fact already died - in a bid to stop the Turkish Government from going ahead with its plan to lock them up in isolation cells in order to break their morale and their resistance."
"We all know what a dark day it was for the whole of mankind when the Turkish military and police forces brutally invaded the prisons."
"They killed people."
"They fired on prisoners. They brutally attacked the families of political prisoners protesting outside the jails and likewise on hunger strike."
"I think that it is wrong that neither we nor the bureau have as yet protested against this situation in stronger, more categorical terms; our silence makes the whole of mankind feel that both the European Parliament and the European Union are accessories to this crime."
"So I ask, even now, that you raise your voice and make our sympathies known."
"Madam President, with the New Year we have learned through the Spanish Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado that eleven policemen and three guard√≠as civiles who had already been sentenced as torturers had been pardoned by the Spanish Government."
"Few cases of torture are admitted by the Spanish courts."
"On the contrary, many officials are promoted because of such activities."
"Inside the European Union that is simply not tolerable."
"It is incumbent upon us to press the Spanish Government on this issue."
"I would urge this Parliament to issue a declaration in the clearest possible terms to show our steadfast opposition to torture."
"I am sure that you will want to respond fully and rapidly to this concern."
"Madam President, has it been brought to your attention that the Members' register of interests was last week published on an Internet site, www.mpt2001.co.uk?"
"This was not the result of Parliament putting into practice the principles of transparency and openness, but follows the copying of the records by a team in Parliament working for a British television comedian."
"Now that the records have been put into the public domain, will you advise all concerned not to allow Parliament to continue looking secretive and foolish, but to take speedy action to bring us into the twenty-first century and get the information published on our own website and made permanently available to European citizens?"
"Madam President, I also regret that a British comedy programme sought to make light of Parliament and would point out that my own group has, of course, already published its register of interests on the Internet."
"It remains open to Mr Davies' group to follow suit and follow our lead in putting the register of interests on the Internet."
"In the meantime, I agree with him."
"I think the sooner this is on the Internet, the better."
"It is a matter of public record."
"There is no reason why it should be kept secret."
"That is the point I believe the Quaestors will be urging on the Bureau in the near future."
"Credit institutions"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0369/2000), by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions."
"Madam President, the European Commission tabled a proposal for a directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the reorganisation and the winding-up of credit institutions back in 1985."
"That so much time has lapsed, is largely down to the Gibraltar issue."
"The purpose of the directive is to ensure that a credit institution and its branches in other Member States are reorganised or wound up according to the principles of unity and universality."
"This means that the administrative authorities of the home Member State have sole jurisdiction in carrying out the reorganisation or winding up of a credit institution and its branches across the EU."
"This applies to all cases, except where Article 20 of this directive specifies otherwise."
"The aim of the directive is, thus, not to harmonise but to ensure equal treatment of all creditors and a consistent approach across the whole of Europe."
"As rapporteur, I can completely identify with the thrust of this report."
"In tandem with the Council and Commission, I have tried to make a few improvements to this report in the shape of two types of amendment."
"The first type is related to the fact that the wording of the Council' s common position was not consistent with the existing insolvency directive and the directive on the winding up and reorganisation of insurance companies, which is to be voted on next week within the Economic Commission."
"This kind of discrepancy in directives which cover the same subject matter is unacceptable, unless there is a good reason for it."
"As rapporteur, I have taken great pride in rendering legislation on this particularly important subject matter as clearly and transparently as possible."
"All our amendments pertain to Article 20, which deals with the exceptions to the rule."
"Some amendments bring the directive into line with other directives, such as the insolvency directive and the winding up of insurance companies, as I mentioned a moment ago."
"These are Articles 20(1)(h) and 20(2)."
"By means of Articles 20a to 20d, they are re-introduced in the report, but this time by using the same wording as in the other two directives."
"The second type of amendment pertains to the deletion of a number of exceptions to the main rule."
"These exceptions had been worded in an ambiguous manner and were open to interpretation."
"Also, there was the risk, in the article on the regulated markets, that the exception was more comprehensive than the main rule."
"Despite this, the articles on regulated markets, repurchase agreements, netting agreements and debt renewal were included as such in the common position."
"In the first instance, I wanted to see these articles deleted."
"The only problem was that certain parties within the Council could not live with completely deleting these articles."
"For this reason, I have tried to reach agreement with the Council, and this was done at the eleventh hour last Wednesday."
"The compromise still prescribes the deletion of the three articles, but three other articles will be inserted instead."
"Broadly speaking, the compromise articles do not prejudice legislation of the Member State to which the contract pertains."
"These articles also clarify that the bankruptcy rules of the home Member State of the credit institution in question are not prejudiced."
"That means, therefore, that if contracts are concluded with regulated institutions, the proceeds from those contracts are still included in the estate."
"That is what this is about, and that was the reason behind my original proposal to delete."
"Everything is now spelled out loud and clear, everyone is happy and I am delighted that, by joining forces, we have probably avoided a lengthy conciliation procedure."
"We are thus tabling two types of amendment. One type is introducing harmonisation with respect to other directives, the other deleting a number of exceptions."
"I hope from the bottom of my heart that this legislation, which I believe Parliament has upgraded in terms of quality, will never have to take effect."
"Mr President, the main points of controversy in this report concern three different types of contractual agreement, namely repo agreements, netting agreements, and contracts conducted on a regulated market."
"As Mrs Peijs' report outlined, these types of contracts were discussed in committee pending this debate and, in essence, what we are seeking to do with the compromises proposed by Mrs Peijs is to ensure that parties can choose their own contract law in relation to these particular contracts, but not their own winding-up proceedings law."
"There is a separation here between the law of the contract and the external insolvency law, because it is quite important to ensure that parties, though they may choose the law of contract, may not actually choose their own insolvency law."
"Now a problem arises concerning the interaction between the law of contract and insolvency law."
"What we are trying to do is to ensure that the contract operates and whatever proceeds are left at the other end are then dealt with according to the insolvency law of the home State."
"There is still one slight uncertainty in the text about what happens with regimes, for example, in Spain which have insolvency proceedings which kick in before the contract law actually takes place."
"In essence, these are known as automatic stays and mean that in certain countries, such as Spain, I believe all contracts are suspended automatically by an insolvency proceeding."
"I applaud Mrs Peijs' work in reconciling what looked fairly irreconcilable and coming up with a solution that favours home State control which is preferable in terms of the internal market, but I have some anxiety that there will still have to be some fine-tuning."
"I hope that we will not have to have a third reading, but we may have to just to make it absolutely clear that these automatic stays would not affect netting contracts, repo contracts and contracts in a regulated market."
"I would appeal to the House that in some ways it is more important to get a clear answer than to get one that suits everyone; one that is absolutely perfect in every respect."
"Because with a clear answer people can arrange their transactions around the framework that we have set up."
"It is vital to do that."
"I applaud the work that Mrs Peijs has done and I hope that we have finally sorted this issue out."
"I just have certain worries about the automatic stays and suspect that we might need some fine-tuning at a later stage."
"The other controversial issue involves right in rem and the difference between the common position and the tidying up operation that Mrs Peijs has done, and this is something we have discussed at length."
"In essence, there is a lot of common ground between what the Council proposes in the common position and the alternative wording that Mrs Peijs has proposed."
"I am inclined to think, in view of the uncertainty, that it may well be worth sticking to the common position on that particular issue, because of the potential threat that it might pose to the mortgage bond market."
"This is not a strategic interest to me as a British MEP, because it does not affect the British market in any way - it is much more important for the Danish, the Austrian and the German mortgage market."
"I would congratulate Mrs Peijs on her work."
"It is a very good report."
"There are still one or two small points of controversy in it, but she has done an excellent job."
"I apologise for the confusion we have had in committee over the voting and I am glad that it has all been resolved now."
"Mr President, I do not feel that I will need the full five minutes, hopefully this will allow you to speed up proceedings tonight."
"I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Peijs as rapporteur on this report which, as Mrs Villiers has already outlined, has been extremely complicated."
"The issue has long been problematic, mainly because of the national differences at governmental level, rather than the issues directly originating from Parliament, but compromises produced in Parliament have been both efficient and expedient in terms of their approach and are very welcome."
"In an effort to provide for equal treatment across the EU, the principles of unity and universality are the central pillars, of course, of this report, and coherence and consistency are therefore attained."
"Similarly the rights of creditors in Member States other than their own are safeguarded by the assurances of cooperation between the relevant authorities in the Member States, but let us be clear, in case some of you have not read the document, this is not about harmonisation, it is about mutual recognition of Member States' reorganisation measures and winding up procedures."
"Parliament's success in introducing substantial changes in the original proposal is important."
"There are many in Parliament who feel the issues here are of real concern since they all concern the safeguarding of European citizens' interests and rights; indeed this report helps clarify many of the elements, such as the deposit guarantee scheme."
"But, of course, many of the changes in the common position which finally came back to us have to be welcomed, as they reflect many of Parliament's concerns, although some work has still to be done."
"It is therefore sensible for Parliament, whilst accepting the improved document's intentions, to reimpose our priorities from the first readings but to organise and also clarify the suggestions emanating from this text."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 2 bring the text into line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals which had already been agreed last summer: this confirms Parliament's desire, therefore, to see a degree of coherence in this matter."
"I also see great strength for creditors in Amendments Nos 3, 5 and 6 while recognising that other national delegations, especially in my group, may have other concerns in this area."
"But I personally offer my support to the idea of bringing this directive in line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals."
"It seems to me that, finally, in the remaining amendments, following in the tradition of tidying up texts for the purpose of clarification, Parliament's rapporteur has maintained the type of quality we have come to expect from experienced Members."
"Whilst issues such as netting seem to have been slotted in as an extra series of amendments, what we have here is a workable document nonetheless, capable of securing support in the House and provoking serious discussion within the Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that the directive on the reorganisation of credit institutions is long overdue, which is also why we welcome it."
"A uniform procedure is at last to be established and there is to be coherence between the reorganisation procedure and the insolvency regulation."
"We would do well to stress that the provisions on protecting creditors' rights, in particular, are of crucial importance here, since they establish the principle of providing creditors with information, as well as the conditions governing payments made to them."
"In this way, all creditors, including those in countries other than the home Member State, are guaranteed equal treatment under the winding up procedure, and a consistent approach."
"Although the text in its current form is absolutely excellent, some clarification is needed."
"Thus, for example, the all-important principle of universality was strengthened by a series of amendments in committee, and several areas of incompatibility with the provisions relating to financial conglomerates, and which could lead to legal uncertainty, were ironed out."
"You will already have noticed in the course of the debate that we differ on one point, specifically in relation to Amendments Nos 3 and 5."
"The close correspondence between the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions and insurance companies is not desirable for all aspects."
"Opinion differs on this because we believe what we are talking about here are different products, and sometimes different markets, and that different products and different markets should be treated differently, and not automatically the same."
"The common position is well-balanced to my mind and was improved on, to some extent, by the committee' s amendments and those tabled by the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, whom I would like to thank."
"The text ought, therefore, to be adopted without delay and transposed by the Member States."
"I regret that the dispute in the Council has led to this being delayed by more than a decade."
"I would point out that the Commission' s first proposal was published as early as 1985 and Parliament' s first reading was held back in 1987."
"The reason I stress this is because we constantly discuss the balance between the European institutions in our debates - particularly in the wake of the Nice European Council - and in many cases discuss how the procedures ought to be accelerated."
"This does not just apply to Parliament, which is often the impression given in the public arena, although we would, of course, do well to consolidate and accelerate quite a few procedures of our own too."
"But this is not about apportioning blame."
"However, doubtless the opinion-forming and decision-making process in the European Council offers the best bet for accelerating the procedures between the European institutions."
"That has been made crystal clear again here."
"The Commission proposal is designed to ensure that a credit institution and its branch offices in other Member States can be reorganised and wound up according to the principle of unity and universality."
"That is guaranteed under this proposed directive."
"Mr President, the market and national authorities have been looking forward to the directive on the reorganisation and the winding-up of credit institutions coming into effect for some time now."
"This directive, in fact, aims to provide a guarantee with regard to the regulations which, in an organic manner and in a way which is specifically tailored to the sector, govern the institutions, the assets, the rights and business relations when a bank, which is active in different EU Member States, gets into difficulty or goes under."
"This directive spearheads the action plan for financial services."
"In its common position, established by qualified majority, the Council displayed a discerning and keen insight into the specific characteristics of the banking sector which set it apart from the rest, both in terms of the insolvency procedure in general and compared to other financial sectors, such as the insurance business and the stocks and shares industry."
"This is why Article 20 of the common position grants the banking sector special treatment on a number of scores."
"This special treatment does not in any way prejudice the harmony and logic of a set of rules for the financial services as a whole."
"Quite the reverse, in fact; it does justice to the specific characteristics of banking, thus giving a better guarantee for stability and legal certainty."
"The report by Mrs Peijs, on which I would like to congratulate her on behalf of the Commission, and in respect of which I would like to endorse the compliments extended by Mrs Villiers and Mr Skinner, which welcomes the common position for the most part, proposes a number of amendments to Article 20, as was explained earlier this afternoon."
"The Commission can approve the purport of these amendments, barring one."
"It objects, at least in principle, to Amendment No 1 with regard to repurchase agreements."
"After all, it is of key importance that the banks know in advance what legislation will govern repurchase agreements."
"As it happens, Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, has tabled five new amendments."
"These amendments draw the amendments adopted by the Economic and Monetary Commission together in a coherent manner which does justice to the special position of the banking sector."
"Under a different guise, the new amendments take into consideration the specific requirements which are prescribed in the banking sector with regard to netting agreements, repurchase agreements and agreements and transactions within regulated markets."
"The Commission can go along with the spirit of these amendments, as is apparent in its explanatory statement."
"If the five new amendments are adopted by this Parliament, the Commission can assent to the spirit of all amendments proposed in Mrs Peijs' report, including Amendment No 1."
"However, the wording of all amendments - and I am also making this point in response to comments made by Mrs Villiers - would then have to be adapted in order to guarantee the compatibility and consistency of these amendments with Article 20."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Simpler legislation for the internal market (SLIM)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Doorn on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on the review of simpler legislation for the Internal Market."
"Mr President, red tape within Dutch industry amounts to near enough EUR 9 billion per annum. This was revealed in the Netherlands last week by Actal, the newly formed Committee of Experts on the verification of administrative burdens."
"The average entrepreneur spends approximately ten hours on completing administrative tasks and forms."
"The Netherlands, as far as this is concerned, is no exception."
"Research has shown that unnecessary bureaucratic procedures within companies account for 4 to 6 per cent of the GNP of EU Member States."
"This is a heavy burden, which hits small companies particularly hard."
"I know of entrepreneurs who have quite consciously decided against further expansion of their businesses because they want to avoid having to take on staff at all costs."
"Many are deterred by the administrative red tape involved."
"In this way, the many obligations imposed by governments on entrepreneurs hinder the growth of production and employment."
"Some of the time, it is not even the legislation which is wrong or ineffective, but it is often the accumulation of obligations which makes the administrative pressures so heavy, and the European Parliament contributes to this in its own way."
"This reminds me of a report we discussed last year which related to the working conditions on construction sites."
"One of the prohibitions in that report, thanks to an amendment in Parliament, pertains to holding a ladder while someone is standing on it."
"Quite apart from the absurdity of such provisions, one wonders who subsequently monitors compliance with this kind of legislation."
"One of the key problems in our complex society is probably the fact that we produce far too many regulations in such abundance and of such complexity, that we ourselves are no longer able to monitor their compliance."
"The consequences can be disastrous, as a recent incident in the Netherlands proved once more."
"In my opinion, the heavy administrative burden on citizens and businesses, combined with the government' s incapacity to ensure compliance with the tangled web of rules, are reason enough to tackle the simplification of legislation and improvement of its quality head-on."
"While I welcome the SLIM project, which the Commission launched in 1996 and which is under discussion this evening, as I stated in my report, it is too little too late."
"Compared to the legislative machinery as a whole, it is only a drop in the ocean."
"That is why I argue in favour of added momentum, as well as shorter implementation periods for the results of the SLIM working parties and, obviously, for the organisation and manpower required in this respect."
"However, I attach yet more importance to simplifying legislation in its entirety."
"Particular attention will need to be paid to the way in which legislation is developed."
"After all, it is much easier to take simplifying measures in the early stages than to adapt existing legislation later on, at great cost, also for businesses."
"Every available effort must be made early on to lay down high-quality legislation and to restrict the administrative and financial consequences to a minimum."
"The Netherlands has seen the recent introduction of Actal, which I mentioned a moment ago."
"Actal is an independent watchdog whose duty it is to examine draft legislative proposals and to expose any negative administrative burdens on behalf of citizens and businesses."
"An excellent initiative which, I hope, will be copied liberally in other Member States and at EU level."
"I would make an urgent appeal to the European Commission to make a maximum effort to improve the quality of legislation and to restrict the administrative burden on citizens and businesses."
"If the current situation continues for much longer, the European Parliament, too, will need to consider the consequences of legislative proposals discussed here on citizens and businesses."
"If others fail to come up with the goods, we might have to follow in the footsteps of the American Congress and set up a service ourselves which maps out the administrative and financial consequences of legislation."
"Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, the simpler legislation for the internal market initiative is one of the most important processes now underway in the Union."
"At least for my party in Finland, the National Coalition, the streamlining of legislation and an end to the needless churning out of directives became one of the main objectives in the last European Parliament elections."
"I believe that much value is attached to this approach in many other quarters too."
"The Commission communication on the present state of the SLIM project is very gratifying, but by no means fully adequate, as yet."
"It is vitally important that the Commission is able to make the proposals for the project' s third and fourth phases into clear legislative proposals as soon and as effectively as possible."
"Furthermore, the six-month deadline proposed by the rapporteur should be taken seriously."
"I warmly support our rapporteur' s proposals that the users of the legislation - the customers of our decision makers - should be heard more than they have been when concrete proposals are being drafted."
"Only this sort of coregulation can fully serve to speed up the development of the European internal market, and, ultimately, guarantee that consumers actually do benefit from legislation projects and the adoption of the euro."
"Proposals alone are obviously not enough: they must also be able to be processed swiftly both in Parliament and in the Council."
"We do have debates on speeding up the legislative process from time to time here in Parliament."
"We members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular await with interest the proposals by the Lamfalussy working party on new courses of action that are to be applied in the future, at least with regard to legislation on financial services."
"Although their interim report was still not very detailed, it nevertheless gives us to understand that the working party is pondering a procedure in which only the broadest policy issues would be solved through a full-scale codecision procedure, while for other amendments to directives of a more technical nature the fast-track procedure would apply."
"In principle, I take a positive view of such proposals, although it is notoriously difficult for us parliamentarians to relinquish power."
"I believe that the relinquishment of power in certain respects will be inevitable to remove the final barriers to the internal market as soon as possible."
"My final position, and that of my group, will surely depend on what form the fast-track procedure will take."
"In no case should it be an imitation of the present comitology procedure, where there is a very great need for reform, especially in the area of transparency."
"Our rapporteur also referred to this."
"As regards the general development of the legislative process, I also await with interest the Commission' s white paper on governance it is drafting for the Gothenburg Summit."
"Whatever the Commission proposes in its paper will determine how quickly new projects for legislation are dealt with, and, how effective the Union is as a whole for a long time ahead."
"Hopefully, the paper will contain good, concrete proposals, but I also hope that we can still put some effort into the SLIM project."
"Mr President, it is clear that improving the quality of legislation is essential to the effective functioning of the internal market and to increasing the competitivity of the European economy."
"So we all welcome the SLIM initiative, but we must all share the rapporteur's reservations about how it has worked so far."
"There are surprisingly few areas which have been subject to the SLIM process and it is not always clear why those particular areas have been selected."
"We need, without a doubt, a fast-track procedure to turn SLIM opinions into legislative proposals, because it all seems to take rather a long time."
"So we welcome the proposal to set up a special group within the Advisory Committee and we welcome the rapporteur's suggestion that it should have more resources."
"Clearly we also need greater synergy between the different Commission initiatives for improving legislation."
"We sometimes think that the different parts are operating in isolation."
"And, of course, we need greater cooperation between Member States and to overview best practice and seek to repeat best practice elsewhere."
"And finally, it is crucial to ensure maximum involvement of the users of this legislation, particularly businesses, because they know best how this legislation affects them."
"However, having said that, you could quite conceivably produce wonderful, simple legislation, yet it could be completely destroyed by the way that Member States implement it and enforce it."
"We must understand that there are three stages of legislation - formulation, implementation, including transposition, and enforcement - and we have to see the process as a whole."
"We often find the greatest problem is not the original legislation but how it has been transposed by Member States and the speed at which they have transposed it, how they have implemented it and how they have enforced it."
"I am often quite surprised by how relatively simple ideas are turned into the most complex nightmares as we go through that process."
"As part of this on-going determination by the Commission to simplify legislation, I would like to see much greater cooperation between Member States and the Commission about the whole life of legislation and, particularly, involvement with the people who have prime responsibility for enforcing the legislation, who are often local and regional actors."
"So we must consider the whole process when we draft the original legislation."
"In some ways, you could argue, we should start at the end and look at how we enforce it and then work backwards as a way of getting simpler legislation."
"But the SLIM process ought to go much further."
"We need a rolling programme which will cover all legislation and look at simplifying, consolidating, re-casting, sometimes repealing legislation."
"Sometimes we may need to go for the status quo, but we need a more dynamic process than we have had so far."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I share the rapporteur' s concern about the fact that evidently, European institutions are unable to issue transparent, readily accessible regulations which are clear and understandable to people with average IQ levels."
"All credit to Mr Doorn, who has managed to put his finger on the problem."
"It should be highlighted, rightly so, that EU citizens and businesses consider complex legislation and red tape to be evidence of a lack of efficiency within the institutions."
"The causes are obvious."
"As long as the Commission does not adopt a clear, centralised approach to SLIM, the SLIM initiative remains an exercise with no strings attached. It should be anything but that."
"In my opinion, two goals need to be brought into focus, in addition to the recommendations which are currently in the report."
"First of all, the SLIM initiative must be lent a binding character, particularly with EU enlargement on the horizon."
"Secondly, Member States must, as of now, set a good example by guaranteeing a correct, but above all, timely transposition of European directives into national legislation."
"All too often, we have been under the impression that the process of simplification, which is so crucial, is much like a procession of Echternach."
"Pending the Union' s enlargement, we must shift up a gear if we want to develop the internal market in a professionally responsible manner."
"I am delighted that the Member State which I have the honour of representing here, has realised that special measures need to be taken, as is the case in the Netherlands, to simplify legislation in a consistent manner."
"Convinced of the need for simplified legislation, the Liberal Group will be lending the Doorn report its unqualified support."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that although I have been allocated four minutes, I should like to do my bit for the simplification and streamlining of bureaucracy by speaking for less than half that time."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on highlighting such a very important issue and also highlighting the failures of the Commission to get to grips with it thus far."
"I hope that the Commissioner will say what more is to be done to give added urgency to what is such a very important programme."
"However, rather than criticise the Commission more than the rapporteur has already done, rather even than refer just to the four committees involved in this particular issue, I should like to highlight one issue the rapporteur also raised, which is that it is really entirely up to us, as Members of this House, to ensure that legislation is better in the first place."
"He wondered to what extent legislation should delve into details and gave an example involving people holding ladders."
"That particular subject came up in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"It must be said that this particular committee has contributed very significantly to the extra bureaucracy that we are now passing the buck to the Commission to try and reduce."
"How much better it would be if that committee, and indeed all other committees, had left such legislation alone in its simpler and purer form in the first place."
"My final suggestion is that for us the acronym SLIM - ""Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market"" - should represent ""Substantially Less Interference by Members""."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and say that the proposals on the simplification of legislation in the internal market that were launched in 1996 are very welcome."
"An attempt was made there to improve the quality of legislation, to try to cut down on superfluous legislation and to limit the costs associated with implementing legislation."
"Now that we have finished the third and fourth phases, with teams of Member State officials and users identifying concrete suggestions to simplify legislation, it is right that we have a review."
"We need to have clearer definitions of what is going on."
"Improved selection at the moment seems to be fairly random and we need some clear guidelines for the operation of the management teams and, of course, the implementation of recommendations which, at the moment, are too little and too late."
"Many of the recommendations are not implemented at all and many have to wait considerable periods of time."
"So we are in favour, but there are two things we want to add."
"Firstly, we have to ensure that political control remains with the Commission and Parliament."
"Recent press reports on the new approach to legislation dating from the 1980s and '90s - not so new now - which allowed the detail of legislation to be worked out by industry-led standardisation organisations, seem to indicate that this is not always the best way forward."
"The European Committee for Standardisation, for example, recently did work on the packaging of waste directive, which the press has described as ""fundamentally flawed, undermines democratic accountability and fails to meet the demands of the directive or, for that matter, environmental protection""."
"So we need to ensure that there is political control there, unless of course there are strong political or consumer pressures to ensure that industry makes progress."
"However, we would also wish to go further in a different direction."
"SLIM seems to have become fundamentally about simplification, even though in the original proposals we talked about limiting costs."
"What we would like to see are proposals for dealing with economy of legislation as well as simplicity."
"We therefore welcome the proposals from Lisbon for better regulation, which will look at the costs of legislation; we welcome the informal meeting of ministers of public administration held in Strasbourg on 7 November; we welcome the establishment of the high-level group to look at recommendations on making legislation more cost-effective; but we are disappointed that the promised European Parliament representative on that high-level group has not been appointed by Parliament nor, as far as I understand, have we been approached to appoint such a representative."
"We welcome the fact that Commissioners Bolkestein and Liikanen are looking at various pilot projects in this area."
"However, the Commission and Parliament will have to begin to act on their own rules in looking at the financial implications of legislative proposals in order for them to be taken into account."
"It can only devalue our work in the European Parliament if claims can be made, for example, that the end-of-vehicle-life directive will cost us ¬£400m a year in terms of the cost to the producers and the consumers but will only deliver ¬£100m a year of benefit to the environment."
"While such claims can be made, obviously we in this Parliament will look rather ludicrous."
"Mr President, I would very much like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Doorn, on this particularly constructive and well-balanced report."
"It underlines the need for stepping up our joint efforts in order to improve the quality of new and existing Community legislation - with good reason."
"I therefore welcome the support lent to the SLIM initiative, as well as the support shown by this Parliament."
"Our review of the SLIM initiative and this report have demonstrated where and how the initiative can be improved."
"Consequently, in tandem with the representatives of the Member States, we are, in this connection, looking forward to making and implementing important recommendations under the wing of a newly established internal market Advisory Committee."
"With the fifth and subsequent stages of the SLIM in mind, we are currently considering suggestions with regard to sectors which could be due an overhaul."
"Any suggestions in this connection from this Parliament are, of course, welcome."
"As soon as agreement has been reached on a shortlist of sectors which can be overhauled, we will contact representatives of the industrial and business world, consumer organisations and trade unions, all referred to as the so-called 'consumers' , every step of the way."
"That should offer them the opportunity of contributing to the SLIM initiative, either directly or indirectly, and of being informed of the progress made."
"I am convinced that this approach will allow all those taking part in this overhaul exercise to focus on the key issues of simplification, and that the SLIM teams will be making relevant and practical recommendations."
"I am therefore looking forward to reporting on the progress made during the next couple of months."
"As you know, the Commission is required to submit proposals to the best of its ability within six months of receiving the recommendations of the SLIM team, provided that these are recommendations which it can subscribe to."
"We will make every effort to fulfil this commitment, and I am addressing Mr Bushill-Matthews in particular with this statement."
"We are thrilled with Mr Doorn' s recommendations that Parliament and the Council will each assume their responsibilities, by carefully considering all proposals in this connection, so as to ensure that the SLIM initiative runs as smoothly as possible."
"I share Mr Doorn' s view that an increasing number of legislative areas should be simplified."
"I am with him on that one. I, too, would like to see this happen."
"That is, of course, only possible within the confines imposed by other priority duties and within the budgetary scope available."
"I would like to underline this point."
"The Commission receives many requests."
"The Commission has many duties, but it does not always have the means available to fulfil these duties fast and efficiently."
"That is an important matter which also merits much attention in this Parliament."
"Nevertheless, I have no doubt that we can accelerate the simplification process, not least as a result of the work in which the Commission itself is involved."
"In response to the appeal made at the European Council in Lisbon, to reach a coordinated policy so as to simplify the legislative climate, the Commission is currently subjecting its position on legislation in general to a thorough investigation in the widest sense of the word."
"It is examining areas where non-regulatory alternatives could be introduced."
"Moreover, it is pressing for the development of better ways of gauging the effect of newly proposed legislation on the business world and industry, so as to minimise possible extra expense and administrative red tape."
"An enquiry in this connection was also submitted this afternoon."
"The efforts which are now being made to draft better legislation coincide with preparations for the white paper on better management."
"I am mentioning this particularly for the benefit of Mrs Kauppi."
"The Commission' s work will be complemented by the results of the discussions held in a high-level working group on better legislation, which was convened by ministers of the Public Office following their meeting in Strasbourg in November last."
"It is this working group' s duty, and Mr Ford called for attention to be given to this, to examine the quality and simplification of both national and Community legislation."
"I am already looking forward to the report and the recommendations of this working group."
"This legislative process for which we all carry some responsibility, concerns us all, of course."
"I am convinced that the current political consensus in aid of a better legislative climate within the European Union will lead to real and permanent improvements."
"I would also like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for the alternative meaning he gave to the acronym SLIM, namely 'Substantially Less Interference by Members' ."
"I am very grateful to him for that."
"I will try to quote this at the appropriate place and time, and those whom the cap fits can wear it."
"On a final note, I would like to let Mr Doorn and your Parliament know that the amendments are acceptable to the Commission."
"Thank you very much Commissioner Bolkestein, as usual, for your helpful remarks in this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Quality evaluation in school education"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0375/2000), by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council recommendation on European cooperation in quality evaluation in school education [11540/1/2000 - C5-0565/2000 - 2000/0022(COD)]."
"Mr President, the quality of education is high on the political agenda of every Member State, and that comes as no surprise."
"The third millennium offers unknown opportunities and prospects within a society which is becoming increasingly more aware, more global, more mobile and more knowledge-intensive, but at the same time where the concern about different speeds and opportunities for people is becoming increasingly apparent, because how does one ensure that everyone can function fully in this new dynamic society?"
"Education must and can help here, and all these new developments offer education opportunities and challenges, because education will undergo a sea of change, and that is only the way children are taught, and how they are taught to learn."
"Consider, in addition, technology, information technology and the different cultures."
"That is why it is so important that the EU Member States join forces and want to work together on future-orientated education, each according to their own tradition but, let there be no mistake, with a common goal in mind."
"As rapporteur, I am thus delighted with the results of the common position as it is now before us."
"Initially, I found the Commission proposal somewhat vague and very non-committal, given the huge importance of sound education, and the Council was suffering from stage fright: whatever you do, do not touch our autonomy in education."
"However, in the course of the discussions, they came to share Parliament' s opinion that the quality of education should be monitored seriously and in a structured manner by, among other things, setting up sound, efficient quality evaluation systems for primary education, secondary education and secondary vocational training."
"The recommendations are now clear in the amendments tabled by the MEPs and myself as rapporteur."
"In these, we stipulate clearly that Member States must develop transparent quality evaluation with high-quality education as the key goal."
"This was not in the first Commission proposal, and neither was the promotion of social integration."
"Offering equal opportunities to boys and girls, that was also hard to sell."
"It was difficult to convince the Council to adopt this wording, but as rapporteur, I am delighted that both the Council and Commission are now in agreement with this."
"Another aspect which was close to my heart is that parents, pupils and teachers too should be involved in the process."
"This, too, has now been included, and this is important for the support structure of evaluation processes and improvements in education."
"It is also important to encourage schools to cooperate at national and European level."
"However, I believe that schools should not be prevented from looking for sound cooperation partners in their immediate surroundings within the region, and, in my opinion, this idea could have been given more of an airing in the report."
"Finally, I should like to underline the importance of collating information and developing indicators and references, and of entering these in a database which can be consulted interactively."
"That is the modern way of communicating."
"It brings me pleasure personally as rapporteur to see that the Member States have got down to work both independently and under the remit of the Commission and have set up a working committee of experts that has developed a limited number of indicators and benchmarks."
"Parliament will be monitoring the developments closely."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the common position as it is now before us is the result of sound and constructive cooperation with the Commission and the Council in the spirit of codecision, but particularly thanks to the involvement of my fellow MEPs who have delivered their comments with great care, the recommendation has become a sound, well-balanced and stimulating one, which Member States can now start to use. I am interested to hear your reaction."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Sanders-ten Holte for the work she has done and I welcome the fruitful cooperation that has developed between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the outcome of which is the text that has just been presented to us, a text which, I hope, will make a real contribution towards promoting the high quality education throughout Europe we aspire to."
"On behalf of my committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would particularly like to stress the importance of improving the quality of teaching in schools and vocational training, and seeking to implement a system for exchanging good practice and methodological tools. These are ways of achieving social cohesion and reducing unemployment."
"High quality education systems must strive to achieve objectives, such as to get people into the labour market, to reduce the number of young people leaving school early, our ability to provide life-long learning and to give people access to the new technologies."
"I must highlight two points in this quality evaluation as specified in the common position."
"First of all, this process makes a clear distinction between administrative evaluation and the innovative procedures that we would like to see and that we would like to implement and in which, as has been said, all stakeholders must take part."
"The second point which I would like to highlight has perhaps not been fully taken on board, as we would have wished."
"What we do not want to do is to turn the quality evaluation process into a factor for establishing a hierarchy, classification or league table of schools."
"On the contrary, this form of evaluation should allow each establishment, however different in terms of its students or the methods or resources used, to meet all the risks of dropping out, to improve the intrinsic quality of education for everyone and to accept all pupils of all abilities by offering education which is tailored to the students' requirements and by allowing everyone to discover their own personal development needs."
"Mr President, this report is strongly supported by the PPE-DE Group."
"Indeed, we have supported it throughout the entire procedure."
"We regretted that initially there was some slight resistance from the Council but we are very pleased that, as a result of strong intervention by the Commissioner and the negotiating skills of the rapporteur, a compromise was reached last autumn that we can certainly support."
"We congratulate the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their work to achieve that."
"We certainly all agree here in this Chamber that education is of vital importance and that an educated workforce is the cornerstone of Europe's future prosperity."
"Therefore, any attempts to improve standards in our schools must be welcomed with open arms."
"We also all agree that education is rightly a matter for the individual Member States and the regions."
"But there is room for the Commission to coordinate and improve evaluation systems as provided for in the Treaty and I was glad to see that the Commission was careful to emphasise that this is to be based on voluntary cooperation between the Member States."
"Certainly, at the moment it is difficult to get past each country's various examination systems and teaching philosophies to reach any objective comparison of the teaching standards of the countries."
"As a former lecturer myself, I would have welcomed a clear idea of how British teaching and educational standards compared to those of other European countries."
"It is important in this global age to have as broad an input as possible for the evaluation system."
"European comparisons will show up, one hopes, strengths but also weaknesses that are currently hidden by evaluation systems limited to a single educational system."
"One of the main aims of education is to provide for the world of work as well as providing a cultural base for Europe's young people."
"This report seeks a balance between the need for adequate preparation in both those fields."
"The possibility of comparing education systems across borders will, I hope, lead to improvements across European teaching establishments as schools learn from others outside their immediate view."
"The point made by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte about social exclusion is particularly valid."
"I would like to see whether there are differences in the pattern of the school day, whether this varies in different parts of Europe, and whether this offers ways of improving education."
"Then there is the use of compulsory sports activities: does this help in the educational system of different countries?"
"Do different countries have different patterns?"
"We would all be interested to know how the educational systems achieve competence in two modern languages in addition to the mother tongue."
"I suspect my own country will not do so well there but perhaps we would do better on the use of information technology."
"Finally, I would just like to say that the rapporteur's amendments calling for greater self-evaluation and participation of stakeholders inserts a valuable cog in the evaluation machine."
"The opinion of those within the educational system is often lost within the large civil service machines and bureaucracies which run schools."
"We must find ways which give power back to the schools and to the parents and to the students because that is where responsibility should lie."
"Mr President, Commissioner, education is assuming an ever more important role in the European strategy."
"The conclusions of the Lisbon Summit emphasised the importance of education both in improving competitiveness and preventing exclusion."
"It is only natural that the quality of school education should receive attention also at Union level, although the organisation of education itself is the responsibility of the Member States."
"We need Europe-wide cooperation and encouragement in all areas of education."
"Systematic quality evaluation in education is still in its infancy in many EU countries."
"In Finland, for example, there were legal provisions introduced on it as part of national educational legislation just two years ago."
"A report on the subject prepared in Helsinki last week shows that evaluation is not yet adequately systematic in nature, although it has got off to a brisk start."
"The report points out, for example, that comprehensive and high school education has not paid adequate attention to cooperation between pupils, their parents and the organisers of education."
"The importance of including pupils and their home background in decision making is certainly worth bearing in mind."
"Education cannot just be looked at from the limited point of view of competitiveness."
"There must be room for different sorts of talent, but, at the same time, we have to ensure that the others remain included. Education has a major part to play in building an equal and integrated society."
"Well-organised education means that national resources are being put to the best possible use."
"In my opinion, schools must be developed in such a way that all children starting their compulsory education can achieve success."
"That is why the evaluation of quality cannot just focus on results, which give a narrow picture of the situation."
"Education is not just about information and skills gathering, but also personal development, in the shape, for example, of a healthy sense of self-worth."
"It is a positive sign that a common position on the quality evaluation of school education is ready to be approved so quickly."
"Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, Commissioner Reding and the Council all deserve the credit for this."
"We are making good progress with this important issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, education is one of those areas of competence which is very much part of what goes on in a community, and so it should be."
"This competence must be carried out as closely to the population as possible, and that means that there will probably never be a need for a general European education system."
"But it is exactly because education is so important in the passing on, not only of knowledge and in the acquisition of skills, but it is also in the passing on of cultural heritage and in the integration of the individual into the social fabric that sound education is vital."
"Accordingly, we pour huge amounts of money into education and yet, there is an increasing need for European quality monitoring. That is why we would like to lend our support in this matter."
"Parents know that education requires a huge effort from children and students, but at the same time they expect to see results."
"In the old days, maybe attending a good school was sufficient, because it enjoyed our ideological trust."
"That criterion is no longer enough on its own, and has not been for a long time."
"Parents want quality education, and children who attend school want to actually learn what is important in life."
"Each one of us can ask the question how important common quality monitoring is in our own environment. What it did lead to in Flanders is a high level of self-evaluation in the schools."
"They sensed of their own accords that they needed to make a stand in the world of education. It has also led to increasing levels of care and concern across the borders."
"In Flanders, quality monitoring used to be a bit of a taboo subject, for example, for it was feared that this would breed hostility in the different educational networks. We now see that the opposite is true."
"The desire for quality monitoring in education has opened up the door to this large European Community and to the job market of this European Community. Quality monitoring has thus increasingly become a common area of concern."
"Today, I can show you the results of an enquiry which was held across the Flemish education system to check whether both primary and secondary education meet the common standards."
"It is quite striking how much media attention this enquiry received, precisely because they know that parents, students and the entire teaching environment scrutinise these results."
"After all, each school, each educational network, wants to come out of this enquiry smelling of roses, but at the same time, each parent wants their children to attend good schools."
"It has come to my attention that the world of education has been complaining about a lack of resources. After all, not only do we want our children to do well at school, we also want their schools to be well equipped, the environments to be safe, in other words the infrastructure to be up to scratch."
"Unfortunately, a great deal of resources are still needed in many countries in order to achieve this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for her work."
"I welcome the report and consider European cooperation in quality evaluation in school education to be important in this age of information."
"The European education systems must become attuned to the information society."
"Rapid scientific and technological change, together with globalisation, demand superior educational standards."
"We need an education system that can easily adapt to rapid developments in modern society."
"What constitutes a good school education these days?"
"Is it about imparting knowledge and expertise?"
"There is more to it than that."
"I believe it is the role of education in terms of the self-realisation of the individual and his or her participation in a democratic, socially just and tolerant society that is crucial to the definition of a high quality education."
"Young people must be given the opportunity to acquire academic and social competences at school."
"Everyone is entitled to a good school education, and that goes for foreign nationals and groups on the fringe of society too."
"They are particularly at risk of social marginalisation because they are not as well educated."
"I call upon the Member States of the European Union to ensure that everyone receives the same standard of education."
"The social divide between the informed and the uninformed must be bridged."
"Quality evaluation in school education is to be welcomed for two reasons."
"Firstly, I regard the evaluation as a way of incentivising people to improve school education, and secondly, it raises awareness of the quality dimension in education systems."
"The Member States of the European Union must work together in the field of quality evaluation in school education, because this is of crucial importance to labour market policy and the free movement of workers within the EU."
"In addition, organisations and associations working in the field of quality evaluation in school education should cooperate at European level."
"We need European networks so as to be able to offer mutual support and to get the external evaluation process off the ground."
"After all, schools, associations, and organisations can learn from one another by exchanging information and experiences and so find exemplary solutions to providing a good education."
"I am committed to the idea of providing a good education, as a way of preventing unemployment and social exclusion."
"A high-quality education is an investment in the future, for the sake of social progress, a peaceful world and tolerance."
"Mr President, today we are discussing a draft recommendation to the Member States on quality evaluation in education which may bring some worthwhile innovations to the working methods of the European Union and a project which has already made good progress at grass roots level."
"As far back as 1998, at a conference in Prague attended by 26 European countries, the national Ministers for Education agreed to implement a system of common indicators for their methods and results."
"First of all, they had to establish a common language and then compare results in order to share experiences, whilst leaving each Member State with full responsibility for its own education system."
"We will find this an interesting initiative as much from the point of view of its motives as the method used."
"As regards motives, on the one hand, education is obviously a key factor in the age of the information and knowledge society, for both human development and economic competitiveness."
"We should, therefore, ensure that we get the most from the inevitably limited resources available to us."
"So we can only be surprised at the size of the gaps between the Member States of the European Union which are emerging, in particular, from the first set of statistics published by Eurostat last July."
"For example, while the average level of public spending per pupil in secondary education in Europe is 100, Germany spends 84.9 and France 131.6."
"The difference is thus quite considerable."
"Moreover, it does not always work the same way and depends on the circumstances."
"That is why it is in all our interests to share our experiences."
"The advantages of doing this seem particularly obvious in the case of France, which has a very inflexible education system that would benefit from being more responsive to the needs of the 'education consumer' ."
"However, it is difficult to carry out any reform precisely because of this inflexibility."
"As regards the methodological issues, on the other hand, the new cooperation in evaluation of education systems could, in fact, lead the way to a new, wholly beneficial, method."
"It involves implementation of an open method of coordination, which has already been touched upon at the Lisbon European Council and which, if it were developed, could introduce a divide between working methods in Europe."
"It would not be a question of setting targets with a view to obligatory harmonisation."
"In any case, Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty establishing the European Community do not give the Community competence in this area."
"It is simply a matter of together finding out the best practices, without, a priori, setting targets in precise detail beforehand and of allowing each country to draw their own conclusions."
"This new method of coordination will create a networked Europe, which organises interaction between the various seats of power, i.e. the national Ministries of Education, rather than a centralised Europe."
"This networked coordination is more decentralised and flexible and more liberal than the standard harmonisation directive."
"In addition, it can easily extend beyond the Union' s borders to bring together 26 or more Member States, rather than 15."
"Mr President, we believe, for all these reasons, that this new and different method of cooperation seems to have great promise."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I said by way of introduction, back in the debate held on 5 July on ""quality evaluation in school education"" that the foundations for the future of young people are laid in classrooms, but not just in classrooms."
"There are no two ways about it, education, i.e. training and further education, must take centre stage in all policy areas."
"Education is not an end in itself but is the key to our being able to hold our own in the modern age, not just in economic terms but also at a personal level."
"The transition to the knowledge-based society, the globalisation of the economy, social, democratic and environmental change, together with far-reaching changes in the world of work, due not least to the new technologies: these are the big challenges we face in the third millennium, and they also require renewed efforts in the educational field."
"So again, I welcome the fact that this report has come before the House, because its aim is both to improve school education and the quality evaluation thereof."
"Quality comparisons - be they internal or external - generate competition, and if the quality of education in European schools is enhanced as a result, and the three-fold challenge posed by the information society, globalisation and rapid scientific and technological change is taken into account, then this report will have achieved its goal of giving renewed impetus to efforts in the field of education, and a major step forward will have been taken at European level."
"So let us help to ensure that the report on implementation, which the Commission is to put before Parliament in three years' time, proves successful."
"Permit me though, on a final note, to say something that is fundamental to the future of education, since I have just come from an educational symposium, the Federal Conference of the Austrian People' s Party."
"There is more to education than equipping people for employment."
"Its goal must be the all-round development of young people as individuals."
"This entails imparting fundamental knowledge, skills and competences, communicating values, and educating people in music, creative subjects, health and sport."
"Secondly, a sound knowledge base, which imparts important material and leaves out what is unimportant, still forms the basis for education in the twenty-first century."
"So it falls short of the mark to say that knowledge and information ought only to be obtained from the Internet."
"Those who do not have basic knowledge do not know where to acquire knowledge either."
"The cultural techniques of reading, calculating and writing form part of this knowledge base."
"The new technologies offer new opportunities to acquire knowledge and employ our cultural techniques."
"Only those who have a knowledge base know how to handle knowledge properly, and how to distinguish and differentiate, in an age that has seen an explosion in knowledge."
"That is why I feel this report makes a significant contribution to placing the acquisition of knowledge at the heart of our policy areas."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate those who have been responsible for getting the report to this stage."
"Quality, as we have been hearing, can be a problematic concept in education, especially when one looks at any form of assessment."
"There are certain areas, such as literacy and numeracy, where we can now gain some idea of what has been achieved."
"There are many international studies which have thrown up difficulties, however, when it comes to making straight comparisons, because of differences in curriculum, approach and the underlying assumptions about what constitutes a good education."
"It is essential not to confuse education with training."
"The primary purpose of education is not to prepare people for the job market but to prepare them for a life which is fulfilling in every way."
"In an increasingly flexible or precarious working environment people will be thrown back on their inner resources at many times in their lives and social cohesion is partly dependent on such personal resilience."
"We only have to look at what happens to those who are thrown out of work or who are excluded from the job market."
"So when we are assessing the quality of education, we want to see if we can develop people who have self-esteem and confidence, who can communicate effectively, who can look behind the information for the hidden message, who can question, who can work as part of a team and independently, and who are creative, resourceful and have an appreciation of the wider world and their responsibility to it."
"I also think that when we are looking at the quality of education we need to see if it is delivering real equality of opportunity for all of those within the system or whether it is doing, as society does, so much to exclude people on grounds of a poor background or their colour or whatever."
"So in our comparisons and benchmarking we have to look beyond narrow league table approaches."
"After all, every football team in a league depends upon the level of investment and the selection of the very best."
"It does not necessarily improve the performance of all."
"I am glad to see that we are recognising the importance of involving pupils themselves in the development and assessment of our educational system."
"We cannot expect to develop fully rounded and responsible individuals if they are not encouraged to be constructive and articulate about this major component of their lives."
"After all, education properly done is a collaborative adventure and we know we have a lot to learn from each other."
"That is why I welcome this report."
"Mr President, evaluation in general and evaluation in school education in particular are not a mere formality."
"Their purpose is always to check if the person being evaluated has met the predefined targets of the person conducting the evaluation, who sets both the evaluation criteria and the consequences of their being met or not."
"Collaboration on the part of the Member States in evaluating school education is becoming an important tool for intervening in the Member States' education systems, the aim being to promote an education model which is a far cry from a universal, quantitatively and qualitatively broad general education."
"A model which is even a far cry from the principle of ensuring that everyone is given the same start in life."
"A model which costs little but which serves the needs of big business for a cheap and, more importantly, docile labour force, a labour force which is wholly adapted to its requirements."
"This policy results in cutbacks in general education for the benefit of training which produces disposable labour; it even results in general education being replaced by an endless process of life-long learning."
"It also results in the weaker - and generally poor - students being shifted out of mainstream education into second-class training, as is the case in Greece, where the number of sixth form students has fallen by 35% in a few years following the so-called education reform."
"Evaluation also aspires to becoming a lever which can be used to force schools to operate in a competitive environment in which the best schools attract the best pupils, the best teachers and the most funding - in other words to operate on market criteria."
"This will result in falling standards in the majority of schools, especially in working-class districts and the countryside."
"In addition, the system of self-evaluation shifts the government's responsibility for the quality of education on to teachers, pupils and parents."
"If we were truly interested in the quality of education, we would not be concentrating on evaluation mechanisms but on improving the standard of education for everyone."
"The debate on how to carry out evaluation is futile and misleading."
"What does make sense is to debate the essence of the problem."
"What type of person do schools mould and for what sort of society?"
"If we were to evaluate today's schools on the basis of this criterion, we would surely conclude that they have a long way to go to meet the needs of the workers and for social progress."
"Mr President, I welcome this document and fully support the European Parliament and Council decision to promote cooperation and quality evaluation in school education."
"I particularly welcome the emphasis on social inclusion."
"Education is an important, indeed crucial, part of society."
"Our education has an impact on all our lives and our communities as well."
"Recent reports, as those of us from the UK are aware, have tended to criticise the teaching of children at a very young age as this could prove damaging."
"It would therefore be good to compare and contrast with other European models, within limits of course, as my colleague Mrs Lambert has already stressed."
"Spain, for example, attaches great importance to social inclusion and developing personalities, working in teams; integrating."
"These are placed higher on the agenda than academia and at an early age."
"I also fully agree with better integration between parents, pupils and teachers and the many community players who rightly want to play a role in education and its development and achieve, as a result, the idea of the school as the community."
"It will also provide an excellent opportunity to encourage schools in the different regions to share in good practices."
"Partnerships between different countries are so important, as indeed are partnerships not only between countries but between rural and urban links."
"This is part of a very important twinning concept and philosophy that is well established in Europe and is proving such a success throughout all our communities."
"Networking is so important."
"I stress that the sharing of good practices and the sharing of information between the different schools in Europe should not develop into a competitive practice."
"We should at all costs discourage any attempt to create European league table of schools similar to that in the UK that has proved so detrimental."
"I welcome the report, it is a positive paper and one that we can build on to create better educational networks within the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are only at the beginning of the new year and I believe that it is still appropriate to say to you and your families that I hope this year will see all your dreams come true."
"To everyone here at the European Parliament and the Commission, I hope that we continue to work on the same good terms as we have done in the past."
"Today' s business is to examine the draft recommendation on quality evaluation of school education."
"This draft has already made good progress and had the full backing of the European Parliament."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its enormous support which was testimony to its political will to forge ahead, something that was, at times, difficult."
"Parliament made many positive suggestions which, over the years, have been put into practice in the field."
"I would particularly like to give sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, for the excellent work that she has carried out in extremely short time frames and I would also like to extend my thanks to everyone in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"You have before you a draft recommendation which, as some of you have mentioned, relates to a key issue at the heart of our political priorities, to wit, can we guarantee improvements in the quality of school education and, if so, how do we go about it so that the European Union can give this a bit of a nudge in the right direction, without interfering in European systems which are, and remain, the responsibility of the national Ministers for Education?"
"You are aware that we have already made considerable progress towards this goal, since the launch of the major pilot project to evaluate the quality of school education took place at the beginning of the 1997 academic year."
"Over 100 secondary schools in 18 countries took part in this project. The draft recommendation is, to a great extent, based on the conclusions which we collectively drew from this research."
"The recommendation relates to two crucial points."
"First of all, that of evaluation as an instrument to improve quality - the aim of which is not to establish who is top and who is bottom of the class, but rather simply to act as an incentive so that everyone ends up at the top of the class."
"Secondly, the role of European cooperation in this area."
"This is, moreover, something we know how to do very well, and we have demonstrated as much."
"In this sense, the proposal encourages self-evaluation, external evaluation and urges all stakeholders to play a part in every aspect of the evaluation process so that, in the end, schools are inspired to learn from each other and can identify good practices and the most efficient tools for evaluation."
"In this process, the Commission shall not prescribe any rules and is fulfilling its role as a catalyst."
"It is encouraging European cooperation between schools and enabling them to establish a Europe-wide network."
"It is trying to set up a database of tools and instruments to be used by schools in self-evaluation and which will then by available to all stakeholders involved."
"That is precisely what the Lisbon European Council asked us to do."
"If we wish to place European society at the forefront of the world stage as an example of the knowledge society, then clearly, the extremely high quality of teaching in schools in every Member State, area and village should be the raison d' √™tre for social equality amongst citizens."
"Mr Karas said that, in today' s schools, we are creating the society and the success of tomorrow' s society and I agree with this wholeheartedly."
"From this perspective, it is our responsibility to provide every available tool and to ensure that schools learn from each other, that the system improves everywhere and that no one is left by the wayside."
"That is actually the goal of a knowledge society."
"We cannot afford ourselves the luxury of 20%, at the very least, of pupils being left by the wayside because they have not received the education they need to be able to do well in society."
"I agree with those of you who, on this point, said that you need to prepare for life in society before preparing for life on the employment market."
"Moreover, that is a considerable loss for a society that needs all its human resources in order to progress."
"Ladies and gentlemen, together with the Ministers for Education, we are making these proposals on quality analysis to enable us to give this opportunity to all young people, because if they receive a high quality education then it is likely that they will be able to do well in society and be able to find a job."
"That is why I would once again like to thank Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, the rapporteur, as well as the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and all the Members who have assisted us in this work."
"I would like to inform you that, following the Education Council' s move to make evaluation and quality a priority issue, action 6 of the Socrates programme has put out to tender within this very specific area."
"This will result in comparative studies being made and relevant institutions being networked."
"I would also like to inform you that, at the beginning of April, the Swedish Presidency will be holding a conference at Karstadt and that the upcoming Belgian Presidency has already planned to work on this issue during its presidency."
"You will, therefore, have concluded, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not the last time that we shall be discussing this issue and that I shall be coming here on a regular basis to speak to you in detail about new and, hopefully, all positive, developments."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"World cultural and natural heritage"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0382/2000) by Mrs De Veyrac, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the application in the EU countries of the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage [2000/2036(INI)]"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a commonplace to say that our heritage and its protection are crucial components of European identity, a commonplace but true, nonetheless."
"Our heritage is one of the most visible components, one of those closest to the culture of our fellow citizens."
"It forms part of their everyday environment and their own identity."
"It strengthens the sense of belonging to the European Union by identifying the roots we all share."
"Protection of heritage is therefore a vital necessity in view of the ravages it suffers over time, but also in view of the new forms of attack it is undergoing, such as atmospheric pollution, uncoordinated urbanisation, demographic pressure and, unfortunately, many others."
"The European Parliament has approached this matter very seriously with, in particular, two resolutions adopted in 1982 and 1988, which provide a frame of reference for the action to be undertaken in this field."
"I now consider it necessary to assess the current situation on this issue, taking into account both the principle of subsidiarity and the development of the European Union due to the increased number of Member States."
"It is worth recalling the objective of the UNESCO Convention, which is to protect heritage and not to enter it on a heritage list."
"Since the last time sites were selected in December 2000, 690 sites have been added to the World Heritage List, 208 of which are located within the European Union."
"Of these 208 sites, 192 are cultural properties, 11 are natural sites and 5 are properties of mixed type."
"The fact that the European Union is highly placed on this list, with almost a third of the sites, is easily explained in terms of Europe' s contribution to world civilisation."
"However, in order to obtain a better balance on the list between the various categories and also between States, UNESCO has drawn up a world strategy and an action plan for the implementation of that strategy."
"I think it appropriate that Parliament recommend that Member States that can pride themselves on a significant number of listed sites should restrict the number of sites they propose in future."
"I think it perfectly reasonable that they should make a contribution towards making the world list more representative and more balanced, both geographically and in terms of its content."
"When this report was adopted by Parliament' s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, the two provisions on self-imposed restriction were withdrawn by a very slim majority."
"I do however feel, ladies and gentlemen, that these provisions should be reincorporated, and I have therefore tabled two amendments to this effect on behalf of the PPE-DE Group."
"Another proposal was made in the report for a European list to be drawn up, for UNESCO sees heritage sites primarily from a geographical point of view, which restricts their concept of what a site is."
"A port may be classified, for example, without any regard for the boats. A steel plant may be classified without regard for the equipment."
"I feel that Europe, the European Union, on the other hand should look at things from a dynamic point of view."
"It could therefore take action on dynamic aspects of heritage and, from this point of view, a European list may represent real progress."
"It would make it possible to raise the profile of sites which are of more than purely national importance but which are not yet accorded world recognition."
"That would moreover help to bring Europe closer to the people, giving them an awareness of a shared cultural heritage."
"There is often need for heritage to be restored."
"The Commission should draw up a report on the position of restorers in Member States with a view to structuring the restoration sector in order to guarantee the quality of such work."
"High-quality restoration requires sufficient funding, and the need for economy should not override the need for quality work."
"Finally, I suggest that the European Commission should, in liaison with the Council of Europe and UNESCO, look into the viability of a legal and fiscal instrument in order to facilitate forms of patronage relating to the conservation of the cultural and natural heritage."
"This aspect might be included in the deliberations on the harmonisation of European tax systems."
"Protection of heritage is an area over which we must be continually vigilant."
"It is our responsibility to hand this heritage on to future generations."
"The young people of Europe must be able to identify themselves in this in order to build their future and to be able to perceive their European identity more clearly."
"Surely the feeling of being European relates far more to cultural references than to economic and social data?"
"In conclusion, let me repeat this expression which you will all recognise as emanating from one of the great founders of the European Union, ""If I had to start again, I would start with culture."""
"It is something which could have been said by Haydn composing in London, da Vinci painting in Amboise, or Byron dying in Missolonghi."
"It is the feeling, the pleasure we all experience when travelling through the European Union and marvelling at the treasures we find there and the pride we feel that, thanks to the existence of the European Union, we are in some small way owners, and also their custodians for all time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, world cultural heritage - we have just heard the statistics - is distributed relatively unevenly."
"Most of it is here in Europe, which is something we can be very proud of, although it also shows that there are certain inequalities."
"Also, there are very few sites, i.e. places that have been deemed part of world cultural heritage, in comparison with the number found in the rest of the world, and it is a real drop in the ocean, because there are many more sites that would merit this kind of status and support."
"This simplifies neither the decision-making process nor the selection procedures."
"More applications are rejected than are accepted, and I think there is a need to redefine the criteria."
"The diversity of cultural heritage underlines the identity of a country' s own regions, which is why responsibility must primarily be taken and asserted at regional level, whilst acknowledging that they must be afforded substantial support from outside, from the European Union and from all those who are jointly responsible."
"These regional responsibilities include the preservation of homelands, customs and traditions, the development of a country' s own regions and so on and so forth. As I see it, these are criteria that can primarily only be managed at regional level."
"The importance of world cultural heritage sites transcends the scope of regional development."
"They are cultural treasures, and bear witness to epoch-making changes and unique occurrences in nature."
"They have outstanding universal value."
"Architectural cultural heritage, land developed and cultivated by man and urban cultural heritage belong together, but the picture is not complete unless it also includes monuments to contemporary history, from the world of work for example, such as developments in working life, the building of factories, machines and so on and so forth."
"They trace the development of the working process of our document, and also elsewhere in the world."
"It is therefore just as important to tackle the plundering of architectural finds as it is to combat the thoughtless destruction of the remnants of social institutions."
"Rapid technological development and changes in our environment really bring home how important it is to spare a thought for our natural heritage and take responsibility, in other words development planning and changes of designated land usages must feature more prominently in our responsibility for the conservation of our cultural heritage."
"Accordingly, when selecting world cultural heritage sites, there must be more emphasis on striking a balance between historic sites, religious monuments, the various religions from prehistoric times, contemporary history and natural heritage, and the assessment criteria must be amended with this in mind."
"The conservation of our cultural heritage is associated not only with a high level of responsibility, but also with high levels of cost."
"We therefore need to find ways of alleviating the financing aspect, of considering the legal and fiscal instrument and providing sponsors with incentives to make us more conscious of this responsibility."
"Mr President, in the European Union and in this Parliament, we must deal with what is essential for European cooperation, namely that which creates a stronger and slimmer Europe, and we must be very careful not to take on any tasks which more properly fall to the Member States."
"It is important to protect cultural heritage, and the Union' s common cultural heritage is its diversity."
"It is a great and vital responsibility to safeguard this diversity in every single Member State."
"I therefore consider this report to be superfluous."
"On the basis of the principle of subsidiarity, it is my view that protecting cultural heritage is a task for the Member States."
"Up until now, the Member States have helped implement the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage by tabling proposals - many of them - for inclusion on UNESCO' s list of values of specially universal significance."
"There is probably a disproportionately high number of European topics on the list and, as the rapporteur remarks, a little more modesty might well be in order."
"I do not think it goes without saying that there should be a special list detailing European cultural heritage. Nor do I think it necessary for the Commission to take on the major task of coordinating the initiatives, as many have requested."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have therefore tabled a series of amendments whereby Parliament is to call upon the Member States, and not the Commission, to implement the necessary cooperation in consultation with UNESCO and the Council of Europe."
"I have done this in order to honour the principle of subsidiarity and also with reference to Romano Prodi' s words here in Parliament last year when he said, ""Let us remember how often we have been made into a laughing stock because we deal with things that are absolutely ridiculous, which defy common sense and conflict with the interests of our population"" ."
"I think that this is an area in which we can put the Union' s work on hold for a short while."
"Mr President, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport deserves our congratulations on its initiative to draft this report on how we can protect our cultural and natural heritage in the European Union, as does the rapporteur for the ideas and measures which she recommends, the majority of which I agree with."
"Naturally - to come back to what the previous speaker said - every Member State of the European Union has a policy on these issues."
"Obviously, we have no intention of superseding national policy."
"However, we really do need a more general perception and a policy at Union level."
"And the reason is clear: it is because all Union policies have a considerable impact on how we preserve and promote our cultural and natural heritage - mainly a negative impact."
"For example, the Union frequently funds projects and interventions through the Structural Funds which destroy or seriously affect monuments, the landscape and other elements of our cultural and natural heritage."
"There are, unfortunately, numerous examples from Greece alone."
"We fought long and hard some time ago to stop the Egnatia motorway from being routed alongside the ancient Dodoni theatre, where it would have prevented the audience from hearing the performance."
"Because of pressure from numerous organisations, the question of electricity pylons on the Cyclades islands was taken to the Privy Council, the Supreme Administrative Court in Greece, which broke new ground in its judgment and recognised, yet again, the value of the beauty of the landscape on these islands."
"Today, the question is still in abeyance of the new Olympic facilities in Schinia in Marathon, an historic site par excellence for the whole of Europe as well as a particularly important wetland which was initially included in the √ç√Å√îURA 2000 lists, Commissioner."
"We should like to save it, quite how I do not know."
"The construction is also in abeyance of the new museum on the Acropolis, a stone's throw from the sacred rock and the Parthenon."
"It is to be located on top of older archaeological remains, thereby endangering both the remains in question and the aesthetics of the whole area and the vista leading up to the world-renowned sacred rock and the Parthenon."
"This project and many others have one thing in common: they hope to receive, or they are already in receipt of, Community funding."
"It is therefore quite clear why I wholeheartedly support the particular points in the resolution which call on the Commission to examine projects from the point of view of their impact on cultural and natural heritage, their historical importance and their visual impact, all of which should be made into eligibility criteria, before any funding is approved."
"Mr President, Mrs de Veyrac' s report seeks to extend the concept of heritage and the criteria for the selection of national heritage sites in particular."
"The UEN Group will vote in favour of this report."
"No one can question the need to extend this concept to sites which are not just monuments, natural sites or moveable property."
"There is clearly a great deal of ethnographic data which can be collected and protected as world heritage."
"The importance of musical heritage or literature in the oral tradition may be emphasised, the task of collection, analysis and protection of which still remains to be carried out in a good many countries."
"This heritage, which goes beyond the traditional concept which often embraces only monuments or sites, is often a factor in the daily lives of the people living on this earth."
"It is this presence and permanence in culture and daily life which should define the very concept of heritage, as indeed Mrs Prets mentioned."
"I should therefore like to emphasise, for example, particularly here in Strasbourg, the importance which our fellow citizens attach to their national currencies and their determination to consider it as a part of their heritage."
"The German magazine, Focus-Money, recently published a survey showing that 70% of Germans are committed to the Deutschmark and wish to retain it."
"This percentage is an average, because in eastern Germany the rate is as much as 80%."
"The French Finance Minister, responsible for implementing the withdrawal of the franc, recently published on his website a very interesting survey on the French people' s commitment to their currency."
"This is, admittedly, a 'reverse diagnosis' because they were, of course, asked their opinion on the euro and not on the franc."
"Nonetheless, the response was overwhelming."
"Only 26% of the French have confidence in this artificial currency."
"I think it worth informing you of the real state of affairs, given that this is something that does not appear to have been taken into consideration or to have any influence over the European Parliament."
"In Great Britain, which has for the moment decided to protect its national heritage in the form of the pound sterling, only 14% of young people in the 18-24 age range wish to give up the pound."
"By this standard, the 45% of Danes who gave a yes answer would make the recent referendum in Denmark look like a vote in favour of the single currency."
"Europeans are committed to their own currencies just as they are committed to their own values, their own nations, their own natural heritage sites, their own languages and their own cathedrals."
"This is how national currencies should be protected, as if they were part of world heritage."
"This is the thrust of the amendment I have tabled on behalf of my group and which I urge you to support."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs de Veyrac, who has set out and elaborated on the subject of a Convention concerning the protection of world cultural and natural heritage in the Member States of the European Union, confirming in her report the undiminished interest which Europe needs to have in this important issue, together with the initiatives which need to be taken throughout the world."
"Although Nice did not take the crucial decision of exempting culture from the unanimity ruling, thereby enabling us to take a more decisive step towards convergence, what is important, as the report confirms, is that the European Union is working to develop a diverse cultural area."
"Equally important, in my view, is Europe's awareness, as the report states, that it is over-represented on the World Heritage list and that this over-representation applies both to historic towns and to religious buildings, as compared with other categories of countries, to Christianity in relation to other religions and beliefs and to 'elitist' as opposed to vernacular architecture."
"This awareness demonstrates that the concept of cultural diversity and respect for what is foreign is an accepted idea right at the nub of the problem and will help Europe play a fundamental role in relation to the rest of the world in the era of globalisation."
"As far as the proposals are concerned, I think that the proposal to take the initiative on harmonisation at ministerial level is especially important, as is decisive action by the Member States to stop the plundering of and the illegal trade in archaeological finds within the countries of the European Union."
"Moreover - and here I agree with Mr Papayannakis - I think that cultural impact studies should be a compulsory criterion when deciding which projects to fund with European money, so that we avoid causing what is often incalculable damage."
"It is to be welcomed that the Culture 2000 programme has allocated one third of its budget to cultural, archaeological, underwater and architectural heritage and to museums, libraries and archives, thereby strengthening national action."
"However, as the report points out, attention must be paid to rural heritage, to ancient and Palaeolithic forests, to habitats and wetlands, in other words to what are considered more or less marginal issues."
"Education and training in all professions involved in protecting, preserving and promoting cultural and natural heritage are also important, as are raising pupils' and young people's awareness and developing a movement of voluntary activities which can also make a decisive contribution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is a sound and very instructive report. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for the amount of work she has put into it."
"It shows, at least, that the European Union and the Member States have done their homework, and have done it well."
"They have submitted many applications, so much so that this has led to an imbalance."
"In my opinion, this is due to the opinion that it is especially buildings that must be registered. There are, of course, also other aspects, and I believe we should encourage Member States to take measures so that we can redress the balance and be more selective."
"My own group is debating whether or not the European Union has a task here."
"First of all, the preservation of our cultural heritage, also at European level, appeals to the citizen."
"Our historic monument days are always very well attended."
"Our cultural heritage is an excellent tool to make the European dimension visible."
"Secondly, European added value is evident in many areas, for example in cross-border projects in the Wadden Sea region and underwater archaeology."
"The European Union can encourage Member States to cooperate, and can offer support in all cultural areas, for example."
"Another point where the European Union can fulfil a typically European task is research and education."
"So is creating clarity as to which areas transcend national interests."
"Drafting inventories and lists is necessary at every administrative level, and it is important to weigh up all the pros and cons when taking environmental action."
"Thirdly, I would mention the deployment of structural funds."
"Preserving cultural heritage is important for tourism."
"It brings cultural diversity into focus."
"It has a bearing on employment."
"The question of whether the European Union has a task is not a question to me."
"In this area, the European Union has a task to stimulate, support and make visible Europe' s common cultural heritage."
"Accordingly, I, along with others in my group, will give my unqualified support to the rapporteur' s report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it so happens that I was involved in the practical application of the UNESCO Convention in a particular case."
"At a UNESCO meeting some years ago in Casablanca, the issue was raised of whether to make the entire Alpine Region a World Heritage Site."
"I confess to feeling somewhat perplexed at this point, for I found the idea of lumping the entire Alpine Region, which covers a whole range of different areas, together as one site rather odd."
"I was amazed by the frequent discrepancies between the sites selected - certainly not due to any fault of UNESCO's but because of the varying natures of the sites put forward by the States. I also noticed the conspicuous absence of some cultural, natural or mixed sites."
"In this regard, Mr Costa of our group, who is the mayor of Venice, reminded us ironically, a few days ago, that Venice has never been classified as a World Heritage Site."
"Well then, upon reading the Convention my suspicion was confirmed: the 30 year-old Convention is now prehistoric."
"In the meantime, we have become much more sensitive towards culture and the environment - consider the buzzword 'sustainable development'."
"This is why I am afraid that the report will prove to be full of inconsistencies: some issues need to be simplified because of the need for coordination between European countries rather than European interventions, which can be unnecessary and are sometimes used by the Member States as an excuse to avoid their responsibilities."
"Moreover, in certain cases, the structures already exist."
"I would point out - and this is a positive fact - that the text refers to regional minority languages, which are covered by a range of protective measures."
"Nevertheless, there are some good points."
"I would point out that there must be a policy of active interventions inasmuch as the protection of sites works well if the interventions also include the commitment of financing; the sums referred to by the Convention, which are minimal, are certainly not sufficient for active interventions, especially in Third World countries."
"It would be a good idea for the Commission, sooner or later, to indicate the limit which State aid may exceed, as laid down in Article 87(3)(d)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am going to discuss that area of Europe' s cultural heritage which is not included on UNESCO' s list and which is scarcely included on our own lists."
"It has to do with the fact that almost every second square metre of the European Union is cultivated, both the agricultural landscape and land given over to forestry."
"The whole of Europe' s current biological diversity is a result of nearly 10 000 years of struggle and hardship."
"It is the fruit of cooperation between nature, the climate, technology and the human being as cultivator."
"That is what has given us the incredibly diverse and many-sided Europe with which we are familiar."
"I naturally believe that cultural heritage is a responsibility for regions and nations and not, in the first place, for the European Union."
"There is, however, one area in which the Union has complete power over cultural heritage, namely agricultural policy."
"If I were in a position to decide, I should exchange the EU' s current agricultural policy for a policy which favoured cultural heritage and biological diversity."
"I should like to use subsidies to preserve the cultivated terraces around the Mediterranean and to preserve the biologically rich and fantastically beautiful meadows in the mountain areas surrounding rivers and lakes in thickly wooded Scandinavia."
"In short, a good cultural policy for Europe would be a transformed, modern and relevant agricultural policy."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"1997 discharge"
"The next item is the report by Mrs van der Laan (A5-0397/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the progress report of the Commission on the measures taken in the light of the observations of the European Parliament in its 1997 discharge resolution [COM(2000) 224 - C5-0223/2000 - 2000/2113(DEC)]."
"Mr President, there have been further developments regarding the report on the 1997 discharge."
"That is a new departure, but then again it comes as no surprise, for this was a special case after all."
"It was the first discharge after the fall of the Santer Commission and thus the first opportunity for this Parliament to have a say in the European Commission' s reform policy."
"Since then, Parliament has made its views heard on a regular basis, notably in the excellent reports by Mr van Hulten and Mr Pom√©s Ruiz."
"Needless to say, the reforms should help restore confidence in Europe."
"The question today is whether those initial steps, which were promised at the time in order to obtain the discharge, have actually been made."
"All in all, it is fair to say that the Commission has made every effort to meet the requirements of this Parliament."
"A serious start has been made on reforms."
"It is, of course, too soon to determine whether all the required results have been achieved; too many words still need to be translated into action for that to happen."
"Although things can still go pear-shaped, even at Commissioner level - and naturally the abominable Commission proposal on access to documents is one of the things that springs to mind - it is quite clear that this Commission is highly committed to making a break with the past."
"I will give you a few examples."
"In its discharge resolution, this Parliament demanded an end to an unacceptably high percentage of error in bills."
"The Commission subsequently submitted proposals to streamline the Financial Regulation, and produced a plan to eliminate all abnormal arrears by the end of 2003. Parliament is issued with six-monthly reports on this."
"In addition, Parliament asked for a reform of the rules on whistle-blowers and for disciplinary procedures; the Commission ensured that this reform was made."
"Parliament asked for improvements in the field of bureaux for external aid; tick."
"Parliament requested a list of current fraud and corruption inquiries; again tick."
"Parliament asked the Commission to clarify its foreign aid strategy; tick yet again."
"Mr President, these are but a few examples, but they do demonstrate that the European Parliament can yield substantial results if it makes a concerted effort."
"One section of the discharge which this Parliament has every reason to be proud, is that concerning the hospital in Gaza."
"In 1996, this project, which is subsidised by the European Union, was 97% complete."
"Due to mismanagement and a lack of follow-up, this hospital still stood empty up until the end of last year, at the very time - we are familiar with the images from the Middle East - when there was a desperate shortage of medical help in an area which very much needs it."
"In April 1999, this Parliament found out about this scandalous state of affairs."
"From that moment, we gave the Commission hell, with no let-up, until we finally had results."
"Since the hospital opened three months ago, more than 2 700 patients have already been treated and more than 370 healthy babies have been born there, which is good news in an area where death is an every-day occurrence."
"If this Parliament had not made it so clear that enough was enough, I am convinced that the hospital would still be empty now."
"Unfortunately, the hospital is now having to face other problems, namely it is impossible to make any deliveries to this hospital due to the closure of Gaza, and even ambulance services cannot get through the Israeli blockades, but that is another story."
"I would like to take the opportunity to go into Mr van Dam' s amendment very briefly."
"I believe that, although it is an extremely kind and considerate amendment, the content of which must be given due follow-up, I cannot recommend approval of it as rapporteur, because we have very consistently rejected new elements in the discharge, so I hope that there will be some understanding for this."
"Needless to say, there are also areas of concern with regard to the 1997 discharge."
"For example, a higher level of transparency must be achieved within the personnel policy with regard to recruitment of staff and the proposed redundancy scheme."
"I also expect the Commissioner to shed some light on how the Commission will guarantee that each individual Commissioner will ensure that recommendations from the Court of Auditors do not end up in some drawer somewhere, but will be implemented with due care."
"This Parliament will monitor the follow-up of all reports brought by the Commission."
"The extensive pledges for the coming years must be translated into action, and I hope that we can do this together, and in doing so, close off this sad chapter and be able to work together on the future with confidence."
"Mr President, the van der Laan report gives a clear overview of the measures which the European Commission has taken further to observations made by Parliament in the context of the 1997 discharge."
"From that point of view, my group will support the report, and I would congratulate Mrs van der Laan on her achievement."
"However, I would like to point out - and that is also mentioned in the report - that although some progress has been made in five areas, they have a long way to go yet."
"This applies to the closure of accounts, improving institutional management and control problems, the technical assistance offices and the fight against fraud and corruption."
"I will not go into all these areas but highlight a few."
"I believe it is of utmost importance for the Commission, in its attempts to reduce the unacceptably high percentage of error, to identify the Member States which fail to achieve any improvement in the percentage of error in the case of the biggest expense items, for example."
"The Member States will obviously not like this, but why could we not keep a scoreboard for this, just as we do for the Member States' performance rating in terms of implementing European legislation?"
"The more transparency, the better."
"An added benefit is that the national parliaments can bring their governments to book."
"In the fight against fraud and the careless handling of European monies, we must rely far more on cooperation with national parliaments."
"The trust of the citizen in the powers that be, and specifically in the European Union, is at stake."
"It cannot be that we here in Europe get the blame for the negligence and carelessness of national governments."
"In the near future, the Commission will need to pull out all the stops in order to set up an efficient management and control system."
"We will soon be discussing the new Financial Regulation which, I hope, will better accommodate the requirements of modern management."
"Continuity, transparency and clear competences are vital parameters in this."
"We must avoid a situation where different bodies responsible for fighting fraud and corruption, such as OLAF and the financial irregularities panel, cancel each other out in their efforts."
"There is nothing worse than having investigation offices putting all their energy into mutual competence-based squabbles."
"Finally, we set great store by the Court of Auditors systematically examining the annual reports to see how the Commission has acted upon critical remarks made previously."
"Control without referring back to errors detected previously is a job half-done."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs van der Laan for giving the Committee on Budgetary Control and the European Parliament a model on which to base future discharge reports."
"From the outset she was very clear that she wanted to concentrate on a few areas where we wanted to see real improvement."
"They were clearly set out last year."
"Now we have a follow-up to check that those points have been implemented."
"We shall be following her lead in not supporting the amendments tabled because we want to keep to that clear-cut approach."
"On the whole, the Commission has responded positively, and this now has to be set within the context of the more general Commission reform."
"We are pleased that the Commission will present annual activity reports for each Directorate-General but, for that to work effectively, we need to know the targets for these DGs very soon."
"Work on staff policy has also gone ahead but things seem to be moving very slowly."
"We appreciate the sensitivity of negotiations on staff issues but we and the European public will soon lose patience if the talking does not stop soon and the action start."
"The CAP and Structural Funds are the areas where most mismanagement problems lie in the EU, partly due to the scale of the finance received by these areas."
"That is why it is critical that we, as the controlling and accountable body, have access to information on the financial management of these two areas."
"We look forward to receiving regular reports from the Personal Representatives Group."
"External aid, however, is an area where we still see substantial problems."
"The rapporteur has referred clearly to the disastrous way the aid to Palestine was handled, which gives a very poor signal at a time when the utmost political delicacy and sensitivity were needed in that region."
"Another Court of Auditors' report on external aid has come out very recently and we shall be looking at that in the future."
"Once again, I thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on a job well done."
"Mr President, in her report, rapporteur Mrs van der Laan looks at the progress which the Commission has made over the past year with regard to following recommendations set out in the report on the 1997 discharge."
"She is rather pleased with the reams of paper which the Commission has produced."
"I am waiting for more substance, for results."
"The intentions are good, but the effect will not be evident until we see the results, once, for example, OLAF is working truly independently, once the backlog in payments has been cleared, once fewer errors are made in payments and once we finally gain access to confidential documents."
"Furthermore, I am unconvinced by all the Commission' s good intentions."
"The scheme for whistle-blowers, much applauded by Mrs van der Laan, leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Instead of openness and transparency, the scheme exudes an atmosphere of damage limitation."
"According to the new rules, whistle-blowers must prove that they have followed the correct procedures."
"Is this not a case where the burden of proof should be reversed?"
"We should let the Commission prove that it applied the procedure correctly."
"Mrs van der Laan devotes much thought to the aid to the Palestinian regions and displays an astonishing degree of faith in the decisiveness of the European Union' s delegation in the process."
"I would like to see a report in which the role of our Palestinian counterpart is explained."
"Moreover, the recent executions force us to revisit the conditions for European aid."
"In this connection, I would draw everyone' s attention to the fact that the teaching material in Palestinian schools contains many anti-Semitic statements, which, in our countries, would fall under the heading of incitement to racial hatred."
"European aid must serve peace."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment in which I urge the Commission not to support the spreading of anti-Semitism in schoolbooks in any way."
"There should be no question of European money being used to pay for the spreading of racist views."
"I therefore heartily recommend my amendment, and hope it will meet with broad support."
"A formal condemnation is not doing anyone any good."
", Chairperson of the Committee on Budgetary Control. (DE) Mr President, it is amazing that the follow-up report on the discharge seems to be generating far more interest this time than the discharge itself, which was, in fact, prepared by the previous Parliament."
"I welcome this with open arms, but there is nothing new in the fact that we have compiled such a report and are sticking to it, as we vowed to at the time."
"Yet I believe we have done justice to our task of verifying whether the Commission has met our demands in relation to the discharge."
"I am extremely pleased that the rapporteur has taken all these issues up again and would like to congratulate her to this effect. However, I am also delighted to be able to tell the Commission that it has fulfilled these demands extremely well."
"We are talking conditions, and not just comments."
"However, there are still a few matters to be resolved."
"This is also clearly brought out in the report, by the way."
"I would single out the closure of accounts for special mention in this respect."
"It is truly alarming when we put in excess of EUR 70 billion to one side, which inflates the budget and is then unavailable for other tasks that the EU has set itself."
"We must do more to tackle this than just compile a report once every two years; we need to cut back."
"Commissioner, this is a matter for you."
"Secondly, I do not think much to the idea of setting up a second office for internal investigations."
"We have set up OLAF and ought to concentrate far more on ensuring that OLAF is able to carry out its work properly and in an independent manner, particularly its internal investigations."
"I believe it is important for us to uphold the demand that we raised during the discharge process, namely that of creating a disciplinary chamber, which could be attached to the Court of Auditors or the Court of Justice."
"I would remind the Commission not just to issue statements on this, but also produce a legal basis."
"Finally, I would like to say a big thank you for the efforts made in respect of the Gaza hospital."
"I was there myself."
"I am delighted that after all these years, it has at long last started work and is evidently serving the people well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to carry on straightaway from where Mrs Theato left off."
"Commissioner, we are actually finding it quite hard to imagine what the point would be of having an advisory office for financial irregularities of the kind you envisage."
"The same applies to the new agency for internal administrative investigations that the Commission is planning to set up."
"What purpose would this office and agency actually serve, when by the Commission' s own decree, OLAF is responsible for all serious breaches of duty against the interests of the Community, and not just for fraud-related offences?"
"I would remind you once again that you, yourself, decided that that is how it should be, yet you are evidently on the point of allowing some kind of pointless superstructure to form part of your proposals."
"Mrs van der Laan' s report quite rightly maintains that the Commission has not yet made sufficient progress on the personnel policy front for Parliament' s taste."
"This particularly applies to the already long overdue reform of the disciplinary procedure."
"Of course, this has a great deal to do with the budgetary discharge, because one thing that also concerns us is the issue of the liability of officials in respect of damage they cause."
"Do Commission officials have to defray the costs of damage they cause, themselves, at least as far as their financial means permit?"
"In principle, the answer to this question has long been 'yes' ."
"Only, the corresponding provisions of Articles 73 and 74 of the Financial Regulation have never actually been applied in a single case yet."
"The excuse used was always that the relevant procedures were unclear."
"Anyone hoping that this will now change under the reform process has been disappointed so far."
"It is this very issue, an absolutely crucial one, that the consultation paper on the reform of the disciplinary procedure put forward by Vice-President Kinnock on 29 November, ignores, and it postpones a response until a later date."
"Understand that if you will, because I find it incomprehensible."
"This House has repeatedly and clearly opposed this and called for an external chamber for budgetary discipline to be established at the European Court of Auditors or Court of Justice, which should be called in whenever the financial accountability of officials is at issue."
"This demand from the report by Mr van Hulten on the reform of the Commission has now been on the table since January last, and was expressly re-confirmed in the Stauner report on the 1998 discharge."
"I also believe that this discharge, the excellent report by Mrs van der Laan, leaves these issues, which are key to the credibility of EU administration, unresolved."
"We have pointed the way, and now all we can do, Commissioner, is to invite you to follow it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are discussing the follow-up measures to the 1997 budgetary discharge at the beginning of the year 2001, is, to my mind, rather anachronistic in procedural terms, given that the 1998 discharge procedure was concluded more than six months ago and the parliamentary committee responsible is already working on the discharge for 1999."
"A modern, efficient administration should respond forthwith to Parliament' s criticism and recommendations for improvement, particularly when misdemeanours need to be dealt with."
"Turning now to matters of content, despite some welcome progress, the fact remains that key demands lodged by Parliament have not been fulfilled and are therefore to be carried over into the discharge procedure for subsequent years, which means that the clear delimitation we desire will become more blurred."
"There are two points in particular I would like to highlight."
"I am at a loss as to why the Commission has, as yet, failed to take steps to set up a chamber for budgetary discipline at the Court of Auditors or the Court of Justice, and so guarantee the effective application of the provisions of the Financial Regulation concerning the financial liability of officials for damage they cause."
"How many times do we have to ask, urge, beseech - and I do not know what else - the Commission to get round to doing something at long last?"
"Surely this is a reasonable demand?"
"The same goes for our demand that Parliament, as a discharge authority, should be given at least the same amount of access to the Commission as the Court of Auditors."
"After all, the duty to provide information is clearly Treaty-based, i.e. it derives from Article 276 of the Treaty of Rome."
"Incidentally, it also seems to me that the advisory office, which was mentioned earlier, would be surplus to requirements, and I do not intend to go into this matter any further at the present time since previous speakers have already taken care of it."
"However, both demands are reflected in our amendments and I consider them indisputable."
"I would appreciate your support in this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs van der Laan, the Commission welcomes your report."
"You have ascertained that in most areas that were central to the 1997 budgetary discharge procedure the measures taken by the Commission merit approval because we are heading in the right direction."
"I might therefore venture, at the start of this new year, to take pleasure in the fact that Parliament has commended the Commission."
"But I want to do more than just give pats on the back, and instead go on to look at the areas where you continue to voice criticism or rather, demand that further measures be taken, namely in the fields of staffing policy and external aid."
"As far as staffing policy is concerned, in your report you specifically focused on the issue of the legal basis for the early retirement scheme."
"I would again draw attention to the fact that, before Christmas, the Commission adopted a proposal that is now undergoing the consultation procedure between the institutions and will be forwarded to Parliament in February."
"The key figures are as follows: it should be possible for 600 people to participate in the early retirement scheme."
"However, owing to budgetary neutrality there are to be only 248 new appointments."
"Who will qualify for the scheme?"
"It is conditional on the official being at least 50 years of age and having been in service for at least ten years."
"The scheme also makes provision, according to a person' s age and service affiliation, for 60-70% of their salary to be counted as early retirement money."
"It is a voluntary scheme."
"Nor is there any legal entitlement, instead, the Commission, using objective criteria, will select who is able to take up early retirement, thereby ensuring that the object of the exercise, i.e. an overall increase in efficiency on the staffing front, is actually achieved."
"The second aspect relating to staffing policy concerns the disciplinary procedure."
"In its January report, Parliament proposed that an external chamber for budgetary discipline should be set up within the European Court of Justice or Court of Auditors."
"You have also mentioned this proposal again today."
"I think I should just run through the reasons again - which my colleague Neil Kinnock has outlined in great detail - as to why the Commission has distanced itself from this proposal."
"The European Treaties assign specific tasks to the Court of Auditors and to the European Court of Justice respectively. The Court of Auditors is responsible for the external control of finances and it is the role of the Court of Justice to oversee the disciplinary procedures pursued by the Commission should the need arise."
"As the Commission sees it, it would lead to conflicts of interest if the Courts were to be directly involved in the Commission' s internal procedures."
"The Commission would also point out that, in all international organisations, it is the institutions themselves that are responsible for disciplining their staff."
"The Commission is convinced that the same should apply here."
"Naturally, there is a need for action."
"That much is obvious having viewed the matter objectively."
"We adopted the proposals that are now undergoing the consultation procedure, and which Mr B√∂sch mentioned, even before the end of the year."
"Firstly, we are talking in terms of steps that can be taken directly, without changing the statute, and secondly, there are steps that will require amendment of the personnel statute, and will therefore take a little longer to implement."
"As far as the first steps are concerned, it is absolutely vital to set up an investigative and disciplinary bureau within the Directorate-General for Personnel and Administration."
"In response to your query, I can tell you that the question is constantly raised as to whether OLAF is already involved in the procedure or intending to become involved before this bureau starts work."
"Only if OLAF answers this in the negative will this bureau take action."
"The scenarios can vary a great deal."
"I would like to cite an example: sexual harassment in the workplace."
"Since OLAF may well not be called in to deal with such cases, it would, of course, be necessary to invoke an administrative investigation or a disciplinary procedure."
"So various areas come to mind."
"I think it is an excellent idea to take a complementary approach."
"We are not about to strip OLAF of its tasks, as it were, or undermine its remit, which was determined by Parliament and the Council, because OLAF investigations take precedence here, and that is a fact."
"Secondly, it is very important for the disciplinary council to be chaired by an external expert."
"This would demonstrate that the Commission is keen to implement fair and objective disciplinary procedures."
"I have just a few more words to say about your critical comments on foreign policy."
"Mrs Theato mentioned the need to reduce outstanding commitments."
"We submitted a report on this as part of the 2001 budgetary procedure and made it clear that, of course, these abnormal commitments, which have long been known as dormant commitments, must be reduced as soon as possible."
"Indeed, the field of external aid is already showing the first positive signs in this respect."
"Turning now to the matter of the hospital in Gaza, which plays a significant part in the report by Mrs van der Laan."
"There were certainly a great many infuriating delays."
"Indeed, there were repeated and emphatic demands from within this House for progress to be made and for something to be done about all the problems."
"Yes, it is most gratifying that the hospital is now fully up and running and that it has been treating patients since the summer."
"One thing I would say though, is that developments on the political front, i.e. the violent clashes, have thrown up barriers again."
"It is even the case sometimes that, owing to the blockades in the Gaza Strip, supplies cannot be delivered and patients cannot get there."
"Many members of staff are unable to reach the hospital at the moment."
"We really must - also within the scope of this debate - make repeated calls for the violence to end."
"The European tax payer was willing to deliver aid to the people of Gaza."
"It is high time the people were able to make use of it."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Special reports of the Court of Auditors"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A5-0331/2000) by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 8/99 on securities and guarantees provided for in the Community Customs Code to protect the collection of traditional own resources, together with the Commission' s replies [C5-0228/2000 - 2000/2132(COS)];"
"(A5-0396/2000) by Mr McCartin, Committee on Budgetary Control, on the European Court of Auditors' Special Reports Nos 1/1999 concerning the aid for the use of skimmed-milk and skimmed-milk powder as animal feed, 2/1999 on the effects of the CAP reform in the cereals sector, 1/2000 on classical swine fever and 8/2000 on the Community measures for the disposal of butterfat, together with the Commission' s replies [C5-0236/2000, C5-0237/2000, C5-0238/2000, C5-0239/2000 - 2000/2130(COS)];"
"(A5-0389/2000) by Mr Staes, Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 2/2000 on aid given by the European Union to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a view to restoring peace and the rule of law, together with the Commission's replies [C5-0229/2000 - 2000/2131(COS)];"
"(A5-0359/2000) by Mr Dell'Alba, Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Reports Nos 6/1999, 7/1999, 3/2000 and 7/2000 on budgetary implementation of the Structural Funds, together with the Commission's replies [C5-0240/2000, C5-0241/2000, C5-0242/2000, C5-0243/2000 - 2000/2129(COS)]."
", deputising for the rapporteur. (ES) Mr President, I should like to begin by praising the fine work done by my colleague, Salvador Garriga Polledo, in the report he is presenting on own resources, a subject he has been following very closely for some time."
"The Community budget comes, in part, from the traditional own resources raised by the Member States' customs services and therefore the principal role of Community legislation on guarantees and securities is to protect the financial interests of the Community."
"The defects in the procedures applicable to the security and guarantee system mean precisely that the corresponding Community revenue is not collected and has to be covered by additional GNP contributions from the Member States."
"Therefore, I understand that interest should be levied on traders who effectively use unauthorised credit in their deferment accounts as part of release for free circulation operations."
"The Garriga Polledo report deals with cases under Member State responsibility in which a failure to enforce Community legislation on securities and guarantees harms the Community' s interests."
"According to the Court of Auditors, in cases of mandatory securities the basic principle is that the customs authorities should fix the security at a level equal to the precise amount of the customs debt where this can be established with certainty, or if not, the maximum amount, as estimated by the customs authorities, of the customs debts which have been, or may be, incurred."
"In practice, it is the security or guarantee body that assesses the risks of the operation."
"In order for these risks to be assessed, the guarantee should be fixed at the closest possible level to the customs debt for which the security or guarantee is provided."
"If these rules were observed, the pertinent financial interests would be fully protected."
"A number of difficulties arise in this and I shall highlight half a dozen:"
"First of all, there are no reliable statistics on the volume of guarantees currently granted."
"The data on these securities and guarantees, which are clearly identified in accounting and legal terms, certainly exists in the customs accounting departments of Member States, but there are no procedures to enable it to be collated and known at Community level."
"Secondly, some customs authorities cannot - I prefer to think this rather than that they do not collaborate - effectively monitor observance of the requirements set out in Community legislation on guarantees because of failures in their accountancy operating or computer systems and procedures."
"I must stress the need for the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) to come into operation soon in all the Member States and the countries associated with the common transit system."
"It is clear that the fulfilment of Community securities will depend, to a large extent, on the development of all the operations of the NCTS."
"To solve the problem of the high level of undischarged transit operations, we should emphasise the importance of operational measures and, again, the need for swift development of this new system."
"With the multiple guarantee certificate system and the NCTS we shall achieve centralisation and greater administrative clarity."
"Thirdly, incomplete declarations must be mentioned."
"At the end of the periods allowed under Community rules the Member States should transfer the duties covered by a guarantee which are not contested into 'A' accounts."
"Fourthly, the need for a change to Community customs legislation in order to ensure that the securities which guarantee the right to credit should also guarantee the automatic payments made by the customs offices after release of goods."
"Fifthly, the large number of cases reported by the Court of Auditors in which the amounts owed to the Community budget have not been paid or received with the relevant late payment interest."
"Lastly, I should like to mention the difficulties giving rise to the failure to collect the considerable amounts of customs duties and other taxes arising from TIR operations, which are attributable to ineffective implementation of existing mechanisms and a lack of monitoring of transit operations."
"To conclude, Mr President, I want to stress that the Commission must study the various problems raised and, in particular, review the computer system in order to take into account the interest owed in this respect to the Community budget by the Member States."
"Mr President, I want to acknowledge the important role of the Court of Auditors in preparing these reports."
"I am dealing with four reports relating to the dairy sector, the cereals sector and swine fever involving total spending of approximately EUR 16 billion, which is a considerable proportion of the budget."
"The study by the Court of Auditors involves a great deal of detail and we must acknowledge the important role it plays in assisting Parliament in its work, because, obviously, without this interaction between the Court of Auditors and Parliament, Parliament would be in no position to evaluate or judge the effectiveness of Commission spending."
"We can also acknowledge that the Court of Auditors plays a role in assisting the Commission to identify weaknesses in its administration and difficulties which it may not have observed in the way Member States implement our various schemes."
"The Court of Auditors, in this particular report, has drawn attention to the weaknesses in the basic regulations, weaknesses which make it difficult for the Commission and indeed even the Member States to effectively control spending."
"In the special report on the reform of the cereals sector, the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to the question of whether or not the policy itself attains its economic and social objectives."
"To go back to the dairy sector - there are two reports here, one relating to skimmed-milk powder, the other to butter - we should remember that even though we have a quota system which is designed to bring production close to the level of consumption, we still have to spend approximately EUR 3 000 million a year disposing of surpluses, and of the skimmed-milk powder which we produce something like only 37% of it is sold at market value."
"In other words, the rest of it must be subsidised for use in animal feed and other things. Similarly, in the case of butter, only 75% of the butter we produce is sold at market prices."
"This identifies the weaknesses in the policies where we have a quota system and at the same time require vast Community resources to subsidise surpluses."
"The Court of Auditors' report - and Parliament supports this - draws attention to the fact that we should perhaps utilise our resources better in a way that might encourage greater consumption of dairy products on our European markets, rather than subsidising unused quantities."
"In the cereals sector, the main concern of the Court of Auditors was the fact of overcompensation which has been well documented and which we acknowledge, and it also draws attention to the fact that it is necessary in designing policy at all levels - Commission, Council and Parliament - to take account of market changes."
"When we designed this policy we did not foresee the rise in world prices which led to gross overcompensation in the sector."
"The report also draws attention to the fact, and Parliament notes this, that something like 40% of all the EUR 14 billion spent in the cereals sector goes to 3% of farmers, and 54% of farmers only get approximately 5% of the aid."
"This again draws attention to the whole thrust of the policy and whether or not we should review it with the idea of making it more compatible with regional policy and with social policy."
"These were the main concerns expressed."
"We should also say in relation to the cereals sector or to the dairy sector that we have noted that the Commission has undertaken a root and branch review of the policy and has already set that study in motion."
"So we look forward to its completion."
"I want to thank the Commission for its cooperation and the fact that it has already taken action on some of the weaknesses identified in the various reports."
"Mr President, since the end of December 1995, when the Dayton peace accords were concluded, the European Union has contributed to peace in a major way."
"A great deal of funding has been freed up for reconstruction, the organisation of elections, contributions to human rights, etc. We also financed 53% of the High Representative Office."
"The Court of Auditors' Special Report which is before us, is the third in a series."
"There have already been reports on the situation in Mostar, and a second report dealt with the reconstruction in former Yugoslavia."
"I believe that these special reports, together with the report which is now before us, have consistently made us as a European Parliament sit up and face the facts, and also try to act upon these reports in an effective manner."
"I also believe that progress has been made in this area thanks to the Court of Auditors' way of working, together with the follow-up by Parliament, via the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the task of budgetary control cannot be carried out from a little office in Brussels or an office in Strasbourg."
"I believe that sometimes, it is necessary to visit the relevant location."
"Expertise in the field is necessary; you need to meet the people; you need to know what people have to put up with there, what the conditions are."
"For previous reports, other MEPs have been given the opportunity of going to Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"They learnt a lot from their visit, and I visited the place myself between 16 and 19 October of last year."
"That is very important. I would like to reiterate as well as underline this."
"In actual fact, I learnt more in those four days in Sarajevo than I could have learnt from wading through reams and reams of written material."
"I would therefore like to urge the Conference of Presidents to take this into consideration when, at a later date, they decide for or against giving rapporteurs the opportunity to have this experience."
"What was the criticism about, ladies and gentlemen?"
"First of all, criticism was levelled at the Commission for not deploying sufficient resources and staff and for a Brussels-based management which is too centralised."
"I gather that this criticism by the Court of Auditors has been acted upon by the European Commission."
"All credit to the Commission for this."
"Improvements have been made and staffing levels have increased."
"I would like to stress here that the people in the delegation in Sarajevo are better organised, highly qualified and highly motivated."
"That is thanks to the Court of Auditors' criticism and the fact that Parliament has acted upon this criticism."
"Furthermore, the Commission has, under pressure from the Court of Auditors, adopted a deconcentration policy, which has given the people in the Sarajevo delegation, but also in other delegations, more clout. It has also meant that the head of the delegation can meet the needs on the ground in a more powerful manner, and has also ensured that all overdue payments have now been cleared."
"So, as far as this is concerned, well done to the Commission."
"Other criticism concerned the High Representative' s Office and how the European Union works with that office."
"The European Commission has been blamed for not keeping a close enough eye on it."
"Thanks to the Court of Auditors' report and the action taken by Parliament, there is now a new mentality in the Office of the High Representative."
"It is indeed the case that, since March 1999, there has been a new financial director who has written a veritable tome on the rules to be followed."
"Apparently, when the High Representative first took up office, rather a lot was being wasted."
"His commitment, and that of the Commission and the office as a whole, has slimmed down the budget of the High Representative' s Office by nearly EUR 5 million over a period of three years."
"I believe that this is an extremely positive result."
"Moreover, one of the key criticisms directed at the High Representative was also in the shape of Paragraph 17 on the conflict of interests generated by the former financial director."
"Parliament, at least in the resolution now before us, is asking for a full explanation in this regard."
"I have to let you know that I have now received a document from the High Representative, and from the Commission, and that the key criticisms have been addressed in this document."
"That is why I propose the adoption of my amendment, which takes this into account."
"Other criticism was expressed with regard to human rights."
"I have to say that the Commission is doing a truly creditable job on this in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina in general."
"I believe we should make more funds available to those people, but in terms of human rights, we are still waiting for responses from the Commission with regard to Paragraphs 29 and 35."
"A final - important - point I would like to make is the recurring theme of the media policy."
"The Commission has come under very strong criticism with regard to its media policy."
"It is reported that with regard to this policy, EUR 2 million' s worth of equipment was subsidised which was not eligible for subsidy."
"I am still waiting for a detailed report from the Commission."
"It is included in the resolution, and so I hope that a response will be forthcoming in the very near future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my report is really a combination of four separate reports."
"From this point of view I should like to thank Commissioner Schreyer for attending."
"I hope that, through her, the managers responsible more specifically for the administration of the Structural Funds, both in the Commission and in the Member States, will be made aware of the content of our report and of our conclusions, since this matter concerns the Structural Funds, which, as we know, are generally managed by the Member States directly."
"So, to the four distinct reports: one report on the principle of additionality, one report on the development of industrial sites, a third report from the Court of Auditors on the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (Guidance Section) - Measures to assist the employment of young persons, and a fourth report on the International Fund for Ireland and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation."
"Regarding this last report, I should particularly like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for its contribution."
"Our Committee took on board all the amendments they presented."
"Although these four subjects are quite distinct, the same sort of comments can be made about them all, and these are of three types."
"Firstly, the major criticisms which may be levelled at the Commission with regard to the administrative procedures which the Court of Auditors, like us, considers too time-consuming and too complex and which occasionally hinder the smooth running of projects."
"It must be said that the same criticisms are also made of Member States."
"There is never sufficient monitoring once projects are underway, either at grass roots or from Brussels."
"The same lack of resources and staffing is continually remarked upon - other speakers have raised it on other points - even despite the frequent comments by the Court of Auditors on the subject."
"The Commission is currently engaged in a radical reform of its organisation and is asking for additional resources."
"I hope that Parliament, which has always believed in the myth of the zero growth of officials despite the multiplication in their duties, will accept the Commission' s proposals and objectives and will also step up its monitoring tasks and its role."
"Obviously, this will cause some overlapping of funding, since funding is not sufficiently well monitored, and hence the poor use of European appropriations."
"The final criticism that may be made concerns the delays in payments, a recurrent problem which the Commission does not appear to be capable of resolving or putting a stop to."
"Secondly, a major criticism that I would like us to emphasise in our dealing with the Member States is the poor use of appropriations, often due to a lack of cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the reluctance of the Member States to make better use of the funds."
"Too often they are treated as donations, funds to be substituted for national funds."
"In some instances, the Member States attach little importance to the principle of additionality which stipulates that this is cofinancing which must be complemented by national financing."
"They seem to think the funds cover 100% of the financing, which is clearly not in line with the reasoning behind the Structural Funds and their use."
"The Member States should not forget that these are public funds and, as such, the concern of all the citizens of Europe."
"They should hence be used with even more care than national funds."
"In order to remedy such inefficiencies, a new regulation was adopted in June 1999, which I hope will enable us to make progress."
"When it uncovers inefficiencies we would urge the Commission to use all the means available to it, such as the suspension of payments, and if there is sufficient justification we shall be right behind the Commission in this."
"Finally, I think the Commission itself should pay more attention to the eligibility criteria before authorising funds to be released."
"This would prevent the funding of projects that were not viable and the 'rag-bag' projects that are often seen in the Member States."
"That concludes my comments."
"Thank you, Mr President, for the extra few seconds you allowed me."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the European Union is making considerable resources available for the reconstruction of democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina and for its consolidation fully justifies the seriousness with which we are now addressing the motion for a resolution on Special Report No 2/2000 of the Court of Auditors."
"I say this because it was only at the beginning of 2000 that the Court was able to complete and approve its report on Community aid granted between 1996 and 1998, in other words, between four and two years previously."
"The obvious consequence of this regrettable delay is that many of the observations in the report are out of date, since, in the meantime, major changes have taken place in the legal framework and the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"But this does not mean that the report' s observations should not be taken into account in future, particularly in Kosovo, in order to avoid similar problems arising with identical actions promoted by the Union."
"This type of monitoring is crucial for identifying and solving existing problems, which exist on two levels: one involving direct funding and the other cofinancing with other donors."
"In the first case, one problem that stands out is the inadequacy of support for actions designed to protect human rights, support for civil society and support for the media."
"There have been many situations which, fortunately, have been rectified."
"These range from identification of centralised procedures inappropriate given the urgency with which actions have to be carried out, to the fact that the Commission found itself confronted with various faits accomplis which subsequently had to be financed."
"With regard to cofinancing, we welcome the transfer of financing from the Office of the High Representative to the first pillar, which meant that it had to be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation."
"Furthermore, we believe the same will have to apply to financing for monitoring electoral procedures and, consequently, to cooperation with the OSCE."
"To conclude, Mr President, these were the observations that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy felt should be considered in the report by Mr Staes - whom I congratulate - given the volume of the total funding for this type of aid, the shortage of resources and the obvious need for them to be used in a rigorous and transparent way."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Dell'Alba's report and its recognition that the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation Fund are an innovative means of consolidating the peace process."
"The difficult environment in which the Funds have had to operate, their role as a pump primer, the approach in giving priority to disadvantaged areas and the unique role in pioneering the joint management and delivery of cross-border programmes have all been given the recognition they deserve."
"I understand that the International Fund for Ireland has produced a comprehensive response to the issues raised in the Court of Auditors' report, which can be made available to Members."
"That response includes a number of specific actions that the Fund is taking to address matters raised in the report."
"It is important to stress one crucial point in relation to the International Fund for Ireland: this is not a European Union programme."
"The Fund is, in fact, an international organisation with its own governing body, rules, audit procedures and so on. Furthermore, the European Union is just one of five donors involved in its financing."
"The European Union's annual contribution constitutes 35% of the total."
"The International Fund for Ireland was established by the British and Irish Governments in 1986 with the objective of promoting economic and social advance and encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between the Unionists and Nationalists throughout Ireland."
"Contributors to the Fund are the United States, the European Union, Canada, New Zealand and Australia."
"Since the Fund was set up it has provided assistance of EUR 597 million to 4 600 projects, which have helped to create 38 000 jobs, leading to an additional investment of approximately EUR 1.193 billion, bringing the overall investment in these projects to almost EUR 1.79 billion; directed almost 90% of its commitments to the most deprived areas; encouraged over 9 000 participants in cross-community groups and encouraged 5 000 participants in cross-border structures."
"Mr President, may I say that Mr Staes has done an excellent job in his report."
"May I also point out to everyone that the Balkans are a separate area of Europe, both geographically and from the point of view of their customs and their way of thinking."
"So we need to study every incident from every possible angle if we are to be efficient both in our criticism and in the measures which we take."
"What it comes down to, as Mr Staes has said and done, is going and seeing for yourself."
"From where we stand, we cannot see what is happening in these particular regions, which are pretty much a law unto themselves."
"We cannot monitor what is going on from behind a desk."
"We cannot understand the Balkan way of thinking from letters, faxes and e-mails."
"What we need to do is to get close to them, and we need to get close to them not just by expressing an interest which, it goes without saying, is manifest on all sides; we need to get close to them in practice, both physically and geographically, but mainly by learning about their history and what makes them tick."
"Everything that has happened, the comments made by the auditors and the Commission, demonstrate that something that is good can always be replaced by something that is better and that something that is better can always be made better still."
"That is the direction we are all pulling in. I am certain that the interest evinced by us and the critical spirit which exists cannot but lead in the right direction and, if you like, we can take the results of the practices applied to this sort of cofinancing and adapt them in other directions."
"The European Agency for Reconstruction is now up and running in Thessaloniki and Pristina."
"It has attracted a great deal of criticism, but we cannot presume that Sarajevo is the same thing as Pristina and we need to make that clear, which is precisely why I referred to different ways of thinking, customs and situations which need to be borne in mind."
"Many honourable Members - and to some extent they are right - said that the agency in Thessaloniki should be decentralised and should move to Pristina."
"Many of us categorically opposed this as out of the question."
"We have been proven right in keeping the agency in Thessaloniki because if we had moved the Thessaloniki agency to Pristina, Yugoslavia would now be unable to obtain funding from the European Agency for Reconstruction because it would have been impossible for a Serb to go to Pristina and claim so much as a single euro."
"Which is why I repeat that criticism is a good thing, but everything we do must be adapted to the circumstances, the needs and the peculiarities of each region."
"Mr President, I would like to start by giving my thanks to the Court of Auditors for its very useful report this time on a range of issues."
"We were very critical of it at the time of the annual report but I think these special reports are very valuable."
"There are clearly a range of areas where the Commission has yet to act to improve matters."
"Today, I am going to concentrate on a response to the report written by Mr Dell'Alba on various aspects of the Structural Funds."
"Certainly, in my country, this is one of the areas where the European Union can visibly claim to be making a difference, and there is a recognition that Structural Funds and the attempt to increase wealth, and improve social conditions and employment rates in an area give a positive image of the EU."
"But we cannot stand by and uncritically applaud."
"The reports by the Court of Auditors clearly show that there is room for radical improvement, and the Commission has already introduced a new Structural Fund regulation to improve the situation and will obviously be checking very carefully to see whether these reforms have gone far enough."
"In the case of additionality, we must remember that European Funds are intended not to finance but to cofinance operations and must not take the place of public expenditure by national authorities."
"That is all very well, but even the new regulations only allow for assessment of additionality at a national level and not at a regional level."
"Rules are rules, but if there is no effective punishment after breaking them, they become weaker and unenforceable, so we need to see a solid legal basis to develop the possible imposition of sanctions."
"On the issue of the development of industrial sites, the Commission should not wring its hands but say that this should only be seen as part of a wider policy to assist SMEs."
"Substantial sums go into these developments."
"In Wales, for example, we know that this is a clear target; we need clear targets and objectives and we will be looking forward to seeing those within the Structural Fund programmes in future."
"Mr President, I would like, in double-quick time, to take you through a number of observations which concern the Court of Auditors' reports which were, indeed, useful."
"First of all, there is the Garriga report."
"I believe the Committee on Budgets has already made plans to this effect, but I think it is vital that we evaluate the results of the committee of inquiry on transit fraud."
"What has the Commission done so far with the recommendations in that report?"
"Next, there is the McCartin report on agriculture. It is always an interesting topic, and nobody will deny that the agricultural policy is not static, but that it should move along with the times, especially in connection with the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation and enlargement."
"I would also like to raise two points without making a judgment either for or against."
"The following considerations are currently of importance to my group: first, what would the effect of cofinancing agricultural expenditure be, and income allowance, in particular?"
"Another point, which is very topical at the moment, is animal disease control."
"This is taking a huge chunk out of the European budget."
"Would it not be possible, in imitation of customs in the Member States, to obtain insurance cover against the outbreak of certain animal diseases?"
"Could the Commission look into this matter at the earliest opportunity?"
"Turning to the Staes report, it is encouraging to see that the European Union can make a difference in the Balkans, which is much like a hornet' s nest."
"We are delighted about this, and we believe the Staes report is excellent."
"We particularly support the fact that it is not the Office of the High Representative which is calling the shots; it is the European Union which coughs up the funds and which will have to check whether these are well spent."
"I would like to make a general comment on the climate of corruption which is supposed to prevail in the Balkans."
"In our opinion, it is necessary for the Commission to decide on the way in which this should be allowed to affect Europe."
"Is this having an impact on European aid?"
"Finally, I would like to make an observation with regard to the Dell'Alba report."
"In my country, there are indications that the price of industrial sites is rising considerably thanks to European aid."
"This is not desirable in our eyes."
"Could something be done about this?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports from the Court of Auditors have been given a whole new relevance by the current BSE crisis."
"The European agricultural policy must be given a thorough going over."
"BSE is only the tip of the iceberg."
"Subsidisation of quantity increases, overproduction and then more subsidies for reducing surpluses, not only is all this very difficult for the ordinary citizen to comprehend, it is also extremely susceptible to fraud, and the quota regime cannot begin to cushion the effect."
"This is very clearly borne out by the McCartin report."
"It is to the rapporteur' s credit that he constantly draws attention to this, and not just in times such as these."
"Unfortunately, Parliament does not have full co-determination powers in agricultural matters and is therefore only able to make very limited use of the political room for manoeuvre."
"The decisions are taken in the Council of Ministers; they are reached behind closed doors by the national Agricultural Ministers, with their diverse client interests."
"Yet whilst they reserve the right to make the decisions, they are not prepared to actually take on responsibility."
"When it comes to errors, misdemeanours, irregularities or fraud, they are not the ones who immediately take responsibility; no, they always point the finger at Brussels, i.e. the EU instead."
"There has to be a fundamental change on this score."
"Not only is control called for, but also political co-determination for Parliament in all areas of the agricultural policy."
"We need more transparency and openness."
"This is not about working against the farmers; it is about fighting for a different kind of consumer policy, in the interests of the farmers."
"Mr McCartin has already mentioned the right key words in his report."
"What we are talking about here is the issue of direct aid and cofinancing."
"Something needs to change here, also in the light of eastwards enlargement, if we want to pursue the agricultural policy in such a way that it will lend itself to eastwards enlargement."
"Even after the Nice Summit, it is clear that the Council is incapable of actually solving these problems, and so to conclude, I would like to stress once again, and this will be a matter of concern to the whole of Parliament, that Parliament needs full co-determination and codecision rights in agricultural policy."
"Mr President, in the report of the Court of Auditors for 1999 we can read that Great Britain, Belgium and Holland have been huge net payers into the EU budget."
"These three countries have rendered account in the budget of their customs duties, i.e. own resources, to a much greater extent proportionally than other countries."
"There are large ports in these countries and a lot of traffic in transit passes through them."
"Both the documents of the Court of Auditors and Mr Garriga Polledo' s report feature an embarrassing element."
"In many countries abuses have been revealed, although there is no mention of countries' names."
"This consequently gives rise to the suspicion that crimes are mostly committed in those countries that have large transit ports."
"If there is no mention of countries' names, suspicion must fall on Great Britain, Belgium and Holland."
"If they are not guilty of covering up crimes and protecting criminals, they are, nevertheless, the object of suspicion, as the countries' names are not mentioned."
"Huge volumes of goods pass through the European Union, which are then shipped outside the Union from its ports."
"Studies by both the Court of Auditors and OLAF have shown that there is major abuse associated with tobacco imports and transit traffic in particular."
"It is difficult to assess the extent of this, but the size of the damage caused to the Union is estimated to be between one and five billion euros."
"Tobacco comes mainly into the Dutch and Belgian ports and is transported on through EU countries, often to the area of the former Yugoslavia, to Montenegro, for example."
"Last year the EU decided to grant financial aid to Montenegro to the tune of EUR 15 million for political reasons, free of any conditions connected with the prevention of smuggling."
"Every night contraband tobacco is taken by 50 or 70 speedboats from Montenegro to Italy from where it is distributed to EU markets free of customs duty or tax."
"To prevent this sort of thing from happening, we need determined effort and answers to the problems Mr Garriga Polledo referred to in his report."
"From the Union' s point of view, we are talking about a project costing billions of euros."
"Mr President, today' s debate is certainly a welcome one, but it covers some very different subjects."
"I shall therefore confine my comments to the subjects raised by Mr McCartin and Mr Staes."
"Regarding the first of these reports, the French Members of our group cannot endorse its comments on butterfat, which challenge the Council decision to maintain guaranteed prices until 2005."
"This is a decision we think is particularly justifiable, and one that is essential for farmers."
"Similarly, we do not think that the fact that 92% of appropriations available in 1998 under the disposal measure ""butter for non-profit organisations"" was spent in just three Member States, none of which is among the poorest in the European Union, as the resolution points out, is worth including as a serious argument."
"It is rather jumping the gun to forget that the phenomenon of the development of a fourth world and the impoverishment of certain social strata in our countries is a horrendous reality, and the return to still vulnerable growth is not about to make it possible to quickly reintegrate that sector of the population which has often been marginalised for a long period."
"We do not find the report' s critical attitude to the aid given to the major cereal-producing regions to be satisfactory either, even though the report does, admittedly, pay special attention to the smaller cereal-producers within the European Union."
"We do not share the report' s opinion, on the subject of swine fever, that pig farmers should bear the greater part of the financial burden involved in combating epidemics. One might well ask just why they should be expected to bear these additional costs when they are weighed down by considerable costs already."
"They are clearly not the parties responsible for epizootic disease; they are its victims."
"So, unless we are seeking, once again, to renationalise the common agricultural policy on the quiet, there could be no question of accepting this proposal."
"Mr Staes' report on European Union aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina rightly condemns the serious financial mismanagement in the Office of the High Representative (OHR) during a dramatic period, what is more, and once again, at the expense of monies belonging to the citizens of Europe."
"Our group also notes the request for the OHR and the Commission to provide information detailing the reasons leading to this confusion of interests."
"Nor is it acceptable for EUR 2 million to be allocated to ineligible material in the sector of ...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I would like to say a few words concerning the excellent report by Mr Staes."
"Firstly, I would, however, like to direct my comments at you, as a member of the Bureau of Parliament."
"It was a disgrace to this House that we had to tolerate such a bureaucratic administrative hold-up over the question as to whether or not we can send the rapporteur of Parliament 's Committee on Budgetary Control to Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"I hope that for the sake of those whom we are supposed to represent here, there will be no repeat performance."
"I make no bones about the fact, because this is something we - myself included - normally criticise the Commission for."
"This time, I am sorry to say, we are forced to acknowledge that the problem lies with us, which is insupportable."
"Secondly, this report by Mr Staes raises our hopes in two respects."
"Firstly, the Commission is receptive to new ideas."
"A most welcome development has taken place between the first visits under the leadership of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the status quo as ascertained by our rapporteur, and I can only congratulate the Commission on this."
"At the start of this programme for the Balkans, aid was granted in the typical EU manner, i.e. the decision was taken around the green table in Brussels and private firms were then commissioned to determine the aid requirement at local level, and to divide and distribute the funds."
"This method has been abolished and the system almost revolutionised - partly under pressure from this House."
"It shows that our initiatives are valuable and that the Commission is receptive to new ideas."
"Commissioner, perhaps you could even use this receptiveness to new ideas, which you displayed in the delegation in Sarajevo, as an example for other delegations in other countries to follow."
"Mr President, despite the resources that the Structural Funds have been devoting for years to furthering territorial balance in the European Union, the 25 richest regions still have a per capita income two and a half times higher than the poorest, and despite the many needs put forward by these least-favoured regions, not all the appropriations earmarked as development funds are actually used each year."
"I believe we should think about the real causes behind this incomprehensible fact."
"Perhaps there is a lack of initiatives and the least-favoured areas do not know how to develop."
"If that is the case, we should not just cross our arms and justify our inaction with the excuse that we give them money but they do not use it properly."
"We should push forward with an additional policy of analysis, information, training, motivation, consultancy and monitoring to give a boost to new structures and opportunities for development and progress."
"But it is also possible that what is happening is that from our more developed and more technocratic positions we are being too perfectionist and demanding, imposing too many regulations and conditions, and thus preventing and stifling the appearance of valid ideas in keeping with the level of development of the regions addressed by Community policies."
"Perhaps we should adapt the Community policies to these regions instead of expecting the regions to adapt to an elitist European policy."
"What is ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I should above all like to congratulate Mr Staes on a most outstanding report."
"His conditions of work were not the best."
"It is unfair that we in Parliament should have to deal with a report from the Court of Auditors concerning events going back many years, but the fact is that Mr Staes has done his homework and gone out into the field."
"Now, it is not that I do not trust Mr Staes, on the contrary, but I too happened to be in Bosnia last week, and he is right in his assessment."
"The history of the Commission' s delegations in Bosnia has become a success story."
"The Court of Auditors' report concludes that the Commission' s control over funds for the High Representative' s Office and the UN, for example, has not, by any means, been good enough."
"Many of the problems are due to the projects having previously been administered centrally from Brussels."
"Now, the EU delegations on the spot have been given more powers and more staff."
"This shows that the idea of giving the delegations more duties and more responsibility does, in actual fact, work in practice."
"The Court of Auditors proposes that, in future, the EU should give organisations such as the UN, the OSCE and the High Representative' s Office a sum of money which they can administer themselves."
"At the same time, the Court of Auditors would like to see tighter control."
"I really do not think that this adds up."
"If we simply give money as a direct form of budget aid to the organisation, then the Commission will completely lose track of things and no longer have any control."
"The issue of cooperation between the EU and the organisations will become part of the 1999 discharge."
"The Commission is calling for clear guidelines from the Council and Parliament."
"That is something I can well understand."
"We cannot demand both better control and more of a free hand."
"We merely need to retain a certain degree of control over taxpayers' money."
"The UN system is unfortunately becoming more and more bureaucratic, inefficient and corrupt so, in spite of everything, I have much more confidence in our own EU system."
"Mr President, this debate covers ten special reports by the Court of Auditors on subjects of such varied kinds and importance that they range from a study of the principal of additionality in structural actions to a specific and thorough analysis of the Community cereals policy."
"I would therefore like to limit myself to the latter issue and to begin by congratulating Mr McCartin and the Court of Auditors on their excellent work and by highlighting the final points of the Court' s analysis."
"Between 1993 and 1997, overcompensation in the cereals sector amounted to over EUR 13 billion."
"Every European citizen contributed more than EUR 37 to the cereals budget in 1997."
"Arable crops represented 43% of agricultural expenditure but only 10.7% of final production."
"Almost 40% of subsidies went to 3% of farmers, and 57% of the beneficiaries received 4.5% of subsidies."
"The Court of Auditors concluded from this analysis that the current system of support for farmers' incomes, which is based on factors such as price, yield or area farmed, needs to be replaced by a system based on a standard net income per farm household or working unit, with farm support only being triggered to make good any fall in that income."
"The COM in arable crops provides the greatest argument for the need to reform the CAP."
"The thorough political remodelling that has been applied to the structure of Germany' s federal government is a clear sign that, even at the heart of Europe, where this CAP was conceived and where it has always found its greatest support, it is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain an agricultural policy model that was designed to protect an industrial approach, based on large-scale farming."
"We must come up with a rural policy geared towards regional needs and fairness between farmers if we are to preserve Europe's cultural heritage and the environment."
"This will require reform of the current CAP."
"Mr President, I shall comment on certain problems raised by Mr Dell' Alba' s report to which I should like to draw your attention."
"The measures to assist young farmers setting up in business are inadequate, since in far too many cases the target group exceeds the age limit on the date of receiving aid even though it was eligible at the moment of presenting an application."
"Given the difficult situations experienced by a large number of these young people and the hardship faced by people working in that sector, a situation where some of them cannot receive European and national aid due to inaccuracies and delays is not acceptable."
"As regards the measures to assist the employment of young persons, we would need a precise assessment before being able to consider the impact of this policy."
"This assessment should take account of the variety of routes to employment to be implemented."
"As regards the measures for the redevelopment of industrial sites, on the contrary, the funding has been too generous, since the ERDF aid has been used to fund projects of types other than the development of industrial sites."
"This is compounded by the fact that different forms of aid, if not coordinated at regional level, can engender competition between promoters and a subsequent scattering of aid and reduced effectiveness."
"This does not make it possible to conduct a redevelopment policy which takes account of the diagnosis of needs and the assessment of achievements, ultimately enabling the active administration of regional development."
"In this respect, I cannot go without mentioning the restructuring planned by the Danone Group, a procedure we find in various Member States."
"We cannot tolerate firms which have been able to receive European subsidies being allowed, even though they are in good financial shape, to decide, for reasons of structural adjustments, to lay off thousands of people and causing as many family crises which, once again, will be a drain on national and European public monies."
"In conclusion, one of the major objectives of the European Union is to combat unemployment, which is a priority of the Member States but also of the Commission."
"We know how difficult it is to reach the whole of a target group with any measure."
"However, in view of the inaccuracies and shortcomings that have been observed, demands have been presented to have the necessary arrangements made immediately, in particular in order to better define the measures and to actually pass the benefit on to the recipients by curtailing delays in the handling of cases and the payment of beneficiaries, in order to ensure that the results achieved are..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for the specific references in his report to two major fundings in Northern Ireland relating to our peace process and for his positive response to the International Fund for Ireland, which is funded not just by Europe but also by the United States, Canada and Australia."
"I would advise other regions with serious problems of unemployment to study the work of the International Fund in Northern Ireland and the border counties."
"It has done such outstanding work."
"For example, it has funded some 4 600 projects, creating 38 000 jobs, and almost 90% of these jobs are in areas of high unemployment and in deprived areas."
"Some 9 000 people from cross-community groups have been involved in these projects for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and some 5 000 people have been involved in the cross-border projects."
"It has done an outstanding job and I welcome the positive response in the report to it."
"There is also the Special Peace Programme from the European Union itself."
"At grass-roots level in Northern Ireland it too is bringing together people from both sections of our community, in particular with projects for young people - young men and women."
"There are shared-city initiatives to promote community; there is development and training for unemployed women - I am just singling out some of the very successful operations that are going on - the development of the food industry and, of course, the new housing development."
"We very much welcome and deeply thank the Commission for this, and the Council of Ministers for the Special Peace Programme for Northern Ireland."
"I should like to express my deep gratitude to all my colleagues in this Parliament for their unanimous support for this peace project because it is making such a very positive contribution to the development of peace in my country."
"Mr President, as a Member of Parliament representing that part of Ireland which benefits from both the IFI and the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, I would like to praise the track record of both these funds, and as a representative who works closely with the local groups and projects making excellent use of the funds I would like to state that I am perfectly satisfied that all monies disbursed through the funds are rigorously accounted for."
"The IFI and the Peace Fund are unique funds so it is understandable that certain misunderstandings should have arisen owing to a lack of familiarity with the special nature and operation of these funds."
"As was pointed out previously, the EU makes a major contribution together with the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand."
"The Fund has committed in excess of ¬£400 million which has triggered an investment of ¬£1.2 billion creating 38 000 jobs for 150 projects right across the border countries and Northern Ireland."
"I deem it wholly inappropriate that the Committee on Budgetary Control should question the effectiveness of the IFI funding system."
"I believe that these funds have made a major contribution towards the peace process and that Mr Dell'Alba should familiarise himself a little more in detail with these funds."
"I would invite him to visit Northern Ireland and the border countries and to see the situation for himself."
"Mr President, it was with great apprehension that we read the McCartin report, which, I regret, we did not discuss until yesterday afternoon."
"Quite frankly, we were rather perplexed at the evaluations it contains regarding the agricultural sector, for, if the data and figures are to be interpreted so harshly for a sector which is undergoing such great, all-encompassing change as the world of agriculture is due to the common agricultural policy, we are concerned about the decisions to be adopted."
"Of course, the rapporteur, Mr McCartin, has recommended a path to take: a thorough review must be carried out of the agricultural sector and the rules governing it."
"It is regrettable that the codecision process on the decisions to be adopted for agriculture was not closed at the Nice Council."
"There will certainly be a great deal to do in that area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank Mr Garriga, Mr McCartin, Mr Staes and Mr Dell'Alba for their reports on the reports by the Court of Auditors, which total ten in all and cover the period 1999/2000, or were published in addition."
"I feel this debate has shown how valuable the Special Reports by the Court of Auditors are, because they investigate particular problematic areas in great detail."
"As Commissioner, I can only welcome these Special Reports with open arms because they enable us to deal with criticisms as they arise, and the Court of Auditors constructs its Special Reports so well that they can have a direct bearing on new Commission proposals."
"Of course, I must be brief and I am only able to go into some aspects of Parliament' s very detailed and valuable reports. Firstly I will deal with the report by Mr Garriga, and then I will consider your comments on the own resources, Mr Pom√©s Ruiz."
"EUR 14 billion is raised annually in customs duties, for the purpose of financing the EU budget, and a substantial proportion of this amount is accounted for by securities and guarantees."
"Over the last few years, the Commission has endeavoured to substantially improve the legal provisions in this area."
"I might mention that in 1999 and 2000, new legal provisions on the transit procedure in the customs field entered into force."
"They allow for better monitoring of transit processes and the handling of securities undertaken for the purpose of safeguarding these processes."
"The Community Custom' s Code has just recently been amended and the amendment has entered into force."
"Last year, seven Member States were connected up to the new computer-supported transit procedure."
"Parliament initiated a great deal in this area through its committee of inquiry, which produced some very practical results that are now being worked on by the Commission."
"Above all, it is highly significant that the candidate countries are now to be directly involved in this computer system, i.e. in this new procedure."
"There are two ongoing sets of infringement proceedings against Germany relating to the consequences of impropriety in respect of customs procedures, and the question as to whether this should attract interest payments, and consideration is being given to invoking similar proceedings against Austria, Belgium and Denmark."
"In addition, I might point out that at some point in the next few days, the Commission will present its report on the own resources system for the period 1997-1999."
"All in all, it is the Commission' s intention to transfer more responsibility to the Member States in the customs field."
"I take the view that in the event of administrative error which leads to losses in customs revenue, a different regime should apply in future to the one currently in force, i.e. it is the Member States themselves that should be liable for the loss of revenue in the event of error."
"It is quite simply a bad system, in that the last pillar of financing within the EU budget has to come into play in such circumstances, i.e. all Member States then have to pay according to their share of GNP."
"In other words, the present system is such that those who practise sloppy management are rewarded, whilst those who make a special effort are, in fact, the mugs."
"It ought to be the Finance Ministers' first priority to want to change a system of this kind."
"There is no sign of this happening yet, but the Commission will continue to press the point."
"I will now turn now to the extremely important report on agriculture by Mr McCartin."
"I would like to express my gratitude for these reports."
"They cover the following subjects: milk powder, butterfat, cereals and swine fever."
"I have several brief comments to make on these, and, Mrs R√ºhle, all I can say is how right you are that this report too illustrates, once again, the number of areas in which urgent reforms are needed."
"We have one surplus in the entire area of milk production, and this causes a whole host of other problems, particularly in terms of financial control, because this surplus has led to specific sales promotion measures for skimmed-milk powder and butterfat, which raise enormous problems for financial control time and again, or, to put it another way, they create opportunities for fraud."
"The criticism raised in the Special Report prompted the Commission to improve on and simplify four aspects relating to skimmed milk."
"The definition of skimmed-milk powder eligible for financial aid was stated more precisely, the control procedures, particularly in relation to the detection of the presence of whey in skimmed-milk powder, were reviewed, and the aid for liquid skimmed milk destined for use in animal feed was abolished following a cost-benefit analysis, which is something that attracted a great deal of criticism."
"This was a necessary measure though, because the vehemence of the Court of Auditor' s criticism on this point meant that steps had to be taken."
"On the subject of butterfat - there is also an issue here arising from the overproduction that occurs in this sector - I can confirm that the fact that payment of aid is concentrated on only a few Member States is to be reviewed at the forthcoming assessment of the milk sector."
"This concentration is not unusual but we will take up your comments on this again nonetheless."
"The Court of Auditor' s observations with regard to shortcomings in the exercise of control are currently being given consideration under the clearance of accounts procedure."
"The Court of Auditors assessed the reform measures introduced in 1992 in the third Special Report on the effects on the cereals sector."
"The Commission used these measures as the basis for its own assessment."
"In the motion for a resolution, Parliament, and yourself, Mr McCartin, call for direct payments to be differentiated, in a bid to redress the currently uneven distribution of incomes between prosperous and less prosperous regions, but also between large and small farms."
"This would be possible subject to certain constraints, although not all Member States would accept it, and there is room for improvement here too."
"You also address the important issue of cofinancing of direct aid in the report."
"We know what became of this matter in Agenda 2000."
"However, the Commission feels that this is another topic that must be brought up for discussion again in the course of the midterm review."
"Very briefly on the subject of swine fever: the Commission is of the same mind as those who feel that after the last epidemic, there is an urgent need to revise the relevant legal provisions."
"It has therefore submitted proposals accordingly, and, has also restructured the Commission' s veterinary service as a result."
"The Commission would agree with you, Mr McCartin, that pig producers should carry a greater share of the financial burden of measures to combat animal diseases."
"In this connection, the Commission will carry out an investigation into risk management instruments in agriculture, the findings of which will be available in the next few months, and they are bound to be the subject of intense discussion in this House thereafter."
"I will now turn to your report Mr Staes, for which the Commission is in your debt."
"In the period from 1996 to 1998, which is the period the Court of Auditor' s Special Report relates to, the Commission - and you acknowledged this - operated under extremely difficult political conditions on the ground."
"You mention the extraordinary circumstances, particularly with regard to the financing of the open broadcasting network."
"Firstly, it was necessary for equipment of a very high quality to be made available for this network, and secondly, it was important to ensure that the transmission of information was of a very high quality too, with a view to preparing for the 1996 elections, and allowing for independent reporting."
"However, the Commission is forced to concede that, in many areas, there was much cause for criticism and so it has taken the appropriate steps."
"I will go on to discuss the relationship between the EU as donor, and the Office of High Representative and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as recipients of the financial aid. This relationship is indeed complex."
"The Commission has been reprimanded for quite a few administrative shortcomings, when the fault actually lies with the international organisations."
"It is not a case of denying responsibility."
"It just goes to show that there are even difficulties on the cooperation front sometimes, which are partly structural in nature."
"The Court of Auditors is now proposing, as it did back in its 1999 Annual Report, that international organisations should not be granted project financing but should be allowed budgetary grants instead."
"But how is the Commission supposed to support international organisations with an exclusively political mandate when these organisations find it difficult to properly implement the administrative and financial standards of Community aid programmes?"
"Further talks and regulations are called for here."
"On the subject of the repatriation of refugees and the construction of housing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which also features in the report: the Commission was able, with the aid of projects financed by the PHARE and OBNOVA programmes, to achieve similar successes where rehousing is concerned to those of other donors."
"A criticism was raised in the 1999 Annual Report to the effect that there were shortcomings with regard to the repatriation of refugees, but this situation has now improved."
"I would also remind you once again that the Commission has learnt from all the errors committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina when it came to granting EU aid, and has taken the necessary steps, and it has also placed the administration of EU aid, for example in Kosovo, on an entirely different footing."
"Turning now to the comprehensive report by Mr Dell'Alba, which concerns the principle of additionality as applied to the Structural Funds, industrial areas, youth employment initiatives, the International Fund for Ireland and the PEACE programme."
"Here, too, I must confine myself to a few remarks."
"The structural funds regulation of June 1999 now includes new provisions regarding the principle of the additionality of measures, which will hopefully help to ensure that, in future, there will be no more cause for the kind of criticism raised by the Court of Auditors about the previous support period, and the criteria will be clearer."
"I have this to say about the Court of Auditor' s report on industrial areas: one of the key aspects of the 1999 reform of the structural funds has been the strengthening of the monitoring and assessment instruments, which will enable us to establish more effectively where the money goes to."
"The regulations now provide for a clearer distribution of responsibility between the Commission and the Member States."
"Finally, permit me just to say a few words about the report on the PEACE programme."
"Parliament has expressed its profound concern at the often slow-moving materialisation of the PEACE programme in Northern Ireland and has called for a transparent budget."
"The furtherance of the consolidation of the peace process in Northern Ireland and the support, particularly of the cross-border cooperation afforded by local initiatives, which Mr Hume made reference to once again, was not just an innovative goal, but was also the right programme to my way of thinking, and I am delighted to be able, once again, to acknowledge the fact that it has Parliament' s support."
"This programme too was launched under very difficult conditions initially."
"As the Court of Auditors report shows, it was still able, in the end, to play a part in supporting the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland."
"I believe that was the object of the exercise and to that extent, I am delighted that it could be judged a success at the end of the day."
"Management of European Monetary Institute and European Central Bank (1998)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0395/2000) by Mr Heaton-Harris, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the report of the Court of Auditors on the operational efficiency of the management of the European Monetary Institute and the European Central Bank for the financial year 1998 together with the replies of the European Central Bank [C5-0319/2000 - 2000/2163(COS)]."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to acknowledge the work that the Court of Auditors did in producing the report that my report is based on which contained lots of detailed work."
"I would also like to thank the services of our committee which helped me a very great deal and indeed the ECB itself which kindly entertained me in Frankfurt for a day and told me where my report was going wrong."
"There is a tiny bit of history behind this report."
"On 31 May 1998 the European Monetary Institute changed to the European Central Bank."
"The president was still the same person and 402 of the 407 staff that were working in the EMI changed also to the ECB."
"The ECB took on all the assets and liabilities of the EMI."
"The Court of Auditors' report identified a number of problem areas which I will come to shortly."
"The European Central Bank replied to the report, but its replies were certainly short, I would say 'terse' , and the Court of Auditors found them quite inadequate since they did not give any indications of actions that the ECB intended to take to remedy the shortcomings exposed by the Court of Auditors' report."
"There were two main areas where the Court of Auditors identified problems."
"There are equally two areas in which Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Budgetary Control, took a great interest."
"The Committee was obviously interested in the Bank's relationship with OLAF, and this is summarised in my report's Conclusion 4 which, if will allow me, I will read."
"This states: ""Welcomes the public commitment of the European Central Bank, in its annual report for 1999, to establish a cooperative relationship with the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF but regrets clear incompatibility between the public commitment assumed by the ECB in its 1999 annual report to establish close cooperation with OLAF and the decision by the ECB itself to prevent OLAF from carrying over internal investigations, pending the ruling by the European Court of Justice."""
"That is a court case that is ongoing."
"The other part that the Committee was very interested in was the contradictory procedure."
"It took ages in this particular case, and when I asked both institutions why, they both said that they had replied in the time that they were given and quite within the guidelines."
"So, I can only blame the postal services of Frankfurt and Luxembourg, and I guess they need greater liberalisation."
"However, I am sure these problems will not occur in future."
"The main areas specified as problems in the Court of Auditors' report concerned the ECB's project management and monitoring."
"The Court of Auditors' report noted a lack of any commitments accounting system which had caused great concern; that it was difficult to track project development simply and coherently; and that the ECB had engaged a company of consultants to run some foreign currency reserve subledger projects in July 1998, but by the end of the year the ECB had still not designated a full-time manager for this project, although that was essential for the monitoring of the consultants' work."
"It also pointed to a number of IT problems."
"The other point was extraordinary bonuses."
"I still find it extraordinary that the Bank whose primary objective is price stability saw its way to paying some staff the equivalent of a 38% bonus."
"The excuse is that they had worked a lot in the past - worked a lot of overtime - put a lot of work in - and that some of these staff were being paid only 9% over a period of years and this was almost like catch-up pay."
"But that is just shoddy management and really should not occur in a Bank like this."
"As to my tactics, I was not really sure what I should do."
"As someone who is not a great fan of the European single currency and certainly not his country's entry into it, I had a dilemma with this report."
"Whilst I would like to demand that the ECB take note of what the Court of Auditors has said, I could have used this report to attack the ECB and got great headlines for myself back home, but that was not the role of the rapporteur."
"So I went to the ECB and asked for a meeting."
"They kindly took me to Frankfurt, and I was told that they had changed their bonus policy, that they had understood the problems in project management, and so my report is, if not actually nice, then enhanced by this meeting with the ECB."
"At my meeting with the ECB, I was told that it had solved its problems especially relating to the bonus and this would not happen again and it would send a letter to the Committee detailing its current bonus policy."
"As it transpires, this letter has never turned up, and that is a great shame because the European Central Bank should not really fear criticism from this institution."
"We are simply doing our job."
"When problems occur, and they always will, it should not be the job of the ECB to paper over the cracks and pull down the shutters."
"It should deal with the problems and tell the EU and its public how it has dealt with them and not have a panic attack over how it communicates these things."
"As my speech has suggested, the report could easily have been a lot stronger, and the ECB has got off fairly lightly this year."
"If similar or more problems occur next year, they might find such a report a bit tougher, unless they choose to actually open up, have a dialogue with our Committee, become more transparent and talk to all of us in this Parliament."
"Mr President, the Court of Auditors' report on the ECB relates, of course, to the period of transition from the EMI to today' s ECB, a fact which characterises the report itself."
"A number of the problems pointed out in the report are specifically concerned with the transition."
"Some of the criticism is levelled at project follow-ups focused more upon how much money had been spent than upon how much had actually been achieved."
"However, the main criticism from both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control concerns the extra bonus which the Bank' s employees received over and above their normal bonus and which substantially exceeded both the maximum levels set and the budgeted costs."
"The methods for deciding about this additional cost were also criticised."
"The ECB has commented on the criticism and stated, among other things, that it has improved its procedures and taken the criticism of its project management on board."
"The ECB also acknowledges that there has been a lack of clarity surrounding this extra bonus."
"We are also pleased that the ECB now recognises that OLAF must be able to carry out internal audits. However, it is a great pity about the delay involved."
"I am responsible for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' opinion on this matter, and our conclusions are simple and succinct."
"First of all: even though this was a difficult transitionary period, there is a great deal of substance in the Court of Auditors' remarks on, for example, project management, and these must be taken account of in future."
"Secondly: the type of bonus system discussed is quite usual in the banking world, but the levels of bonus allocated in this case and the way in which the system was dealt with genuinely merits criticism."
"What is most worrying and a matter of serious concern is the fact that, in the Swedish and other media, the Bank' s public relations manager dismisses both the Court of Auditors' and the European Parliament' s criticism which, he maintains, is not taken seriously in the banking world."
"If the Bank, which is already criticised for lack of transparency, does not take the criticism seriously, it is in danger of losing public confidence."
"My committee does not, however, believe that the criticism is so serious in nature that it needs to affect confidence in the ECB or cause the institution' s effectiveness to be questioned."
"On the contrary, the Bank deserves substantial credit for the well-managed transition from EMI to ECB."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my point is that the European Central Bank is going through a rough patch, what with mounting criticism, the fall in the euro against the dollar, the lack of confidence in the guidelines being issued and the unnecessary sniping against the Bank, which is a luxury neither the European Bank nor the European system can afford."
"It is not enough for Caesar's wife to be respectable, she must also appear to be respectable."
"I see the European Central Bank as Caesar's wife and she is respectable, but she must make more of an effort to show the outside world that she is respectable."
"Today, if the truth be told, quite a few of our partners are not overly keen on the euro."
"We must try not to give others an excuse to join their ranks; we must create the potential for the euro to win more supporters who will then accede to the euro zone."
"I would also point out, as regards the famous bonus which has caused such a stir, that if there is justification for paying every employee at the European Central Bank an annual bonus of 9% of their salary, then 38% over a period of 54 months comes out at 8.5% per annum."
"So I fail to see what there is to criticise about something which is within the bounds of both what is acceptable and what has been planned."
"Presumably the figures have been misinterpreted."
"However, I would point out that, whatever is done must be done in the best, most transparent, most efficient manner and with the maximum possible credibility vis-√†-vis the outside world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we approved the report tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Heaton-Harris, in committee, and we will support it in this House, for it avoids both exaggeration and undue reserve in its comments on the issues raised by the report of the Court of Auditors on the management of the EMI and the ECB."
"The three points raised by Mr Heaton-Harris are the insufficient monitoring of projects, the granting of an extraordinary bonus to ECB employees and the refusal to be subject to OLAF investigations."
"I would not imagine that it occurred to any of us that the euro would weaken or that such a thing would be engineered."
"That is not the point. The point, in our opinion, is that the greater our recognition of the authority of the monetary bodies in question - and I endorse this recognition, although I also take note of the clear need for political administration of the economy at European level as well - the greater the need to require them to provide clear evidence of efficiency, wage moderation and transparency."
"There is an old saying, applied to people whose actions do not match their words, which goes like this: ""Do what I say, not what I do""."
"Those whose role and prestige makes them a point of reference for such a huge public and for all the institutions - such as the European Central Bank, which has our confidence - cannot permit themselves even a minor imperfection, and still less can they say, ""Do what I say, not what I do"" while advocating price stability, management efficiency and the greatest possible rectitude and transparency."
"It is precisely because of the major, valuable role of these institutions - and I wish to stress this by way of conclusion - and because the issues condemned can be resolved that we are confident that the recommendations of the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament will be given practical effect."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 12 noon."
"Financial assistance to SMEs (1999)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0335/2000) by Mr Bushill-Matthews, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Growth and Employment Initiative - Measures on financial assistance for innovative and job creating Small- and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) - As at 31 December 1999 [COM(2000) 266 - C5-0507/2000 - 2000/2245(COS)]."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by just reminding the House of a few statistics."
"There are at least 16 million businesses within the EU, 99.9% of them are micro to medium-sized."
"There are 100 million people working in the EU in the private sector and, of these, 32 million people work in micro-businesses, which is businesses of less than 10 people; 33 million people work in small to medium enterprises, with less than 249 people."
"So a total of 65 million workers in the EU are in the small and medium sector, which shows that it is very important for us to be discussing the growth of such a sector."
"In particular, it is absolutely right that this specific initiative - growth and employment - should be discussed within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, although it is clearly also of interest to other committees."
"This particular report is concerned with funding programmes, which was an important initiative from this Parliament a few years ago."
"But it is worth saying straight away, as confirmed at the Lisbon Summit, that the issue of the development of SMEs is not just a matter of funding."
"It is also very important that all of us secure the right climate for enterprise, with less red tape and less bureaucracy, to encourage SMEs and risk-takers to actually consider taking out risk capital in the first place."
"1999 was the first full year of this particular set of initiatives and, therefore, as a start-up phase it should have been relatively straightforward to report upon this without being too controversial."
"However, there are some controversial elements in the report, essentially because of the Commission timetable in issuing its report."
"I have annexed the detailed timetable to the report."
"It shows that whereas the initial draft proposal from the Commission came out in November/December 1999, it literally took a full five months before the report came before Parliament."
"Then there was a further delay within Parliament, because we are not perfect in that respect either."
"It took over a month to allocate it to a rapporteur and then, because of the summer recess, it was not possible to programme the internal debate and discussion until October and November."
"Despite this long delay, there was further incompetence, dare I say, within the Secretariat because the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy under Mrs Flesch as the rapporteur had produced some very useful amendments to the report which only came to the Committee on Employment after we had voted on the report."
"So that again was not exactly impressive."
"I have agreed with Mrs Flesch that amendments from the committee today have my full support to go through unchallenged, as there are a number of useful contributions there."
"I should add that I asked the Commission back in August about a particular comment in the report, which stated that in August there would be some feedback from SMEs about their response to the project."
"However, the Commission did not reply."
"I asked again in October where this information was and it finally replied: ""What information are you waiting for?"
"We do not understand!"""
"It was literally only yesterday that I received an e-mail from the Commission stating that there was such information but it had been sent to the Committee on Budgets rather than to our committee - again, not too impressive."
"Yesterday, I spoke in the debate on the Doorn report on SLIM concerning bureaucracy."
"I should like to reinforce those comments now, because the fact that this report had to go through so many different Directorates before it emerged - including legal, budgets, financial control, general secretariat, regional, innovation, employment and social affairs, research, internal market and competition - is not an impressive way of dealing with an important subject."
"I speak not only on behalf of this report but also, I am sure, of other reports that need to go through the same system."
"This is just too much micromanagement."
"There are too many managers involved and, as a result, the project ends up not being fully managed."
"Finally, I have made a few comments about the European Investment Bank taking a controlling interest in the EIF."
"This may be absolutely right given its expertise, but we want to ensure that these particular projects are given the priority they deserve."
"I am not particularly confident but we shall watch to see how that goes."
"I have also called for a full audit, not because of any doubt about the financial probity, but just as a basic management control system."
"In conclusion, may I say that the Commission has apparently already written the draft report for the year 2000."
"I should like to ask that we see it now so that we can make a positive contribution now in good time, rather than repeat the timing of the current report."
"Here we are in January 2001 debating and voting on a report that was issued back in 1999."
"It is already history."
"On such an important subject we want to deal with the present, thereby being better able to shape the future."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur and to emphasise that there is basically no difference in the attitudes of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"We therefore endorse the rapporteur' s conclusions, particularly his comments on delays, which should be avoided in future."
"The Committee on Industry perhaps emphasised to a greater extent the importance of SMEs for employment, the need to facilitate access to risk capital, the need to simplify bureaucratic and administrative procedures and regarding improving the coordination between the various Commission programmes of interest to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We therefore tabled a number of amendments and, as the rapporteur has just explained, due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances, the rapporteur did not receive the amendments in time."
"I should like to thank him, nonetheless, for having tried to accept Amendments Nos 1 to 8, which constitute the bulk of the Committee on Industry' s amendments, which complement the rapporteur' s report."
"Mr President, the Nice Summit was characterised by weak decisions."
"However, it will not impede progress towards an ever stronger European Union."
"When national measures have no effect, that is when Europe comes into play."
"We are experiencing this with BSE."
"Suddenly, all sides are calling for effective cross-border consumer protection and robust action where wrongly labelled products are concerned."
"We are also experiencing this with the fight against unemployment."
"The SMEs feel the effectiveness of union-wide initiatives for growth and employment, which are designed to underpin the measures introduced by the Member States."
"One of the first things to come out of this programme is that EUR 450 million is to be made available for growth-orientated SMEs."
"On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to congratulate Philip Bushill-Matthews on his report, which bears witness to his exceptionally detailed knowledge."
"We concur with his criticism of the Commission for providing too little information too late."
"Just how are we supposed to oversee matters properly, or even submit solid programme proposals under such enormous pressure of time?"
"We need clarification on which of the three facilities - start-up capital, guarantees, or joint ventures - have achieved the best results, in which States and which sectors companies were set up, whether the small enterprises had access to foreign capital too, or whether statements originating from SME circles are correct, according to which, more than 50 000 new jobs were created simply by means of interest subsidies to the value of EUR 100 million, which age groups are especially required, and to what extent women were involved."
"In talking to SMEs in my constituency, I constantly met with complaints that the funds are virtually only ever granted to enterprises in state-of-the-art technology."
"Other innovative enterprises, from the craft industry for example, ought to qualify, too, to my mind."
"We must also take greater account of the sustainability of services."
"Mr President, let us seize on the initiative emanating from Mr Bushill-Matthews' excellent report."
"The more detailed the information, the sooner confidence in EU initiatives will grow."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I very much support this report and in particular the initiatives behind the ETF Start-up Facility and the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Guarantee Facility."
"I am sure there is a shared opinion across this House of how important small businesses are."
"In my own country, the United Kingdom, the small business population has actually increased in size by one half since 1980 and there is now one small business for every 13 adults in the population."
"Small businesses are important not just for jobs but also for trade in this European Union."
"I recall talking with the counsellor in the British Embassy dealing with Belgium and the Benelux countries and exports into those countries, who told me that the vast majority, over 90% of the enquiries which he deals with, are not from large companies seeking to export but from small businesses."
"So that is very relevant to us in this House too."
"It is relevant because of the Lisbon process."
"We welcomed the conclusions from the Lisbon Summit last year: the move towards flexibility, the move towards entrepreneurship, towards innovation that were reflected there."
"These facilities should be seen very much as being at the heart of trying to achieve those economic goals."
"I would also like to change past practice by congratulating Mr Bushill-Matthews."
"I have sat in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with him for the last year or so and I have heard him make the same speech time after time about de-regulation and too much bureaucracy at European level."
"He has actually come up with something constructive here, so well done Mr Bushill-Matthews."
"Nice to see that you can do some work, or at least others can do it on your behalf."
"I particularly congratulate you on your conclusions regarding the need for more transparency and speed - absolute support for that - and on the importance of the high technology sectors - yes, but not just those."
"Also, I am very surprised to see you putting emphasis on the need to increase female participation in small businesses."
"Congratulations to you for supporting that."
"I would have liked to see more on the social economy."
"Our cooperative businesses should be seen fair and square as part of the small business sector."
"They are particularly important in terms of job creation amongst disadvantaged groups in the labour market."
"They are particularly important in terms of socially useful employment and it is an omission that they are missing from the report."
"They should not be treated differently; they should be given extra help."
"Perhaps the Commission could comment on that at the close of the debate."
"I would also like to particularly support Amendment No 3 from the Socialist Group."
"We will be supporting all of the amendments to the effect that bank guarantees behind venture capital are still far too strict, far too conservative and actually prevent entrepreneurs from creating jobs in the UK and in other European countries."
"Let me conclude by saying that yesterday the UK Government published Think small first, a document about ensuring that every department of government thinks about small businesses, not just about the availability of finance that we are discussing in this debate but about the overall macroeconomic framework and the sorts of advice and skills that they need to support them and become prosperous."
"We in this European Union should follow that lead and ensure that every Directorate-General, every service of the European Union puts small businesses first."
"Mr President, I want first of all to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his report."
"He has produced a good piece of work in spite of difficult conditions, and we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party very much agree with his conclusions, as well as with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"There are, of course, many different ways to create full employment, but this cannot be achieved without economic progress and a high degree of competitiveness."
"This was also, of course, the conclusion reached by the Lisbon Summit last year which specifically emphasised growth and development as the means to higher employment in the EU."
"Moreover, every politician has a soft spot for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"At any rate, that is true whenever we raise our glasses in praise of their importance to economic development and employment."
"When it comes to everyday practice, however, the reality is all too often different."
"Far too many obstacles are placed in the way in the form of bureaucratic rules which deter many people from setting up in business."
"There are not enough incentives to take risks, and this generally impedes development and dynamism."
"We cannot, of course, get away from the fact that, in general, there is less willingness to take risks in the EU than in the United States, something which is reflected in less dynamic new business development."
"I therefore also think it is important to ensure that these programmes which, through the European Investment Bank, provide small and medium-sized enterprises with new financing opportunities operate as efficiently as possible in the eyes of the enterprises concerned."
"The programmes must be made more widely known and linked to other programmes, and it must of course be ensured that the payments are not dragged out, indeed that the programmes operate with a minimum of bureaucracy."
"Mr Bushill-Matthews' s excellent report and the amendments tabled by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy contain criticism of experience to date."
"That criticism should be taken on board so that our friendly feelings for small and medium-sized enterprises do not only find expression in fine celebratory speeches, but also in practice."
"We must also ensure that the programmes are effective overall, and I am therefore particularly pleased about Mr Bushill-Matthews' s request that the Commission follow up the programmes and examine their effect on employment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quite amazing what excellent reports are produced, although the Commission basis is completely inadequate."
"The rapporteur puts forward the proposal that enterprises that have not taken up support programmes should be interviewed."
"I consulted numerous colleagues on this, in my capacity as owner of a medium-sized enterprise."
"The almost unanimous verdict was as follows: when it comes to the European Investment Fund, and especially the various components of the Amsterdam Special Action Programme (ASAP) on SMEs and job creation, we small enterprises lose track of things because there is a plethora of individual sub-programmes, responsibility for which is in all kinds of different hands, I might add."
"For example, there is the normal SME guarantee facility, the growth and employment initiative, the growth and environmental initiative, the EIF technology facility ETF, the ETF start-up-programme, new sub-programmes for innovation attached to EIF-ETF since Lisbon, e-Europe, e-Learning etc."
"How are these distinguished from one another and where must I, as entrepreneur, submit the applications for my project ideas?"
"Parliament has the same problem from the opposite perspective, if it wants to assess how the ASAP is developing overall, because the reports from the EIB and EIF do not contain a coherent account."
"Sometimes there is talk, in general terms, of the full range of SME support, and sometimes the individual components of the ASAP are cited in different contexts."
"There are also a few things wrong with the organisation of the ASAP on the policy side."
"The growth and environmental initiative has not received any more funds."
"What is more, it strives for a completely antiquated after-care style of environmental protection."
"The remaining areas, i.e. growth and employment, ETF, etc. have received continuous boosts, I grant you, but they concentrate on a few high-tech sectors alone, predominantly innovation, communications and genetic engineering."
"In many cases, these SMEs are not dealt with directly; instead the application procedure is handled by middlemen, usually traditional risk capital and investment funds, which receive the credits and guarantees from the EIB, and which the SMEs have to go to with any complaints."
"That being the case, in fact nobody but the EIB knows which SMEs are receiving support for precisely which projects, and how many jobs are being created in the process."
"That is why hitherto, when assessing the effect these programmes have on employment, rather than providing concrete figures, the EIB has performed a simple macroeconomic model estimate."
"More detailed information will be available on the outcome of the whole exercise in 5 to 10 years' time."
"Rumour has it that essentially, the ASAP serves to strengthen the European risk capital market for information and communication, genetic engineering and starting up new businesses, and that the job creation aspect is not actually examined in greater detail or assessed."
"The EIB homepage showing the list of funds to which the EIB has given credits and guarantees, fuels this notion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those subjects on which we cannot and, in fact, do not have any doubts or hesitations as to our political approach."
"First of all, programmes aimed at promoting employment and growth are still vitally important, despite some positive signs in recent years."
"Secondly, the strategic importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this area is quite clear and crucial, as was stated in the definition of the initiative for greater employment, which was strengthened recently by the guidelines laid down at the Lisbon Summit."
"I too, like the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, wish to highlight the Lisbon Summit conclusion that calls for a climate encouraging the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, and in particular a regulatory framework which is conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship."
"Thirdly, we are all fully aware of the particularly tough challenges as well as the new opportunities that economic globalisation presents for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Fourthly, it is crucial for the European Union and the Member States to overcome the relative gap that exists in many areas between the EU and the United States."
"If we are to fulfil our responsibilities in this area, we must have good information in good time. This has, until now, not been the case."
"I agree with the rapporteur' s criticisms and I also call for the draft 2000 report to be submitted to us in time, by March of this year, otherwise the harsh criticism that we have refrained from making this year will have to be made with even greater severity next year."
"In its reporting procedures, the Commission must acknowledge the priority and the importance that we attach to these areas and ensure that these are reflected in the quality of its analysis tools."
"In conclusion, I think that we must improve our commitment: I agree with the rapporteur when he advocates that our interest in high technology and knowledge-based industries must not mean that we forget the more traditionally structured businesses involved in tourism, trade, crafts and in services in general."
"We must consider the amendments, since we need to demonstrate a greater ability to harness venture capital. The amendments also, in my opinion, complement the report well."
"Mr President, Europe normally finds it hard to assess the impact of government policy."
"That is not the case in this report."
"I therefore find the assessment presented here of the effects of the programme on actual job creation particularly interesting."
"Furthermore, since the agreement of the Council for Employment and Social Policy on 20 December 2000 regarding the creation of articles of association for the European company, the legal and administrative prospects for SMEs are looking up."
"This is essential, since SMEs form 99.8% of all firms and employ 66% of the European workforce."
"Yet the concept of an SME continues to apply to a catch-all category embracing a wide range of company structures and situations."
"The great majority of them are firms employing at most 10 employees."
"It is to be regretted that their special characteristics have not been recognised and that they do not benefit from special measures."
"Unlike the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which mentions it in its opinion, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs does not mention any such recognition."
"Similarly, the aid programme should not be reserved for the large SMEs using or producing leading edge technology."
"The traditional sector should also be able to benefit in full."
"I am thinking in particular of the craft sector, which provides employment, know-how and innovation."
"From this point of view, I support the programme of start-up facilities for smallSMEs."
"On the other hand, I am more sceptical of the idea of urging Member States to amend their tax laws."
"There are plans to create a single European structure for risk capital investment funds operating in parallel with national structures."
"This is liable to make administrative procedures more complicated for the small SMEs who do not necessarily have the resources to deal with them."
"Mr President, I am happy to be speaking on this major document tabled by Mr Bushill-Matthews, whom I have the honour to call my friend. I am glad to see that this report, which is so important for the development of small and medium-sized businesses in Europe, has been so well written, and I hope that Mr Bushill-Matthews will continue to be a beacon of light for all those drawing up European Union legislative measures on small and medium-sized businesses."
"He is certainly one of the greatest authorities on the matter, which became extremely important after the fall of communism."
"As we are all aware, communism and the countries of the Eastern Bloc stifled free initiative. There were no small entrepreneurs in communist states."
"We have now proved the superiority of the economic system of free initiative."
"I therefore urge Mr Bushill-Matthews to remember in future - and Commissioner Schreyer to bear in mind both now and in future - that, in addition to the major initiatives proposed in this report, it would be appropriate to call strongly upon the Member States to exempt small businesses which are just starting off from taxes for at least the first five years of activity."
"Whoever undertakes a free initiative creates at least one job - his own - and often employs family members and other people as well."
"I am sure that this proposal will be music to Mr Bushill-Matthews' ears, for he is well-known for being opposed to taxation, and I therefore hope that both he and Commissioner Schreyer will accept it."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bushill-Matthews on this major report."
"I also have to say that I am extremely grateful to him for having accepted the amendments I proposed which supplement the main part of the report on certain points and certain basic issues."
"In my opinion, it is extremely important to be focusing on the development of small and medium-sized businesses and what that involves, in order to offset the unemployment in large businesses, apart from anything else."
"Europe must, therefore, make it a priority to support businesses, create a favourable climate for their establishment and development, encourage research and, above all, encourage the leading sectors."
"It is also of primary importance that the European Parliament succeeds in monitoring both the projects and the results made possible by European funding."
"This would appear to be of extreme importance, together with the fact that small and medium-sized businesses in the small craft, trade and tourism sectors - as I pointed out - and other services will also benefit."
"We must take on board the fact that the era when people stayed in the same job all their lives has passed, that we must change our perception of employment and that the sector of small and medium-sized industry and craft trades will provide increasingly realistic job opportunities for our young people and for the future European citizens."
"It is vital for Europe to focus on these factors and we must continue to have confidence in this approach."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Bushill-Matthews, for the great expertise he has demonstrated in drafting this report."
"Although SMEs now employ two-thirds of the workforce in the whole of the European Union, there is still employment potential in the SME sector."
"Support and venture capital while a company is being set up are enormously important for the creation of jobs, as, according to certain studies, SMEs use as much as 80% to 90% of venture capital market resources in taking on staff."
"We must give SMEs that have potential for growth our strongest support, irrespective of what sector they operate in."
"More attention must also be paid to making it easier for companies to globalise, so that SMEs may take full advantage of the benefits brought by the internal market."
"Also great in this regard are the expectations connected with harmonising systems of guarantees and legislative reform regarding mortgages, which we are expecting in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur that the Commission should, in future, provide information more promptly on how this important initiative is progressing."
"In future, the Commission' s reports should contain feedback on the users of the fund so that defects in the system can be speedily rectified."
"Finally, I would like to focus attention on those legal provisions which aim to make it easier for bankrupt companies to begin trading again."
"Although these companies have proved to be a risk once, that does not mean that the same thing will happen in the future."
"Bankrupt companies should rather be viewed as a resource for Europe, which we should not fail to exploit."
"I would also like to stress how important small businesses are for competitiveness with regard to Europe' s big companies."
"Small companies often work as subcontractors for our European mammoth organisations, and, as a result, the position of small businesses is more important than ever for competitiveness throughout Europe."
"Mr President, I am delighted that this report has been put before the House."
"Especially with my being an entrepreneur, I would like to congratulate the Commission on having brought out, to excellent effect, what is lacking in Europe."
"What it boils down to is that there is not enough start-up capital available for people who want to set up in business, and so numerous young entrepreneurs have to give up again prematurely."
"Exports constitute a risk of course, and so it is particularly important for joint ventures to receive financial support in the early stages, more than at any other time."
"The guarantee system serves to ensure that not everyone who is willing to become an entrepreneur automatically jeopardises his livelihood in the process and faces the risk of financial ruin, at the very least, for the rest of his life."
"When we consider that approximately EUR 7 billion is available in risk capital in Europe, whilst in America the figure stands at EUR 12 billion, then we ought to give thought to how we can make good the difference."
"What steps can we take, particularly as regards agriculture?"
"The very word BSE ought to inspire us to reflect on what kind of young enterprises we could establish in order better to guarantee food safety, carry out blood tests, develop treatments and so on. Urgent action is called for here."
"I would also like to stress that it is important for young entrepreneurs to be given a commitment they can rely on as speedily as possible."
"Deadlines should be set by which a decision must be given in the form of a clear 'yes' or 'no' , so as to avoid any unnecessary risk."
"It is also important to apply the directive on tackling default in payment, so that people actually get their hands on the money within a set period of time."
"There is still too much hesitancy on this score for my liking."
"The Commission should submit proposals on project management, develop best practice methods, introduce benchmarks, on the basis of which it will be possible to examine how much time elapses between the first application and the successful creation of jobs. It also needs to monitor payment flows, and finally, promote the entire strategy in the public arena."
"When it comes to PR, one idea would be to have a 'young entrepreneur of the year' prize, awarded to the entrepreneur who has created the most jobs in absolute terms and in percentage figures."
"This would demonstrate at European level, and correspondingly in the Member States, that we are going the right way about this."
"Mr President, as I am here instead of my colleague Pedro Solbes Mira, I will give his speech in English, also in honour of the rapporteur."
"This report concerns the first annual report on the Growth and Employment Initiative."
"This initiative aims to provide financial assistance for innovative and job-creating small and medium-sized enterprises as a step towards the development of a business climate conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship."
"It is also in line with the Lisbon European Council conclusions of March 2000 where the objectives of strengthening employment, economic reform and social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy were set as a new strategic goal for the Union."
"I would like to address the main points raised by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs' report prepared by Mr Bushill-Matthews."
"Firstly, the report notes that the Commission reporting process is too lengthy, causing delays in the receipt of the report by Parliament."
"At the same time, Parliament's report states that there is a lack of information particularly concerning feedback information from small and medium-sized enterprises, beneficiaries of the Growth and Employment Initiative."
"In my view, these two matters are inter-linked and are a result of the way the financial instruments that form part of the Growth and Employment Initiative are constructed."
"These are designed so as to commit budgetary resources to financial institutions such as venture capital funds, national guarantee schemes and commercial banks which would act as intermediaries for final SME beneficiaries."
"In this respect, the information regarding commitment and draw-downs made to financial institutions in a given year is available during the first quarter of the following year."
"On the other hand, feedback information from small and medium-sized enterprises concerning a given year is only available for all the instruments in the last quarter of the following year."
"This implies that an annual report drawn up by the end of April will include year-end statistics for the previous year at the financial intermediary level and at the SME level, detailed statistics for the preceding year."
"These time-scales indicate why last year's annual report referring to 1999, which was the first full year of the programme, could not include detailed information at SME level."
"This leads us to the following point: streamlining the initiative is an objective shared by both Parliament and the Commission."
"However, a re-shaping of the financial instruments of the initiative cannot be done annually."
"First of all, market players could be confused and find it difficult to appreciate the reasons for these changes."
"Furthermore, a detailed evaluation of these instruments based on a bottom-up approach is needed."
"Regarding the JEFV programme which has had the weakest take-up out of the three financial instruments of the Growth and Employment Initiative, the multi-annual programme for enterprises foresees a simplification of the scheme to enable SMEs' requests for financial contributions to be dealt with more quickly by the financial intermediaries and the Commission services."
"The possibility of adopting the eligibility criteria will also be examined in order to respond more effectively to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Concerning the reform of the European Investment Fund, the report is incorrect in stating that the Commission can no longer use the EIF directly as a tool for financing SMEs."
"As before, current and the future Community schemes entrusted to the European Investment Fund will be managed separately from its own resources under the principle set and controlled by the Commission services."
"Finally, the report questions the tax structure of venture capital funds and calls on the Commission to encourage each Member State to adopt laws permitting tax-transparent funds to be created in their country and to recognise transparent funds established in a similar way in other Member States."
"This matter, which is of great interest to the Commission, has recently been dealt with in the Commission communication on the risk capital action plan which was finalised in October 2000."
"To quote from the report ""the tax structure might hinder cross-border investment by creating specific tax obstacles or even discriminating against foreign investors."
"A comprehensive response to such barriers might be achieved most effectively through coordinated action on EU level."
"In any event, Member States have to make sure that tax treaties and all other tax law instruments prevent double-taxation of dividends in cross-border investment'."
"To conclude, now that the restructuring of the European Investment Fund is complete, the Commission services and the EIF are working together to progressively implement the ECOFIN and Industry Council's decisions, in particular with the multi-annual programme for enterprise."
"To be realistic, Parliament should not expect any substantial result before 2003 or 2004, although preliminary indications in particular from guarantee schemes might be available earlier."
"Let me add as the Budget Commissioner, that the Commission has welcomed Parliament's decision for the 2001 budget to increase amounts for loans and grants available to SMEs."
"This was an important signal to the small and medium-sized enterprises and an important step to achieve the aims of Lisbon to create a knowledge-based modern economy in the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 12 noon."
"Frontier workers"
"The next item is the report (A5-0338/2000) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the situation of frontier workers [2000/2010(INI)]."
"Mr President, it came as a surprise to me as well that this debate was being squeezed in today."
"The topic of frontier work has fascinated me for over 21 years, the length of time I have served in politics, in the Dutch Lower Chamber, but also in the European Parliament."
"It fascinates me not only because I am faced daily with problems which frontier workers experience when they live in one Member State and work in another, but also because the mechanics behind it are quite considerable, mechanics which have to be adjusted annually."
"It also fascinates me because it demonstrates that parliaments, national parliaments that is, are not getting things moving quickly enough."
"Another reason why it fascinates me is that what politicians appear unable to sort out, the European Court of Justice manages to settle, and Member States are always being lectured about putting right any existing mistakes."
"This brings me to a remark which I would like to make vis-√†-vis the European Commission."
"I have no axe to grind with the European Commission."
"It is particularly the Council, the members of the Council, who are unwilling to grant frontier work the flexibility it needs, and so we politicians, national politicians that is, leave this for the European Court of Justice to solve."
"I think this is no longer acceptable, or necessary, for that matter, and that we must make every effort, and employ all means, in order to change this situation."
"What I want in my report - and I would like to thank my fellow MEPs who have helped in the drafting, as well as predecessors who have worked on this dossier - is four things."
"First of all, I would make an urgent request to the Commission to draft a directive which provides for frontier effect reports."
"This request has been put to the European Commission and the Member States since 1990."
"Such reports would oblige Member States, when changing their legislation on social security, taxation or public health, to draft an assessment straight away in order to study the impact on frontier workers."
"Why?"
"Not because this will make amends, but because it will help us to operate in a preventative manner; and help us to prevent problems from arising."
"My second request to the Council is at long last to incorporate the amendments in Regulation 1408 without any further delays."
"I believe this dossier has been with the Council of Ministers, the Social Affairs Ministers, for two years now."
"It includes a number of improvements for frontier workers, as well as - and Mr Doorn mentioned SLIM yesterday - a whole host of provisions which make everything more simple, easy and more readable."
"The Council must do something about this;"
"Parliament has codecision rights on this dossier."
"However, the Council must decide unanimously, and I hope that something can be done there."
"Thirdly, in my opinion, the Commission should be more alert when it comes to all bilateral taxation agreements which are being concluded, in order to check whether the principles, whereby tax law should be brought into line with social security in the country of employment, are being upheld. This is to prevent problems arising and to prevent people from falling between two stools."
"As far as this is concerned, the Commission should get its act together a bit more, and check and verify the bilateral taxation agreements more, also in the preliminary phases."
"The fourth point I want to make concerns medical expenses, or the possibility of benefiting from provisions for medical care in another Member State."
"Court judgments have been passed on this."
"This is another area where politicians have let themselves down."
"There are judgments of the Court of Justice, Kohll-Decker being the most prominent, and I know a few people from my own region, which is a border region, who went to Court."
"Mr President, neither the Member States nor the Commission have ever submitted any notes to Parliament on this matter."
"That is shocking."
"We should not leave matters in the hands of the courts; we as politicians must be able to do something about this."
"I know very well that when the previous Commissioner, Mr Flynn, was in office, a note was being circulated."
"I know that the outcome of this was thought to be unpleasant."
"But it does mean that for once - and I would like to push the Commission in this respect - we had clarity and transparency."
"The position of active frontier workers, but also that of post-active frontier workers is at stake here."
"As far as Kohll-Decker is concerned, it applies to all people who live near the border."
"I would ask the MEPs to vote in favour of the report and certainly also for the amendments which I have tabled."
"The reason for this is that frontier work is no longer a problem of the old Union of the 15."
"It impacts on the day-to-day running of the market, also with regard to the candidate countries."
"I would therefore call for the broadest support possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for highlighting the situation faced by frontier workers in an own-initiative report from Parliament."
"Many and varied are the situations and problems that we continue to encounter in the European internal market, one of the key aspects of which is the freedom of movement of frontier workers."
"These are problems which cause the people to question the raison d' √™tre of the European Union."
"Being an MEP in a region bordering Luxembourg, Belgium and France I can identify with all the facets of these issues. Why is a German pensioner, who is undergoing dialysis, only permitted to have access to this for a limited period of time when holidaying in France?"
"The mother of a family in Germany is immediately entitled to child benefit for her second child, but not if her husband works in Luxembourg."
"Is it permissible for an aunt who is insured in Belgium to be cared for in a nursing home near her family in Germany?"
"Pension entitlements acquired in Italy are subject to enormous outlay before they reach the German pensioner."
"And why should an honorary mayor working in Germany suddenly have to pay tax on his whole salary, which he earns in Luxembourg, because he receives an expenses allowance?"
"Luxembourg firms are fighting against additional expenditure and additional costs, and so jobs are at risk."
"This is why people decline the office of mayor."
"The list goes on."
"Frontier workers must be flexible, so as to be able to cope with the confusion of laws on both sides of the borders."
"Those who look for a job over the border within the European internal market need legal certainty in a united Europe, particularly in the sphere of social legislation."
"We MEPs from the border regions in the European Union call upon the Commission and the Council, to provide for more cross-border social justice."
"We have achieved a great deal, but there is still much to be done."
"The report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten illustrates the legitimate demands of the people in the border regions."
"The internal market must also be completed within the labour market if we want to make Europe an integrated whole."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Ria Oomen-Ruijten for the sound cooperation we enjoyed within the framework of this report."
"I thought it was a splendid idea to dust down a number of requirements which this Parliament put forward in 1998 further to an own-initiative report and following my own report which is based on a frontier workers petition."
"It has to be said: not a great deal has happened legislatively speaking over the past three years."
"We have often said that border regions are good barometers for European integration."
"If this is the case, then I do not think integration is in terribly good shape these days, because, except for the European Court of Justice, little progress has been made."
"Moreover, I also regret the fact that the frontier effect test has not even been included in the social agenda and that the Treaty of Nice has not made any decisions with regard to Regulation 1408/71, which only complicates matters."
"Meanwhile, the world moves on, and in all manner of countries, tax reforms are under way, social security legislation is in full swing, statutory schemes are being supplemented with additional schemes, and quite a few countries, in a bid to reconcile work, family and leisure time, are coming up with all kinds of schemes for career breaks which will only apply to the country' s own citizens and unfortunately not to frontier workers."
"I am therefore in total agreement with the European Commission, which intends to institute an inquiry into the Belgian career break scheme, which - I regret to say - does not cover Dutch citizens, whilst the Dutch scheme does apply to Belgians."
"Frontier workers have an added disadvantage compared to other citizens who avail themselves of the free movement of persons principle."
"They often work in one country and live in another, and pay taxes in one country and their social contributions in another."
"To have some coherence between the tax policy and social security system in one country would already be something, but to expect this to happen between countries is nothing short of utopia. As a result, frontier workers continue to be at the receiving end of this unsatisfactory situation."
"Even the most dyed-in-the-wool European federalists among us dare not dream of a time when we could ever achieve the utopian vision of a harmonised social security system or harmonised taxation across Europe."
"We must therefore look for creative solutions."
"I would like to mention two."
"First of all, the Oomen-Ruijten report is right to breathe new life into the EP requirement on compulsory frontier effect reports on the part of the Member States in all legislative changes which pertain to social security and taxation, with compensation for frontier workers to balance out any drawbacks, a practice which, in fact, is already being implemented in some countries, albeit with some reluctance."
"Accordingly, my group has some difficulty with the fact that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten toned down the text at the time."
"We believe that the test must remain in place as a matter of urgency and that compensation must be made compulsory."
"Secondly, we must have the courage to take the conclusions reached in 1998 a little further."
"We were unable to halt the Russian roulette for frontier workers at the time."
"We must, at long last, opt for one levy principle, either in the country of residence or the country of employment."
"I think there is a whole raft of arguments in favour of the country of employment."
"I think that, accordingly, my group will be voting against the amendments tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and against those of Mr Manders who wants to eliminate this principle."
"I hope that this report will emerge from the plenary unscathed and that frontier workers can at long last make some more headway."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen for the huge amount of work she has done."
"She, herself, has also indicated that this is an important issue for which little is being done, for which politicians hardly have any consideration, and, as we can see, it is extremely difficult to lend this matter some clarity."
"Despite this, I have some observations in this respect, which is also apparent from my amendments."
"I, myself, live in a border region and every day, I see people from my area who commute to another country. Whether this is Germany or Belgium, they cross the border at any rate."
"What I have noticed is that the regulation on social security, No 1408, also applies to workers who decide to move to the country of employment and actually live there."
"I welcome clarity in this matter, and I have tabled two amendments to this effect."
"I agree with this position and I have also told Mrs Oomen."
"But I do believe that we should include a caveat so that, if it transpires that after eighteen months or two years, an assessment should be made and if, based on this assessment, it appears that frontier workers are suffering disproportionate drawbacks, a different choice can be made, and I would like to see this caveat included in the report."
"Mrs Oomen takes the country of employment as the guiding principle."
"I believe that it is not so evident that the country of employment principle always works in the interests of, and benefits, the frontier workers."
"I am of the opinion that we work to live and not the other way round."
"For that reason, I believe that all the money and certainties we obtain on the shop floor should be brought to bear in our living environment."
"That is why I am in favour of considering the possibility of using the country of residence principle."
"I have included the above in an amendment."
"I would therefore ask my fellow MEPs to vote in favour of this amendment."
"I have also tabled two amendments to Articles 6 and 7 to have these deleted, because I believe that the Commission is not competent to take measures to intervene in bilateral agreements."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work on this issue."
"I share many of her criticisms and frustrations about the scope, implementation and speed of change to Regulation 1408/71."
"As a member of the Committee on Petitions, it is clear to me that there is a considerable and growing number of residents, including third-country nationals and frontier workers, for whom the current arrangements are not working satisfactorily."
"Enlargement will make a complex system of coordination even more complex and it is not surprising that many citizens simply do not believe that the Union takes the free movement of citizens as seriously as it takes its commitment to the free movement of goods."
"We have to find a way of simplifying things for citizens themselves and for the administrators of these systems."
"It would not be surprising if we were to hear an increasing number of calls for a single European agency that would deal directly with national administrations on the citizens' behalf."
"The call for a directive concerning frontier effect reports is to be welcomed."
"At least these would be proactive and could hopefully deal with some of the problems before they arise, which would make a pleasant change."
"It is also clear that as more countries integrate their taxation and social security systems, we need to take action to tackle the resulting anomalies, which can result in double payments."
"However, the key issue is that Member States need to prove their commitment to free movement by tackling problems openly and in a spirit which favours residents of the European Union."
"The debate is suspended until 3 p.m."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"As more and more Members come into the Chamber, I would like to announce a welcome innovation."
"We have today opened a smoking zone behind the Hemicycle, a lovely sunny place with lots of good views."
"I hope that all colleagues who continue to ruin their health by smoking, will find themselves comfortably installed outside the Chamber and will stop smoking in the non-smoking zones."
"I hope everybody has heard that."
"Thank you, Mrs Banotti, for looking after the interests of non-smokers."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I welcome the fact that there is now going to be a smoking rather than a non-smoking zone."
"I hope now that all Members and all members of staff observe the no-smoking areas across the whole of the European Parliament building."
"I am still having problems being able to get into the part-session and being able to get in and out of committee meetings, both here and in Brussels."
"So I plead with everybody, now there is a smoking area, to use it and not the no-smoking areas, including the corridors and going up to the lift."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I was just wondering whether anybody is going to inform the particles of smoke where the smoking zone and the no-smoking zones are."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"VOTE"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in yesterday' s debate, the Commission explained why, and under what conditions, it can accept Parliament' s amendments."
"Having said that, the wording of some of these amendments will have to be changed because otherwise they might not correspond with the explanatory statement and the recitals."
"Slight changes in the wording are also necessary in order to ensure consistency with Article 20 of the directive."
"If the European Union were to support learning materials that had anti-Semitic content then of course this would be an absolutely terrible thing."
"But the measures in the educational sphere, which the EU is supporting in Palestine, are to do with the infrastructure or direct expenditure, for example salaries for the teachers, which means that the amendment in its present form is not actually justified and should therefore be rejected."
"However, I will of course use Mrs van der Laan' s statement as an opportunity to ask the services to examine very carefully once again whether this accusation is indeed unjustified."
"Relating to paragraph 26 van der Laan (ELDR)."
"(NL) Mr President, this is a technical amendment and it only illustrates that we had hoped to discuss this report before now. Reference is made to yesterday, but since we are adopting the report today, this is a bit illogical."
"The text should therefore read as follows:"
"""Welcomes the fact that it has requested the Secretary-General of Parliament to implement procedures for the handling of confidential documents, including the setting up of a secure archive, secure reading rooms, formal rules of access and an access register has resulted in a proposal submitted to the Bureau for deliberation in December 2000 which calls for implementation before 31 January 2001."""
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0331/2000) by Mr Garriga Polledo, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Court of Auditors' Special Report No 8/99 on securities and guarantees provided for in the Community Customs Code to protect the collection of traditional own resources together with the Commission' s replies [C5-0228/2000 - 2000/2132(COS)]."

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"That concludes the vote."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Peijs recommendation for second reading (A5-0369/2000)"
"Mr President, I was afraid I was going to have to make my explanations of vote in writing."
"I was concerned in case my fractured foot prevented me from speaking."
"However, I hope that I am not one who often puts his foot in it when he opens his mouth and that I will be able to make my usual contribution to the proceedings."
"Well then, I would like to declare my support for the Peijs report and call for a European Bank to be established in practice."
"In recent days, I am glad to say, the euro has gained against the dollar and the pound."
"I would therefore like to take the opportunity presented by this explanation of vote to express my satisfaction at the European monetary policy and to call for an increase in the European Bank's activities, including the establishment of offices throughout Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, Amendment No 5 to the draft directive on the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions has received majority support."
"This is extremely regrettable because it will give third-party creditors the opportunity to gain access to the general resources as a result, which will mean that mortgages ordered abroad for the benefit of the bank will no longer be competitive."
"This is unacceptable."
"This, to my mind, is reason enough to reject this report."
"That is what I have done, and I regret that the Commission' s common position in its present form failed to receive majority support."
"The objective of the Commission recommendation is to harmonise creditors' rights in the event of the winding up of credit institutions Union-wide."
"Yet nowhere is there any specific mention of the rights which the employees of the credit institutions in question ought to have."
"A number of national legislative systems do acknowledge the employees as creditors, but they are only, at best, entitled to the payment of their wages due."
"They receive no compensation, on the other hand, for the loss of their job, i.e. the loss of their future wages, even though there are attempts to guarantee that creditors will receive compensation for the sums they are owed, in other words their capital, the source of their future income."
"Employees bear no responsibility in the difficulties of banks or credit institutions since they have had no part in taking decisions."
"They are the ones that should be compensated first and foremost for the loss of their jobs."
"We voted against this recommendation which is concerned only with capitalist creditors, and not with the employees who do the work of running these credit institutions."
"Sanders-ten Holte recommendation for second reading (A5-0375/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Sanders-ten Holte report."
"A few days ago, I was the guest of a university of the third age, where people go because they want to learn rather then merely to get a certificate."
"These universities are, of course, frequented by many elderly people."
"The head of this university - the university of the third age of Bergamo, where I live - was lamenting the fact that there is no grading list or quality evaluation of universities of the third age."
"He said to me: ""Many universities are poorly organised, but ours is well organised."
"Therefore, you should mention in your explanation of vote that it would be as well for some interest to be taken in the quality of universities of the third age too""."
"We certainly have nothing against ""European cooperation in quality evaluation of school education"" , but it is a well known fact that the quality of education depends on the resources made available to state schools."
"In order to provide high-quality education, we need sufficient numbers of schools, classes with limited student numbers and a great many teaching assistants, teachers and administrative and technical staff at all levels of education, starting with primary classes."
"Throughout Europe, differences start to show at primary level, causing children from working class areas to fall behind in their education at this stage in an often irreversible way."
"In order to move towards harmonisation in Europe, we first need to align ourselves with the countries that allocate the most resources to education."
"Even in those countries, however, there is a tendency to cut back on the resources allocated to education and, more generally, to public services in favour of other budgetary expenditure, mainly aid and grants given to corporations or, rather, their owners."
"If the resources allocated to education are not increased throughout the European Union, especially in those that have the lowest levels of funding, the European recommendation on quality of education will remain a pious hope."
"The main thrust of this report relates to the need for greater European cooperation in evaluating the quality of education within our overall school systems in the EU This could prove quite a valuable exercise because different EU governments can mutually benefit from successfully proven educational programmes that have been tried and tested within the educational system in Europe."
"We should also recall that this is now even more important in light of the new information society that is now upon us."
"EU leaders in Portugal last year laid down a framework of proposals whereby training in the use of the Internet would be extended to all primary and secondary schools across the European Union."
"This is a fundamentally important social and economic objective if the European Union is to take advantage of new e-commerce and related business activities."
"The reality is that new information technologies are changing all the time."
"This means that educational training in the field of information technology is also changing all the time."
"That is why the European Union must respond in a coordinated and structured manner so as to guarantee that the best educational methods in the field of information technology are available to all our students."
"This will ensure a higher quality of education and will also ensure that a stronger foundation is laid to entice new information technology industries to be set up and located within the territories of the European Union."
"Cooperation in the field of education has been a proven success within the European Union in recent years."
"Currently, 18 countries participate in the Erasmus programme, including countries from Eastern and Central Europe."
"Approximately 90 000 students benefit from this initiative on an annual basis."
"While I welcome the proven success of the Erasmus initiative, I would recall that there is certainly room for improvement in the manner in which this scheme is administered now within the European Union."
"Still students are encountering financial problems while studying abroad."
"I do not support a system of inequality between the levels of funding available to students from the various Member States participating in the Erasmus programme."
"I would strongly urge the Education Ministers from within the EU to put in place a system which eliminates any element of inequality with regard to the administration of the Erasmus programme."
"We should recall that it is a very good policy of the European Union to encourage students to study in other EU Member States."
"This affords real and tangible opportunities for students to improve their practical language skills while promoting the free movement of persons across the EU."
"De Veyrac report (A5-0382/2000)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of Mrs de Veyrac' s report, not just because I feel it is very positive and thorough, but because we are going to have to devote a great deal more attention to this theme in future."
"I also believe that not only do we need to undertake the necessary public works, as provided for in this report, we must also make more funding available, so as to achieve the necessary level of acceptance amongst the general public for these areas."
"A great deal still remains to be done, but we are on the right track."
"That is why I voted in favour."
"Mr President, I voted against this report."
"And why did the Pensioners' Party vote against Mrs de Veyrac's report?"
"Because, before I left for Strasbourg, I met a former Member of the European Parliament, Mrs Monica Baldi, who is very au fait with cultural issues."
"While we were discussing this report over a good coffee in a bar, she said to me: ""Why is it that this report hopes to reduce the number of cultural sites listed in Italy?"
"It' s not the quantity but the quality of sites that counts."
"It is hardly our fault that Italy has so many ancient monuments to preserve""."
"Mrs de Veyrac's report shows willing and contains certain constructive proposals, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of it."
"However, we fear that these proposals will fall on deaf ears."
"We all know that our cultural and natural heritage risks being wiped out by activities which damage or destroy the urban and local fabric in which priceless examples of our cultural and natural heritage are to be found."
"Excessive and uncontrolled use of land, buildings springing up in historic town centres, in the countryside and in green belts and the lack of any proper measures to protect forests and the natural environment are evidence of our rape of the natural and cultural landscape."
"Of course, this is not the random work of a few villains, it is the direct consequence of a policy which commercialises everything and is driven solely by the profit motive."
"A typical example is the TVX Gold site in Olympiada, in Halkidiki, near Stayira, the birthplace of Aristotle, where the forest has been destroyed and monuments have been put at risk."
"As if that were not enough, the residents in the area have been dragged through the courts and sentenced for daring to defend their historic and natural environment."
"We could cite numerous other examples in connection with the destruction inflicted or which it is planned to inflict in order to stage the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004."
"Not only does the European Union do nothing to check and deal with these incidents; on the contrary, it is the main advocate of this policy."
"It funds projects on archaeological sites which will bury and destroy ancient monuments - witness the case of the Acropolis Museum."
"The Greek Government is repealing Article 24 of the Constitution as we speak, thereby abolishing what little legislative protection there was for forests and without the slightest objection on the part of the √ÖU."
"The √ÖU has a penchant for waxing lyrical about culture, but while it preaches that cultural heritage is a basic factor in the individual identity and historical development of a society, it has done nothing to get the Elgin marbles returned to the natural and historic site of which they form an integral part, even as a gesture of respect for our cultural and historic heritage and for the need to protect historic monuments."
"It is also indifferent to the fact that monuments in North Cyprus are being plundered and vandalised by the Turkish occupying forces."
"Finally, it bears a huge responsibility for the destruction of monuments during the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia."
"This situation cannot be rectified with half measures or wishful thinking or, of course, within the context of a market philosophy."
"We need to mobilise the masses, all the cultural agencies, all the workers, and we need to impose a different policy, one which respects the working man and the fruits of his creation."
". The ELDR Group considers that the de Veyrac report is a very important contribution to better protection of world cultural and natural heritage."
"We are of the opinion that the application of the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in the EU is a task for Member States rather than for the European Community."
"It is difficult for us to see the added value of EU intervention in this matter."
"The ELDR amendments to the de Veyrac report reflect this position."
"Thus, for reasons of lack of added value and the principle of subsidiarity the ELDR Group will abstain in the final vote."
"Protecting and promoting our heritage in each Member State is fundamentally important as, in so doing, we are safeguarding our identities and special characteristics whilst still respecting differences."
"Our heritage, be it cultural, architectural, economic or natural, is the legacy of our past and in protecting it we are not fighting a rearguard action."
"On the contrary, it shows that we are preparing for our future."
"The author Ernest Renan wrote that the only true men of progress are those who take a deep-seated respect for the past as their starting point."
"We must, therefore, take advantage of the wealth of our past, our heritage, our roots and our traditions, even the very oldest, in order to prepare for the future."
"This cultural diversity and wealth will allow us to gain a better understanding of ourselves."
"To achieve this, however, we must respect all the diversity of our various heritages, all our differences, and the only way to do this is to invoke the subsidiarity principle."
"In line with this principle we can preserve, develop and transmit our heritage, culture and traditions."
"When these disappear or fade away (in the way of hunting, rural life and gastronomic tradition) we are breaking the chain of transmission by which we hand down our wealth and our way of life and this brings about cultural impoverishment. At the end of the day, we will create a mould into which everyone has to fit in order to live in an insipid but more malleable society that can be controlled by 'rulers and governors' ."
"That is unacceptable."
"Therefore, to protect, preserve and promote our heritage, we must save our architecture, support our arts and craft industry, preserve and enhance the value of our countryside, but I would like to stress that we must not wrap it in cotton wool or exclude the cultural traditions and customs which are practised there."
"In so doing, we must also respect the right to be different and help to preserve all these values since rural life has its own rightful place in this predominantly urban society."
"Therefore, to come back to the report, it is, of course, important to protect the heritage of both the European Union and third countries, but it is equally important and vital to protect the heritage of our own countries and regions."
"We are therefore pleased to note the proposals to take our heritage into account in the various training programmes set up to protect and restore our heritage."
"The same goes for funding and support of the arts and craft industry, a sector which creates many jobs, as long as it is not suffocated by unrealistic pernickety regulations, as has been possible for market traders."
"We must however state our reservations regarding the European regulations which, on the pretext of environmental protection (a term applied too narrowly), will serve only to wipe out local traditions and customs that are a vital part of the local culture of our regions. Yet, this is the opposite of what this report sets out to achieve and so, although we support the report, we are abstaining from the vote for this reason."
"Since 1972, when the UNESCO General Conference adopted the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, which has already been signed by 158 countries, including the 15 Member States of the European Union, 630 sites have been added to the world heritage list, 30% of which are in European Union countries (188), and of those 10 are in Portugal."
"It is obvious, however, that classifying sites as world heritage sites is not enough."
"Every measure must be taken to support their conservation, including financial measures, as we have done with the proposals that we have tabled for the Community budget."
"As the rapporteur highlighted, there is an imbalance between European countries and the rest of the world with regard to recognised natural and cultural sites, and therefore third countries must be supported and encouraged, in a wide-ranging approach, to add to the list of natural and cultural heritage, so that they can be afforded protection."
"It is also important for Member States to comply with existing directives, and in particular the environmental impact assessment directive on assessing the impact of specific public and private projects on cultural and natural heritage, as the report states."
"My vote in support of the de Veyrac report on the application of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage in the Member States of the European Union is based on the conviction that we must enhance the cultural dimension of the European Union. We must work to ensure we have a cultural policy in the Union which highlights, among the main features of its spiritual richness and that of the Old World, its cultural, linguistic, architectural and artistic diversity and all those elements that make up our common cultural heritage."
"This is clear when you travel around the Union and see how the diverse spiritual trends over the centuries have been embodied in our monuments, artistic styles, value systems, religious and spiritual trends, and schools of philosophical and scientific thought. In short, and in accordance with the Treaties, we must go deeper with our European cultural policy, supporting and protecting our cultural diversity, a factor which in turn defines the European Union."
"The de Veyrac report is a laudable contribution towards this."
"Doorn report (A5-0351/2000)"
"Mr President, I am sure you will listen carefully to my explanation of vote in support of this report."
"I am in favour of anything which streamlines or simplifies, provided that the process is not too tiresome for those undergoing the streamlining and is carried out rationally."
"I therefore stress that, in this operation of simplifying and streamlining Community legislation on the social security coordination sector - to which this report refers - we must bear in mind that it would be appropriate for workers who work in more than one State of the European Union to receive a single pension from a single pension office rather than part of it from one State, part of it from another State and part of it from yet another."
"Thank you Mr Fatuzzo."
"The more I listen to you the more I realise that I will know your life history before long."
"Given that we are opposed to a market economy, we shall not adopt any position on the alleged simplification of the internal market."
"We are therefore abstaining from the vote on this report."
"However, on the aspects that may affect the majority of the population i.e. the workers, we are in favour of:"
"simplifying social legislation and social security by bringing them into line with countries that have the most favourable schemes for workers;"
"simplifying VAT through the universal abolition of both VAT itself and all consumption taxes, which are particularly unfair as they mainly affect lower income classes, and replacing these with a sizeable increase in corporation tax and a steeply graduated tax on all forms of revenue from capital."
"van der Laan report (A5-0397/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the van der Laan report. Thank you for your kind words just now."
"In voting for the motion, I would like to draw your attention to the part of the document which refers to assistance to the Palestinian authorities."
"I was prompted to do so by the representatives of the Pensioners' Party in Israel - for the Knesset includes representatives of the Pensioners' Party in Israel - one of whom said to me: ""I am glad you are helping the Palestinians."
"In fact, you should give them more and better assistance and ensure that it genuinely serves to help the Palestinian people, for they truly need it."
"Indeed, I am sure that, if the Palestinian citizens were in better health and their economy were improved, there would be less war than I am sorry to say there is at the moment""."
"I am unable to agree with my group regarding its position on Mr van Dam' s amendment, which I, personally, chose to support."
"It is one thing for the issue of the spreading of anti-Semitic propaganda by Palestinian schoolbooks not to be included in the 1997 discharge resolution."
"I would say that this is a technical problem."
"However, to my mind, it is a misjudged political signal for us to oppose it for this reason alone, i.e. on the grounds of form rather than content."
"Since signing the Oslo Agreement, the European Union and its Member States have, to a great extent, subsidised the Palestinian education system."
"Therefore, it is up to us to demand that the Commission should monitor more closely to ensure that the material in Palestinian schools does not constitute an incitement to war, violence and racial hatred."
"The European Union cannot keep actively supporting reconciliation and peace while continuing to turn a blind eye to the way EU financial support is being misappropriated for ideological ends."
"Indeed, I sincerely hope that this issue will very soon be the subject of a genuine debate in Parliament."
"We must be firm on this issue."
"Our conscience will not allow anything else, nor will our electorate."
"I have voted in favour of the report and especially of Amendment No 1 from Mr van Dam."
"It is important for the European Parliament to strongly criticise the anti-Semitic statements in teaching resources for Palestinian schools and for Parliament to call upon the Commission to ensure that the aid given to Palestinian education does not, either directly or indirectly, finance racial hatred. Instead, the EU' s contribution to the Palestinian education system should instead promote peace and reconciliation in the Middle East."
"EU aid must, as far as possible, be designed to bring about peace and reconciliation in the Middle East."
"The EU is, among other things, providing aid to the Palestinian education system."
"It is profoundly unfortunate and offensive that Palestinian school books should contain anti-Semitic statements and describe Israel - the only democracy in the Middle East - in terms as abominable as those of Nazism."
". Both the rapporteur and the ELDR Group share the sentiment expressed in Amendment No 1 regarding concern at the possible use made of EU financial support for inciting racial hatred amongst Palestinians against their Jewish neighbours."
"The Budgetary Control Committee is strict in the remit of a discharge follow-up report to restrict itself to the contents of the original discharge resolution for the year in question."
"This amendment raises a new issue on evidence that has recently come to light."
"The rapporteur is therefore recommending that the amendment be rejected but that the matter be dealt with more fully in the context of the ongoing 1999 discharge report."
"Garriga Polledo report (A5-0331/2000)"
"Mr President, speakers have drawn attention to a number of problems, including cigarette smuggling."
"I support their concern as it is generally believed that international criminals are now more interested in cigarette smuggling than drug-trafficking as it is more profitable and less dangerous."
"We in the EU must respond to this problem as a matter of urgency."
"The profits from cigarette smuggling not only line the pockets of criminals but also deny revenue to the EU, which would otherwise be used in tackling cancer, poverty, the promotion of human rights, etc. In addition, cheaper cigarettes mean greater danger to health because of heavier tobacco consumption, and we must enlist the support of ministers in national and regional governments in any campaign against this."
"The Commission should contact in particular the ministers of health and education in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Ms de Brun and Mr Martin McGuinness."
"I mention that because we use education and health programmes to combat cancer and the Anderstown News recently revealed the deep involvement of the IRA in illicit cigarette smuggling."
"They have links to that organisation."
"What better way to discharge the ministerial portfolio than to encourage their friends to stop this activity."
"It also underlines a greater need for widespread policing in Northern Ireland."
"Mr President, I voted for this report but with great reservations."
"Before I left for Strasbourg, I met Mr Rota, a pensioner who is also from Bergamo, in a restaurant."
"We talked about the Pensioners' Party and he asked me whether I was content with the European Parliament."
"I said: ""It is such an enjoyable job!"
"I am content, I feel at ease and I have some very good friends."
"Even the Vice-Presidents, such as Mr Provan, for example, are very diligent and I like them very much."""
"He continued: ""And is everything working alright in Europe?"
"You don't find yourselves wasting European money every now and again?"""
"""No"", I replied, ""everything is working fine."""
"However, I am sad to say that I then read in this report that the national States have not applied Community legislation on collecting duties owed to the Community budget."
"I therefore hope that, in future, the collection of customs duties in Europe will work well too."
"We have voted in favour of a report on securities and guarantees for traditional own resources."
"The report as a whole makes sense."
"There are, however, a few points from which we would disassociate ourselves."
"Paragraphs 15 and 16 pave the way for introducing a single corpus juris in the EU and for harmonising criminal law and the administration of justice in the Member States."
"First of all, this is unclearly formulated."
"Secondly, we are not in favour of harmonising criminal legislation and the administration of justice in the Member States."
"What we do support is establishing the necessary instruments for combating fraud involving EU funds more effectively."
"We are in favour of supplementing the OLAF regulation by setting up a unit under OLAF to lead investigations and make it easier to follow up criminal cases in the national courts."
"The unit must only concern itself with crimes committed by EU employees."
"In the longer term, consideration should be given to introducing a European public prosecutor to follow up cases of fraud involving EU funds in the Member States."
"We must not, however, have harmonisation for harmonisation' s sake and, in other areas, the Member States' criminal law and administration of justice are national concerns."
"McCartin report (A5-0396/2000)"
"Mr President, although I have mislaid my notes, I seem to remember that I voted against the McCartin report, which deals with agriculture and powdered milk."
"I am happy to discuss the subject on this occasion because I want to call strongly for genuine help to be given to farmers - for this document does not provide sufficient protection for them - and, in particular, because I want to draw attention to the fact that there is currently a huge crisis in Italy over powdered and other milk."
"Not only is there talk of mad cow disease, sadly, but, since yesterday, there has also been talk of ""mad milk"" in Italy."
"People are saying that it might be possible to contract mad cow disease by drinking milk."
"This is a truly unforgivable thing to say, and it would be appropriate for the European Union to intervene and make it clear that milk is not mad but quite healthy."
"This report is deeply contradictory in its assessment of various aspects of the CAP."
"For example, the approach adopted in its reflects exclusively budgetary concerns, for example, when the report expresses satisfaction at the reform reducing institutional prices and surplus produce, and insists on a greater reduction of compensation payments, without even mentioning the consequences this will have for farmers' incomes."
"Furthermore, together with the principle of cofinancing, it advocates the renationalisation of CAP costs. This is a principle that we reject."
"The report also expresses satisfaction at the Commission' s decision to carry out a thorough assessment of the COM in milk, which closely reflects a Court of Auditors' opinion questioning the system of milk quotas and increases in these laid down in Agenda 2000, forgetting that, despite some unfairness in the allocation of quotas, such as that suffered by Portugal, this system still manages to guarantee a degree of protection as regards prices and incomes."
"With regard to the pig sector and animal epidemics, the report concludes by considering and supporting the proposal to establish funds with contributions from the producers themselves or other types of insurance schemes, which is a step backwards in relation to the opinion that has already been expressed in the Garot report, which argued in favour of such Community-cofinanced funds."
"Nevertheless, I agree with the rapporteur when he raises a very important issue affecting the system of arable crops, which is the concentration of aid amongst major producers and in the most prosperous regions."
"What is needed is an improvement in the situation of small producers, differentiating support according to the size of the farm."
"It is hard to understand how the rapporteur proposes to support small farmers through the measures that he is recommending."
"Staes report (A5-0389/2000)"
"President."
"Mr Fatuzzo, if you want to remain standing we will just keep going as you are the only speaker left."
"Mr President, my leg gets tired easily so I have to sit down every now and again."
"With regard to my declaration of vote on the Staes document, which concerns the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in particular, the way in which the aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina has been spent, I have to say that I have had a meeting with the representatives of the pensioners of that region."
"They urged me to ask the European Parliament - and I am very happy to do so on this occasion - to ensure that at least part of the aid, by some means or other, reaches the elderly people of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"""But we can't go checking up on what happens to our money"", I replied. ""But you must, Mr Fatuzzo."
"You must insist that the funds are monitored when they reach their destination as well."
"We pensioners need to receive some of them!"""
"Mr President, there is indeed a crisis of succession in farming as Mr Parish with his expertise as a farmer knows well."
"If this crisis is particularly acute in Mr Parish's own Member State, it is the direct result of policies pursued by UK governments over the past twenty years, and to overcome it the United Kingdom must review the implications of the Fontainbleau Agreement for its contribution to European Union finances."
"This has been disastrous for farming."
"Moreover, the rapporteur, a member of the Conservative Party, must work within his own party to secure support for his proposals in the House of Commons."
"In countries where less than 10% of the population now lives in rural areas, it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas, and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries."
"(EL) Barbaric military intervention - ostensibly for the sake of peace -, dirty 'peace-making' agreements signed manu militari, followed by dirty, suspicious financial 'help' for the purpose of 'restoring peace' : such are the EU's achievements in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and the Balkans in general, which have been commiserating for years now as the result of the huge military and political imperialist interests being played out in this region."
"This parliamentary report reveals exactly how the above funding is managed and shows how the EU taxpayers' money is being squandered, with no controls or transparency, in order to consolidate the expansion of the huge interests of the EU in the NATO protectorate of Bosnia, declarations of 'humanitarian and peace-making' motives notwithstanding."
"References to mismanagement, delays, late payment, millions of √ÖCU being granted for non-subsidisable equipment, waste and irregularities abound both in the Staes report and the opinions."
"They describe the prevailing situation in the strongest of terms and reveal the tremendous hypocrisy about support for the civil society and the restoration of democracy."
"What could be more damning than the reference in the report to ""conflicts of interest"" in the office of the High Representative himself?"
"We are not surprised that those who 'promote' peace with depleted uranium bombs, spreading death and destruction, cannot and will not play the role of peacemaker."
"We are not surprised that the golden goose is being squeezed dry by the major economic interests which created, cultivated and fomented the hatred between the peoples of this region and by the employees and servants of those interests, such as the famous Mr Kounser."
"But we are surprised by the cynicism and hypocrisy of leaders who continue to talk of efforts to 'clean up' and improve the uptake of funds and restore the rule of law."
"The gloomy facts speak for themselves and leave no room for doubt, let alone complacency."
"People are not accounts; their consciences cannot be bought off and however much you try to embellish the facts, you still have to contend with the people."
"We shall not be voting in favour of the Staes report, despite the fact that it contains numerous accurate findings and proposals, because its general perception is bereft of any notion of resistance to the presence of imperialist forces and its only concern is how to embellish that presence so that it is easier for the people to swallow."
"Dell'Alba report (A5-0359/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Dell'Alba report, but I want to stress that underlying this vote for the motion is my position as representative of the Pensioners' Party."
"I wish to make clear my total opposition to the now established practice of insisting that the Structural Funds and European aid are added to national aid."
"So the Structural Funds should be additional aid? I disagree."
"I feel that European funds should have nothing whatsoever to do with national financing or national policies."
"European funds must not be tied to national funds."
"Europe is a separate entity from its constituent nations."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Neil Parish on the fact that he has produced a report which is based on the farmers' reality, the reality in rural areas, and not on the view from Brussels."
"This in itself constitutes a valuable contribution to agricultural policy."
"But if we now examine the situation, we could ask ourselves whether there are any young people left out there who are mad enough to become farmers in the European Union."
"What we need is people who want to take up the challenge of producing an outstanding achievement, five-legged sheep as it were, but not obtained through genetic modification."
"They seem to be fighting a losing battle, if we consider the adversities which young farmers face, as well as the achievements they are expected to deliver."
"To quote just one example - and I am just considering my own country for a moment - dairy farming is a sector where absolutely everything is being scrutinised, from the blade of grass right up to the moment that the milk hits the supermarkets."
"I cannot help drawing a comparison with arable farmers and horticulturalists who have been required to keep tabs on the implications of their actions on the environment and consumer front for a long time, and do so with great enthusiasm."
"At the same time, we have to say that in many European countries the requirements for animal welfare are among the world' s most stringent."
"So whoever wants to become a farmer in Europe must outstrip their counterparts elsewhere in the world."
"They need to give the landscape and cultural conditions due consideration."
"They must apply the strictest consumer conditions, supply a wide range of products, both regionally and in terms of quality, make animal welfare a top priority and be responsible for the product, even once it has left the farm."
"This is what we call social enterprising as a top-level sport."
"It requires entrepreneurship, a love of nature and the environment, social orientation and perseverance."
"For this reason alone, it would be desirable if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is focused on the future."
"Some of the focal points could include a premium scheme linked to quality, landscape and environmental protection, but also the introduction of an eco-tax in other economic sectors, not payable by the farmers but by the consumers, to finance those extra requirements which farmers need to fulfil, and to reinforce the market position of farmers and consumers."
"What strikes me in the European Union' s competition policy as a whole, is that although it is enjoying a great deal of attention, in the food sector, for example, the consumers, the supermarkets that is, are gradually gaining a monopoly position, and that at the same time sales from farms, the small-scale dimension, are still fragmented."
"In that sense, it would be desirable if both Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein were more critical in their assessment of this area in terms of competition."
"Mr President, nobody can survive for one day without food; it is life requirement number one."
"This requires motivated producers."
"This means that food does not just stand for market forces, but also for public health, landscape and nature."
"In short, if we realise this, then we will know that, in future, young farmers will need to be five-legged sheep, and in that sense, deserve more support, more political support than they are receiving at the moment."
"Heaton Harris report (A5-0395/2000)"
"Mr President, the Heaton-Harris report, which I voted in favour of, is a report on the efficiency of the European Monetary Institute and therefore on the situation of the euro."
"I have already had occasion to congratulate the European single currency, in other words, the euro, on its gain in strength in recent weeks, but today I would like to call for the establishment of a European bank."
"The EIB - European Investment Bank - should be closer to the European citizens as an actual bank, a credit institute as well."
"I therefore trust that my recommendation will be acted upon."
"The report by Mr Heaton-Harris confuses two issues."
"In the name of wage moderation, it condemns granting extraordinary bonuses to some ECB employees, which is unacceptable."
"On the other hand, the rapporteur criticises the ECB for preventing OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, from carrying out its work."
"We learn therefore that ""the European Central Bank has stated that it will not allow the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, to conduct internal investigations"" and that ""in its first report to Parliament, Council and Commission, the supervisory committee of OLAF called for legal proceedings to be brought against Community bodies that have not implemented Regulation 1073/99, before the end of 1999"" and that ""the Commission initiated legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice against the decision of 7 October 1999 of the European Central Bank regarding the non-application of Parliament and Council Regulation 1073/99"" ."
"We believe that this whole issue is extremely important and we support the paragraph of the report which ""regrets clear incompatibility between the public commitment assumed by the ECB in its 1999 annual report to establish close cooperation with OLAF and the decision by the ECB itself to prevent OLAF from carrying over internal investigations, pending the ruling by the European Court of Justice"" ."
"We will vote in support of the report by Mr Heaton-Harris for this reason."
"Bushill-Matthews report (A5-0335/2000)"
"Mr President, I could not fail to give an explanation of vote on my friend, Mr Bushill-Matthews' report, upon which I have already spoken during the debate."
"This time, however, I would like to state that my vote for the motion is also a call for Mr Bushill-Matthews to accept, at a later date, an amendment which I tabled and which, I regret to say, has been rejected this time. I am calling, that is, for funds to be allocated to small and medium-sized businesses which follow the practice of setting up a company where a young entrepreneur who is full of enthusiasm and the will to work is aided by an older - senior - entrepreneur who knows everything there is to know about the business, is very experienced and can pass on his skills, and, even though he has no real wish to work long hours, would be happy to give the youngsters the benefit of his experience."
"The Members of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the Bushill-Matthews report because the specific ""Measures on financial assistance for innovative and job-creating Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)"" proposed in the report form part of the more general policy exercised by the monopolies and the EU against SMEs, to which there are three strands:"
"¬∑ Selective support for a small group of what are - by Greek standards - medium-sized and large enterprises, with a view to consolidating their satellite role around the monopolies and strengthening the processes used to concentrate capital and production."
"¬∑ Worsening competitive terms for the overwhelming majority of the remaining small and medium-sized enterprises, in a bid to strengthen the same processes by the back door."
"¬∑ In addition to the aforementioned, it is clear from all the EU programmes on SMEs that big business is keen to 'offload' (on to SMEs) the jobs which it is forced to abolish as it increases its exploitation of the working classes, helped by technological progress."
"This aim will be thwarted by the contradictions inherent in the capitalist system and therefore has little chance of success."
"It is also important to note that isolated companies, not SMEs as a whole, benefit from European programmes."
"Big business knows only too well that a policy which benefits SMEs as a whole would create an adversary to be reckoned with."
"Hence, even if grants under European programmes manage to reach small enterprises, they cannot be used to advantage, because each of these enterprises is in an extremely weak position on the capitalist market."
"A number of observations on the substance of the specific programmes bears out the general comments made above:"
"1. The limits on the enterprises targeted by these measures (250 employees and up to GDR 14 billion in annual turnover) clearly allow what are large companies by Greek standards to benefit."
"In fact, 91% of companies in Greece employ up to 4 persons and achieve turnover of up to GDR 60 million."
"From this point of view, the concern about small enterprises expressed in the parliamentary report is well-founded."
"The total number of SMEs targeted by these measures is negligible compared with the total number of SMEs in the √ÖU: 7 387 out of a total of some 15 million SMEs in the √ÖU or 0.05% of the total number over a period of two years from application."
"3. The total paid out by the European funds in grants is discouragingly low and does not amount to a real policy for the benefit of SMEs."
"A total of EUR 273 million has been paid out (GDR 93.6 billion) or EUR 18 (GDR 6 170) per enterprise."
"4. The results of this policy are even worse: 2 238 new jobs were finally created, compared with several million unemployed in the √ÖU, at a cost of EUR 122 000 (GDR 42 million) each."
"5. 97% of SMEs which benefited from these measures come under the third strand of the programmes, i.e. the companies received guarantees for funding for which they themselves were wholly responsible."
"This begs the question of how a complicated procedure which cost so much and achieved so little can be presented as a successful EU policy."
"As far as Greece is concerned, it was nowhere to be found in the programmes; no funding whatsoever came our way."
"We shall therefore be voting against the report in question and the relevant Commission proposal."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Frontier workers (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the situation of frontier workers."
"Mr President, I want first of all to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for an excellent report."
"Many previous attempts have, of course, been made to use frontier workers' problems as a way in to harmonising tax legislation as a whole."
"However, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten knows that frontier workers do not even constitute half a per cent of the labour force, that their problems are different from one frontier region to another and that different regional solutions are therefore needed if frontier workers are to have a better time of it."
"I can speak from personal experience, having spent 25 years commuting between Denmark and Sweden."
"We have now acquired a bridge between Copenhagen and Malm√∂, and everyone expects a sharp increase in cross-border commuting and for the two cities to become a conurbation It was here that, in 1997 on the initiative of the Danes, the EU-supported principle was introduced of taxing people in the country in which they work."
"This means that people can take up residence in Malm√∂ and have access to health care, child care, education and everything else, at the same time as paying all their tax to the Danish State."
"That is quite intolerable if we are to have a common √ñresund region."
"The alternative recommended by Swedish politicians is the OECD model for frontier taxation, which advocates that tax should be levied in the country of residence."
"That principle too causes problems, however, because much more than families' social welfare is financed through tax."
"For ourselves in the √ñresund region, it would in actual fact be best if we were to pay local tax where we live and State tax where we work."
"I think that would put an end to tax avoidance and to cheating in frontier regions."
"However, a model such as that, too, would require some form of fine tuning in order to create an entirely fair situation, for these are complicated issues."
"It is therefore crucial for solutions to be worked out in the affected regions themselves, and on the basic principle that frontier workers must pay tax in the country in which they enjoy their benefits financed through tax."
"Only in that way will long-lasting solutions be obtained."
"It is essential to adopt a principle of this kind if √ñresund is to become a common region."
"Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I would like to extend my hearty congratulations to the town of Piacenza, which has inserted Articles 25 and 26 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights of the elderly and persons with disabilities into its own bye-laws. I would also like to comment on Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report."
"I endorse the content of the report, particularly the part which calls for an analysis of the impact of changes to the laws of the Member States on Regulation 1408, relating to people who have worked in more than one State, and especially that part of the regulation which concerns rules for the payment of the pensions of people who have worked in more than one State."
"We are discussing the problems of cross-border workers: of course we refer to European Union workers but also, indirectly, to relations between the States which have associated themselves with Regulation 1408, that is with the EEA - the European Economic Area - in other words Italy and Switzerland."
"I regret to say that the Italy-Switzerland Convention and the ensuing regulation have been misinterpreted by the Italian Government, which has hitherto paid the pensions of people who have worked in both Italy and Switzerland according to the scale of half of half the amount, that is a quarter of the amount owed, as laid down by Italian magistrates, judges and courts."
"I call upon the European Parliament to intervene to stop workers being forced always to institute legal proceedings to obtain their rights."
"Mr President, today we are discussing the situation of frontier workers, a nagging problem for the European Union, which has yet to find a satisfactory solution."
"Commissioner, Mr President, this situation prevents the people living and working on the borders of the various European Union countries fully experiencing the notion of European integration we champion, even though these are the people who should be the first to benefit from it."
"We have a habit in this House of lauding to the skies the issue of free movement of persons and, hence, of workers."
"Yet, while there are still obstacles to this, particularly in terms of tax and social security, there are also other matters to be considered."
"I believe that this issue is inconsistent with the principles of freedom and liberalism which we are considering, even though we seem able to find perfectly good solutions to problems when it relates to the free movement of capital and of goods."
"This represents a major obstacle to the principle of the free movement of persons and the principal of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality."
"In my opinion, this report is a real booster shot in relation to previous reports."
"We should at least ensure that there is no need to produce many more reports."
"We must remind the Member States of their responsibilities and ask them to undertake a thorough evaluation of policies which result in upholding systems which have an adverse affect on the situation of frontier workers."
"We agree with the general thrust of the report but the reincorporation of certain amendments waters down the ambitions which we should be adopting."
"Bilateral agreements, which, for example, relate to tax or social security, should be perfectly consistent and it is simply not a matter of taking varying provisions into account."
"Mr President, I would like to sum up by repeating that an accurate inventory should be proposed, listing situations giving rise to prejudice, or even discrimination but also one which would make it possible to clamp down on the fraud which occurs at present. We await the Council' s guidelines in this area."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her own-initiative report."
"I think it only right that we in Parliament make efforts to reduce the problems experienced by frontier workers."
"I am familiar with the problems from Southern Jutland, where it is worth noting how few people live on one side of the Danish-German border and work on the other side. I think this illustrates how major the obstacles in practice are."
"That is why I think it is a good idea to try to get the Member States to continually assess the effects upon frontier workers whenever they change tax and social security legislation. In my opinion, we cannot, however, require governments to compensate frontier workers financially for changes in legislation."
"It is better to heighten awareness not only of the problems there have always been, but also of new problems that might arise."
"I should also like to support the view that we should do more to simplify Regulation 1408/71. This is a very far-reaching problem, but one of great importance to many people."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to make a few observations following on from this dossier."
"First of all, I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for the work she has done."
"Secondly, my contribution should of course be considered as an appeal to the Social Council and the Commission, but mainly the Social Council, to do something about this dossier at long last, particularly in the knowledge that this is the start of the necessary deregulation of the movement of workers across Europe."
"Frontier work falls under free movement, and will grow, especially once the candidate countries have joined."
"Despite this, there are still major problems to contend with."
"Especially in my own country and a number of neighbouring countries, Belgium and Germany, I notice that different groups wish to apply different principles. Foundations involved with frontier workers argue in favour of the principle of the country of residence, trade unions support the principle of the country of employment, the government itself believes in the principle of the country of residence, and so it goes on."
"It is about time we made a decision, and in that sense, we are unwilling to support a number of amendments which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten tabled, and which are partly designed to adopt a mixed approach. We suggest using the principle of the country of employment as point of departure, and to develop this so-called European social model."
"Mr President, I should like above all to thank the rapporteur for this report."
"It is good that we should not forget frontier workers and their problems."
"The report is further evidence that Regulation 1408/71 requires thorough revision and simplification, proposals for which have been before the Council for two years. We can, therefore, once again regret the lack of success in obtaining more majority voting at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice."
"The Danish Social Democrats broadly agree with most of what the rapporteur says, but I completely and utterly disagree with her when she sees it as a problem that ever more features of national social insurance are financed through public funds."
"Regulation 1408/71 concerns the coordination, and not the harmonisation, of social security arrangements, and it is important to make this clear."
"I should like to emphasise this, because it is precisely this form of argument which has given an unwarranted boost to those Danish opponents of the EU who maintain that the EU is eroding the Danish welfare system."
"It is partly those who organise resistance to the EU who are purposefully working to ensure that nothing at all happens in this area."
"They seem to forget that the Council' s incapacity for action does in fact have consequences - consequences for those people and their families who work across national frontiers and who are plagued by uncertainty."
"However, one further consequence of the Council' s incapacity to act is, in actual fact, that it is the courts, instead of the politicians responsible, who take the decisions."
"The Eurosceptics talk such a lot about democracy, but it can never be democratic to omit to take the necessary decisions and, in that way, to consign people to insecurity and to give the courts a degree of influence which politicians ought to have."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her excellent report on the situation of frontier workers and, in particular, the social and fiscal problems these workers face."
"I should also like to thank Parliament for the support given to the Commission's proposal to extend the scope of Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals, the proposal to modernise and simplify that regulation, and for the encouraging support given to the Eures network."
"The Commission fully supports your concerns as regards the problems encountered by frontier workers."
"I therefore welcome your proposal to forward the resolution to the Council."
"Allow me to now set out briefly the Commission's approach to the points raised in the resolution."
"First, on social security and the labour market, the report calls on the Commission, before the end of this year, to organise an international conference for the Member States and applicant countries concerning the position of frontier workers."
"This is an excellent idea and advantage can be taken of the experience accumulated under the Eures network."
"Such a conference could identify best practices and initiatives that could be launched both at Community and national level, and the European Parliament will be involved in its organisation."
"On the idea of coordination provisions for supplementary pensions, I would remind you that the Commission has committed itself in its social policy agenda to propose in 2002 a directive on the transferability of supplementary pensions."
"This initiative will complement the already existing directive in this field, which was adopted in 1998."
"As the proposal will be based on Article 42 of the EC Treaty and rely on the codecision procedure for its adoption, Parliament will be fully involved."
"Furthermore I can confirm that a study covering the extent and nature of frontier work is already planned to be carried out under the Eures auspices in 2001."
"On the initiatives taken by social security agencies for closer cross-border cooperation in order to facilitate access to health-care benefits, I am very much in favour of such initiatives and can confirm that it is the intention of the Commission to encourage such initiatives and to promote exchanges of experience and best practices."
"In fact the Commission is already giving support to such a project involving the inhabitants of the Euregio Meuse-Rhine, which covers part of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands."
"With regard to the follow-up of the Decker and Kohl judgments, there are important legal questions currently being debated in new cases before the Court."
"These questions concern hospital care and the Dutch health system."
"The Commission will await the outcome of these judgments before taking a position."
"On obstacles to the mobility of stagiaires, students, volunteers and researchers, the Commission has already taken the initiative and presented a proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and the Council on mobility within the Community for students, persons undergoing training, young volunteers, teachers and trainers."
"On 9 November 2000 the Education Council adopted its common position on this proposal."
"I wish to thank Parliament for its support on this matter and I hope that the final discussions will enable Parliament and the Council to adopt the recommendations shortly."
"On the idea of a proposal for a directive on the introduction of frontier effect reports, whereby Member States would be required to test their legislation as to the effects for frontier workers, I should make it clear that it is already the Commission's task to ensure that all provisions of national legislation are compatible with the Treaty and the secondary legislation of Community law."
"The Commission will certainly continue to use the powers laid down in Article 226 of the Treaty and to launch infringement proceedings against Member States when they violate Community law."
"However, I understand that the suggested proposal for a directive aims to provide for a more general socio-economic impact assessment of the consequences of national legislation, that is in itself compatible with Community law but might cause further difficulties to frontier workers."
"The Commission is not sure that it would be appropriate to propose such a legislative instrument."
"It seems to the Commission more appropriate to stimulate cross-border cooperation of the partners involved in the different regions and at Community level in order to prevent any negative consequences of national legislation on frontier workers."
"Finally, my comments on tax."
"Unlike social security, there is no Community legislation at all on personal taxation."
"Indeed Member States are extremely protective of their sovereignty in this area."
"That is particularly true of their competence to enter into bilateral tax treaties."
"Therefore, there is little chance of the Commission being able to secure successfully the adoption of measures by Member States, as requested in the report."
"Unfortunately this will not change following the Treaty of Nice."
"As you are aware, contrary to our common wishes, the requirement of unanimity in Council was retained for tax matters."
"Opinions are, moreover, likely to be divided about the merits of the recommendations made in the report concerning taxation in the State of employment."
"In fact, the prevailing view in tax administrations is that the State of residence rather than the State of employment is best placed to take account of the overall situation of taxpayers."
"In conclusion, I wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten again for her stimulating report and to underline the Commission's determination to maintain its efforts to overcome the problems faced by frontier workers."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The debate will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Environment directives"
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0556/2000) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to the Commission, on the poor implementation of certain environmental directives (PCB/PCT, habitats, nitrates)."
"Mr President, Parliament's Committee on the Environment is increasingly concerned that we are adopting European environmental legislation and then neglecting to implement it properly."
"Putting it bluntly, we believe that the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the European Parliament are complicit in a deception of the public."
"Opinion polls show that the majority of people support the idea that environmental issues are important and should be dealt with at European level."
"We are adopting legislation that appears to fill this need."
"In fact, in all too many cases, environmental laws are ignored, targets are not met, reports are not sent in to the Commission on time and those countries which break the law go unpunished."
"The purpose of this debate is to highlight what is going wrong and to try and do something about it."
"The Committee on the Environment has put together three reports, we call them 'insight reports' , basing ourselves on the model of the US Congress."
"We have found that the habitats directive is locked in controversy and law suits."
"The PCBs directive is characterised by the failure of Member States to supply the all-important inventories of the stocks they hold."
"The nitrates directive was probably flawed from the beginning and all but two countries, Denmark and Sweden of course, are now before the European Court of Justice because of their failure to implement it."
"It is highly likely that these shortcomings are repeated throughout the canon of EU environmental law."
"What can be done about this?"
"We hope firstly that in the environmental action programme, which the world is eagerly awaiting, the Commission will key in adequate resources for following up what has happened to legislation."
"It would be interesting to hear from the Commissioner roughly how many people in her Directorate are responsible for this as compared to those overseeing the introduction of new legislation."
"There needs to be a much more honest debate secondly - nationally and at the European level - about the real possibility of achieving the environmental objectives set out in draft legislation."
"Too often, we suspect, Member States sign up to green laws because it looks good to do so, and opposing or moderating them is seen as politically insensitive."
"If, in fact, they cannot comply with what they have agreed to, such countries are doing Green causes harm."
"If the Germans and others, for example, now have trouble with the habitats directive, why did we not hear more about it when that directive was going through this Parliament?"
"And did the German Government, in fact, vote against that directive originally?"
"Certainly the cost of clean-up laws must be taken into account when a law is adopted."
"A good example of the failure to do this is the urban waste water directive which the government of Brussels cannot afford to comply with."
"We suspect that the same thing will happen with the national emissions ceiling directive."
"Thirdly, we want Member States to develop the infrastructures which will allow them, all of them, to carry out the monitoring work that must accompany the proper implementation of many of the EU directives we adopt here."
"My colleagues and I were desperately disappointed that the Council felt it could not agree to our proposal to transform the environmental inspections recommendation into a directive."
"We were not demanding an EU inspectorate but simply that Member States should agree to bring their national inspectorates up to a common high standard."
"We will continue to pursue this idea in two years time when the issue should return to us."
"Fourthly, we want much quicker action by the Commission to take Member States to court when they break EU law."
"Last week the Greek Government, which can ill afford to do so, paid the second instalment of a fine, now totalling over EUR 2 million for failure to comply with a judgment of the Court of Justice over the dumping of waste in Crete."
"This was thirteen years after the Commission received the first complaint about the dumping of that waste and no less than nineteen years after the directive concerned came into force."
"It is absurd that a poor country should get itself into a situation of paying back money to Brussels, but equally absurd that the case should have taken so long."
"Finally, let me say that we in Parliament are not daunted or diverted by the idea that the European Parliament should only be concerned with the adoption of legislation and not with its follow-up."
"Apparently the Environment Council was somewhat surprised and even disapproving that we had intruded into their territory and that our intention was to take the environmental inspections recommendation very seriously."
"MEPs, as we will all know, are on the receiving end of public criticism of poor implementation."
"The public tends to complain to us, not to the Environment Council."
"In the interests of the people of Europe and their environment, we will pursue this issue and we will not let go."
"Mr President, first of all I thank Mrs Jackson for her important question."
"I would remind all the Members of the European Parliament that implementation of European Community law covers both the transposition of directives into national law and their application to individual decisions."
"It also includes fulfilment of other obligations such as adopting programmes, making designations and monitoring."
"The difficulties encountered by the Committee on the Environment in these three reports are indeed not limited to the three directives chosen but extend to all EC environmental directives."
"The Commission, and not least the Environment DG are aware of these difficulties and have for some time devoted efforts to improve their performance in this field and I can assure you that next week when the Commission discusses the Sixth Environmental Action Programme the whole implementation issue will be a very important point in that programme."
"We have a number of tools at our disposal to improve implementation."
"We can, for example, disseminate information to give a more up-to-date picture of the state of play and I know that we have also forwarded some of these reports and annual surveys to Parliament and that we can do much more to ensure some media attention as well."
"We can develop tools to aid in the analysis and evaluation of progress in implementation."
"We can take legal measures to follow up implementation."
"Since 1997 specific initiatives have been pursued on a number of fronts including environmental liability, which of course will put pressure on the Member States to follow the existing rules and regulations; complaints and investigations procedures at national level where we have been involved in playing a consultancy role; access to justice, magistrates' training courses - also very important because this is also about education - and the publication of this annual survey on the implementation of environmental law."
"We have also worked to create a clear link between implementation of the directives and Community cofunding which has proven to be very effective as well as ensuring a close relationship with the LIFE financial instrument, because when they see that the money is threatened if they do not comply with the regulations this will definitely put pressure on the Member States."
"In May last year we had a first name and shame exercise, as we call it, on bathing water quality."
"A second exercise will take place in March this year and I will continue to follow this up so as to give us a scoreboard of how Member States are implementing Community legislation."
"Just last week the European Parliament and the Council, as Mrs Jackson said, reached an agreement on a recommendation which will establish minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States."
"All these initiatives are intended to increase the level of knowledge of and compliance with European Community and environmental law."
"Of course, I acknowledge that there is still much to be done."
"We have to look for new ways to encourage the proper transposition and application of environmental legislation."
"For example, we need to work to improve the involvement of people at the local and regional level."
"Greater public awareness at these levels would lead to closer scrutiny and to public demand for effective implementation of environmental legislation."
"We must remain vigilant and active to ensure that the situation improves and I would like to confirm to the European Parliament my personal commitment and that of my services to ensuring the highest possible level of compliance with European Community environmental law."
"To this end I will apply all means available, including the formal infringement procedures set out in Articles 226 and 228 of the European Community Treaty and 141 and 143 of the Euratom Treaty, which may lead to imposing economic penalties on non-complying Member States."
"I would be more than happy to receive more resources and personnel from the European Parliament to work on this."
"Today we have about 45 to 50 staff working full or part-time on implementation, and, of course, we would need more than that."
"But I also think that it is for every civil servant here to actually look at the implementation part of introducing new legislation."
"I have been very clear from the beginning that I will put more emphasis on implementation."
"That needs the three I' s: information, integration and implementation, which should be the guidelines for the future."
"I hope that you will agree with me that we are starting to make progress on improving implementation and if both the Commission and the European Parliament continue their efforts to highlight the problem and act on it, further progress will surely be made during this parliamentary term."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the field of the environment and public health, the main problem with the European legislative process is not its inability to produce appropriate legislation."
"The problem lies, on the one hand, in the slowness with which directives are transposed into national law and, on the other, in shortcomings in their implementation."
"The environmental directives that we are now debating, on PCBs, nitrates and habitats, are examples of this very problem."
"There is little point in our having approved the directive on habitats and the creation of the ""Nature 2000"" network in order to protect sites of Community importance, when the Commission has been waiting since 1995 for all the Member States to present a definitive list of these sites, as well as their plans, rules and management mechanisms."
"The same problem applies to the directive on PCBs."
"And there is little point in our having stipulated the ban on PCBs and the decontamination of all equipment containing PCBs and PCTs with a view to protecting public health, if five years on, the overwhelming majority of Member States have not only failed to implement the directive, but have also failed to take the most simple action, which was to catalogue PCBs and to produce plans for decontamination."
"We therefore have widespread non-compliance and for that reason, these directives have not produced the environmental results hoped for."
"We also have a situation, however, in which a degree of impunity reigns."
"The slowness of the Community's legal processes and the rare use of financial penalties against those Member States that are slow to comply have sent out two negative political messages."
"Those States that do comply feel that there is no incentive to continue and those that do not comply do not feel any pressure to change their ways."
"It is therefore crucial for the Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties, to monitor the whole process of transposing and implementing Community law, publicising the commitment of all the Member States and guaranteeing that those States that do not comply will be penalised as an example."
"Mr President, as Mrs Jackson has so clearly illustrated, the picture which emerges from the analysis of the implementation of the three directives in question gives genuine cause for concern."
"Despite the fact that the measures differ quite widely, it appears that the majority of Member States have fallen a long way behind schedule in implementing them practically."
"And, quite apart from the technical considerations specific to each of the three directives, this is a serious situation which must lead us to reflect on the reasons behind it."
"I would like to highlight two aspects of the issue: on the one hand, in our countries, protection of the environment is hardly ever considered at the planning stage of the various sectorial policies but continues to be viewed as a series of actions to be carried out a posteriori in order to repair damage."
"On the other hand, precisely because of this retrospective approach, it is often felt that the directives are too costly to implement and that it would not serve any real purpose to do so."
"The error lies precisely in, when all is said and done, considering environmental investments to be an obligation which has been imposed, an additional cost which serves no purpose."
"But the environment is our future and we cannot rely solely on volunteers or fear of a sentence from the Court of Justice to protect it."
"I, too, am of the opinion that, since the Fifth Environmental Action Programme adopted a principally sectorial approach to environmental policy, it may be that, when discussing the sixth, we ought to place greater emphasis on the involvement of social and economic players such as local authorities in the achievement of the objectives, so that the safeguarding of our environment increasingly becomes an element to be integrated into the overall planning stage."
"In this context, it will be important, as we state in our motion for a resolution, to ensure extensive circulation of the best and worst results achieved by the Member States in the implementation of the environment directives. This could even take place via the Internet and would underline the difference in the commitment of each of the States in this matter and expose their behaviour to public opinion, which is almost always more effective than judgments of the Court of Justice."
"In order to facilitate the monitoring operation, but also comparison between the different situations, I feel that it is also even more important to continue to develop research on common indicators in the field of the environment."
"The protection of the environment crosses national borders and is a field of Community action par excellence."
"It is also for this reason, and even more so in the light of the now imminent enlargement to countries of Central and Eastern Europe, that we must not accept that the decisions adopted by ourselves and the 15 governments should then be disregarded."
"The natural world is a common legacy, and our commitment to pursuing goals must serve as an example to the candidate countries, who are in the throes of remedying often extremely serious incidents of deterioration."
"If this situation is to improve, each of us, as a representative of Community, national or local institutions but also simply as a citizen, must do our part."
"Mr President, my assistant, Vikki Phillips, has just handed me a note which says that Denmark spends 15 times more than Greece in carrying out environmental inspections and making appropriate assessments."
"Well, if that is the case, then something is clearly very wrong, and I suspect it is not wrong with Denmark."
"I am very pleased to support most of what the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment has said, although I have some trepidation in doing so being conscious that the next ECJ fine may well be against the UK for its failure to comply with the bathing water directive, despite the fact that a great deal of money has been spent and effort made in recent years to reach such compliance."
"I want to make it clear, though, that I do not believe that we should be using the failure of some Member States to achieve compliance with environmental legislation to justify weakening our ambitions or claiming that too much legislation is impractical."
"I am all for being realistic and for making sure that new legislation makes sense but the problems we face both throughout the European Union and across the world are too great for us to lower our sights."
"And I think some of the progress made by the United Kingdom in implementing the habitats directive over the past year demonstrates very clearly that it is very often not the fault of the legislation but the lack of political will which is to blame for the failure to deliver the goods we all wish to see."
"I want strongly to support the idea of a scoreboard which the Commissioner mentioned and of gestures to name and shame those Member States which are failing to meet the expectations of MEPs, of the Commission and of the public."
"As a politician, the Commissioner knows very well the importance of making sure that that information is presented in a way which is easily digestible and understood by every journalist across the European Union and perhaps a few politicians as well."
"So, let us call it the Commission's little red book, no, let us call it the Commission's big green book, albeit one with a few black spots on its pages."
"Let us name and shame at every opportunity and bring the public alongside us in ensuring that this environmental legislation is enforced and that Member States recognise their responsibilities."
"Mr President, Mrs Jackson well expressed the concern of the members of the Committee on the Environment, which in my case is heightened since I belong to the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions."
"Forty per cent of the petitions submitted to this committee come from citizens concerned for the preservation of the environment."
"And they usually refer to the habitats directive, the environmental impact directive, the wild birds directive and the right to information directive, which together with those discussed here today on nitrates and PCBs are probably the ones most often infringed."
"Mr Goodwill's report shows that there are some Member States before the courts, others with proceedings against them, and only two Member States that are above suspicion."
"Mr Sj√∂stedt too, in his report, mentions those Member States that have repeatedly infringed the habitats directive."
"The Committee on Petitions and I, myself, know that what often happens is that Member States either do not respond in time or, as we say in Spain, and I do not know if there is a good translation, they ""make the partridge dizzy"" [try to deceive one]."
"In addition, with the scant human resources of the Committee members, who are always having to answer the demands not only of the petitioners but also of the governments, it is very difficult to work, Commissioner."
"It is essential that we respect the legislation that we ourselves draw up, and the proof that there is a lack of political will is that some Member States obey it and others break it."
"This can give companies a competitive edge."
"In my opinion, there are three fundamental questions."
"First, something that has already been mentioned here: the deterrent use of European Funds;"
"European Funds must not be given to projects that break Community law."
"Secondly, suitable penalties must be found; it is very hard (I am from a region that badly needs European subsidies), but even if it is very hard to freeze certain subsidies, if it is not done the Member States will not understand."
"Lastly, Mr President, the process must be speeded up."
"But I know that this lies in the hands of the courts, this lies in the hands of the governments, this lies in the hands of us all."
"Mr President, the aim of these directives is to protect the environment."
"This means that not only do the Member States transpose the directives into national legislation, they are also the ones who actually implement this national legislation."
"This also means that when monitoring implementation, it should not be the means to an end, but the end itself, which should be looked at."
"Unfortunately, experience has shown that Member States often fail to implement European directives correctly."
"Consequently, campaigns, such as those designed to monitor compliance involving independent inspectorates, are essential."
"As far as the environmental inspections are concerned, the European Parliament has gone to great lengths to ensure that this is regulated effectively."
"However, negotiations have not led to the enactment of a binding directive, because the Council and Commission do not want that at this stage."
"Given this attitude of the Member States, I fear that in future, problems will arise at the implementation stage of other directives too."
"We need only call to mind the many warnings issued by the Commission to the Member States, which in some cases have led to infringement procedures."
"This can only get worse after enlargement, because the current Member States are setting the wrong example."
"Where there are differences in interpretation, the Commission should put forward amendment proposals for workable rules."
"These amendments are not intended for additional or more far-reaching measures, but should help improve the workability of the current rules."
"As far as the PCB [polychlorinated biphenol] directive is concerned, we should also turn our attention to the supplies."
"If these are to be maintained for much longer, it will be a rather long time before this directive makes itself felt."
"Mr President, allow me to start by agreeing with everything Mrs Jackson and many of my fellow Members have said and to focus on a number of points."
"As everyone has pointed out, we have the legislation."
"The problem lies in incorporating and applying this legislation."
"Of course, the political will must be there but it depends mainly on the monitoring carried out by your office, Commissioner."
"If, for example, you receive repeated complaints, instead of dealing with them through time-consuming correspondence, you should take a persistent and decisive stand and make sure the legislation really is implemented."
"And if we have cause to go to the European Court, then let us do so and, if sanctions need to be imposed, then we shall do that too."
"As Mrs Jackson has said, Greece is already paying EUR 20 000 a day and I trust that Greece will come to its senses and fall into line."
"I should particularly like to draw your attention to Directive 92/43 on Natura 2000 areas."
"We should not allow projects to go ahead in these areas with a light heart, because Article 6 of the directive says that only in the absence of alternative solutions should a project be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest in Natura 2000 areas."
"And here again I would remind you that in an area of Greece, in the area of Fthiotida, where everyone is against bridging the Maliako Gulf which, it should be noted the Ministry of the Environment and Public Works itself included in the Natura 2000 areas, your office has received complaints about the Greek Government's intention to build this bridge, which will have a huge environmental impact, even though alternative solutions exist."
"I shall be monitoring - and I welcome the undertaking which you took in your intervention and I hope that it is a real undertaking - what happens in all the areas in Europe which are Natura 2000 areas including, of course, the Maliako Gulf, where there are plans to build a bridge which will wipe out an important habitat."
"Mr President, first of all I must thank the Commissioner and the Chairman and other colleagues for their words of wisdom."
"They are very positive and clear commitments to do something about this very serious problem."
"But it is not just words we need, it is actions, it is deeds, and we cannot rely on Member States to do this alone."
"Even if representatives of the Council were here, which they do not appear to be, even if they were prepared to make statements, which they do not appear to be, we would not be able to leave them to do it on their own."
"We need some kind of watchdog to monitor and ensure the implementation of legislation."
"Sadly our own Environment Agency does not appear to be up to the job yet."
"We can but hope."
"So what solutions do we have?"
"What can Parliamentarians do?"
"Well, these three reports before Parliament today are a start."
"They name and shame."
"They call for fines."
"They make proposals for further improvement."
"But, they also make a point which we must take on board here in Parliament."
"They say essentially that bad legislation should never have been put on the statute book."
"And that is a lesson that we have to take to heart."
"Perhaps we have to start to think about doing less but better."
"We have talked about doing it but seemingly not done so yet."
"When we put better legislation on the agenda in future, it has to be respected."
"Because of the failure of Member States to put into place legislation, typically the PCBs and PCTs legislation, we now have the extremely serious problem of a long-term contamination of our food chain by a persistent toxic chemical."
"That toxic chemical is slowly but surely accumulating in the human food chain, reaching levels which are already beyond World Health Organisation levels in certain fatty substances, typically butter, and in some cases fatty fish, such as salmon."
"They are now creeping up the food chain to the point where our children are now starting to ingest amounts of these toxins that are beyond those that are recommended by the World Health Organisation."
"If we are not prepared to take serious action promptly in future we will see further problems of this kind affecting future generations."
"We owe it to those future generations to pursue this issue."
"Mr President, I share the opinion of Mrs Jackson and many other speakers who say that once legislation has been laid down, it should be implemented."
"I also agree with Mrs Jackson and her statement regarding the nitrates directive: ""that was flawed from the beginning""."
"It was poor legislation."
"How is it possible, if you want to maintain 50 milligrams of nitrate in groundwater, to apply the same stocking density per hectare across the entire European Union, from Finland to Italy?"
"Needless to say, the growth season in Finland is much shorter than in Italy, and so in Italy, as a general rule, more cattle units per hectare can be kept than in Finland."
"As far as I am concerned, every farmer can have as many cows as he chooses, as long as he does not exceed the 50 milligram limit."
"Turning now to measurements, how it is possible that the Commission has not issued any clear guidelines on how measurements are to be taken, the depth levels of these measurements, the number of times a year they should be taken, and how seasonal influences can be taken into consideration?"
"All these factors are still unknown and differ considerably from country to country and season to season."
"And if nitrate is measured, how is it determined that it originates from animal manure alone?"
"A great number of farmers use artificial fertiliser; how is that measured?"
"What is the impact of sewage leaks, for example?"
"What is the impact of major rivers discharging into other countries?"
"Animal manure cannot be the only cause of nitrate pollution, and it is completely unreasonable to tell farmers to restrict its use if we do not know the other causes."
"I share the view of all the speakers who say that we must adopt sound environmental policy."
"I do not dispute the standard of 50 milligrams of nitrate in groundwater, but I do want clear guidelines on how it should be measured and how these measurements should be carried out."
"Mr President, I have written the report on the follow-up to the habitats directive and have, in the meantime, obtained the clear impression that many Member States really did not appreciate what commitments they were taking on when they adopted the directive."
"They did not appreciate how far-reaching it really was."
"This is one of the most important explanations for why progress has been so slow."
"However, the fact that progress has been slow does not mean that nothing is happening."
"In actual fact, an incredible amount is happening in this area, albeit not as much as we should like."
"When the directive is called into question, it is important to remember that what is happening is important, even if progress is slow."
"I also believe that this is an explanation for why insufficient resources have been invested in information and in dialogue with those directly affected by these protected areas, something which also creates partly unnecessary conflicts in many areas."
"I believe there is a lot to be learned from this."
"Obviously, the Member States have prime responsibility, both financially and legally, but, for the EU' s part, it is important not only to legislate and to collect funds - good though these activities obviously are - but also to publicise the many good examples there are and to use its own financial resources to encourage sound development."
"The situation we have is incredibly serious, mainly because of the extremely rapid impoverishment of biodiversity."
"Nor can we see a reversal of this trend."
"The work must therefore continue and, in the present situation, the directive ought not to be changed or reviewed."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the fact that we as Parliament also fulfil our monitoring competences and that we take a look at directives which meet with a great deal of criticism in the Member States."
"Not only do they meet with a great deal of criticism in the Member States, they also cause enormous division in the European Parliament."
"I would like to comment on two directives today."
"These are the habitats directive and the nitrates directive."
"What do these two directives have in common?"
"The fact that the Member States have been granted far-reaching powers to designate nature reserves, species to be protected, and certainly as far as the nitrates directive is concerned, the sensitive areas."
"There are now an increasing number of complaints from members of the Dutch Lower Chamber of the States General who ask us what in God' s name we have been up to."
"However, it is not Europe which prescribed that the whole of the Netherlands should be designated a nitrate-sensitive area."
"It is the Netherlands itself which decided to do so."
"It is then up to us, with the kind help of a number of MEPs, to see how, by means of derogation requests, we can undo the nitrate legislation, for example, in order to reach the goal, this being a reduction in nitrate levels, in a decent fashion."
"The same applies to the habitats directive."
"Today' s tragedy, a cross-border industrial site between Aachen and Maastricht, has been brought to a standstill for the umpteenth time because of two European hamsters."
"These hamsters were spirited away by a campaign group for the protection and preservation of this species who believed that, if they abducted the hamsters, they could get them to mate."
"But forced mating is something which does not work, even in the animal kingdom."
"Once again, for the umpteenth time, the Council of State in the Netherlands brought a cross-border industrial site to a standstill."
"However, having scrutinised the habitats directive and having correctly interpreted the regulation on areas where preservation is required, we see that this measure was unnecessary."
"What should happen now, and that is why I support the report on the habitats directive, and most certainly the nitrates directive, is for the European Commission to make it quite clear - and perhaps lay down in writing in clear Dutch language - what is and is not possible."
"We agree on the principles, they are sound, but the way in which the Member States deal with them is disgraceful by any standard."
"Mr President, poor compliance with environmental legislation is a huge problem."
"As co-legislator, it is important for us to speak our minds, but we should not pass the blame to the Member States too readily."
"We must also consider the quality and nature of the legislation we produce."
"The Union is growing ever bigger and more diverse."
"We must therefore lay down rules which can thrive in the different national cultures."
"That is why I think we should prescribe less detail."
"We must be very precise in the results we want, but not in the way in which the results must be achieved."
"For that reason, I believe we should stand by the result, a maximum of 50 milligrams, in the nitrates directive. We do accept a certain degree of flexibility with regard to the method by which the result is achieved."
"An example of sound legislation is the habitats directive."
"The environment is a common legacy; environmental protection a common task."
"It makes no sense to protect birds in one country if they are being shot down across the border in another country."
"The habitats directive prescribes a clear goal."
"The way in which it is to be achieved is quite flexible."
"The directive is not detailed, but provides a framework which allows latitude for weighing up local or regional interests, and that is exactly how we need to move forward."
"As long as the result - caring for the protected species and their habitats - remains paramount."
"Needless to say, there are many conflicts in villages and provinces with regard to the directive' s application."
"There are instances of incorrect application."
"It would be useful and necessary to provide clear information, but I am taken aback by the large number of MEPs who have requested a review of the bird and habitats directive in order to work out in further detail certain concepts in the habitats directive."
"The significant implications of this would then be compensation and major public interest."
"The very strength of the habitats directive lies in its flexibility."
"The directive stands for a modern way of protecting the environment."
"It is not about putting up fences around the environment, but about dealing with the species and natural resources in a conscientious manner."
"Accordingly, I regret that some MEPs are adding to the chaos by suggesting in an amendment that the existing infrastructure should disappear, or that major new projects are not viable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was delighted to find this topic on the agenda today."
"I would like to thank Mrs Jackson for raising the question."
"Although you refer to three specific EU directives, I would point out that what we are talking about here is a widespread problem with the transposition of EU legislation in the Member States."
"If you start from the principle that directives and regulations are adopted by the Council and Parliament in the EU, then it is quite reasonable to assume that the Council - which does, after all, use these directives - will transpose them in the Member States accordingly."
"But what do we see happening?"
"Two camps are forming."
"On one side there is the European Union, which seeks to blame the Member States for shortcomings."
"On the other side, there are the Member States, which are more than willing to offload their problems onto the oh-so-distant Europe, forgetting in the process that they are part of Europe themselves, and the Commission is piggy-in-the-middle."
"Commissioner, you have gone to great lengths to try and ensure that these laws are transposed in the European Union in a purposeful manner."
"But it really is not that simple and, of course, we have criticised your methods sometimes."
"I can understand to an extent, why you took the line you did."
"There are various reasons as to why countries have trouble transposing this legislation."
"In my opinion, one of the reasons in the case of the nitrates directive is the failure to observe scientific findings, because one thing is for sure, it is not possible to reduce nitrate levels as rapidly as we demand."
"Nature simply will not allow it."
"However, in the case of the habitats directive, Parliament highlighted the shortcomings quite clearly last year, namely that the directive was complicated and unclear in parts and so it cannot be transposed in the Member States."
"When we were in Toulouse, we saw how local people are trying to transpose it."
"But basically, they do not know what is going on."
"They do not know where the boundaries are, or how to apply them properly."
"These are shortcomings that must be reviewed as a matter of priority."
"But it is also our responsibility to ensure that the directives are less utopian and far more realistic in nature."
"Mrs Jackson's question actually contains all the points we need to address and there is nothing more to add to it."
"Speedier sanctions and careful drafting of laws will enable us to solve this problem."
"However, I would just like to point out that something needs to change in the Member States too, because the Environment Ministers are, no doubt, sometimes too cowardly to promote the initiatives they adopt here, in their own countries, if this could lead to conflict."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Jackson and the rapporteurs for the three reports we are debating today."
"Effective implementation of the EU' s environment directives in the Member States is naturally of great significance in two ways: firstly, in terms of environmental protection - which is, of course, the whole purpose of the directives - but also in terms of our not causing confidence to be lost in EU legislative work through the Member States' being able for a long time to get away with not implementing the legislation which they themselves have helped bring about in the Council of Ministers."
"That is why I think that the three reports concerning the Member States' failure to implement EU legislation are important."
"The Council has, of course, been rather irritated about the fact that Parliament is looking over its shoulders, but I think that the work on the reports has revealed how slack the majority of the Member States are about implementing EU legislation."
"They have also revealed how slow the Commission' s and the Court of Justice' s reactions are when it comes to inadequate implementation."
"We often, of course, hear fine speeches about grand European visions and the Europe of the future, sometimes from Members of this Parliament."
"We also hear this kind of thing from many governments, but it often, of course, disguises the fact that narrow national interests are being cultivated instead of the common interests we have worked for in the course of the legislative work."
"It is also interesting to note that those countries which are often regarded as rather reluctant and critical in relation to certain aspects of EU cooperation are in reality those countries which comply best with EU decisions."
"In all modesty, I am thinking, for example, of the Nordic countries."
"I was pleased to hear Mrs Wallstr√∂m' s remarks on the reports."
"I am sure that Mrs Wallstr√∂m has the will to ensure that the legislation is of a sufficiently high quality to be implemented and to ensure that it is effectively followed up."
"I think, at any rate, that Parliament ought to provide as much support as possible for this work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Jackson's question illustrates the fact that the best laws in the world are no use whatsoever unless they are applied correctly and, more importantly, properly controlled."
"For example, the Member States have not transposed the habitats directive into national legislation."
"The same applies to a great deal of other legislation."
"And this is legislation which we need for the future."
"The Commission is responsible for transposition and for checking what sort of on-site controls have been carried out."
"In doing so it, in turn, must rely on information supplied to it by the Member States."
"I get the impression that monitoring is no easy task and if the Commission is to perform this task it needs information and data and reports to be sent in."
"The complaint was often voiced in the past that the Commission did not have enough staff and resources to evaluate the data sent in for control purposes."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission if it now has sufficient resources."
"Mind you, Parliament cannot talk, because we are constantly calling for reports."
"I know that the Commission is very busy receiving and processing reports and that this sometimes ties up Commission capacities and resources unnecessarily."
"In other words, we all have to think where we can make improvements."
"I think the Commission should react more quickly, both towards the Member States and in instituting the necessary proceedings before the ECJ and setting fines."
"At the same time, I call on the Member States to honour their obligations to transpose and control legislation and report to the Commission properly."
"I am the person responsible in our group for the water framework directive and the rapporteur for the groundwater action programme, which is still pending, and the nitrates directive is therefore a matter of particular concern to me."
"On Tuesday, i.e. tomorrow, we shall be voting on the Goodwill report, to which I have proposed a number of amendments."
"I should like to ask the House to accept these proposed amendments, because what we are trying to do here is to give the Member States more responsibility."
"I should therefore be grateful for your support."
"Finally, I should like to mention one more point, namely the candidate countries."
"We require candidate countries to adopt European legislation."
"But when the Member States themselves fail to abide by it and the European Commission is unable to take decisive action, then everything starts to go pear-shaped."
"For this reason alone and, most importantly, in order to protect human health and the environment, all those responsible need to radically rethink the matter post-haste and these reports make that clear."
"Mr President, what a relief that no speaker so far has called for the environmental directives to be watered down."
"Mr Sj√∂stedt, it is nothing to with the poor Member States not knowing what they were letting themselves in for."
"And right now they know full well that they are simply and deliberately contravening European legislation."
"They are stalling for time and they know perfectly well that nothing will happen to them, because it takes so long for the Court to do anything."
"What we have here is the deliberate flouting of European legislation and neither Parliament nor the Council should stand for it."
"Some members are saying that we should name and shame."
"I can name and shame myself because Austria is one of the countries which has failed to comply with the habitats directive, but I must also protest, Commissioner, because Austria has not been at all remiss as far as the PCB directive is concerned."
"We did everything here which needed to be done even before there was a European directive."
"We passed a Waste Law back in 1990 and an ordinance banning halogenated substances in 1993."
"We are being accused unfairly here."
"As far as the nitrates directive is concerned, Austria has now rectified its shortcomings, but we know only too well that the Member States had terrible trouble transposing the nitrates directive."
"The main problem here was that, because of the extremely high density of livestock in many parts of the Union, keeping to within the limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare of farmland caused immense difficulties with the production of farm manure in several countries."
"Perhaps such a high density of livestock will be less of a problem in the future, because cows, those pained and tormented creatures, are fighting back."
"The form of BSE which currently confronts us may well be a sort of revenge on the part of these tormented animals."
"We should take a lesson from nature and conduct ourselves properly and comply with the laws which we ourselves have passed."
"Mr President, the drinking-water directive, waste-management directive, major accident hazards, sewage sludge, asbestos, wild birds, waste shipment, not to mention the habitats directive, the nitrates directive and the PCB directive."
"The list is long, the list of the failure of my own country to transpose EU environmental law."
"Despite warning letters, reasoned opinions, threats of legal action to the European Court of Justice, so it embarrassingly continues."
"We are second worst in terms of transposition and designation of sites under the habitats directive."
"Sometimes, but rarely, there can be genuine reasons for delayed transposition of a directive and the nitrates directive has come in for particular mention in this regard here today."
"But to fail to provide information requested by the Commission under Article 10 of the Treaty in a timely and proper manner is inexcusable."
"That is the first step: reply to the letters of the Commission."
"No government should be forgiven bad manners and inappropriate behaviour."
"That is one of Ireland's and, I suspect, many countries' cardinal sins in relation to the area we are discussing."
"Article 10 requires Member States to actively cooperate with the Commission in dealing with complaints, to clarify facts and to state official positions."
"Only last weekend I read in the Irish media that the head of the Commission's Environment DG, Mr Curry, complained to Ireland's EU Ambassador, Mr Denis O'Leary, last autumn that the Irish authorities were not cooperating adequately with Brussels on environmental issues."
"Commissioner Wallstr√∂m wrote last March to the Irish Minister of the Environment, Mr Dempsey, suggesting that the large number of Irish environmental complaints currently being dealt with by the EU officials be dealt with in his department or by the Irish Ombudsman."
"No joy, no progress, perhaps even no response - I do not know."
"With 1% of the Community's population, to our shame we in Ireland have been generating 10% of the Commission's environmental complaints."
"Mr Curry had strong words for not only our Department of the Environment but also our Department of Finances policies, our Environmental Protection Agency, our Heritage Protection Agency and, indeed, our local authorities."
"Sensitive and sensible implementation must be encouraged to ensure political and public cooperation and understanding of what we have to achieve."
"I often give the example - as I did at a committee meeting this morning - of the survival of the only cotton-weed colony in Ireland in the south-east corner of Wexford."
"This is on a local pilgrimage path."
"In its over-zealousness to protect the cotton-weed, the local council decided to ban the pilgrimage from the immediate area."
"It very quickly became apparent that the trampling of the pilgrims' feet and not divine intervention had, in fact, been essential to protect that particular ecosystem."
"Stronger and more vigorous species, better known colloquially as 'weeds' - even though they are all wild flowers - gained a foothold in the colony and began to choke off the cotton-weed once human intervention was gone."
"Changing the essential balance between human activity and our environment led to the loss of this precious ecosystem."
"Finally, it must not be a case of the last person off the island turning the lights off."
"We have to live and earn a living in these places."
"Equally we cannot continue to mortgage our children's health and heritage."
"Mr President, I should like again to thank all the Members of the European Parliament for their statements."
"I could not agree more with most of what you have said, except for any accusation of complacency."
"May I remind you that, as of today, 45% of all the complaints are on environmental issues and cases - 700 complaints, 30% of the infringements - about 400 - are on environmental cases."
"So there is a heavy burden on us and we are trying to do our best but also look to the future."
"That is why I am saying that we also have to look out for new instruments and ways to do more."
"Mr Sacconi's point was that we need the good examples of what economic gains can be made from complying with environmental legislation."
"We could do more on that."
"We could do more with the use of indicators because we have to measure."
"We have to be better at assessing the results of compliance with environmental legislation."
"We are most effective when we have a good and effective interplay between the institutions, while not denying the fact that Member States are responsible."
"They have to give us answers and provide us with information."
"We do not have the means to send people to all the Member States to check."
"We cannot do that unless you give me another 500 people."
"What we have to do is modernise legislation."
"It has been said that we need less but better legislative proposals."
"I agree with that."
"The easiest way is the limit-value approach, to say 50 mgs of nitrates for example in drinking water."
"But this cannot apply in other far-reaching directives of a broader scope, such as the habitats directive."
"It is no coincidence that the habitats and nitrates directives are chosen as examples of bad compliance because they are very far-reaching."
"They are ambitious directives and in some cases it means the Member States need to review fully their agricultural practices."
"We know this from some of the Member States."
"This should not be taken as an excuse, but an explanation of why these directives are cited for lack of implementation."
"I totally agree with Mr Sj√∂stedt that it is not because these directives are not good or ambitious enough."
"They are far-reaching and there are consequences for the Member States which they perhaps did not realise when the decisions were taken."
"We must not give in now, we have to carry on because we will finally start to see results."
"What we have done, which is very effective, is to establish the link between European funding and compliance with environment legislation."
"We have to draw on that."
"We can do more on education and information."
"We have started activities like this. We use our experts to go to Member States or to carry out seminars to teach the Member States how to best implement it."
"We try to use all these available instruments to improve implementation."
"In an enlarged and more diverse Union, clear and legally binding targets, as well as education and methods for measuring, monitoring and calculating results, become more and more important."
"I hope for the European Parliament's support and backing in our further attempts to improve the implementation of our European Community environmental legislation."
"I have received a motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"Young farmers in the Union"
"The next item is the report (A5-0357/2000) tabled by Mr Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union [2000/2011(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to present to you today the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development' s own-initiative report on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union."
"Twenty years ago, I, myself, was a member of my local young farmers' organisation in the county of Somerset in England."
"Even in those days it was not easy for young farmers to carry on the family farm or get started in the industry."
"Today the situation has become even more difficult, and we are witnessing a big drop in the number of young farmers coming into the industry."
"We have reached a point where it has become vital to take action in order to stop this decline."
"Not only for the sake of agriculture itself, but also to safeguard existing structures in our countryside."
"The last thing that we want to see is a depopulated countryside where the green and pleasant landscape which we take for granted will not be looked after properly any longer."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European organisation CEJA for its help and cooperation in enabling me to produce this report."
"I was given the opportunity to visit young farmers in five Member States which gave me a better and wider understanding of the practical ways in which young farmers could be helped in the industry."
"I would further like to thank Commissioner Fischler for his backing and I would also welcome the draft opinion on the report produced by the Committee of the Regions because it is going to do a report on young farmers."
"Last but not least, I would like to express my thanks to Ross Gordon Consultants who produced an excellent study on the situation of young farmers in the European Union last year and whose publication has been of great help in producing today's report."
"The report puts forward a series of ideas and ways of assisting young farmers starting up or carrying on in their businesses."
"I have, however, tried not to reinvent the wheel."
"Basically I would like to see the introduction of a guaranteed standard level of assistance for young farmers throughout the European Union."
"I am fully aware that it is not an easy task to come up with one solution covering all the different conditions facing young farmers in their respective countries in a Community of 15 Member States."
"To name just two examples: land values can vary from EUR 12 000 per hectare to EUR 15 000 per hectare."
"Levels of taxation vary greatly with some Member States imposing considerable inheritance tax which renders the survival of young farmers very difficult, especially where land values are very high."
"I do not have the time to go through all the recommendations made in the report, but I will list some of the measures which should be given priority: the continuation of start-up grants of up to EUR 40 000, in combination with subsidised interest rates for start-up capital of up to EUR 120 000 for eight years."
"Two of the major difficulties encountered by young farmers are the raising of start-up capital and subsequently the danger of overstretching their financial abilities by providing regular interest payments."
"We are living in a computer age."
"Access to education and training needs to be further encouraged in order to allow young farmers to take full advantage of the potential advantages offered by modern communication technology and business operation techniques."
"The changing face of agriculture, increasingly determined by global WTO agreements, means that agriculture will continue to change."
"It is in our best interests that young farmers are well prepared to anticipate and to manage these future challenges."
"Food safety measures and production methods are being thoroughly analysed these days."
"There is greater emphasis on organic production throughout Europe."
"Here again, young farmers must be placed in a position which will allow them to embrace a new upcoming culture and to be aware of the benefits attached to maintaining consumer confidence and support for agricultural products."
"There is tremendous scope for innovative and creative local high-quality production."
"The European agricultural industry is going through a difficult economic period with a great deal of restructuring going on at the same time."
"There is a great need to assist some of the older farmers to retire in dignity."
"In this context, I would very much like see a retirement package for existing farmers linked to bringing in young farmers to carry on the industry."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler to recommend to Member States that they introduce such a policy throughout the EU."
"We are seeing the average age of the farming Community increase with falling numbers of young farmers."
"This trend must be reversed."
"Young farmers need greater access to production rights."
"It is not easy to balance the delivery of additional production rights to young farmers if they have to be taken away from existing farmers who themselves are already facing financial difficulties."
"When, in future, production rights are changed, I would like to ask the Commission to take into greater account the need to increase the amount of extra production which is given to young farmers."
"With the emphasis in the CAP on giving increasing importance to rural development schemes, it is crucial to recognise the young farmers as the key players and main executives responsible for the implementation of such new rural redevelopment policies."
"With the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, I would strongly advise the applicant Member States to start creating supportive measures for their young farmers already at present, especially in view of the introduction of production controls required by the Commission."
"In many parts of the world, share farming is a common practice."
"I would like to ask the Commission to investigate the possibilities for developing share farming within the common agricultural policy."
"As I have already mentioned, this report is an own initiative report of the Committee on Agriculture, and I hope all parties will be able to sign up for this report and make sure positive practical help is given young farmers in the future."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Fischler once more for his support and also ask him to introduce an audit to be carried out every two years on the availability and success of measures put in place to support young farmers."
"It is very important that we do not just pay great lip service to helping young farmers, but actually deliver policies within the common agricultural policy that increase the number of young farmers coming into the industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, in particular its rapporteur, Mr Parish, on the timely initiative to bring the debate on this issue to the European institutions."
"It is 32 years since Sicco Mansholt, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture from the time the Commission was formed until 1972, presented his draft reform of the common agricultural policy, the Mansholt Plan."
"It is my view that the European institutions have not paid sufficient tribute to this great figure in European politics."
"I still read this classic work today and I still find that it contains many of the answers we need to the problems faced by young farmers, which are accurately described in Mr Parish' s report."
"We have created a major common policy based on support payments per hectare, per animal or even according to production achieved; we have limited production rights and established quotas; we have imposed complex mechanisms for standardising production and we have created intricate systems intervening in international markets."
"The results have been varied, with some positive aspects but with many other negative aspects."
"Amongst the latter, I would highlight the effect this policy has had in creating major problems for young people wishing to establish themselves in farming."
"The bold study drawn up on this issue by Parliament confirms that land is still the major investment for European farmers. The study also shows difficulty of access to land to be the main problem facing young farmers."
"According to this study, for each percentage point increase in subsidies for wheat crops, the price of land goes up by 0.4%."
"This effect is significantly magnified by quota systems and by production-limiting schemes."
"We cannot, therefore, contemplate the need to protect and support the modernisation and reinvigoration of agriculture unless we consider changes that could be made to the current CAP."
"The alternative to this model of agricultural policy will necessarily require a policy focused on farmers and their incomes and not on the produce, the land or the livestock by means of which the income is obtained."
"It will require an agricultural policy that is defined in regional rather than sectoral terms and will require priority for the environment, rural development, vocational training and early retirement."
"To conclude, I should like to suggest to Mr Parish and to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that this report should not be seen as a finishing line but rather as a point of departure for a thorough study into overhauling agriculture and reforming the common agricultural policy with the specific participation of young farmers' associations."
"Revisiting the Mansholt Plan would be a good place to start."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the European Liberal Democrats I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"Many thanks indeed go to him, then."
"In this short speech I would like to focus attention on a couple of points."
"The report takes excellent account of the problems of young farmers. Social problems are dealt with particularly well."
"This is to be welcomed, because it is young men who are mostly keener to continue farming than young women are."
"The problem that has come about is what is referred to as the hundred-hectare solitude factor."
"In agriculture we need sustainability, especially with regard to change-of-generation factors."
"The average age of European farmers is worryingly high."
"It must be financially feasible to sustain the change-of-generation system."
"Young people must be induced to start farming."
"There are not enough young starters, however."
"It would be very important if we could get young people to continue in a profession that is important to us all."
"Young farmers are very skilled and are not prejudiced about using modern technology in their work in the fields and in rearing cattle."
"Similarly, they can make use of the latest information technology in their planning."
"We are on the threshold of great change, which the rapporteur brought to our attention here, and it is the young, if anyone, who are best equipped to lead us through this revolution, which we will inevitably have to face within a few years."
"The conclusions and measures proposed in the report are largely matters that have to be decided upon nationally, and this is good for flexibility."
"The EU can and must promote policies that work as incentives for the young."
"Bureaucracy must not become a barrier to improving the position of young farmers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I should like to give Mr Parish my thanks, congratulations and support for his report."
"In these times when the younger generation can see that the quality of life is no longer closely linked to industrialisation and cities and large commercial centres, we have the obligation in the Union to encourage and help the younger generation to take over from the older so that the cycle of life and people in agriculture may be completed by means of new Community initiatives that have the young farmer as their priority objective."
"We must put into practice the principles and actions proposed in this own-initiative report so as to make rural life more attractive to young people, thus preventing depopulation of the countryside."
"This social group is the future basis of the Common Agricultural Policy; we have to increase installation aids and supplementary investment grants for this group, particularly in those structurally less-favoured areas where abandoned holdings and deserted villages are common, where young people can revive the rural economy."
"All this will be thanks to the development of new products of regional interest, such as agro-tourism and rural tourism, or through repopulating these natural spaces with animal and plant species, contributing to the sustainable and lasting development of the area."
"Mr President, the first part of the motion for a resolution in the report repeats the now familiar findings on the poor situation and prospects of young farmers in the European Union."
"However, no mention is made of why this should be so, given that the previous two Community support schemes promoted two programmes for the benefit of young farmers, which the European Union vaunted as a panacea which would solve all the problems faced by young farmers and reverse the negative trend."
"This conscious omission runs throughout the resolution, which fails to mention three basic factors which, unless they are dealt with, will render the third Community programme for young farmers equally ineffectual."
"These factors are, first, that the CAP, especially in its post-1992 form and following Agenda 2000, does not safeguard a viable income for most small or medium-sized farming households, or a survival income for the heads of these households, which is why no one wants to invest anything at all in the farming sector, however many grants there may be - not that there are that many - because not only is it unprofitable, it does not even afford a basic income."
"Secondly, there is usually nobody to apply the incentives to; in other words, because of the quotas, young farmers have no reason to work, given that the quotas have been used up for all the products and they must wait for a national stock to be created and distributed to young farmers or buy quotas, in which case, good luck to them."
"Thirdly, however high the incentives, the terms and conditions are such that they are more suited to large farmers and exclude small and medium-sized farmers."
"The requirement for very large cultivated areas, even in island regions, is a typical example."
"This requirement becomes prohibitive when combined with quotas."
"In other words, the Community requires young farmers to have a large farm and large-scale production, but nigh prevents them from producing anything with the quota system."
"This incongruous situation is not, in my view, an inadvertent, random choice by the European Union."
"It is deliberate policy, the purpose being to ruin poor, medium-sized farmers and support large farms or rather large companies in the agricultural sector."
"That is why we cannot vote in favour of this report; it is because it conceals the real reasons."
"Even these grants, when they are given to poor, medium-sized farmers, are meted out in drips and drabs and Greece is a typical example here."
"I do not know, for example, if Mr Fischler is aware of the fact that our grants for young farmers have still not been received, despite the fact that the government used this type of argument to saturation point in order to win votes last April."
"Mr President, I want to commence by complimenting the rapporteur on his very well-researched and objective report which I and my group have no difficulty in supporting."
"In the context of Agenda 2000, very credible efforts were made to deal with the serious problem of succession in European agriculture."
"A re-vamped farm retirement scheme, installation aid and other measures may not, however, achieve our desired objective and in my view the problem must be revisited as a matter of urgency, otherwise the continuity of family farming will be put at serious risk."
"Apart from the seriously upsetting and devastating consequences of BSE, which I believe will be overcome, the real problem for young people who in normal circumstances would take up farming as a career is the availability, welcome though it is, of alternative and certainly more financially rewarding employment."
"Farmers and non-farmers must face this reality and do so before it is too late."
"Farming as a profession has the onerous responsibility of guaranteeing our citizens food security and quality, and we must act to safeguard the productive base of European agriculture by ensuring that young people with the ethos of farming in their blood are appropriately encouraged and compensated."
"I realise that many small farms do not have the capacity to generate sufficient income for their owners because of scale and enterprise."
"I believe we must do more to assist those interested in a restructuring programme - and the rapporteur made reference to it in his report - through the pooling of land and human resources, which would lead to greater efficiency and improved competitiveness."
"Likewise, the opportunity of rural development and new technology in terms of creating farm and part-time employment for both women and men must, in every case, be vigorously pursued."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we realise that 55% of European farmers are over 55 years old and only 23% are less than 44 years old, we must inevitably conclude that the future of farming in the European Union is under threat."
"The situation is even more serious in my own country, where these figures are 66% and 15% respectively."
"In the mid-1980s, the CAP began changing in order to improve measures for direct control of production with the aim of preventing surpluses and guaranteeing the stability of prices and incomes."
"However, the other side of the coin as regards opting for stability in this way has been less flexibility in access to farming, which particularly penalises young farmers, first of all because of the difficulty in gaining access to quotas, production or premium rights. Secondly, young farmers are penalised as a result of increases in land prices due to the increase in value created by the quota systems."
"Furthermore, it is well known that many Member States have not implemented measures that in any way address the concerns of young farmers."
"I shall give the example of my own country where, after an initial phase of enthusiasm when we joined the EU, in recent years we have become more sceptical and the activities of the organisations most representative of young farmers have even been penalised."
"For this reason we must, as a matter of urgency, adopt certain fundamental measures which are, in fact, in line with the rapporteur' s proposals."
"These are, specifically, to create special reserves for quotas and production rights solely for young farmers, to increase support for setting up a first farm and investment in farm properties, to establish a special scheme for low-interest loans to supplement other investment aid, to establish conditions for the proper functioning of an early retirement scheme for older farmers, which will speed up the process of renewal and, of course, to adopt training and information measures."
"The Commission must now urgently table proposals for measures for action and the Council must adopt them."
"Unless this happens, we will be taking an irresponsible attitude that will put the continuity of farming in Europe, with all that this means for our culture, at risk."
"To conclude, I wish to thank Neil Parish for his outstanding work on this report."
"Mr President, the report deals with a most difficult subject: the prospects for young people in the farming industry, as the rapporteur has indicated, are probably worse than at any time since the creation of the CAP and their prospects cannot be separated from those of the industry as a whole or from the prosperity of the rural communities."
"One measure of the complexity of the situation can be found in the courses which are now offered at agricultural colleges."
"At the two colleges in my region the number of courses relating to farming has now fallen to 40% in one case, and the remaining 60% of the courses relate to horses and small animals."
"Significantly, 70% of the students, however, come from farming families, so there is still that link."
"The report spells out that there is a strong case for measures to encourage new entrants to the industry and for achieving a much greater degree of standardisation across the European Union, and the issue, as the rapporteur mentioned, was well dealt with in the excellent STOA report at the beginning of last year."
"There are many good examples in that document of the valuable background material which we were able to use during discussions in committee."
"Now that the rural development programme is in place it is important to examine how this programme can be used to strengthen training and re-training facilities in our agricultural colleges."
"I would emphasise the need for training in farm diversification, including low-volume products for niche markets, and cooperative marketing techniques where, by coming together, individual farms can seek to match the commercial bargaining strength of the supermarket chains."
"I would also wish to see such courses paying special attention to the needs of the smaller farm where new entrants are most likely to be found."
"I hope that the Commission and the national governments will take note of the many excellent suggestions in this report and thus give a boost to the future prosperity of farming in the rural areas."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate my fellow MEP, Mr Parish, on an extremely good report."
"I want to focus upon the small number of young people going into farming in recent years and, at the same time, the unduly large number of people who are also leaving it, because, if young people do not come into the industry, there will come a time when agriculture no longer exists."
"I think that the image of farming - due to the many outbreaks of disease, dioxin scandals etc - is, at the moment, one of the really major problems. It puts the whole industry in a negative light and seems unfair to the many farming families who would, of course, get top marks for the way they look after their farms."
"It is undoubtedly very important that there should be transparency and that people should be made more aware of production methods and of the modern stalls and cowsheds that now exist, as well as being given information about the common agricultural policy and about the ways in which fields and animals are looked after."
"Efforts must be concentrated on providing support - moral, educational and financial."
"No one has in recent years questioned the many millions of euros we pump into training lawyers, engineers and doctors."
"There is a clear parallel with young farmers who, of course, are responsible for the land and the animals we have and, especially, the food we eat."
"Mr President, I also commend Mr Parish for his hard work and the excellent report."
"In the brief time I have I wish to stress that one of the greatest difficulties facing young farmers entering the business today is capital and cash-flow problems in the first year of operation."
"I am backing this proposal because young people must be given the opportunity to come into the industry on a sound financial footing."
"After all, young farmers hold the key to the future of all our rural communities."
"The lack of young people entering the agricultural industry in the UK is a very worrying problem."
"Statistics show that in Ireland 14.8% of farm owners are under 35, in France the figure is 13.2%, but in the UK it is a mere 6.8%."
"I stress that farms are also important employers in our rural communities."
"Employment protects our countryside, it keeps our post offices, schools and services open there."
"Farming and the viability of farming is the life blood of the future of our rural communities as we know them."
"If all small businesses - which includes farmers - were to employ just one more person each, then the whole unemployment situation throughout the European Union would be solved overnight."
"Of all the European Union countries, only the UK and the Netherlands do not operate a specific aid scheme for young farmers."
"European rural development regulations allow a grant of EUR 16 500 to be made available for people under 40 years of age to establish themselves in a viable farm holding."
"Yet the Labour government in the UK has not taken advantage of this excellent scheme."
"I therefore fully support making installation aids mandatory across the European Union."
"The farming industry needs young blood in order to inject a new vibrancy into an industry which at present is aged and disillusioned."
"Young farmers are the future of the farming industry and vital components in urban communities."
"I thank Mr Parish for his report and wish his report all the best to ensure that we can follow up these important decisions taken by him in a specific and constructive manner."
"Mr President, there has been endless discussion of the role of young people in agriculture, but even today their situation gives little cause for optimism."
"It is no coincidence that, after the launching of Agenda 2000, in the current phase of WTO renegotiations and with the now imminent prospect of enlargement, we are still here today debating the future of young farmers, of those young people who, in so many countries in Europe, are placing bets on whether they will be able to remain within the agricultural sector for good."
"How can we help them?"
"One of the best solutions can only be to revoke the measures laid down by the CAP."
"It is time to evaluate carefully how the distribution of contributions - as, by definition, income support - reaches undertakings able to compete on the global market."
"This would make it possible to direct the finances towards a vision which is more targeted towards lowering general costs, encouraging the formation of consortia."
"We could also work on the joint farming of lands; after all, this is the change which will mark the evolution of farming."
"From this point of view, it is then essential to stipulate that incentives should be provided in the form of reductions in the relevant interest rates for investments made by young farmers."
"In this way, we would be implementing the provisions of Regulation 1257 of 1999, which encourages the combining of several actions when they are aimed at bringing about greater use of the resources provided by development plans for rural areas."
"I feel that, if this debate were to send out these sorts of signals, we would be able genuinely to start building the framework for a new European agriculture structure based on young people which, most importantly, would certainly not mean abandoning and forgetting those who are seeking possible alternatives in the new environmental and multifunctionality opportunities."
"I would like to thank Mr Parish for his excellent work."
"Mr President, the Parish report provides a rigorous analysis of an essential issue for the European Community and for those who wish to join the Union."
"Young farmers do indeed need urgent attention."
"First, because we must support our young people in all areas of activity, and secondly because it is in our interests to keep the rural population, most of whom are connected with agricultural activities, in the countryside."
"In approaching this issue, we have to appraise elements that lie at the roots of our social structure, our territorial organisation, our economy, our culture and our civilisation itself."
"Many of the problems that affect these farmers are substantially concerned with one of the bases of the dominant economic model in Europe; private land ownership and the forms of land transfer."
"This report contains an appeal for institutional action benefiting a specific group and also for the implementation of concrete measures to give rural land ownership a meaningful social function."
"In this context, the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport seems to me highly appropriate when it states that young farmers are not a very homogeneous group."
"A distinction must be drawn between students at agricultural schools and colleges, young people who wish to set up in rural areas as an alternative to the urban environment, and the children of farmers."
"Even within this last group I would distinguish between those who are the children of farmers who work on the land and those who are descendants of farmers who, from the size of their holdings, are really agricultural businessmen."
"While accepting that measures should be taken to reduce charges on inheriting property, I would highlight other actions also mentioned in the Parish report to help make holdings viable, which are based on socio-economic formulas."
"I should like to stress another aspect of the report: we must try to ensure that when our future co-Members of the Union incorporate the acquis communautaire they do not bring in hidden habits that hinder the development of the rural environment in their countries."
"The change from collectivised farming economies to situations that can be merged with the Community situation may trigger off speculative processes that will artificially raise market prices for land and thus increase young farmers' difficulties in setting up or keeping themselves in the countryside."
"This report, Mr President, will certainly be important in so far as we can also disseminate it in our own countries, in the candidate countries, and in particular in the sector it specifically addresses."
"Mr President, there is indeed a crisis of succession in farming as Mr Parish with his expertise as a farmer knows well."
"If this crisis is particularly acute in Mr Parish's own Member State, it is the direct result of policies pursued by UK governments over the past twenty years, and to overcome it the United Kingdom must review the implications of the Fontainbleau Agreement for its contribution to European Union finances."
"This has been disastrous for farming."
"Moreover, the rapporteur, a member of the Conservative Party, must work within his own party to secure support for his proposals in the House of Commons."
"In countries where less than 10% of the population now lives in rural areas, it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas, and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Neil Parish on the fact that he has produced a report which is based on the farmers' reality, the reality in rural areas, and not on the view from Brussels."
"This in itself constitutes a valuable contribution to agricultural policy."
"But if we now examine the situation, we could ask ourselves whether there are any young people left out there who are mad enough to become farmers in the European Union."
"What we need is people who want to take up the challenge of producing an outstanding achievement, five-legged sheep as it were, but not obtained through genetic modification."
"They seem to be fighting a losing battle, if we consider the adversities which young farmers face, as well as the achievements they are expected to deliver."
"To quote just one example - and I am just considering my own country for a moment - dairy farming is a sector where absolutely everything is being scrutinised, from the blade of grass right up to the moment that the milk hits the supermarkets."
"I cannot help drawing a comparison with arable farmers and horticulturalists who have been required to keep tabs on the implications of their actions on the environment and consumer front for a long time, and do so with great enthusiasm."
"At the same time, we have to say that in many European countries the requirements for animal welfare are among the world' s most stringent."
"So whoever wants to become a farmer in Europe must outstrip their counterparts elsewhere in the world."
"They need to give the landscape and cultural conditions due consideration."
"They must apply the strictest consumer conditions, supply a wide range of products, both regionally and in terms of quality, make animal welfare a top priority and be responsible for the product, even once it has left the farm."
"This is what we call social enterprising as a top-level sport."
"It requires entrepreneurship, a love of nature and the environment, social orientation and perseverance."
"For this reason alone, it would be desirable if a specific policy were set up for young farmers which is focused on the future."
"Some of the focal points could include a premium scheme linked to quality, landscape and environmental protection, but also the introduction of an eco-tax in other economic sectors, not payable by the farmers but by the consumers, to finance those extra requirements which farmers need to fulfil, and to reinforce the market position of farmers and consumers."
"What strikes me in the European Union' s competition policy as a whole, is that although it is enjoying a great deal of attention, in the food sector, for example, the consumers, the supermarkets that is, are gradually gaining a monopoly position, and that at the same time sales from farms, the small-scale dimension, are still fragmented."
"In that sense, it would be desirable if both Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein were more critical in their assessment of this area in terms of competition."
"Mr President, nobody can survive for one day without food; it is life requirement number one."
"This requires motivated producers."
"This means that food does not just stand for market forces, but also for public health, landscape and nature."
"In short, if we realise this, then we will know that, in future, young farmers will need to be five-legged sheep, and in that sense, deserve more support, more political support than they are receiving at the moment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking Mr Parish for his serious analysis of the situation of young farmers in Europe."
"I ask you, what shall we do when there is no one to take over our farms?"
"Structural change is important and it is right, but that should not result in a mass exodus from the farming profession."
"If we want farming to have a future in Europe, then we must secure its succession."
"We are in favour of a multi-functional farming model, i.e. a model whereby farmers are not just responsible for producing food and a large part of their work benefits society as a whole, a society which can take pleasure in seeing nature unspoiled and enjoy rural areas which are worth living in."
"The agricultural policy and the policy for the countryside as a whole lives for and from its inhabitants."
"We therefore need to create framework conditions which ensure that young people look on the countryside as somewhere worth living in and are willing to continue the farming tradition."
"Setting-up aid and investment grants are essential for young farmers, but modern technology has an equally important part to play."
"Young farmers need to be as familiar with computers and the Internet as they are with seed and the animals in their stalls."
"This means that training and further training for young farmers are becoming more and more important and I, for one, support lifelong learning in farming and among farmers."
"Allow me to say a few brief words on the social aspects."
"Time and again I hear farmers using various arguments to put off leaving their farms to their children or successors."
"Letting go is difficult, as I know from personal experience, but it is the only way of ensuring survival."
"So I call on the older generations to help the young and to give them and, hence, the whole farming industry the same chance which they had."
"Of course, and I say this quite openly as a farmer myself, it is no help when all we hear about is the down side of the profession."
"Let us be quite clear about one thing: there is not a single profession which is either all good or all bad."
"Finally, I should like to say that it gladdens my heart when I see established and young farmers working together to develop the farm, exchanging experiences and creating and putting innovative ideas into practice."
"Their dedication and commitment will be needed in the future even more than ever and we must encourage successive generations to be optimistic and take their future into their own hands."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by joining in the gratitude expressed to Mr Parish."
"I think this is a very constructive own-initiative report."
"There is a rather nice saying that the future belongs to the young, but we can turn this around when we talk of European farming and say that, without young farmers, there is no future."
"The future of the countryside, and especially the future of young farmers in Europe, does not look good."
"The numbers alone should set our alarm bells ringing."
"The number of farms in the EU has fallen constantly over recent years."
"Of course, we welcome the structural change but, at the same time, the extent of the change does give us cause for concern."
"The biggest decrease has been in the number of farmers under the age of 35."
"Thank God that young people from farms have the same career prospects as their peer groups and siblings."
"The tradition of handing farms down from one generation to the next is disappearing."
"The question of what becomes of the older generation left on the farm is often still unanswered."
"Unfortunately, farms standing empty have become a familiar sight - even in my country, which I would never have imagined possible."
"How many young people want to have to keep making excuses because they are farmers?"
"Young farmers want fair prices for their products."
"It is not because of the subsidies that they choose to be farmers."
"The Parish report may help to improve the overall image of young farmers."
"The public pays scant attention to the services of farming."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank you, Commissioner Fischler, for repeatedly highlighting the multi-functional task which farming fulfils."
"But apparently bad news makes better news."
"At the moment, you can read about the current BSE crisis blow by blow."
"But no one bothers to mention, for example, that consumer associations in my country have been wantonly campaigning for food at rock bottom prices for years now."
"Of course I disapprove of the criminal machinations of the feedingstuffs industry, the lack of controls by the authorities and so forth, but it is all this together which has resulted in the chaos in which more and more members of the profession find themselves."
"If you belong to this profession, if you are a farmer, then you will easily understand why young people ask, do I really need this?"
"With the current BSE situation, it is quite out of order to pillory our farmers and young farmers."
"We have set standards."
"So-called 'good professional practice' has been continually developed by our excellently trained young farmers."
"Essential services in the production of foodstuffs and raw materials, the development, further development and preservation of the countryside and the protection of the natural bases for life are all areas in which Europe will need farmers and young farmers in the future."
"I should like to close by saying that these young farmers do not just need reliable policies; they also need good wives and strong families."
"Only this sort of environment can give them the strength they need to perform their important function in society."
"Mr President, I note that the last seven speakers in this debate come from the Group of the European People' s Party, so we have seven people anxious to talk while everybody else has dried up."
"It is an indication of the concern of this particular group for the problem we are discussing."
"I want to thank Mr Parish for his contribution, the thorough research and the very extensive report he has produced."
"I was just thinking of my youth when I was a member of the Young Farmers of Ireland;"
"I started my political career in that organisation."
"I remember a plan was produced which was based on two simple things: intensive advice and a little bit of financial incentive."
"It was based on the geographic unit of organisation, which was most popular in Ireland, it was a church community called the parish."
"It was the parish plan. So I started off my political life with the parish plan in my hand and today I have another Parish plan."
"It is much more comprehensive and, indeed, I have to confess that I do not see as many simple answers to the questions raised in this one as in my Young Farmers' organisation in Ireland 40 years ago."
"Something that comes to mind is that we ought not to get carried away with emotion or lead people down the wrong path on this whole subject."
"The 1926 census in Ireland found that more than half of the entire population of the country was engaged in agriculture and yet the country did not produce surpluses and there were people short of food."
"There are still people harking back to the days when, as an Irish poet said: ""every rood of ground maintained its man""."
"However, we should not imagine that this was an ideal world in which to live."
"Over the years, as the number of farms was reduced and farmers became more efficient, food obviously became more available to the poor who could buy it at a lower cost."
"The reduced farm numbers have produced a lot of well-being in Europe."
"We should not forget that."
"Since Ireland joined the European Union - I only mention Ireland because I am very familiar with what happened obviously, but you can draw lessons for other areas - our many small farms were reduced gradually in number."
"If it were not for the common agricultural policy, that would have been very painful."
"It was a good thing that the number of farms was reduced and that we had the common agricultural policy to ease that."
"We must be concerned about the human problems that arise out of the squeeze-out of excessive labour, but at the same time, we should remember that the cost of food has been reduced."
"Emphasis, in the future, must be put on quality, while in my time limitless quantities were needed."
"Today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment."
"All these are things Mr Parish has underlined."
"But we should not offer the prospect of young, energetic people in greater numbers producing the quantity of food that Europe needs today because they will not eat it."
"Mr President, could I begin by congratulating Mr Parish on bringing forward a very excellent report."
"I know very well that he put a lot of time and effort into it and I am happy it can be debated by Parliament today."
"It is a very difficult subject to address and there is no easy solution to the problem of young farmers, as any of us who have any knowledge of the problem and the background would accept."
"Of course, everybody likes to say we must help the young farmers."
"The problem is when you ask them how to make the help really worthwhile, they are very slow to come forward with answers."
"How can you encourage young people onto the land?"
"You have to address the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today."
"Many young people from rural areas some 20, 30 or 40 years ago, at the time Mr McCartin was speaking about, would naturally have gone on to become young farmers."
"Nowadays those young people have many other options open to them."
"They look around and they see their friends going into jobs where they may quit working at lunchtime on Friday and not start work again until the Monday morning."
"But the young farmer will work seven days a week for very little money."
"You only have to look at the financial situation right throughout the European Union at the moment to see that we have a terrible problem here and one that is not going to be easy to address."
"The reality is that if you do not get young people into the industry, you will not bring the new ideas in and you will not allow the industry to develop and take on the challenges that it faces in the future, relating not just to the production of food, but to how that food is produced and to ensuring that it is produced in a way the consumer finds acceptable."
"It is not enough just to give financial assistance to young farmers because then all you do is put the price of lamb up out of reach."
"We in the European Union have brought in milk quotas, we have brought in suckler cow quotas, we have brought in sheep quotas, all now with a financial value that the young farmer could not even begin to contemplate."
"So I believe the best way is to make it easier for young farmers to inherit the family farm at an earlier stage, be it through an early retirement scheme or through a bond scheme."
"I certainly feel that the European Investment Bank should be encouraged to help young farmers into the industry through the bond scheme."
"But, if you are going to bring this scheme in it has to be mandatory and it has to be introduced in every Member State."
"It is not enough to introduce it in one Member State alone."
"Finally, we are spending a lot of money on rural development and the Commission would do well to look at other ways of spending that money, because, as I see it, we could make better use of it."
"We could encourage young farmers, who face so much red tape and bureaucracy now."
"Young farmers have computers."
"Farmers' wives know how to use computers and could use them on the farm."
"That is the way forward for the future."
"Mr President, I welcome this report."
"It certainly highlights the bleak future facing young farmers within the European Union, despite the support provided by the Union and Member States."
"The current unfavourable economic climate for farming in general and young farmers in particular, the obvious lack of prospects for young farmers, the decline in the number of full-time farmers and the consequent ageing of those who remain - these are all general trends which underline the problem."
"It is clear that we will experience a drastic drop in the number of young farmers over the next couple of decades, unless appropriate and effective measures are put in place now."
"Young farmers face enormous problems such as the massive financial burden when they start up and often this can be compounded by difficulties associated with inheritance."
"Training is often deficient, and for young people it can be an isolated life in rural areas, with limited social activity in comparison with those of a similar age who work in more urban settings."
"All of this begs the question: what can the European Union do?"
"A European policy aimed at supporting young farmers and linked to the CAP is essential."
"Up until now there has been little evaluation of EU assistance measures either by the Member States or the EU Commission."
"Greater attention must be given to interest rate subsidies and loans, installation aids and investment grants must be paid more speedily and the implications of enlargement on young farmers need to be considered and integrated into any future policy approach."
"Other measures that could be considered are supplementary investment aid for farmers under 40, production rights, assistance with credit terms, better education, training and networking opportunities - one could go on."
"But the point I want to make is that we need to do something now."
"To take up the point made by Mr Nicholson: why should young people in the Celtic Tiger economy in Ireland remain on the land?"
"Why should they face an anti-social life?"
"Why should they be in a career which has economic uncertainty when other occupations offer a much more attractive life, much more security, work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with week-ends off and with long holidays?"
"That is the problem we have to address and we must address it now."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking you, Mr Parish, for your earnest report on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union."
"I should also like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for its work."
"We have endeavoured in Agenda 2000, especially by developing the second pillar, to take account of the concerns of young farmers."
"In some organisations of the market, we have at least managed to grant special terms to newly established farmers or young farmers."
"I need only mention the sheep premium or the administration of national milk quota reserves or planting rights under the programme to restructure and convert vineyards."
"But, without doubt, the real issue here is the future of farming per se, because if young people are no longer prepared to take up farming, then any further debate on agriculture is superfluous."
"And, without doubt, the attractiveness of farming also depends a great deal on the political framework conditions which apply to agriculture, not just agricultural policy as a whole, but also the specific terms on which a young person can enter this profession."
"Measures to promote rural development are particularly important here."
"Agenda 2000 increased the maximum setting-up grant by 66%, meaning that up to EUR 25 000 can now be paid in aid, and loans to finance setting-up costs qualify for interest rate subsidies."
"At the same time, the terms governing investments in farming operations include the option of increasing the maximum rate of aid for investments by young farmers within the first five years of starting up."
"These aid rates may be as high as 45% and, in disadvantaged areas, as much as 55%."
"Apart from this specific aid for young farmers, there are, of course, all the other forms of aid which young farmers can claim just as any other farmer can."
"On balance, the rules for promoting the development of the countryside are extremely flexible but, according to the principle of subsidiarity, it is up to the Member States to implement them."
"The Member States are responsible for deciding what priority should be given to promoting young farmers."
"Finally, I should also like to point out - and several Member States have already gone for this option - that the early retirement scheme, the eligible sums for which have again been raised under Agenda 2000, can be linked to setting-up aid for young farmers."
"The Commission, like Parliament, feels that we need adequate statistics if we are to make better policy assessments."
"The information which the Commission compiles via the information network of agricultural accounts and structural surveys should, in fact, suffice in order to analyse the situation of young farmers and I do not think that we need, nor does it make sense to set up a new database especially for young farmers."
"What we do need is for the assessments in question to be made available."
"The Commission services are currently working with the Member States evaluating the arrangements for which provision is made in the earlier 1997 regulation, especially with reference to young farmers."
"I am sure that we shall glean some useful facts from this exercise, but I must point out that we shall be unable to submit an initial assessment of the programmes still being examined by next year because we quite simply do not have the necessary data."
"The Member States are able to amend plans to develop the countryside, especially in order to take account of the results of interim assessments."
"The Commission does not intend to introduce any new Community initiatives now; it prefers to keep to the seven-year term prescribed in the Agenda and the relevant legislation."
"But we must not forget that the young and women are priority target groups under the LEADER + Community initiative and that the assessment system which the Member States need to work out in order to select pilot projects needs to take account of this focus in Community policy."
"Many of the questions addressed in the report and the motion for a resolution, such as land prices or the availability of farmland or inheritance tax or the tax status of farms, are matters for which the Member States alone are responsible."
"However, despite a great deal of criticism, the Commission will examine the conclusions of the Parish report within the limits of its powers and right of initiative in a bid to help improve the conditions of establishment for young farmers and revive the countryside."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended until Question Time at 5.25 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0001/2001)."
"Part I"
"Question No 25 by (H-0962/00)"
"Subject: Abolition of extradition between Spain and Italy Spain and Italy recently signed a treaty on the prosecution of terrorism-related crime, trafficking in human beings, etc., which abolishes extradition and sets up a common area of freedom, security and justice between two Member States for the first time."
"Furthermore, the European Parliament recently agreed that EU institutions should be able to adopt effective measures to combat terrorism, particularly as regards search and capture orders within Europe."
"Is the Commission ready to push forward with measures to give effect to what Parliament has agreed with respect to combating terrorism and the issuing of search and capture orders in particular?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission gave a commitment to respond to the request made at the Tampere European Council to draw up legislative proposals to replace the formal extradition process with a simple procedure for transferring persons who have been convicted and who try to escape justice."
"At the last Justice and Home Affairs Council, held on 30 November 2000, I expressed the Commission' s sympathy with Member States who face the problem of terrorism and, in particular, with Spain, and I was delighted to welcome the bilateral agreement concluded between Spain and Italy."
"On that occasion, I announced that in the course of 2001, the Commission would submit proposals on three essential points for the Council' s consideration."
"Firstly, there will be a proposal on common definitions, incriminations and sanctions for crimes involving terrorism. Secondly fast-track extradition procedures between Member States will be introduced."
"Thirdly, we will submit a proposal on the creation of an instrument known as the European search and capture order. The Commission has already called a meeting of national experts in these fields, which will be held in the next few days, on the basis of a working paper that is being drawn up to present the proposals that I have just mentioned."
"I wish to reiterate the Commission' s commitment, using all its powers under the Treaties, to encourage tougher European action against terrorism, an issue that will be given great prominence in the Commission' s work programme for 2001, which will shortly be discussed in this House."
"I must say that I am pleased with the Commission' s reply and positive attitude to seek formulas and implement measures that can effectively control the worst enemy of freedom and democracy: terrorism."
"But what is the problem, Commissioner?"
"The problem is the urgent need to lay down some concrete deadlines for these measures to be implemented as quickly as possible."
"As you know, Commissioner, the European Parliament has urged that the European search and capture order should be pushed ahead as an instrument providing the necessary flexibility and speed to facilitate the capture, prosecution and sentencing of those who in European territory are violating the most fundamental right of all; the right to life."
"It would be a real aberration if in the new European Union area of freedom, security and justice the law served precisely to support those who committed such a despicable crime."
"I wish to begin by saying that I share Mr Mollar' s sense of urgency."
"Urgency is indeed crucial in this matter."
"I would say that the most urgent need is for all Member States to approve and ratify the 1995 and 1996 conventions on extradition."
"That is urgency is most vital."
"Secondly, on the European search and capture order, as you will see in the 2001 work programme, we shall have very concrete dates and deadlines for the Commission to present its proposals."
"I can guarantee that 2001 will be a turning point in the fight against terrorism, which is a fight shared by all European countries, not as a problem for a single State but as a threat to freedom, security and justice throughout the European Union."
"Question No 26 by (H-0975/00):"
"Subject: Women persecuted without asylum or refuge In some countries women suffer cruel persecution and punishment, basic human rights violations which may involve mutilation and may cost them their lives."
"In many cases, this is a consequence of the application of fundamentalist laws or the carrying-out of ancestral practices and traditions."
"The European Union says that it intends to protect women from such unacceptable persecution and punishment, but it has not yet found a way of translating its declarations into political actions and decisions offering grounds for hope."
"Would the Commission be in favour of putting forward proposals whereby such situations afflicting women might be considered grounds for granting asylum and refuge, in political terms, in the European Union?"
"I wish to say in response to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s question that refugee status is governed throughout the world by the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees."
"At European level, a non-binding common position of 4 March 1996 adopted under the Maastricht Treaty applies; this relates to uniform application of the term ""refugee"" under the terms of Article 1 of the 1951 Geneva Convention. However, there is no uniform application of the definition of the term ""refugee"" throughout Member States."
"Neither the 1951 Convention nor the European Union texts make specific reference to issues concerning requests made by women, specifically women whose human rights have been violated, with particular reference to gender-related abuse, such as sexual violence, genital mutilation or fundamental legal discrimination on the grounds of their gender."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union now has, following Tampere, a mandate to adopt common minimum rules in the field of asylum and refugee protection, with a view, in the medium term, to adopting a common European asylum system."
"The Commission intends to table specific proposals in relation to some of these in the course of 2001. These proposals will take account of the specific circumstances of women who have been victims of abuse and mistreatment."
"Indeed, the Commission has already begun to develop actions designed to address the specific circumstances of these women. An example of this is the proposal for a directive on providing temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons, which we presented on 24 May last year."
"In this proposal, under the terms of Article 11(4), Member States are obliged to provide appropriate medical assistance or other forms of assistance to women who have been victims of torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence."
"By the same token, the Commission' s proposal on minimum standards to apply to the process of granting and withdrawing refugee status, which the Commission adopted on 20 September 2000, contains various provisions addressing the specific needs of women, such as Article 4(4), which lays down that women have the right to present a request for asylum separately from their husband, or Article 3(8), which enshrines the principle of an independent and separate interview for women when presenting a request for asylum."
"There is also Article 7(8), which gives women the right to have a different interviewer or interpreter if they feel inhibited about explaining the reasons for their request for asylum due to the fact that the interviewer or interpreter is male, particularly in situations of sexual abuse and, finally, Article 14(1)(c), which lays down the obligation on Member States to guarantee that staff interviewing persons in a vulnerable situation are given the necessary basic training to deal with the specific problems of these women."
"The Commission also intends to propose measures concerning persons with special needs in its proposal for a directive on reception conditions for asylum seekers, which will be presented in the first quarter of this year."
"With regard to the specific issue of gender-related persecution forming the basis of the asylum request, the Commission has already embarked on extensive consultation on this matter and we hope that in the course of this year we will be able to draw the necessary conclusions to present to Parliament and the Council a proposal for subsidiary protection that would also cover this type of situation."
"Thank you, Mr Vitorino, because I understand that the Commission intends to submit proposals."
"I should like to say that, in the last decade of the century that has just finished, both the Vienna Conference and subsequently the Beijing Conference opened up new horizons so that we can bear in mind the very real situation in which women suffer in numerous countries, but I believe the Commissioner understands the question Mrs Izquierdo has raised and I am grateful that he is to make this kind of proposal."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 27 and 28 will be taken together."
"Question No 27 by (H-0969/00):"
"Subject: European chemical industry The carbohydrates industry employs some 8 500 people."
"However, even with the export refund applicable in previous years, the competitive disadvantage to the European chemical industry is demonstrated by the fact that four European production units have already been closed down and six new production units have been set up by European companies in third countries, with the adverse consequences of loss of direct and indirect employment (farmers) and a loss of outlets for European agricultural products."
"What will the Commission do to reverse this trend?"
"Question No 28 by (H-0977/00)"
"Subject: Export refunds in the starch industry The carbohydrates industry uses 1.2 million tons of starch/glucose produced from 2 million tons of cereals grown on an average of 400 000 hectares."
"Does the Commission realise that, by withdrawing the export refund entitlement for chemical products derived from agricultural raw materials, it has further seriously impaired the competitiveness of the European chemical industry which is already deprived of the economies of scale enjoyed by the glucose suppliers of its US counterparts as a result of the EU quota system for isoglucose and the lack of an ethanol programme in the EU?"
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Community chemical industry did indeed stop receiving export refunds at the end of July last year for agricultural raw materials such as starch, glucose and sugar, which are processed for export."
"This measure is part of a series of provisions for so-called non-Annex I products which was decided by the Council of agricultural ministers in March last year, since when exports of these products have been subject to budgetary discipline in accordance with the agreement decided within the WTO."
"However, these products still receive enough compensation to be able to compete with similar products on the world market."
"It is therefore highly unlikely that imports will rise, because the price of agricultural raw materials used by the chemical industry will, de facto, be reduced to world market prices, that is, free-port prices in the Union."
"As expressly requested when these measures were discussed, the Commission is closely monitoring the market, including the export market, and the budgetary situation in this sector."
"I thank the Commissioner for his answer but would ask the Commission to explain the obvious lack of coherence between its and the Council's politically declared will to promote the biotechnological industry and the measures taken, which endanger the very existence of this industry."
"May I point out to the honourable Member that the question at issue here is the terms on which European industry obtains the raw materials which it uses to manufacture specific industrial products."
"In theory, our starting point is the competitiveness of European industry, and it is competitive if it can obtain the raw materials which it processes on the same terms as the rest of the world."
"I fail to see why any additional aid should be needed."
"In any event, we can only support the agricultural aspect of this whole question with our organisations of the agricultural markets."
"We are not here to use funds earmarked for agriculture to support the chemical industry."
"It is our job, in line with the objectives of the Treaty, to support the agricultural aspect, i.e. to give European farmers the chance to get the products which they produce on to the market."
"I do not think that there is a difference of opinion on the question whether we would like to see a chemical industry subsidised on the basis of the agricultural policy."
"What is important, however - as transpired last year - is that on the basis of the budget discipline considerations, and other considerations, this option was not available for a while. That is point one."
"Point two is that industry has been making distinct noises to the effect that the existing discrepancies are forming an obstacle, and so are costs incurred in processing. These aspects very much form part of the European agricultural policy."
"Alongside this, it cannot be denied that producers of vegetable products in the European Union are going through a rough time at the moment."
"In that sense, every kilogram of extra sale to the chemical industry is a welcome bonus, especially when producers can prove that they are having to produce against a higher cost price after all."
"I would still like to ask the Commissioner, based on a real cost-price analysis for companies in Europe and elsewhere, also taking into consideration the genetically modified aspect, to again cast a critical eye over whether these regulations outside the scope of active improvement could not, in fact, be applied more forcefully."
"Yes, of course we can check if there is any other sales potential, but I must stress that certain limits must be kept to, even in the area of agricultural aid because, in the final analysis, all the products being addressed here, sugar and starch alike, are subject to quotas and aid is granted within the framework of those quotas."
"We cannot subsidise more huge quantities now because we do not have the funds."
"Aid to agriculture must be granted within the framework of the maximum quotas agreed in the organisations of the market."
"We cannot simply extend the quotas."
"Question No 29 by (H-0003/01)"
"Subject: Coordinated approach to the financial repercussions of the BSE crisis According to Commissioner Franz Fischler, the European ban on meat-and-bone meal will cost approximately EUR 4.5 billion."
"There is still great uncertainty surrounding compensation for the losses incurred."
"This means that the financial measures due to expire may create distortions of competition between the 15 EU Member States."
"Does the Commission support a coordinated European approach to the financial repercussions of the BSE crisis, given that the financial measures taken by the national and regional authorities that are now due to expire are leading to the distortion of competition between the 15 EU Member States?"
"If not, why is the Commission against a coordinated approach?"
"Part II"
"Mr President, honourable Members, we need to differentiate in our assessment of the financial repercussions of the BSE crisis between veterinary measures, Community measures taken within the context of the common organisation of the market in beef and national measures."
"As far as Community action in this area is concerned, may I draw the honourable Member's attention to the series of measures recently introduced to support the beef market."
"Both aid for private storage and public intervention have been introduced and are being funded 100% by the Community."
"A special culling regulation for animals over thirty months old has also been introduced."
"Seventy per cent of the value of the animal is paid for by the Community, while Member States are required to pay the other 30%, together with the culling costs."
"Any Member State which intends to take national measures must, of course, report them to the Commission and the Commission constantly checks what is going on in order to discourage distortions of competition."
"Any Member State wishing to grant aid in order to mitigate the consequences of the BSE crisis must notify the Commission of the aid arrangements in accordance with Article 88, paragraph 3, of the Treaty - as I have already mentioned - so that they can be checked to ensure that they comply with Community framework arrangements."
"Commissioner, all of this is, of course, music to my ears."
"Naturally, I would like to thank you for your response and the clarification as well as the distinction you have drawn between national measures on the one hand and Community measures on the other."
"In practice, however, I have noticed that all hell has broken loose, not just in my own country but - I assume - in other countries too."
"Our own regional Minister for Agriculture in the Flanders Region, Mrs Dua, has mentioned levies on meat."
"Others have mooted the idea of an increase in VAT, others still would like to pass the buck to Europe."
"All I can see is a great deal of chaos and insecurity in my country."
"Despite the fact that, apparently, the Commission will have to be notified of such measures, there is a great deal of concern among farmers, and also amongst those in the meat-processing industry, and certainly among our local butcher shops, who, at the end of the day, will have to take the first blow."
"Would it indeed not be preferable to harmonise the compensation or the way in which the costs will be met, at the time that all tests need to be carried out, in advance rather than afterwards, thus ruling out any distortion of competition?"
"Your response in this matter is somewhat disappointing, in my opinion."
"Mr President, the honourable Member may well be disappointed with my reply but if what he says is correct, i.e. that statements by local politicians have caused confusion in his region, in Flanders, then it is up to the same local politicians to clarify the matter."
"They cannot expect the European Commission to do it for them."
"I have one more comment to make on a point that was raised."
"Where, as the honourable Member mentioned, a Member State introduces fiscal or parafiscal measures, such as value added tax surcharges, then any such measures must, of course, be taken within the framework of existing legislation, i.e. they must be compatible with European tax directives, and any measures taken must be checked by the Commission accordingly."
"But it is also the job and the responsibility of the individual Member States to announce regional measures."
"In other words, Member States must not only announce measures taken at national level; they must make known and report all measures taken."
"Questions to Mrs Wallstr√∂m"
"Question No 30 by (H-0972/00):"
"Subject: Export of mining waste During the 1980s, the Swedish mining company Boliden exported a large quantity of toxic waste to Arica in Chile for treatment and recycling."
"The waste was subsequently left in an open landfill site with the result that heavy metals seeped into the surrounding environment, causing the local population serious health problems."
"In Chile, demands have been made for the waste to be shipped back to Sweden."
"Does the Commission consider that this particular export complied with the existing rules in this area?"
"Does the Commission consider that Boliden now bears any responsibility for resolving the situation?"
"Shipments of waste, including shipments to and from the Community, are governed by Regulation 259/93."
"This regulation replaced Directive 84/631 on the transfrontier shipment of hazardous waste."
"This revision incorporated the provisions of the 1989 Basle Convention on movements of hazardous wastes into Community legislation."
"As from 1 January 1998, the Community has therefore banned all shipments of hazardous wastes to be used for material recycling or to be deposited in countries outside the OECD."
"The Community therefore complies with the 1995 amendment to the Basle Convention which has not yet come into force internationally."
"This legislation is not, however, applicable to exports of waste from the Swedish mining company, Boliden to Chile during the 1980s because Sweden was not an EU Member at that time."
"Furthermore, the provisions of the Basle Convention did not apply in the 1980s."
"In this specific case, the Commission believes that there is no Community legislation which can now make the company liable for possible environmental damage due to these waste products."
"The issue of Boliden' s liability in this case therefore remains a national issue which must be resolved through national environmental legislation."
"Thank you for your answer."
"I naturally appreciate that this is how matters stand, that is to say that there is not at present any legislation which may be used in this context."
"Nonetheless, what we have here is an example of an unusually cynical trade in which hazardous waste that causes serious illnesses, especially among children in the area, is exported to a country which is unable to deal with it."
"My question is: if something similar were to happen today, that is to say if an attempt were made to export waste in this way, would the rules mean that exports of this kind were totally banned?"
"The answer to that question is yes."
"There is currently a ban on exporting hazardous waste, including to third countries, that is to say non-EU countries."
"Question No 31 by (H-0973/00):"
"Subject: Spanish national hydrological plan: citizens call for the Commission to intervene More than 80 000 objections to the draft national hydrological plan have already been lodged during the consultation stage for those affected."
"Objections have been submitted by ecological organisations, who complain that many of the works planned under the scheme will affect areas declared as sites of Community interest by the Spanish Government, seriously threatening protected species, by trade unions and farmers' associations, who stress the negative aspects of the plan and propose a thorough revision, and by many local authorities, who have drawn attention to the inconsiderate planning of some of the diversions and their social and economic consequences for people living in the areas concerned."
"All these social agents have expressed the wish that the Commission should take up a position on the plan and should contact the Spanish Government urging it to correct its negative aspects."
"Can the Commission specify its position on the matter and say what conclusions it draws from any contacts it has had with the Spanish Government to date in relation to the plan?"
"Mr President, at the initiative of the Spanish Minister, Mr Matas, we held a meeting where he presented the main elements of the Spanish draft plan hidrol√≥gico nacional."
"The plan is, at this stage, a draft which is likely to be subject to modifications following the wide consultation under way involving a wide range of stakeholders."
"The Spanish Minister for the Environment has confirmed his commitment to this consultation."
"At the meeting, I brought to the attention of the Spanish authorities the need to ensure full respect for all relevant EC environmental legislation and policy including the water framework directive."
"This applies both to the formal adoption procedure of the final plan as well as the implementation phase."
"The plan remains a draft document and at the request of the Spanish Environment Minister my services are currently examining the draft plan."
"Yes, Commissioner, it is a draft document, and you know that it will soon be going through the Spanish Parliament."
"Considering that this draft, as presented, infringes specific European directives, both the habitats directive and the wild birds directive, and also the objectives of the water framework directive, my question is this: if the final law still infringes these directives, if it is harmful to the environment, will it receive the announced EUR 1 300 billion in resources from Community funds?"
"Of course the whole process that we have now started of consultation and dialogue with the Spanish Government on this particular case means that we intend to get all the information necessary for us to be well informed about this process and to make sure that the Spanish Government complies with the legislation."
"You have already identified some of the directives affected by this."
"If there were a breach of the environmental legislation, we could actually withhold project money."
"It is very important that today we have this possibility and, of course, we should not hand out money for a Member State to breach environmental legislation."
"We plan to stay in touch with the Spanish Government to make sure that their plans are in line with the existing directives."
"I believe that the Spanish hydrological plan - at this stage there cannot be the slightest doubt of this - is an essential project for our country."
"This has, until now, been the opinion shared by almost all Spanish political groups over the years."
"In fact, in 1993, the Socialist government was already aware of this need and drew up a proposal which at the time it either could not or did not know how to carry forward."
"True, that proposal contained an appreciably larger number of infrastructures than the current project."
"Of course, the years have passed and the current project has to be coherent, involving much more social cohesion than those that have gone before, being much more environmentally sensitive, and undoubtedly inviting more participation."
"So, as it is such an important project for the joint development of the Spanish regions, I am sure that the comment, promise or statement that the Minister for the Environment has made on several occasions that this is an open document, that this is a draft, a proposal, and that the need for a consensus on it among all the regions affected is absolutely beyond doubt, my question, Commissioner, is as follows: in the framework of the closest cooperation between the Commission and the Spanish Government, and within the situations laid down in the framework directive, precisely what support can the Commission provide so that this project can progress as it should?"
"Mr President, at this stage, of course, what we are doing is having an exchange of information."
"We make sure that we are well informed about what is happening in Spain."
"I can only repeat that the Spanish Minister of Environment has confirmed his commitment to this consultation process and I know that this is what is going on at the moment and that there is a debate - as I understand, a heated debate - on this issue."
"So far, since the plan is not finalised we have been asked for some advice and guidance, and this is what we can deliver at the moment: to stay in a genuine dialogue with the Spanish Government and to make sure that the consultation process is carried out as it should be."
"Question No 32 by (H-1002/00):"
"Subject: Action being taken by the Commission to increase coordination of fire protection in EU Member States The EU's strategies for fire safety are inadequate."
"In particular, recent disasters such as the tunnel fire in Austria as well as earlier fires in restaurants, hotels and ships, etc. highlight the importance of better coordination of fire safety policy in the EU."
"Increased integration between the Member States means that common strategies need to be identified in these areas of fire safety as well."
"At the Commission, there is to my knowledge no coordination between Directorates and no Commissioner seems to have overall responsibility for these issues. Fire safety touches on many policy areas such as tourism, environmental and consumer issues, transport networks, etc."
"People must be able to feel safe wherever they are in the EU."
"What action is the Commission taking to increase the coordination of fire protection strategies in EU Member States?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is well aware that people have died and been injured as a consequence of fires - a fact it deeply regrets - and we express our sympathy to the relatives of the victims."
"The Commission also regrets the environmental and economic damage caused by fires."
"This issue is particularly important in the present situation in view of the fires which occurred at Christmas in the Netherlands and in China and in which many young people died."
"The Commission believes that it is very important to coordinate fire safety issues."
"Improved fire safety within the Community, especially fire prevention, is a high-priority issue in the programme of Community measures in favour of civil protection."
"I can also tell you that the construction division of the Directorate-General for Enterprise has recently initiated an investigation into fire safety in the European Union in relation to buildings under construction."
"This investigation is aimed at improving the harmonisation of building standards so that buildings throughout the Union might fulfil the same safety requirements."
"The building products directive lays down essential requirements for all types of construction, including tunnels."
"In close cooperation with the Member States, the Commission is also assessing the consequences of the Council' s recommendation on fire safety in existing hotels."
"In this area, the Commission plans to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council during the first half of this year."
"It should also be borne in mind that the Member States can establish their own safety requirements and that fire prevention measures mainly come within the Member States' area of competence."
"Nevertheless, this is an all-embracing problem of which Community policy takes account in a variety of areas with a view to complementing measures adopted in the Member States."
"There may still be certain weaknesses when it comes to coordinating fire safety issues."
"In order to get to grips with this problem and improve coordination, my own Directorate-General' s civil protection division, together with the competent divisions in the areas of industry, health and consumer protection, set up a working party last October including representatives of different branches of the emergency services."
"I really must thank you for your answer."
"Obviously, a good deal of progress has nonetheless been made in this area."
"I have no intention whatsoever of removing responsibility for these fire safety issues from national or local authorities. The principle of subsidiarity must, of course, apply in this area, just as in other areas."
"I ask this question partly against the background of the numerous discussions I have had with firemen and their trade unions, who are quite worried."
"Just like the public, they are, in fact, affected more and more by cross-border factors."
"Firemen have to work with ever more vessels, vehicles and products from countries with which they are unfamiliar and whose levels of fire protection they are not used to."
"People travel more and more and naturally want to be able to feel safe irrespective of what country they are in when they take a ferry, travel through a tunnel or go to a discotheque."
"Against this background, I believe it is especially important not only for each Directorate to deal with these fire safety issues but also for there to be real coordination where this strategic common responsibility is concerned."
"I interpret the Commissioner' s statement here to the effect that there is now just such a coordinating working party as a step in that direction and, that being the case, I should just like to thank her for her answer."
"It is, of course, easy for me to agree with Mr F√§rm about these viewpoints. There ought to be a way in to these issues in the Commission too."
"However, it is not entirely easy because we are also dealing with states of affairs which differ considerably from one country to another and in which systems are often devolved to the greatest possible degree to local level."
"Consequently, it can be difficult to issue recommendations and still more difficult to issue a directive which would, as it were, be applicable everywhere and clarify all these various aspects."
"As I said in my first speech, we are nonetheless attempting to coordinate matters as far as we can."
"We are also trying to see if we can obtain similar standards in all Member States and ensure that we coordinate our own efforts."
"A lot can be improved now that we have a civil protection division, specifically with overall responsibility of this kind."
"We must continue with the somewhat laborious process of reviewing special provisions relating to buildings under construction, discotheques, boats and what have you, with a view to ensuring that we become better and more effective at coordinating our fire prevention efforts."
"May I draw the Commissioner's attention, as on other occasions I have drawn Parliament's attention to the fact that, in cases of disasters such as fire, flood or earthquake, what is needed is fast State intervention to tackle the problem and, more importantly, save lives."
"Local authorities can never manage on their own."
"What we need is a collaboration plan between all the local rescue units so that, if one country suffers an earthquake, flood or fire, the forces from all the countries which are not affected can rush to the scene and at least save lives."
"Have you considered this as an idea which could be promoted with good results?"
"As the honourable Member points out, these issues of civil protection and civil defence are very important."
"We therefore have a plan involving increased opportunities for the Commission to, for example, arrange joint exercises for emergency services and contributions to civil protection from different Member States."
"We also have better coordination within the Commission in order to be able to come up directly with the information needed and, sometimes too, with the special initiatives and special forces needed in order to help, depending upon what kind of accident, disaster or natural catastrophe may be involved."
"When I visited Brittany, I appreciated for myself that there was a need for a unit, or specialists, with responsibility for cleaning and washing birds affected by oil slicks."
"It is precisely that kind of service which ought to be looked into."
"Where is it to be found?"
"How shall we be able to mobilise it quickly when it is needed?"
"And how can we train ourselves to be able to react still more quickly?"
"The plan and the proposal already exist."
"We also have to coordinate our emergency teams."
"I believe we have made some good progress."
"It is now also a question of allocating enough resources to make the plan really work in practice."
"Question No 33 by (H-0001/01):"
"Subject: Control of the primrose willow The primrose willow, a plant native to South America, is proliferating alarmingly in all parts of France."
"Every wet place is affected, including, as far as Loire-Atlantique is concerned, the Bri√®re, Brivet, Goulaine, and Redon marshes, the Grand Lieu lake, the Mazerolles plains, and so forth."
"The primrose willow is now spreading extremely rapidly and, despite the efforts of numerous volunteers, can no longer be contained by uprooting."
"The resulting situation is posing a serious ecological problem and greatly inconveniencing those entitled to use the land."
"What technical and financial measures will the Commission take to halt this nuisance?"
"Mr President, this question concerns the primrose willow."
"This particular plant, as the honourable Member has mentioned, is a particular problem in wetlands and the management of wetlands, is of course the responsibility of the Member States."
"However the Commission can help in two ways."
"Firstly, within the limits of its remit, it can encourage an exchange of information between local players who have the same problem."
"You may for example be aware of the initiatives taken by the Mediterranean Environment Agency or by the Landes general council, Acquitaine region, which recently organised a meeting on how to manage the primrose willow."
"Secondly, Community funds, in particular the Structural Funds, and the LIFE instrument could be used to aid the management of the primrose willow in respect of Natura 2000 sites."
"It would, of course, be up to applicants to propose actions in accordance with the normal rules of eligibility."
"I listened closely and I would like to thank you for your answer."
"I would also have liked to know if it would be possible to grant this plant 'harmful' or 'of no market value' status because the problem with the primrose willow is that it is sold widely for use in aquaria and when people get rid of their tanks it escapes into the environment, causing these problems."
"If we could, therefore, ban it from sale, I believe that this would help to stop it spreading."
"It is still within the competence of the Member States and, of course, they have to decide what to do or what kind of action to take."
"It would be very radical to try to ban a certain plant."
"That cannot be done."
"Any action and any plans have to start at local level."
"What we can do is to provide some advice and links to others who have the same problem."
"Mr President, we are always so surprised when the balance of nature is upset."
"What I should like to ask is whether we could investigate why the balance has been upset under European research programmes?"
"I wish I could answer that question."
"I can say that the right way to deal with this problem of the Ludwigia grandiflora, which is its Latin name, is to discuss this during the technical days which are being organised on 23 and 24 January."
"It is a conference for those who are concerned about these things."
"Perhaps you will be able to get some more information about this primrose willow and the way it has spread in an unnatural way."
"That is the only advice I can give today."
"We will continue to gather information and hopefully be able to link all those concerned with this issue."
"Questions to Mrs de Palacio"
"Question No 34 by (H-0955/00):"
"Subject: Assessment of the interim report by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate on BNFL Has the Commission assessed the interim report prepared by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate on progress made by BNFL in implementing the improvements NII required in safety and management structures at Sellafield, in so far as the operations at Sellafield adversely affect other Member States?"
"In February 2000 the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the British regulatory body, published a report on aspects relating to the activities of British Nuclear Fuels Limited at the Sellafield Plant."
"This British regulatory body recently published a revised interim report on the progress made by BNFL."
"Following the February recommendations, the Commission' s services are also studying this second interim report."
"In addition, the Commission knows that, since the revised report was published in November the British regulatory body has been satisfied with the way in which BNFL has dealt, for example, with the 15 recommendations in the report specific to the demonstration plant, and that these recommendations have been closed, as they say in the nuclear industry, which means they are considered to have been complied with."
"The Commission observes that the British regulatory body appreciates the effort and commitment displayed by BNFL with respect to its concerns and also that significant progress has been made (I am quoting directly) regarding its other recommendations in the February report."
"Much still remains to be done, however, since in November 2000 only 3 of the inspection team' s 28 recommendations had been formally closed."
"Nevertheless, the British regulatory body has recognised that many of the measures already introduced by the company will still need time to take effect fully."
"In the words of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, British Nuclear Fuels Limited has made a good start, but it must keep up the spirit of change while it continues to operate its plants safely."
"Mrs Ahern, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission appreciates the progress made and shares the inspectors' desire to see a steady drive towards an improved safety culture at all levels of management, and, of course, within my competences, or rather in this field, my non-competences, I shall keep a watching brief on what is happening at Sellafield."
"I wish to thank Mrs de Palacio for studying the situation and for saying that she was keeping a watching brief."
"However, I cannot agree that compliance with 3 out of 20 recommendations is progress."
"It certainly is not."
"In the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the chief inspector of the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate said quite clearly that he would shut the reprocessing facility if the recommendations were not complied with in full."
"Clearly they have not been complied with in full."
"We can argue about progress being swift or slow, but we have to see compliance in full."
"I hope Mrs de Palacio that you will state here today that you wish to see compliance in full with the recommendations and swiftly, because that is what I want to hear."
"I also referred to the adverse affects on other Member States, namely the Republic of Ireland, and would like to draw the Commissioner's attention to a report published by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in December 2000, which is critical of emissions from Sellafield and their adverse effect on the Republic of Ireland."
"I would ask you to study that in full also, Mrs de Palacio."
"Of course I shall ask straight away for this document that you have mentioned to be analysed too, if it is not being examined already, and if we do not have it, which would be strange, may I ask you to provide us with a copy."
"In any case, we would, of course, like to see compliance as soon as possible with all the recommendations - not just 3, but all 28 - on the part of British Nuclear Fuels in its operations and activities at Sellafield, and it is obvious that if it does not carry out all these recommendations, as the British Government has already said, they will have to take decisions in that respect."
"I must remind you that what I can undertake to do, as I have already said, is to keep a very close watch, but competences in this field are still national, and I know that the British authorities are taking a very firm stand on this whole question."
"I tabled a question to the Commission in October on the environmental hazards posed by DU, depleted uranium 238, shells in the Balkans and suggested that some of the emergency aid package to Serbia should be dedicated to investigating and, if proven, making good the toxic and radioactive damage possibly posed to the people of Kosovo."
"Commissioner Patten rather surprisingly replied that this was not a priority."
"In view of the recent EU-wide publicity and concerns expressed about DU shells and the hazards posed by the dust in particular if inhaled by soldiers and civilians, particularly children playing in the vicinity of where there has been bomb damage, have the Commissioner's views changed since then?"
"The question on British Nuclear Fuels Limited is not relevant and not supplementary and therefore lapses."
"Question No 35 by (H-0960/00):"
"Subject: Modal shift from road transport to rail transport and climate change Transport is of enormous relevance to the debate on climate change, as it is the source of 26% of the current CO2 emissions where road transport accounts for 84% of all transport."
"Recent forecasts suggest that transport is likely to represent the source with the highest increase rate in CO2 emissions in the next few years."
"Liberalisation of rail freight transport and increased interoperability of the rail system are important but insufficient steps towards the promotion of rail transport, the most important alternative transport mode to road."
"How is the Commission planning to support investment in rail transport, mainly within the framework of the forthcoming White Paper on Transport Policy, Guidelines for the TENS, and the Green Paper on Urban Transport?"
"Is the Commission planning to review current priority or non-priority road projects within the TENs framework so as to give preference to more sustainable transport modes?"
"Can the Commission indicate the share of investment per mode of transport in the framework of the Structural Funds' Programming Period 2000-2006?"
"At the beginning of next month the Commission expects to approve a White Paper on the common transport policy, which will be accompanied by a review of guidelines on the trans-European transport network and possibly other initiatives to promote less polluting and more efficient transport systems."
"These initiatives are intended to combat growing congestion, negative environmental effects, our over-dependence on oil and the high number of road accidents."
"The Commission is drawing up a set of economic measures regulating infrastructures to favour greater use of those transport modes that still have available capacity and are less harmful to the environment."
"The intended aim is to give a boost to new technologies and to encourage greater cooperation between transport modes."
"To this end, the review of trans-European networks will be carried out in two stages."
"The first stage will focus on a few priority topics, emphasising the encouragement of rail freight transport."
"In the second stage, which is expected to begin before 2004, a more profound review of the guidelines will be conducted, looking especially at the enlargement of the Union and the environment, and the principal multi-mode transport routes will be determined."
"The Commission' s guidelines concerning the Structural Fund programmes for 2000-2006 recommend that priority should be given to intermodal transport."
"The Commission will present a communication to show how these guidelines have been taken into account."
"I wanted to ask a supplementary question but I am afraid that I am going to have to return to the two parts of my question which have not been addressed."
"I asked if the Commission was planning to review current priority or non-priority road projects within the trans-European networks framework so as to give preference to more sustainable transport modes."
"That part of my question has not been answered."
"Secondly, I wanted the Commission to indicate the share of investment per mode of transport in the framework of the Structural Funds programme period 2000 to 2006."
"You may say that it is not possible, but I think you could at least give a rough estimate."
"Mrs McKenna, I must tell you that with regard to trans-European networks right now priority is being given de facto to rail projects, if that is what you are concerned about."
"The major part - the investments - corresponds to large rail projects."
"Secondly, what is intended in this White Paper - in which we shall have the opportunity to discuss all these issues in great depth, and in which problems of charging and the competitiveness of the various modes of transport, etc., will also appear - is precisely to make progress in sorting out bottlenecks, which does not mean that in some cases we shall not have to think about enhancing certain road infrastructures."
"What is also intended is a greater use of transport modes such as river or coastal transport, and what is intended, above all, is to facilitate the integration of the transport system, because in the end, sooner or later, roads always seem to come into it to guarantee the 'door to door' factor, which is a decisive element."
"This means intermodality, interconnection platforms, and also interoperability in freight systems too."
"As for the sums for the 2000-2006 period, I frankly cannot give you the exact figures."
"What I can tell you is that at the moment more than 50% is already being earmarked for projects that have to do with the rail sector."
"Question No 36 by (H-0963/00):"
"Subject: Supply of energy and nuclear energy The Commission has just adopted a Green Paper on the security of energy supply."
"This document gives fresh encouragement to the nuclear industry, while at the same time the Commission' s estimates suggest a progressive reduction of the proportion of energy consumption supplied by nuclear power, down from the current 15% to 6% by 2030."
"Civil society is rejecting the promotion of nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels."
"Is the Commission considering increasing the proportion of energy consumption supplied by nuclear power?"
"If so, up to what level?"
"How does it think it will be able to finance the development of renewable energy?"
"How does it plan to use nuclear industry profits as an additional source of funding for renewable energy?"
"Does it not consider it advisable, and indeed necessary, to redirect the financial resources now allocated to the promotion of nuclear research, including research into nuclear fusion, into the promotion of renewable energy?"
"Questions to Mr Nielson"
"To Mrs Isler B√©guin' s question on renewable and nuclear energies, I should like to answer first of all that, at the moment, the priority is to encourage an increase in the use of renewable energies."
"Let this be quite clear."
"In no document, or anywhere else, have I shown that I favour the use of nuclear energy."
"In the Green Paper - which you can get hold of - what emerges quite clearly is the increase in support, incentives and all kinds of backing for the use of renewable energies."
"A result of this is the discussion on the directive on the use of green electricity - electricity from renewable sources - or our collaboration with the Directorate-General for Competition on the question of the processing of aid to these kinds of sectors."
"Secondly, the Green Paper also puts forward the possibility of using some kinds of compensation or crossed subsidies from the usual or traditional energy sources - coal, oil, gas, nuclear energy, or all of them together - to provide support for renewable energies."
"Lastly, in any case, in addition to this aid for renewable energies, which I believe is essential and is put forward not just as a statement but as an objective - and remember that for the first time concrete objectives tailored to each individual Member State are being proposed, and this is being done in the green electricity directive - I consider it vital to maintain support for research in the nuclear sector, especially into matters of safety, storage and waste treatment (because burying it is not a solution), or into alternative issues such as the fusion system."
"Commissioner, the reason I ask this question is simply because my fellow Members in the European Parliament have been working for 15 years for renewable energy to be taken into account."
"The Commission is beginning to incorporate it, but renewable energy is apparently continuing to be viewed as a back-up supply rather than as the energy of the future."
"The facts are clear, and the view is expressed that funding is not sufficient, especially compared with levels of investment made in the past for other forms of energy."
"On the other hand, nuclear energy and nuclear-based electricity, which does not produce any greenhouse gas, were widely promoted as part of the fight against the greenhouse effect, and it was basically asserted that nuclear energy could be seen as an alternative to combat the greenhouse effect."
"Therefore, this is why we asked the question, to see if the Commission is still on the same wavelength, in wishing to continue to develop renewable energy in both the European Union, and elsewhere in the world, and not just as a backup energy source."
"Mrs Isler B√©guin, I should love to be able to say that we could supply all our energy requirements from renewable energies, but, unfortunately, at the current stage of technological development this is not true."
"Our potential for renewable energies in the European Union is limited, both for physical reasons - because, apart from solar power, where we could have a greater margin, the others have clear limitations - and for economic reasons, because it is true that we have to grant aid to the renewable energies - and I have already said that I have taken concrete, positive initiatives in this respect - but even so, we have to maintain some level of competitiveness and balance."
"Obtaining 12% of our basic energy from renewable sources seems to me to be a very ambitious target, and I am prepared to make every effort to reach this target by 2010."
"Having said that, I cannot deny the evidence, and the evidence is that, apart from other very serious problems such as waste, nuclear energy does not involve pollution from any emissions."
"Finally, I must say that the nuclear problem is a very serious problem, but it is under control."
"At the moment, unfortunately, the problem of climate change is absolutely out of control."
"It is a problem that is out of control now, and what is more, I am afraid it will not be controllable unless we take major steps."
"I share your concern."
"Not only the Green Paper on energy but also the White Paper on transport - because transport has a lot to do with this subject - take a clear line of trying to minimise the effects from a climate change point of view and from an environmental point of view, while maintaining development, growth and the quality of life."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"In your response you relied heavily on the economic argument, but we have to say that both nuclear energy and coal are, in fact, heavily subsidised."
"As Mrs Isler B√©guin said, can we see the same level of subsidies - look at the money spent on research in fusion - in renewable energies?"
"To date we do not have level of funding either from the EU or from the Member States."
"I have two other points."
"Firstly, do you consider waste incineration a renewable energy, because we need clarification on that?"
"Secondly, where we get industrial profits as an additional source of funding for renewable energy, will we see a level playing field across the board?"
"I would refer you also to the fact - I have said this in other fora - that Director-General Lamoureux has made statements on nuclear energy which vastly exceed the brief of the Commission."
"It is for the Member States to decide whether they will build or not build nuclear power plants."
"Will the Commissioner disassociate herself from those comments?"
"The Green Paper clearly states that renewable energies need aid and support at the moment, as was the case some time ago with coal or nuclear energies, for instance."
"At the moment, renewable energies need backing and to be given a similar level of support, at least - and I think they need even more."
"In other words, I fully agree with you, and I say so plainly in the Green Paper."
"Secondly, waste as such is not renewable energy. Waste incineration by itself cannot be a renewable energy."
"But in the case of the appropriate incineration of waste from renewable organic components, then yes, we are in the field of renewable energy."
"You know that this was the subject of a debate in this Parliament and also that, in the end, a compromise was reached by which we agreed to accept a particular type of waste in certain respects and under certain conditions."
"But if you just say waste and that is all, then I will say no. Only waste considered in a particular way and, of course, specified and selected."
"With regard to Mr Lamoureux' s statements, he says what the Treaty states, and, of course, the decision to set up a nuclear power plant or not or to opt out is up to the Member States; it is not up to the Commission and neither is it a Community decision."
"It is the Member States that take their own decisions according to their own options, within the general framework, of course, which does not mean that I do not believe we should think carefully about it, because I believe Europe needs a common energy policy."
"As the time allotted to questions to Commissioner de Palacio has elapsed, Questions Nos 37, 38 and 39 will be replied to in writing."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I want an answer to my question."
"You passed over my Question 39."
"I am here to take the question."
"I must request the answer to that question."
"Furthermore, may I point out that in Question 36 there were three questions in one, which took up over 20 minutes."
"There are three questions in one in Question 40, which will take another 20 minutes or so."
"My Question 39 is one simple sentence and all I require is one simple answer."
"I am entitled to that."
"I therefore expect you, Mr President, to accord me the respect of the House and the answer to my question."
"I have been here for the last 16 years and I am at least entitled to the respect of the House."
"Mr Fitzsimons, the House has every respect for you, but the primary duty of a Member - especially those of us who have been here for many years - is to read the Rules of Procedure."
"There is an order of questions."
"You will understand that I have been conducting Question Time now for a year and a half, and out of duty I have had to read this part of the Rules."
"Each Commissioner answers for 20 minutes."
"Your question is No 39."
"Nos 37 and 38 did not receive an answer either in accordance with the Rules, and their authors were also present."
"There is not going to be debate on this now, I assure you, because it would prevent Members from being able to ask their questions."
"So in accordance with the Rules, Annex II, ""Answers to questions"" , paragraph 11: ""Questions that remain unanswered for lack of time shall be answered in writing."""
"That is what I have done, and I am applying the same rule to you as to everybody else."
"In other words, you are being accorded total and absolute respect."
"If you have anything else to add, please do so in writing."
"Mr Tannock, who is requesting a point of order, asked a question that was not relevant, because it was not supplementary."
"This is the view of the presidency of this sitting and I do not intend to discuss it further."
"Question No 40 by (H-0959/00):"
"Subject: NGOs and reform of development services and policy The Commission has embarked on the process of reform in the field of development policy, in the context of which the role of NGOs will need to be defined."
"The European Parliament argues that NGOs are one of the pillars on which Community cooperation rests and is concerned at the treatment of NGOs in the new guidelines and establishment plan for development policy and services."
"Will the Commission establish a permanent structured dialogue with the European NGO Liaison Committee (CLONG) which will guarantee the terms governing the participation of European NGOs in Community cooperation?"
"Does the Commission believe that it is important to strengthen the role of NGOs with a view to balancing their presence in Community development policy by comparison with multilateral aid organisations, chiefly those belonging to the United Nations family?"
"Will the Commission take account of the experience with NGOs acquired by staff in the Development DG when it draws up the establishment plan for the new implementing body?"
"The Commission fully agrees with the honourable Member that NGOs as important actors in civil society are one of the pillars on which EC cooperation rests."
"The Cotonou Agreement specifically mentions the increasing role of non-State actors in the development process."
"The Commission has elaborated specific programming guidelines on the role of actors such as NGOs in the EU partnership with the ACP countries."
"The Commission action plan also contains commitments to partnerships with the ACP. The Commission action plan also contains commitments to partnerships and consultation of civil society and non-State actors."
"As far as the European NGO Liaison Committee (CLONG) is concerned, our relationship with it has always been active and fruitful."
"In addition to contributions to NGO projects, projects that actually reach people in the developing countries, the CLONG is also financially assisted by the Commission."
"In accordance with its financial rules the Commission received the preliminary results of an audit of the CLONG in December 2000, which shows poor financial management within the CLONG."
"The Commission will draw the consequences of this audit in order to put its relationship with the CLONG on a sound basis."
"However, it should be mentioned that the dialogue between the Commission and the CLONG is not and will not be interrupted."
"The dialogue with a number of other NGOs and other NGO umbrella organisations - there is a number of them - also will be deepened over the next year as the new organisational structure decided in May 2000 comes into place."
"On this matter it is important to ask you not to make the mistake of thinking that accepting a special lower standard of financial management for the CLONG is an adequate way by which the Commission should demonstrate its positive attitude towards the inclusion of civil society as such."
"This is not the problem, the problem we are facing here is simply one of financial management."
"The Commission considers that NGOs have a distinct and crucial role, which is different from and not in competition with UN agencies."
"ECHO's use of NGOs, the UN and other organisations reflects what is best in the situation."
"Situations change and so does the pattern of how we distribute through different partners."
"Finally, many of the staff with experience of NGOs in the Development DG have now been transferred to the EuropAid Cooperation Office - our new implementing body."
"Therefore they will bring their knowledge to the new office and concentrate on how to handle the relationship better to reduce some of the problems we have had in the past with the not always very smooth dialogue between the different parties."
"I am sorry for what has happened, because I heard, or I think I heard the Commissioner say that he will keep up the dialogue and continue to regard NGOs as important, but in this context I should like to ask the following question: clearly, Commissioner, we as Members of Parliament, and specifically the Socialist Group, are not going to uphold or overlook the possible bad management by the NGO Liaison Committee (CLONG), but we do think that the political principle of dialogue with the NGOs is very important, and a large proportion of these NGOs is represented by the CLONG."
"Therefore, we understand that the solution that may be presented is not in proportion to the seriousness of the irregularities that the CLONG administration may have committed, and that if a way out of the current situation is not found the NGO Liaison Committee may close."
"The question is, therefore: does the Commissioner foresee a way out of the financial situation without precluding the fact that the Commission should then negotiate a restructuring or new way in which the NGOs must work and how they must coordinate themselves?"
"We will make the kind of response to this problem that we have presented for the CLONG so far."
"Let me here make the point that we are not at the final conclusion, we have received the report from the Auditors and we are looking at what kind of conclusions we will draw in the Commission."
"But we have indicated - and this reflects what the Auditors are saying - that there is a need to recover something around EUR 1 million."
"That recovery normally also leads to a stop in the funding of the recipient in question."
"This is normal procedure."
"I am faced with a situation where if I do not do this I would be acting in a manner which would in all probability be strongly criticised by the Court of Auditors and by this House."
"I still remember the very loud applause I received at my hearing in the Committee on Development and Cooperation a year and a half ago when I said that I and this Commission would take the line of a zero tolerance policy relating to mismanagement and all these problems."
"Everybody agrees on that and what I am doing now is following normal procedures, to the extent that we have such a thing in the Commission."
"But here I am on clear ground."
"I am aware of the problem that Mrs Sauquillo has raised and we are doing everything we can to find a solution which will allow the substance of the cooperation with the NGO world to continue."
"But if some sort of reconstruction is necessary, this is a phase they may have to go through."
"For the time being I am very careful not to stipulate what the outcome ought to be because it is very much in the hands of the owners of CLONG and the many different NGOs all over Europe."
"But we are not turning our backs on them and we expect and hope that future cooperation will be normal and fruitful."
"Question No 41 by (H-0971/00):"
"Subject: Aid to Christians driven out of the Molucca Islands Particular attention should be drawn to the persecution, violence and terror perpetrated against the Christian population of the Molucca Islands in Indonesia by Jihad militants, especially on the island of Ambon, which has resulted in the desecration and burning of churches, Christians being forced to flee en masse, and a large number of deaths."
"I have personally met the Catholic bishop Mondagi from Ambon together with Protestant church leaders."
"The situation is alarming."
"The Indonesian Government and army are duty-bound to guarantee their citizens' safety and lives, regardless of which faith they profess."
"What initiatives and measures has the Commission taken to provide aid to assist the thousands of Christians driven from their homes in the Molucca Islands, particularly on Ambon, in the very vulnerable situation in which they find themselves?"
"ECHO mounted the first operations in the Moluccas in March 1999 when an aid package of EUR 1 million made it possible to set up medical health and food distribution programmes for displaced people from the Ambon and Kai islands."
"The financial decision for Indonesia was signed in December 1999 and EUR 900 000 were used for the continuation of these two programmes."
"Two further emergency operations with a budget of EUR 1.5 million began in March 2000 because the number of displaced persons continued to rise."
"These operations covered the distributions of foodstuffs and first aid and the operations also ensured medical aid and a supply of drinking water to the displaced persons from the archipelago."
"As the conflict has reached the north of the Molucca islands and particularly the island of Halmahera the two NGOs financed by ECHO in Ambon, Medecins sans fronti√®res, Belgium, and Action contre la faim, France, have extended their action to include displaced persons from this island."
"The resumption of violence in May and June last year provoked new displacements all over the archipelago."
"Therefore an emergency aid decision for Indonesia was signed in August 2000 for EUR 2 million."
"It is funding a new programme of assistance for displaced persons with a budget of EUR 600 000 which involves distribution of food and first aid."
"World Mission Germany is carrying out this programme."
"Considering that the situation in the Moluccas remains a cause for humanitarian concern, a new humanitarian aid decision of 2 m was signed on 5 December 2000."
"The decision includes a project for the improvement of the victims' nutritional and health conditions which will be implemented by Action contre la faim, France."
"It also includes a project aiming at ensuring the transport of drinking water which will be carried out by the international committee of the Red Cross."
"So, we are giving high priority to assisting the people who are the victims of this very unfortunate conflict."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Nielson for his answer and for the efforts being made on behalf of all refugees specifically in the Molucca Islands where the largest group is de facto Christian."
"We are concerned here with a total of 300 000 refugees out of a population of 10 million people."
"It is as if all the residents of Sweden' s third largest city, Malm√∂, were to be expelled as refugees."
"I also want to highlight the gravity of the situation for the Christian minority in Indonesia."
"On Christmas Eve, a large number of coordinated bomb attacks against churches - including the cathedral in the capital, Jakarta - took place at a variety of locations in the Indonesian archipelago."
"Indonesia is the world' s fourth largest country in terms of population, as well as being the most heavily populated Muslim country."
"I assume you are following developments there very closely."
"My specific question is this: are there links with Caritas, the Lutheran World Federation and the World Council of Churches with a view to providing aid to the expelled Christian minority, above all in the Molucca Islands?"
"I can answer the last question by saying that the organisations concerned are those I referred to as our partners in implementing humanitarian aid."
"I would also add that a conflict of this kind could escalate if, as providers of humanitarian aid, we were to choose as partners to help us implement the aid, organisations which could be seen as not being neutral in the conflict."
"We are careful to avoid this further problem."
"I understand the nature of the conflict very well indeed, as well as the feelings associated with the conflict because of its nature, but I believe that, in carrying out the task before us, what we are doing is right."
"This aid is very laudable on the one hand, but, could it not also be letting the Indonesian Government off the hook; and should we really not use the political and economic strength of the European Union to force the Indonesian Government to look after its own citizens, especially this Christian minority?"
"There are a number of conflicts within Indonesia."
"They are not all of the same character. This one is different from those conflicts that have arisen from the issue of secession, splitting up Indonesia."
"In fact, we are cooperating with the Indonesian Government, trying not only to insist but also to urge them in a cooperative spirit to do what a government ought to do in handling a problem of this character."
"There is, in my view, a difference between this conflict and the other conflicts in Indonesia and also some difference in the character of the response of the Indonesian Government."
"Here there is the basis of relatively good cooperation with the Government of Indonesia."
"But the conflict itself is extremely nasty and very problematic for everybody, especially the victims of course."
"Question No 42 by (H-0981/00):"
"Subject: Situation of Burundian refugees in Tanzania The food situation in the camps for Burundian refugees does not appear to have improved, according to reports received from the Lukole camp (Ngara), and there are also signs that preparations are being made to repatriate Burundian refugees currently in Tanzania."
"Taking into account the resolution adopted by the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly (ACP¬≠EU 3005/00/fin.), especially paragraph 15 thereof in which it calls ""on the Commission, the Council and the representatives of the Member States in international organisations to take, as a matter of urgency, the necessary measures to alleviate the situation in the camps for Burundian Hutu refugees in Tanzania"" , and bearing in mind that the above resolution was adopted several months ago, can the Commission say what measures it has taken to comply with paragraph 15 of resolution ACP¬≠EU 3005/00/fin.?"
"I am pleased to inform the honourable Member and this House that the Commission has taken and continues to take appropriate measures in relation to the nutrition and repatriation situation of Burundian refugees in Tanzania."
"I visited Tanzania in March 2000 and on that occasion I also went to see camps with refugees from Burundi."
"The overall number of refugees in Tanzania, including those from Burundi, continues to grow."
"By the end of 2000 there were approximately 500 000 refugees in camps in Western Tanzania of whom around 360 000 were Burundians, 110 000 Congolese and the remainder Rwandans, Somalis and other nationalities."
"Through ECHO the Commission funds more than one third of the total humanitarian aid available to refugees in Tanzania."
"In the year 2000, ECHO's budget for aid to Tanzanian refugees was EUR 26.85 m."
"ECHO's level of support is expected to remain substantially the same this year."
"The key partners in Tanzania are the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the UNHCR, UNICEF and the World Food Programme."
"The main objectives of the humanitarian aid are multi-sector care of refugees, feeding, education, health care for children and finally, public health, water and sanitation in the camps."
"As to the standard of nutrition inside the camps, ECHO contributes one third of the total cost of the World Food Programme in Tanzania, which provides a balanced daily ration of 2166 calories per refugee, well over the minimum recommended by the WHO."
"The WFP recently alerted the international community to potential problems of supply, which would be due to delays in funding from sources other than the Commission, and daily rations were temporarily reduced to 80%."
"However, the rations remained adequate in view of the fact that many refugees have access to additional sources of food."
"In 1999, FAO joined the international relief operation by introducing a programme to improve nutrition standards among the most vulnerable households."
"In collaboration with UNHCR, FAO provided 15 000 families in six of the camps with seeds and hand tools in order to plant household and community vegetable gardens."
"Training was given and FAO estimates that more than 50 000 people have benefited directly from the project."
"I have seen this programme and it is in fact so well-organised and so neat that the alternative that we can offer the refugees when they return looks much less organised."
"But, of course, this is what we are going to support."
"Concerning the possible repatriation of Burundian refugees in Tanzania following the signing of the peace agreement at the Arusha Summit, the Commission is maintaining a state of readiness for this eventuality."
"I was myself present at the Burundi donors' conference chaired by Nelson Mandela in Paris in December, which endorsed the peace agreement."
"The Commission is pursuing a twin-track approach."
"Firstly, the current level of humanitarian assistance to refugees will be maintained while they remain in Tanzania."
"Secondly, should the conditions be met for their repatriation - and we are pushing everybody concerned and some who do not think they should be concerned to make this happen - then the funds allocated by ECHO to the Tanzania programme will follow the refugees back home."
"An additional sum of EUR 25 million has been allocated by the Development DG under the Lom√© Convention's Article 255 to assist UNHCR in a planned and orderly repatriation."
"At this stage, the preconditions for an orderly and voluntary repatriation unfortunately are not met."
"This was discussed in ECHO's annual strategic programming meeting with UNHCR in December when it was agreed that repatriation may only take place if all parties are convinced that the security situation inside Burundi is stabilised and sustainable."
"This is a major operation of ours and we want to follow it through to a successful conclusion."
"Commissioner, I think it only fair to thank you for such an exhaustive answer, which to a certain extent reassures me."
"To the same extent as you are reassured, I think, because there is no doubt that the problems of these numerous refugees in Tanzania are severe."
"We had the World Food Programme report, which said that food reserves would run out by the end of the year."
"There is also the need to provide for the training and education of all these refugees, even though they are in an anomalous situation in their lives, precisely so that these years should not be wasted years."
"Therefore, not only is it essential to give humanitarian food aid, but education programmes and health programmes are also needed so that these tragic years for this people will not be wasted years but can be the starting point for better times and especially for the permanent reconciliation of the Burundian people."
"Question No 43 by (H-0984/00):"
"Subject: Conflict Prevention and Peacekeeping in the Developing World How does the Development DG intend to cooperate with the Swedish Presidency on issues related to conflict prevention and peacekeeping in developing countries?"
"Peace building and conflict prevention, management and resolution continue to have a high priority in our policies, and the Commission welcomes the importance attached to those issues by the Swedish Presidency."
"Peace and democratic stability are indispensable preconditions for economic and social progress."
"Conflict prevention is an integral part of the EU's external policy objectives."
"The challenge is now to address in concrete terms the root causes of conflicts and to focus on actions and the implementation of policies."
"The EU's contribution to conflict prevention is greatest where we can use or adapt our different instruments, especially trade and cooperation agreements, development assistance and social and environmental instruments, to tackle causes of conflict."
"The last Development Council, by focusing the objective of development policy on poverty reduction, has laid the basis for addressing one of the major causes of conflict - the widening of disparities in prosperity and poverty."
"Let me again repeat that the HIPC initiative alleviating the debt of the poorest countries is also a very real contribution to conflict prevention."
"Globally, the low level of development assistance is, in my view, the biggest single issue that needs to be addressed if we are to be serious about conflict prevention."
"The Commission has already had numerous discussions with the Swedish Presidency and we share their concerns."
"It was, for example, decided to have a policy debate on conflict prevention in the General Affairs Council on 22 January."
"We agreed that we needed to incorporate the concept of conflict prevention in existing policy instruments to strengthen cooperation with the United Nations, the OSCE and other regional organisations and to find common approaches to cross-border phenomena of destabilisation such as the trade in narcotics, weapons or diamonds."
"We really need better instruments in these fields, of course."
"The Commission will present a communication on conflict prevention this spring."
"It is fully aware of the crucial role of development cooperation in this context."
"We will work closely with the Swedish Presidency to maintain conflict prevention and peacekeeping at the top of our agenda."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the answer is, of course, very satisfactory but I wondered if you were aware Commissioner that the strategic policy planning and early warning units in the Commission has 20 staff, 11 of whom are responsible for the Balkans and only one responsible for Africa which is your responsibility."
"I wonder if you would look at that issue and try to ensure that we have more staff on the ground in these units."
"Also, are you aware that they depend on annual funding which means that they cannot make long-term planning of the kind that you suggested now, so it is important that the Commission looks at these issues."
"Secondly, Commissioner, the whole matter of decentralisation to the delegations: will you be ensuring that in the delegations you have members of staff with expertise to deal with conflict prevention and peace building?"
"The answer is in all honesty ""no"", and everyone knows that the Commission is not in a position, unfortunately, to give a good answer to this kind of question."
"We are in the hands of Members States and this House in our struggle to get enough staff, qualified staff, to do what we are expected and supposed to do."
"But, I am not able to say, ""yes"" we will do this as Mrs Kinnock and I would like."
"That is not so easy."
"On the distribution of people geographically as to their responsibilities in the early warning group and the political bodies we have created to do these things better, I do not think it can be measured only in that way."
"Definitely with the new structure the more cross-cutting, general handling of relations with the ACP countries for instance, the Development DG will be given more emphasis as the division of labour changes between the Development DG and the new cooperation office."
"This is part of our own adjustment to these priorities, and that is definitely the way I will try to improve our efficiency, even on the basis of the given resources."
"As the time allotted to questions to Mr Nielson has elapsed, Questions Nos 44 to 65 will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."

"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0365/2000 by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the common fisheries policy and the challenge of economic globalisation [2000/2027(INI)];"
"A5-0333/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the Community system for fisheries and aquaculture in 1996-1998 [COM(2000) 15 - C5-0109/2000 - 2000/2069(COS)];"
"A5-0332/2000 by Mr Poignant, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission report on the regional meetings arranged by the Commission in 1998-1999 on the common fisheries policy after 2002 [COM(2000) 14 - C5-0110/2000 - 2000/2070(COS)];"
"A5-0367/2000 by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision setting the terms for financial support to Guinea-Bissau in the fisheries sector (renewed consultation) [8263/2000 - C5-0361/2000 - 1998/0355(CNS)];"
"and on the Commission declaration on the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco."
"The Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, has the floor to raise a point of order."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, because yesterday we debated this subject in committee, and especially also on behalf of all the rapporteurs of the reports we are to discuss today, and if the Commissioner, with whom I have spoken, has no objection, and it seems he has not, I should like to ask you if we might first hear the statement from the Commissioner himself and then we the rapporteurs could speak in the order laid down."
"That is what I should like to ask you, Mr President."
"Mr President, I am not going to speak about anything that we are going to debate now, and I apologise for departing from the agenda."
"This very evening I have learnt that ten members of the environmentalist organisation, Greenpeace, ten pacifist environmentalists, have been arrested by the military authorities of the Rock of Gibraltar, because they were trying to get near the submarine Tireless with a placard expressing what I believe everyone thinks: that the sea should not be occupied by nuclear energy."
"These environmentalists are still under arrest, and since Parliament has been, let us say, rather insensitive about safeguarding the interests of the citizens of the Campo de Gibraltar and Algeciras Bay, I ask at least that appropriate steps should be taken so that these pacifist environmentalists can sleep in their own homes."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr Bautista Ojeda, as for sleeping in their own homes, I am not sure if it is feasible that we could achieve that from here at this time, but we take good note of your intervention, which will appear in the Minutes, since I suppose you would also like that to happen."
"Mr Nogueira Rom√°n may take the floor."
"Mr President, it seems appropriate to me that Commissioner Fischler should come before this Parliament today to deal with the Morocco question."
"I think it is entirely appropriate."
"What I think is totally inappropriate is to have merged a debate on four resolutions that the Committee on Fisheries considers highly important for the future of the common fisheries policy with a debate on the Morocco question, which will inevitably take over from the other debates planned."
"I think these are two entirely distinct debates, which should have taken place at separate times during this Strasbourg part-session, and each one should have been given the importance it deserves."
"As that has not happened, we Members above all who have little time will be obliged either not to talk about Morocco or not to talk about the other reports and thus the future of the common fisheries policy, and both options are lamentable."
"Mr Nogueira, our working conditions are lamentable in general."
"We are trying to improve them so that the debates can be conducted more correctly."
"You are aware that there is a working document by the Bureau to discuss this subject."
"But on the specific point that you mention, apart from taking note as is my duty, I can tell you that your group voted in favour of this proposal at the Conference of Presidents."
"Therefore, I understand your arguments, but I would be grateful if you would also pass them on to the Chairman of your own group."
"Mr Cunha has the floor."
"Mr President, I wish to use this point of order to state that I understand the issue raised by Mr Nogueira Rom√°n, but this is a question of timing, as the President said."
"We must understand this."
"This is precisely why I understand and support the issue raised by the Chairman of our Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela Suanzes¬≠Carpegna."
"The truth of the matter is that the Morocco situation is an extremely important issue for many of us and it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to speak right at the beginning of the debate on this issue."
"I would say that, given the political importance of the Moroccan question, strict adherence to protocol on the agenda is of secondary importance."
"I therefore think that it would make sense to arrange the debate as I have suggested."
"Thank you, Mr Cunha."
"I think the best thing to do is to proceed to the debate, and if there is no objection I shall take up the proposal by the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries."
"So, Mr Fischler, the floor is yours."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am, of course, perfectly willing to start by making the requested statement on fisheries relations between the Union and Morocco."
"As you probably already know from the media, negotiations on a new form of collaboration in the fisheries sector were started with the Kingdom of Morocco following my visit to Casablanca in October, when the King of Morocco agreed to begin serious negotiations."
"As a result, a total of six rounds of technical negotiations took place between 30 October and 22 December."
"I then met Prime Minister Youssoufi and Fisheries Minister Chbaatou for talks twice at the beginning of January - once for three days and once for two days."
"I took great pains to ensure that both sides understood the main aspects of future fisheries relations, especially with regard to fishing possibilities, the term of the agreement, technical fishing conditions and, most importantly, financial compensation."
"Negotiations were held nearly every day between the first and second political meetings this year, more recently at technical level."
"We have done a great deal of constructive work and numerous details have been clarified."
"The Commission has endeavoured throughout the negotiations to date to be as flexible as it feels it can be on Morocco's main demands, especially as regards the extent of fishing possibilities and compulsory landings in Moroccan ports."
"We have stated from the start that we are prepared both to take account of Moroccan interests and to support the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector."
"We have also made clear time and again that we want to protect the Community's social and economic interests and are looking for help in preserving resources."
"Unfortunately, the Moroccan side suddenly took a very intransigent stance during my second visit on 8 and 9 January, especially on the important questions of fishing possibilities and technical terms, and made excessive demands for financial compensation."
"I tried to persuade the Moroccan side to reconsider its position, because an agreement was not on the cards on this basis, and I asked them to resume talks as quickly as possible in a bid to reach a final agreement."
"We are prepared to pay a fair price for a balanced agreement, but the price must be in proportion to the fishing possibilities granted by Morocco and I have always clearly given the Moroccan side to understand as much."
"If our Moroccan partners are now prepared to return to the negotiating table and show willing to negotiate, then I am sure that, in the end, we shall broker a solution which is acceptable to both sides."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the question of cooperation with Morocco in the fisheries sector was one of the main points on the agenda for President Prodi's visit to Morocco, when both sides took the opportunity of reaffirming their wish to conclude an agreement."
"It was therefore agreed that we should resume negotiations at a technical level as quickly as possible."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"It is now the turn of the rapporteurs, and I should like to remind them that, despite the temptations, they are rapporteurs and they have to present their reports."
"First, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna."
"Mr President, thank you very much for your understanding."
"I wish to thank Mr Fischler for his statement on the fisheries agreement with Morocco, and I also wish to thank him for all the effort he is putting into these difficult negotiations."
"We all knew they would be difficult and lengthy."
"I should like to remind you here, as he too has said, but I want to stress this, that it is the first time that a President of the European Commission has been personally involved in negotiating a fisheries agreement."
"It must be clear both to the citizens of the European Union and to Morocco that all the institutions in the European Union - and at the highest level - want this agreement: the European Council wants it, and it said so at Nice; the President of the Commission, who has been to Rabat, wants it; and the European Parliament in Strasbourg wants it."
"So, for the time being, the one that does not want it, and I say for the time being, is Morocco, at least on the terms that the European Union is demanding."
"Let us hope that together we can soon manage to persuade them of the mutual benefits of this agreement and thus be able to associate President Prodi with this success."
"I just ask, Mr Fischler, that the negotiations be resumed as soon as possible - immediately if they can be - to make the most of the boost that the President of the European Commission himself has given them."
"As has also been said here, I do not want Morocco to draw our attention away from the extremely important debate that we have here today."
"We have been summoned to debate four major reports to do with the common fisheries policy and its future."
"I am going to focus, naturally, on mine, the one for which I am the rapporteur, but first I should like to congratulate Mr Poignant and Mr Gallagher and also Mr Cunha on the magnificent job they have done."
"I want to point out in relation to the report for which I am the rapporteur that I think it is the first one that a Community institution has drawn up on globalisation in fisheries, and therefore I think our Committee has hit the nail on the head with the two own-initiative reports it has decided to produce; the other one is still in progress."
"In mine, in this report, what I want to stress is this: first of all, Commissioner, the fishing industry in the European Union must start to shake off this almost domestic or almost marginal image that it currently has, perhaps because of the fact that it is confined to peripheral regions or because of the coldness of the Community GDP contribution figures that are always being mentioned."
"We have to recognise the global importance that fishing now has."
"We are becoming more and more dependent on imported fish; we have our own fleet on all the seas and we have enough technical knowledge of our own not to leave this strategic sector in the hands of third countries."
"The 2002 reform, therefore, must not serve just for us to carry on staring at our own navel in the form of our own Community waters, our own problems and our own misfortunes."
"What we really need is a fleet of the right size that is competitive at European and world levels."
"More competitive does not mean more predatory but simply more efficient at using the resources actually available, and doing this better than everyone else."
"The fishing sector is now strategic - and will be more so in the future - as a food reserve: healthy and safe animal proteins for a growing human population."
"We must involve fisheries - and this is also shown by the fisheries agreement with Morocco - in the European Union' s foreign policy and commercial policy."
"Our Union' s foreign fisheries policy has to earn credibility and an image, which it does not yet have, standing before world public opinion as it really is: the policy of a fishing power as compliant as any other with the United Nations principles, that is, the development of the international law of the sea, the conservation of resources for all, cooperation for development, etc."
"Let us therefore make it an active policy, both in fisheries agreements with third countries, adapted to each individual situation, and in the regional fishery organisations, in which we must play a leading role, as we have often said, and let us not resign ourselves to a situation in which the 15 states that today make up the European Union - tomorrow perhaps 20 or 25 - must forever have as much weight as, for instance, Estonia has now."
"The Council of Ministers of the European Union or the United Nations Security Council are examples to bear in mind of voting systems weighted by the specific weight of territories and populations, and we should bear this important example in mind."
"My report states that the European Union has not yet woken up to the importance of its fishery concerns at an international level."
"Admittedly, as I said earlier, its relative importance to the Community GDP is small, but we must not forget that ours is the fourth largest fleet in the world."
"If we total up the processing and marketing industry, subsidiary industries, investment in other countries and specialised shipbuilding, EU fisheries-linked economic activity is the most substantial in the world."
"Other powers, like the United States and Japan, are aware of this and are investing in this sector."
"In the World Trade Organisation we must not be afraid to stand up for our interests, and for our structural aid system too, since not all of it relates directly to fishing: some is aid for conserving and controlling resources, making vessels safer, improving fishery infrastructures and the selective arts of fishing."
"In the WTO we must demand the real liberalisation of port services, the freedom to invest and establish in third countries with full legal guarantees and freedom of access to ports."
"Let us denounce attempts to extend exclusive economic zones and lead the effective fight against flags of convenience."
"All this, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, is the real challenge facing the common fisheries policy from economic globalisation."
"The European Parliament is today offering this report to which I refer as food for thought for everyone on the eve of an historic reform of the common fisheries policy, so that we can all be clear about where we are and where we have to get to."
"Mr President, Commissioner, at the outset I want to acknowledge the assistance which I received from the secretariat of the Committee on Fisheries and indeed from the secretariat of my own group in preparing this report."
"I want to thank Mr Poignant for his cooperation while producing my report."
"Both myself and Mr Poignant had one major preoccupation - to make sure that our reports were not only complementary, but more importantly that they were not contradictory."
"After all they deal with the same subject, and I would like to think that the same spirit will prevail in the House when both reports are voted on tomorrow."
"Under the regulation establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture, the Commission is obliged to report at least every three years to Parliament, the Council and the Community bodies representing the sector on the implementation of measures and developments in the common fisheries policy."
"This report reviews the years 1996 to 1998."
"The timing of the present communication gives it a special significance in that it represents a bridge to the Green Paper to be published on the review of the common fisheries policy."
"Not only is this is an historical snapshot of the past, it is an important indication of the direction of Commission thinking about the future and shape of the CFP after 2002."
"This, of course, is to be welcomed."
"The report covers all aspects of the CFP, including conservation and management of resources, structural policy, external fisheries policy, market policy and monitoring and control."
"In the conclusions to its communication the Commission lists among its priorities: better coherence between the various objectives pursued by the CFP, such as conservation of resources, the economic efficiency of the fleet and securing employment in fisheries - dependent areas, taking account of the economic dimension of fisheries management, better integration of environmental and fisheries policy, improvement of management tools such as multi-annual management objectives and strategies, management of fishing effort, and full integration of the Mediterranean into the Community management regime, a more accountable decision-making process and maintaining the external dimension of the common fisheries policy."
"Many of these points can be endorsed by us, indeed as the Commission acknowledges, a number of these priorities are those which Parliament itself set and has long demanded."
"I would like to underline to you, as I have done in my report, a number of points that I feel strongly about."
"I regret the present unsatisfactory state of fish stocks in relation to technical conservation measures."
"I believe that more progress can still be made."
"In spite of initiatives taken by the Commission to strengthen its dialogue with the industry, I believe that these should be fully reinforced."
"I believe that fishermen must be more involved in the work of scientists in order to establish mutual confidence."
"I have strong suspicions that multi-annual programmes have operated in a discriminatory fashion without producing any major benefits to the fishing sector as a whole."
"I would like to see a uniform inspection regime throughout the Community and the harmonisation of penalties for infringements."
"I want a strict enforcement of the Community control system with regard to third country vessels operating within EU waters."
"I am strongly in favour of a greater regionalisation of the common fisheries policy through the creation of a comprehensive series of regional management units and regional advisory committees based on the use of ICES areas and sub-areas to define the boundary lines."
"In this context, I want to stress that regionalisation of fisheries policy is not in any way the same as renationalisation or fisheries policy."
"It does, however, to use the Commission's own words, involve the participation of stakeholders, and I quote ""in all the three phases of the management process i.e. consultation, decision-taking and implementation of decisions taken""."
"I believe that the lack of cohesion in the regional application of the CFP must inevitably lead to a lack of confidence in the policy and in the Community institutions."
"I believe that it is necessary to define the application of the CFP in a clear and consistent manner, setting out a coherent system of regionalisation."
"I am convinced that this must entail such factors as closer links between fishermen, scientists, the recognition of the socio-economic factors in areas highly dependent on fisheries, flexibility and simplification."
"As I have done on so many occasions in the past, I repeat my call that in order to ensure an appropriate policy of decentralisation it is essential to maintain access to the territorial waters of 12 miles as the exclusive sovereign preserve of the coastal States and to extend this preserve to 24 miles, as previously agreed by this House in February 1999."
"On a personal note I would point out that these last two issues are fundamental to my own country, Ireland."
"I believe that the utmost respect must be paid to the need for social, economic, regional cohesion, and that the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of regions highly dependent on fisheries."
"I want to see the Commission review the application of relative stability so as to take better account of the need for economic, social and regional cohesion."
"There is no doubt in my mind that this must be done without calling into question the fundamental principle itself."
"I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on his report."
"The fact that there are no amendments tabled is a clear indication that we can all agree on this text."
"I am pleased to say that all the ideas contained in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry have been included in the report in one form or another."
"Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has outlined to us in detail the importance of the multi-functional role of the EU fisheries."
"This is something that must be taken into account in future WTO negotiations to ensure that EU producers are not put at a disadvantage."
"The Commission must come up with appropriate negotiation proposals."
"Unlike what was done in relation to agriculture, I would invite Mr Fischler to consult this House on the fisheries proposals."
"In conclusion, I am pleased that Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has recognised the need to take into account social and economic factors, such as employment in coastal areas."
"This must be taken into consideration in the WTO talks and the review of the common fisheries policy, and I welcome the reference to an environmental and health food standard in Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's report."
"I also want to congratulate my colleague Mr Cunha on his report."
"Mr President, the report I am presenting deals with the regional meetings arranged by the Commission in 1998-1999."
"It has been subject to intense and, at times, heated debate in committee, because it is one of the first reports, like those by Mr Gallagher, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and Mr Cunha, to force us to consider the common fisheries policy for 2002 rather than because it is crucial or likely to lead to decisions being made."
"This is a sensitive subject, involving a sector with very specific characteristics and one which affects some quite typical and fairly limited regions in Europe."
"The activities of the sector usually generate a great many jobs both up and downstream, making many regions dependent on fisheries, with no easy alternatives to turn to in times of crisis."
"Everyone in these regions knows that 31 December 2002 will be crucial, since this is the deadline for the common fisheries policy, as in 1992 and 1982, as if we produced a new one every 10 years."
"With a view to forming as rounded an opinion as possible in order to prepare for this deadline, which I believe was a good idea, the Commission organised a systematic consultation process involving everyone associated or involved with this activity, sending out questionnaires and arranging meetings."
"Thirty meetings were held, attended by nearly 1 500 people."
"With regard to the form of proceedings, the method of the report was discussed."
"Some Members would have preferred not to examine the subject in too much depth."
"We debated the matter at great length within the parliamentary committee and, in the end, the Committee on Fisheries went along with the opinion of the rapporteur - as, in my view, there really was no other option - with everyone able to argue their own corner on the subject, just as usual."
"With regard to the substance, however, national and even regional differences within the Member States were seen to be more intense than the rather traditional political differences, and that is why a number of amendments were tabled."
"These amendments show that, although the original positions were sometimes far apart, the political debate allowed groups to be reconciled, leading to an open-minded text which provides a sound starting point, along with the other reports, from which to undertake the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"Looking at the amendments and more generally, most of the provisions voted on in committee adopt the rapporteur' s point of view, with some additional specification or clarification."
"A Green Paper is due to be issued in the coming months - at the end of March of this year, I believe - followed by the legislative text in the course of 2002."
"At the moment, two main schools of thought are discernible."
"The first would like to see a thorough re-evaluation of the entire system and all the foundations, past and present, of the common fisheries policy."
"The second, while avoiding a complete re-examination of the existing foundations, would like to see the system clarified, amended and improved so that the fisheries sector can develop while, of course, preserving fish resources."
"Quite obviously, the European fisheries sector has to deal with the problems that most other fishing industries throughout the world are currently experiencing. They do not affect just our continent or our waters."
"Overfishing reduces stocks, catch sizes and revenue, and is the main threat as far as the future of resources and the fishing industry proper are concerned."
"Increased competition, associated with the globalisation of the market in fishery products, is a further problem."
"If the fisheries industry is to become more competitive, it will depend on the sector' s ability to adapt in order to face up to the constraints imposed by both the state of its resources and by commercial demand."
"The common fisheries policy is the European Union' s management tool for regenerating the fisheries industry and aquaculture."
"This policy was drawn up in order to manage a common resource and to respect the commitments laid down in the first European Treaties."
"The report, therefore, expresses views on the four aspects of the common fisheries policy, which are conservation and management of resources, structural policy, market organisation and relations with third countries."
"Review of the main areas of the Union' s fisheries policy is called for throughout."
"That is the guiding principle."
"The precautionary principle, the latest thing, so to speak, is clearly included, as is the commitment to developing a responsible fisheries policy."
"In particular, I would like to highlight some suggestions, especially maintaining the status quo position on the 6/12-mile zone; maintaining boxes after scientific checks have been carried out along with, inevitably, the issue of access to the North Sea, which will be more difficult in view of our enlargement plans; maintaining the system of TACs and quotas, on condition that they be reviewed; vigilance regarding individual transferable quotas and a thorough review of the Multiannual Guidance Programmes; harmonising inspections and infringements and, of course, committing to fisheries agreements and action programmes specifically designed for the Mediterranean."
"I should like to finish by adding, as Mr Gallagher said, that we do not wish to see regionalisation become renationalisation nor do we wish for further social measures to be introduced into the common fisheries policy."
"Perhaps Mr Gallagher and I have given the impression that we are repeating ourselves."
"Politics involves repeating oneself and contradicting oneself."
"We have opted to repeat ourselves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I simply wish to ask for your understanding so that before I embark on the subject of my report, I may take a minute to speak about Morocco. I should like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Fischler for the commitment he has demonstrated in the negotiations to renew the fishing agreement with Morocco, but these thanks should also go to the Commission's entire Directorate-General for Fisheries."
"From the start of the negotiations we were faced with intransigence on the part of the Moroccan negotiators, who presented arguments such as ""the sustainability of fishing stocks"" to reduce access for the European Union' s fishing fleet."
"However, we know that these were not the real arguments, since they did not apply the same criteria to other third countries with which they concluded agreements nor to private agreements with various operators, including some from the European Union."
"Given the importance of the agreement with Morocco to the European Union' s fishing industry, this issue should have immediately been raised as a matter of great political priority within the European Council itself, in the Foreign Affairs Council and, of course, in the Fisheries Council."
"My impression is that Commissioner Fischler and his staff stood practically alone in this struggle, apart from one important but isolated speech by the President of the Commission."
"It is incomprehensible, given that the European Union is home to so many millions of Moroccans and that we have provided that country with so many trade concessions to ensure its products access to our market, that they should have reciprocated our openness and cooperation so little."
"This meant that the Community authorities at the highest level had major political trump cards to play, with the help of those Member States most closely concerned."
"We see now, however, that these cards were not played."
"Why was this the case?"
"In time we will see why, but in any event, I fervently hope that we can rapidly negotiate a reasonable agreement."
"Let us now proceed to the subject of my report, which is Guinea¬≠Bissau."
"The protocol governing fishing arrangements between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea¬≠Bissau was signed in June 1997 and came into force in December of that year, remaining valid until June this year."
"Following an armed conflict in that country in 1998, the Commission presented to the Council and Parliament a proposal for a decision requesting that this agreement be suspended."
"Parliament' s Gir√£o Pereira report, at the beginning of 1999, considered the Commission' s proposal to be justified and legitimate and delivered a favourable opinion."
"Parliament thereby authorised the suspension of the agreement for the duration of hostilities, after which the suspension would be lifted and the Government of Guinea¬≠Bissau would be given help for ad hoc support actions for the local fishing industry, for infrastructure and for monitoring activities."
"As a result of certain procedural and legal problems raised by a previous Commission proposal, the Commission is now tabling a new proposal."
"The purpose of this new text, as with the previous one, but using a different legal formula, is to grant the legitimate authorities of Guinea¬≠Bissau a sum equivalent to the unpaid part of the financial compensation laid down in the agreement currently in force, which totals around EUR 6.5 million and which is intended solely for supporting local fishing activities, for improving monitoring measures and for reconstructing fisheries infrastructure damaged in the intervening period."
"On the basis of a programme of actions proposed by the Government of Guinea-Bissau, the Commission will pay over 50% of the compensation that has been provided for and will pay the balance when the government of that country has submitted a detailed report on the progress of the actions it has proposed and the results that have been achieved. This report is due to be submitted to the Commission by 31 May 2001."
"The date for payment may, however, have to be postponed if major problems are encountered in the organisation of Guinea-Bissau' s administration, that is, its government, following this armed conflict."
"Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries has therefore approved the date of 31 May 2003 as the final deadline for the processing of payments instead of the initial proposal of May 2001."
"Therefore, given that the Commission' s proposal is basically the same as the one to which we gave our assent in March 1999, given that the amount of money stipulated is exactly the same and given that the proposal has precise objectives, I, as rapporteur, feel that Parliament should deliver a favourable opinion on this proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I trust that we have not bitten off more than we can chew this late in the day because this first fisheries debate of 2001 really is a far-reaching debate."
"It gives me special pleasure, Commissioner Fischler, to be able to welcome you here today."
"For a long time, fisheries debates were held in Strasbourg on Fridays."
"This year we have done away with Fridays and brought the debate forward to Tuesday, and while many Members are still not listening to us today, you at least are here and I thank you for that."
"The new year is a time of hope and expectation, especially for our fishermen."
"I need only mention the reform of the common fisheries policy and the Commission's eagerly awaited Green Paper."
"However, I am forced to admit that the worry lines on my fellow Members' brows and - as far as I can see from here, on your brow, too, Mr Fischler - are still as deep as ever."
"One reason must surely be the continuing and difficult negotiations on the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"I am afraid that there is still no light at the end of that particular tunnel."
"The Commission's cautious and diplomatic approach - if I may express it thus - be it on your part, Mr Fischler, or on the part of Commission President Prodi, has met with little response and hence no real progress on the other side - I am tempted to say the opposing side."
"I think that is a crying shame because I want an agreement although, let there be no mistake, I do not want an agreement at any price."
"The financial framework is limited and EU payments must be in proportion to the benefits granted in return."
"In the final analysis, the Kingdom of Morocco needs to take a realistic and trustworthy approach."
"Otherwise, Morocco's obstructionist stance hitherto may well come back to haunt it, because fisheries are not the only link between Morocco and the EU."
"The EU should not be the bull in diplomacy's china shop, but nor should it merely be an irritating fly buzzing around."
"The next round of financial compensation for Spanish and Portuguese fishermen is coming up."
"It really is time we started thinking about and naming alternatives, however drastic they may be, because aid cannot and should not be a permanent solution."
"We are looking forward, at last, to taking a closer look at the study on the cost-benefit analysis of the fisheries agreement and drawing the necessary conclusions."
"Mr Gallagher addresses this particular point in his report."
"We had an initial presentation an awfully long time ago and after that mum was the word."
"But we must watch out - it could be the calm before the storm, because there is every sign of a storm brewing."
"But first I should like to thank Pat Gallagher for his excellent report."
"As one of our most active comrades-in arms in the Committee on Fisheries, he has yet again done a creditable job."
"There really is no longer any need to make a point of stressing just how important an analysis of measures and developments is, especially in view of the reform of the entire fisheries policy."
"But just what will the Commission's long-awaited Green Paper propose?"
"The objective - on this we are clear - must be to reconcile the need to improve fish stocks with the social and economic importance of fisheries, in which case it is vital for interest groups to be more involved and, given the considerable shortcomings now coming to light in the agricultural sector alone, for example as the result of BSE, it also means finding a new, attractive way of marketing fish as a healthy, protein-rich food."
"As I am sure you are all aware, a huge programme of work awaits us."
"I am looking forward to a stimulating and controversial debate in the interest of the future of European fisheries."
"In any case, I think we should not slacken in our efforts."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Fischler for having come before this House."
"He is here because, at the Conference of Presidents, the Group of the Party of European Socialists asked him to come. May I remind you, Commissioner, that in October 1999, a month before the agreement expired, you said here that you ""would do everything in your power to find a solution"" and that you ""would get your feet wet"" ."
"Fourteen months later it is the Community fleet that is getting wet, but the water is up to its neck."
"But I am not one to blame you."
"I believe you have done what it was within your power to do, which really was very little."
"The problem for me is that there has not been a concerted effort by the various Commission services, and there has not been enough political pressure from the Council, and what is worse, in my opinion, is that there has been no clear thinking, skill or hard work in parallel by the government of the country most affected."
"Mr Varela, I believe Mr Prodi' s visit - which I think was very positive - rather than reassuring the sector has made it more worried, precisely because of the moment in the process when it took place."
"Such are the doubts and vacillations that the sector feels at the moment."
"The sector keeps on repeating that it does not want an agreement at just any price, and it is afraid that an agreement will be signed just to save face."
"The sector says that what the Moroccans are offering - the technical conditions that they want the Community fleet to submit to - is unacceptable, and there are a number of limitations on freezer trawlers and shrimp vessels that are unacceptable."
"I think the Moroccan authorities need a clear message from the Union."
"The Union would like to have fair cooperation with its partners, and now we all realise that we would have gained a lot if the Moroccan Government had responded in time to Community appeals."
"It is unacceptable that for 14 months the Moroccan Government repeated that it did not want an agreement, and now they are trying to blame you, Mr Fischler, for the failure to conclude one and for the negotiations having broken down."
"The result will be that the next Austrians - like yourself - or Swedes who negotiate in Rabat will think that what the Moroccans want is exactly the opposite of what they are thinking or saying."
"This whole absurd process, which has been going on now for 14 months, is not having any positive effects for one simple reason: because in certain sectors in the Union it is generating a rejection of the European Union itself."
"Here we spend days on end discussing the Union' s democratic deficit and good governance, and then, when we have a subject on our hands that directly affects more than 4 000 fishermen, we pretend not to see what is obvious and not to do what any government would do to stand up for such an important part of its productive fabric."
"There are some who say that President Prodi should have blocked not just fisheries cooperation but the whole MEDA II programme."
"With regard to the Poignant and Gallagher reports, which bring forward many points for debate on the forthcoming reform of the CFP, I think that if a number of amendments are approved we shall be able to achieve two balanced resolutions and correct some contradictions."
"But a balanced agreement - such as the one we should reach on the Green Paper - does not mean that it is a compromise between various extreme positions but rather a coherent report endorsing the future of the whole sector and the viability of fishing as an economic activity throughout the European Union."
"The balance that we socialists desire can only be achieved through a fisheries policy based on scientific criteria and adapted to the market, with the suppression of the political discrimination that still persists."
"The reform process must be participatory, in the words of Mr Poignant, whom I congratulate on his work, performed under difficult conditions."
"His report reveals many of the problems that we are going to have to discuss during the process of reforming the common fisheries policy."
"He has supplied many solutions, for instance the socio-economic aspect of fishing, the development of the social aspects of the CFP, and the updating of criteria that define regions as fishery-dependent."
"The Gallagher report is also interesting in that it refers to social aspects or regards agreements with third countries as a fundamental part of the CFP."
"We are requesting clear legal and scientific opinions on access restrictions."
"We believe that the reform of the CFP should not contain any discriminatory element whether political or based on nationality."
"Our amendments support keeping the current 6/12 mile zone."
"Lastly, I should like to congratulate Mr Varela - and also Mr Cunha - for the excellent report on the challenge of globalisation and the dangers that certain aspects of it pose for the Community fisheries sector."
"The international side of the CFP, our ever more necessary participation in multilateral organisations, is a challenge that still awaits us."
"This question is going to return and be debated many more times in this House."
"I congratulate Mr Varela on his political foresight, which could almost be called poetic."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on the excellent work that they have done."
"I speak specifically of the issue of regional management of the common fisheries policy."
"In fact the term zonal management better expresses the kind of development that we would like to see implemented."
"This would involve much fuller participation in decision making by all those with a direct interest in each of the ICES divisions, whether engaged in fishing, fish processing, science or conservation."
"If such a system were already in place we would not be facing the difficulties we face at present over the Commission's proposals for a cod recovery plan for the North Sea."
"It is the clear view of those most directly involved that, as initially announced, the plan would have both a disastrous effect on the industries concerned and an adverse effect on cod stocks, and this view is supported by conservationists."
"The Scottish MEPs are most grateful to the Commissioner for meeting us and for his assurances that these proposals are not yet firm ones."
"A great deal of work has been done locally, both in Scotland and around the North Sea, on conservation measures in general and on cod recovery in particular."
"I hope that the Commission will take the results of this work very seriously indeed."
"In particular, I would ask it to abandon the idea of requiring 140 mm mesh size and also to recognise the extent to which the Scottish fleet depends on a mixed fishery."
"Accordingly, instead of imposing blanket restrictions on some 15 000 square miles of the North Sea, I trust that it will opt for seasonal closures in areas where the cod concentration is high."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it was inevitable that the Gallagher and Poignant reports would not only comment on the past but would focus in detail on the CFP review, and I consider it entirely appropriate that the MEPs should seek to influence the review process in advance of any formal consultation with Parliament."
"I contend that the principal objective of the CFP, namely the conservation of fish stocks, has not been realised and as a result we have had to face dramatic year-on-year fluctuations in quotas, as exemplified by the current cod crisis."
"In addition, we must re-examine the process by which, and the level at which, decisions are made."
"Various amendments tabled with my name attached seek to establish certain important principles for the CFP review, including that relative stability should remain since the good reasons for its inclusion as a founding principle remain valid."
"That in the light of experience with areas like the Shetland Box, specially protected areas based on scientific advice should continue in the future."
"And a system of zonal management should be established based on the ICES areas and with representation from fishing, science and conservation interests able to participate meaningfully, not to renationalise the CFP, not to take away power from the Council or the Commission but to allow each Member State with quotas in a particular zone to assist in devising and recommending controls which are relevant, appropriate to these areas and, therefore, more likely to succeed."
"Recent events have led to even greater lack of faith within Scotland in the decision-making processes and in the structure of the CFP itself."
"How can, for example, the Commission justify continuing levels of industrial fishery and even increases in white fish by-catch while on the other hand reducing quotas of fish for human consumption?"
"Let us use the opportunities arising from the review of the CFP to achieve a solution which works."
"I challenge the Commission and the Council to look seriously at zonal management within a framework of Community-wide objectives, of course, but so that interested parties can participate more fully and so that the new CFP, once agreed, can actually achieve its purpose, namely the long-term sustainability of European fisheries."
"Mr President, the excellent work done by Mr Poignant and Mr Gallagher deserves recognition, but I sincerely believe that their zeal - and they are people with vast experience and knowledge of the sector - has in some respects led them to go beyond the subject of their reports."
"The problem is that the amendments emphasised this view, and generally in some respects they have even come to approve contradictory points."
"I hope that in tomorrow' s votes these issues may be calmly corrected, because my group would like to vote for both these reports."
"As for the matter of fisheries and globalisation, it must be recognised that the low level of Community self-sufficiency in fisheries products has encouraged the liberalisation of trade sooner and more fully than in other sectors. While the nature of fishing itself, the growing nationalisation of fisheries or other circumstances may have their own particular features, they also have effects similar to those of globalisation and can have an especially hard social impact, with sometimes serious effects on working conditions or the displacement of fishery-related activities."
"I think the excellent Varela report points out corrective measures for these negative effects."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Cunha."
"Finally, on the subject of Morocco I want to point out two things: first, the negative effects that the lack of agreement is having and will have in disadvantaged areas of the Community both on the fishermen themselves and on fishery-related dependent activities."
"Because they are disadvantaged areas, restructuring activities stand very little chance of success."
"The second point is that the attitude of the Moroccan negotiators hardly squares with that of a state linked with us through an association agreement."
"In this situation it is to be hoped that the Commission will be able to make the Moroccan authorities understand that the association can only be based on reciprocity, and that, if necessary, it will be able to adopt suitable measures."
"What the media is saying is that if there is agreement, it may even be highly detrimental to the interests of the European Union."
"I should like there to be an agreement, and I hope the Commission will be able to assert its right to reciprocity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to draw your attention to a point that I believe constitutes an omission in the common fisheries policy."
"It is important that this should be considered in the reform to be initiated in 2002, since it concerns the situation of fishing in the outermost regions."
"It is also important that the common fisheries policy should take account of the amendment made in the Treaty of Amsterdam and highlight the potential that flows from their situation. This applies particularly to Portugal, with its outermost regions, the Azores and Madeira, but also to the French and Spanish outermost regions."
"The European Union has an opportunity to draw up an exclusive economic zone in these particularly less-favoured regions, and this strategic value in this field must be emphasised for the future."
"With regard to Morocco, we are grateful for the information that the Commissioner has just given us, although for the Portuguese this is scant consolation."
"The situation in Portugal is that 40 boats have remained inactive since December 1999 and if the agreement is concluded one day, many of these businesses may by then have become unviable."
"I therefore support the remarks made by Arlindo Cunha and Rosa Migu√©lez Ramos to the effect that both the Council and the Commission must attempt to adopt a more dynamic approach in their dialogue with the Moroccan Government."
"In general terms, we have maintained an attitude of prudent optimism towards the revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002."
"It is widely known that the view from Portugal is highly critical, because whereas fishing should be a source of employment, the Portuguese experience is that the common fisheries policy has been a source of unemployment."
"We hope that maintaining the quotas, which was decided on this year, is a first positive sign for the future. We are particularly interested in the fact that attention has been paid to the feeling of discrimination that has emerged from consultations held in recent years, and the fact that the problem of planning and development has been given due consideration."
"Lastly, as Mr Gallagher has pointed out, we would like to see an exclusion zone of 24 miles for coastal fishing."
"Mr President, I still have my doubts as to the methods used, especially in Mr Poignant' s report, and I still believe that the opinions of the fisheries sector expressed at the regional meetings deserve a more thorough examination."
"In addition, Mr Gallagher and Mr Poignant have presented views in many cases contrary to the measures that the CFP should contain."
"We cannot fail to recognise the effort that has been made a posteriori to try to unify viewpoints, but the European People' s Party believes that in some fundamental areas there are still some clear contradictions."
"We have therefore tabled a series of amendments above all to try to eliminate the impression that Parliament does not have a definite attitude towards the future of the CFP, because that is not the case."
"It may be that we do not agree on specific measures, but if something comes out of these reports it is that Parliament is in total agreement with the fisheries sector in that the CFP requires some fundamental changes."
"I therefore ask for our amendments to be approved, because far from entering yet again into sterile discussions they reflect this desire for change and the need for careful thinking about the fisheries policy, with our sights set on the future and not the past."
"If there were no clear need for this, the Council of Ministers last month would have given some indication that this were the case."
"Things cannot go on like this."
"The fundamental flaws that have encumbered the CFP since the beginning have to be paid for by the industry at the end of every year with a series of increasingly brutal cuts to its operations."
"When you come to the extremes that have been reached this year, you have to wonder what economic sector could survive with these rules of play."
"If resource levels are getting worse and worse, it is because a sequence of failures in the policy that governs fishing not only allows it to happen but actually causes it."
"A sector constrained by a series of outdated, contradictory and often incomprehensible rules can only have very limited responsibility in this state of things, and yet it alone has to pay the price."
"The CFP is in need of very far-reaching changes that will provide solutions for a fishing industry which, unlike the rules which govern it and even despite them, has managed to survive and has done everything it can to evolve and continue to provide coastal regions with wealth and jobs."
"That is why I must again stress that, when there is evident dissatisfaction with the resources policy, the brilliant results of which we have just seen yet again at December' s Council meeting, with a TAC system that encourages discards, when issues such as relative stability and freedom of access have yet to be resolved, not to mention the matter of bringing the only Community policy that still discriminates on grounds of nationality into line with the Treaties, the Commission cannot seriously propose a draft Green Paper like the one it has drawn up."
"If the Commission really believes that the future of European fisheries depends not on the simple modification of a regulation, but on the proposal of measures already contained in current regulations, if the Commission' s great proposal and great discovery for the future CFP is to be multiannual TACs and the encouragement of aquaculture, perhaps the moment has come, Mr President, to ask in all seriousness for it to make room for other people who can bring in new ideas and the tiniest sense of responsibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, very briefly and concisely, to make three observations on the planned revision of the common fisheries policy."
"My first point concerns access to waters and to internal resources."
"Maintaining the traditional activities of every fishing community should be one of the European Union' s main concerns."
"I therefore feel that it is crucial to at least preserve exclusive access to so-called ""territorial waters"" , particularly given that activities involving small-scale fishing have a considerable effect on the coastal resources of every Member State."
"My second point relates to the principle of relative stability and the full use of fishing rights obtained outside Community waters."
"The principle of relative stability is a fundamental pillar of the common fisheries policy."
"However, the application of this principle to fishing quotas obtained by the European Union through financial compensation, either in agreements with third countries or in waters governed by regional fishing organisations, may lead to perverse situations."
"For example, the Community is not taking full advantage of the quotas that it obtained with such difficulty in the waters of some third countries, even though there are Member States keen to use them."
"Therefore, although the so-called agreements ""with southern countries"" lay down that once Member States have made use of their respective fishing rights, the unused part should be made available to all interested Member States, this mechanism is not implemented under the so-called agreements ""with northern countries"" ."
"The European Union is not making full use of the fishing quotas for the open sea that it has obtained through regional fishing organisations, even though there are Member States that are keen to take over the quantities that are not caught by the ""highest bidders"" , as they are called."
"They are thus exposing themselves to the risk that their share will be reduced once a review of quotas allocated to the parties involved takes place."
"My third point relates to the role of the European Union on the international stage."
"Since the Union as a whole is a world-class fishing power and one of the largest markets for fish produce, it must claim and adopt a role that matches its importance in international organisations and specifically in regional fishing organisations."
"I am very grateful for the Commissioner' s speech and I urge him to use the power of all 15 Member States in negotiations with Morocco and not simply to argue the case for Portugal and Spain."
"Mr President, the common fisheries policy, as many have pointed out, has failed to conserve fish stocks at adequate levels to support a viable industry."
"This is due, at least in part, to the conflicting nature of some of the objectives of the CFP as laid down in Regulation 3760/92."
"It is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both the market and industry while conserving resources."
"When the CFP is revised next year it is essential that the conservation of fish stocks and the protection of the marine habitat be made its primary and overriding objective, and the only way to do this is to implement a rigorous and comprehensive precautionary approach to fisheries management."
"The precautionary approach should mean that before any stock can be fished on a commercial basis there must be, at the very least, a scientific assessment of the stock and a conservatively-based total allowable catch."
"In other words, the current pillage of certain types, certain deep-water stocks by some EU countries would not be allowed to happen."
"It means that any new fishing gear or any significant modification of existing gear must be evaluated for its potential impact on the target stock as well as any species caught as by-catch or any impact on the marine habitat."
"It means being conservative when one decides the level at which one wants to maintain a fish stock."
"The use of maximum sustainable yield or any of a number of other reference points is quite simply wrong, for they lead to over-fishing and stock collapse."
"Targets and limited reference points must be established which will maintain the fish stock at a high enough level that the risk of stock depletion or collapse is insignificant."
"The best definition to date of the precautionary approach is the one contained in the UN fish stocks agreement, and many of these and other principles are defined there."
"The EU has accepted these ideas for some stocks and I think it is high time that it implemented them for its own stocks."
"A number of things have been said already about Morocco and I just want to say that we would insist that it is entirely up to Morocco, as a coastal state with sovereignty over its fish and its exclusive economic zone, to decide what it wishes to do with these resources."
"We are therefore opposed to any kind of political or economic pressure being brought to bear on Morocco in order to encourage it or to coerce it to sign an agreement with the European Union."
"Secondly, we are adamant that no potential agreement with Morocco should involve any access to waters of Western Sahara."
"We do not recognise Moroccan sovereignty there and so Morocco has no right whatsoever to discuss access to EU vessels there, nor for that matter has the EU any right to enter into such negotiations with Morocco or to allow EU flag vessels to go there as has happened in the past."
"Mr President, the socio-economic importance of the fishing industry is well known, not only for the jobs that it creates directly and indirectly, but also for the economic development of many fishing regions and communities, including the small coastal fishing sector that ensures the European Union' s supply of fresh fish and the preservation of its traditions and cultures."
"Nevertheless, as has been confirmed at regional conferences, there is profound criticism of the common fisheries policy, both with regard to the TAC system and quotas and with regard to the system of Multiannual Guidance Programmes, which have led to discrimination and have not brought any major benefits to the industry."
"This makes it essential that Member States which have achieved their objectives should not be penalised through further reductions of their fishing effort whilst other countries have not achieved the objectives laid down in previous MAGPs."
"It has also become clear that most of those working in the fishing industry harbour doubts about scientific opinions on the management and conservation of fish products, although they do not question the need to conserve species."
"What is needed, therefore, is a thorough review of the common fisheries policy, involving fishermen and other interested parties in the decision-making process, to ensure that their experience and knowledge can contribute to the creation of a more workable and realistic system."
"We need appropriate structural measures to guarantee the survival of communities dependent on fishing and socio-economic measures that improve the standard of living of fishermen, who must not suffer as a result of possible measures to protect species, as has happened to the sardine fishermen in the north of Portugal."
"We must also take account of the specific nature of the outermost regions and it is particularly important, as the Gallagher report states, that we move towards extending the exclusion zone to 24 miles, which is, in fact, something on which Parliament has already taken a decision."
"With regard to current negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, it must be emphasised, as it is in the Varela Suanzes¬≠Carpegna report, that Community fishing activity cannot be analysed from a purely economic angle based on trade in goods."
"Fishing in the European Union is multifunctional in nature; it contributes towards the integration of the social and economic fabric of coastal areas, representing a way of life and a factor for cohesion in large areas along our coastline, while at the same time guaranteeing food supply."
"I also wish, Mr President, to mention international fishing agreements, which have a fundamental role in supplying the European market by means of the European fishing fleet."
"What is of particular concern, however, is the information that we have received not only on the delay in the fishing agreements with Angola, but also on the difficulties in renewing the fishing agreement with Morocco."
"We need more than just a rehashed explanation. What we need is the adoption of measures that will guarantee the protection of fishermen and the rights of shipowners who are caught up in this situation, as is currently happening in Portugal."
"Mr President, 2001 is the year in which the Commission is to draft a new common fisheries policy."
"In my view, it is of utmost importance that the Commission should actively involve the fisheries industry itself in the preparatory activities leading up to its decisions."
"When translating research results into catch restrictions, the Commission should not only take the advice of scientists, but also the fishermen. If not, imposing total allowed catches and quotas will meet with unnecessary resistance from them."
"Fishermen, especially in the Netherlands, recognise the benefit of catch restrictions, provided there is a good reason for them."
"A bad example is the recent catch restriction imposed on Dutch fishermen for plaice and sole, which will set them back EUR 35 million."
"This is a restriction which, according to the European Fisheries Council, is required in order to protect cod, whilst biologists claim that such recommendations were never made and that this was a political decision."
"European fishermen are active in very different waters."
"This requires a regional approach which is entirely in compliance with the European Union' s principle of subsidiarity."
"That means that in the case of the Netherlands, it will develop the policy for the North Sea in conjunction with other North Sea countries."
"These countries will decide whether the fragile system of the North Sea can accommodate ships from other regions."
"If the Union insists on other ships having access to the North Sea, the quoting of as yet unquoted fish species would be a real way of keeping additional catches of quoted fish within limits."
"Finally, I would echo rapporteur Gallagher in his request for a cost-benefit analysis of fisheries agreements which the Commission concludes with third countries."
"Do all Member States benefit proportionately from spending Community funding in this way?"
"I doubt it very much."
"Mr President, when we discuss the excellent reports by my colleagues Mr Varela, Mr Cunha, Mr Poignant and Mr Gallagher, it is against a background of crisis in the EU fisheries sector."
"As we contemplate the radical reforms of the CFP, which are clearly necessary and long overdue and which are highlighted in these reports, we do so in the knowledge that fish stocks are in spiral decline."
"Too many fishermen are chasing too few fish."
"As a result, EU fishing fleets are shrinking and many thousands of jobs are being lost at sea and on shore."
"The situation in the North Sea is of particular concern."
"Savage cuts in the total allowable catches and quotas were announced in December by the Council."
"Now the Commission is seeking to implement emergency interim measures to aid the recovery of cod stocks, which have fallen to unsustainable levels in that sector."
"I am extremely grateful, like my colleagues, the other Scottish MEPs, to Commissioner Fischler for agreeing to meet us earlier this evening to discuss these dramatic emergency measures."
"We welcome Mr Fischler's generous offer to meet with leaders of the industry to discuss alternatives to the draconian proposals which have been widely publicised by the Fisheries DG in the last few days."
"A sensible, multiannual cod recovery plan embracing realistic technical conservation measures, the closure of cod spawning grounds and the decommissioning of the larger new fishing vessels will surely be more sensible than the pursuit of a plan which would allow industrial fishing to continue in vast restricted zones and which would potentially lead to the bankruptcy of half the Scottish fleet."
"The Poignant and Gallagher reports have attracted some amendments, which seek to do away with the 6/12 mile limits and break open the Shetland Box and gain free access to the North Sea."
"Clearly there are some Member States that still regard the resources of the North Sea as a rich prize."
"I hope that this debate may bring them to their senses."
"Mr President, how should and how will the European Union's common fisheries policy look after 2002?"
"This question has stirred the emotions of everyone involved in fisheries for some time now."
"The Poignant and Gallagher reports are important milestones in the preliminary debate."
"The actual debate on reform will, however, not start until the Commission's Green Paper has been submitted within the next few months although, quite understandably, representatives of highly disparate fisheries interests in the European Union are already trying to influence the preparatory process within the Commission."
"A great many demands have been made on the Commission."
"I think it is still too early for the European Parliament to commit itself one way or another."
"We should confine ourselves, within the framework of these two reports, to addressing the problems and discussing various possible solutions."
"Both rapporteurs have done a great deal of work and have highlighted the basic problems of the common fisheries policy and I am grateful to them for that."
"I should like to single out just three of these basic problems."
"First, the problem of access to waters, which should at least be re-examined as part of the reform."
"Protection zones must be defined on the basis of scientific studies and the relevant conclusions must be drawn from their results."
"Secondly: regionalisation is another catchword which repeatedly gives rise to controversial debate."
"But regionalisation does not mean some form of renationalisation."
"We have a common fisheries policy in the EU and that is how it is going to stay."
"Thirdly: I should like to finish by again highlighting how important it is for the whole fisheries sector - fishermen, science, industry and so on - to be involved in the forthcoming reform process."
"This is the only way we shall be able to ensure that the new common fisheries policy is well accepted by those whom it affects."
"Mr President, European Union fisheries policy is a vast subject."
"I would like to tackle it from the point of view of globalisation and in relation to the specific problem of Guinea-Bissau."
"As far as the Group of the Greens is concerned, I would remind you that we are in favour of a fisheries policy that respects the natural balance, in favour of developing offshore and inshore fishing, which creates jobs, and in favour of selective fishing, which takes account of available stocks."
"This is a question of achieving economic growth to satisfy businesses as well as protecting social aspects."
"We are against granting subsidies that encourage excessive industrial fishing, which catches everything indiscriminately, to the point of wiping out species and harming food safety and biodiversity, a fisheries policy which allows fleets to grow out of all proportion, and so forth."
"Because of this, we consider that untrammelled market forces represent one of the factors leading to such over-investment and that these issues should be taken into consideration in the next round of WTO trade negotiations on liberalisation."
"We therefore request that the Commission present appropriate proposals, both on the issue of the future direction of the subsidised sectors and on social aspects to the other members of the WTO."
"Furthermore, we are, generally, not particularly in favour of the bilateral fishing agreements between the European Union and third countries, often small countries, whose entire budgets are occasionally no larger than the subsidies granted them."
"It is essential that we remain as integrated as possible."
"However, we accept that a reserve of EUR 6.5 million was allocated to Guinea-Bissau, given that it is assigned to an action programme which will support the local fishing industry, infrastructure and controls and that a detailed report on how these funds are being used will be submitted to Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Varela on his far-sighted report, which was accepted by the entire committee, and Mr Cunha, who has also done an excellent job."
"However, it cannot be denied that, as has already been mentioned, the points and issues we are discussing today are the same as those dealt with by the Gallagher and Poignant reports."
"I will not go back over the technical reasons why these issues are sensitive: the 6/12 mile limits, protected areas, maintaining the principle of relative stability, regionalisation which can somehow be interpreted as renationalisation."
"I, too, see the nature of these issues as very specific and share the view stressed by my fellow Members that they are sensitive."
"With regard to this, I repeat that, for the very reason that we are going through a period of reform - and if we are carrying out reforms then it is because our current strategy is not working or the possibility of reform would not arise - we must be very aware that we cannot leave everything as it is, nor, moreover, can we continue to be inconsistent in our recommendations."
"In this regard, the Group of the European People' s Party has tabled amendments aimed precisely at achieving greater coherence between the positions."
"I would, however, make one entreaty to the Commissioner and to all of us: it is important that a balance is found, for a major political reason apart from anything else."
"At the last part-session in December, we all - Commission and Parliament - criticised Nice because the countries' desire to protect their own national interests took root once again and we condemned that Council for placing the Community method in crisis."
"Now we must work to ensure that a common policy is genuinely achieved in this typical sector, but in order to do so we must respond to those who are complaining - namely the operators - that there is insufficient participation or backing for the choices made, therefore that there is no cooperation in the decision-making process."
"If we do this, we will be able to prove - and I am convinced that we are capable of doing so - that it is possible to achieve a sound common policy, valuing differences rather than penalising them and involving the operators of all the Member States, particularly the fisheries operators in all their diversity."
"Mr President, it is always comforting to see the same few faces at every fishing debate and I would like to reassure the Commissioner and colleagues and friends that we may be small in numbers but we all have an active interest in fishing and no matter how late the debate is, rest assured we will be there."
"The reform of the CFP and the forthcoming launch of the Green Paper mark a critical time for the fishing industry."
"On the one hand all of us here in this Chamber want to see the existence of the fishing industry, not least because we enjoy eating the product; but on the other hand we are faced with grave scientific evidence of depleting fish stocks, so much so that certain species may no longer exist in the future."
"In Scotland, as mentioned this evening by many of my Scottish colleagues, the issue of cod is dominating the news agenda."
"Some say that even before the launch of the Green Paper there could be little left of the Scottish fleet because of cuts in TACs, quotas and the proposed cod recovery proposals."
"Others say that in order to have a fishing industry at all we need to conserve, they hark back to the 1996 article in Nature warning of the collapse of cod stocks."
"I really do not know how you square the circle, but by the end of 2002 we must."
"From talking to people in the industry, those involved in scientific research and those involved in conservation, it seems there is a willingness to be involved and a need for greater participation of all those concerned."
"In Scotland, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the WWF have joined forces and suggested a better way of working."
"The proposal for zonal management and greater regionalisation of the CFP is a serious one that has the support of fishing and conservation groups alike."
"In other countries there are also suggestions."
"This can only be good for debate."
"In conclusion, this year and next will provide an opportunity to get the CFP right."
"I look forward to debating this on future Tuesdays in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, President Prodi was decorated by the King of Morocco and at the same time signed a cooperation agreement with that country, which excluded fishing."
"The European fleet in the Canary-Saharan Banks has not taken to sea for a year now and thousands of workers are grounded."
"The Commission is not facing up to its responsibilities and is willing to sign a limited and ill-judged agreement that can only lead to the destruction of our fleet in two or three years' time."
"Resolutions adopted in this Parliament are scorned, as is Parliament itself, and the Member States, Spain in particular, turn a blind eye."
"This is the deplorable image that shipowners, fishermen and the populations affected in Galicia, Andalusia, the Canaries and Portugal have today of the European Union."
"I am sorry to have to say this, Commissioner Fischler, but things could not have been handled more badly."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate both MEPs, Mr Gallagher and Mr Poignant, on the way in which they have set the tone for the new Green Paper, for it feels like this debate forms part of the groundwork for this paper, and we could say that we are using these reports for our own ends in an appropriate manner in order to adopt a position on this."
"If we consider the fisheries policy, then there is actually one aspect which needs to change on a number of levels, and with regard to that debate I should like to put forward a few initial points, which are also based on the situation in my region, so as to give you an indication of the expectations we have from the Green Paper."
"To begin with, there is the issue of control, especially quota control, within the EU."
"This will need to be regulated more effectively in future, for any policy hinges on control, and if we want to adopt a policy in a truly structured manner, sound control is vital."
"This is also the key point, and in due course, we will need to consider sanctions in this field in the event that countries do not have adequate systems for quota control."
"The second important point for the future policy is a restructuring programme which needs to be developed to replace the present multiannual orientation programme."
"European subsidies should benefit actual capacity reduction first and foremost, as well as environmental and quality investments with the following action points: a sea-day scheme in all EU countries - in my own country this scheme has worked excellently, which was also evident from the fisheries conference held in Brussels a couple of months ago."
"A second point is a premium scheme for the use of nets, which restricts additional catches. This is a truly technological improvement."
"The third point is the so-called set aside scheme for regions which are hit hard by the dwindling fish stocks."
"I am, for example, thinking of regions in Europe which heavily depend on cod stocks and the decline thereof."
"Europe should definitely invest in this."
"A fourth point, in my opinion, is the reorganisation of the fisheries policy which must be further developed."
"A fifth point is the actual investment in food safety, because the dioxin issue will soon be hitting the fisheries industry, and we must be able to deal with this adequately."
"A sixth point is that, in the light of the environmental problems in candidate countries upon EU enlargement, we will need to pay particular attention to the problems which occur there in the field of food safety."
"Mr President, we are faced with the total inability of the Commission and the Council to negotiate on behalf of the citizens."
"The latest Euro-barometer data shows scepticism is rising, perhaps as a true reflection of this inability to negotiate."
"In the agreement with Morocco they have had no weight whatsoever."
"Even the French Presidency told us at the time that it was unable to secure an agreement."
"We are going to have a major social problem on our hands, and we have no real alternative."
"Now some of our fishing towns are going to develop their economy partly around and thanks to the drug that Morocco grows and markets and we Europeans consume."
"To Moroccan blackmail of negotiating with the resources of some fishing grounds that belong to the Sahrawi people, the Commission responds by seeing Community fishermen as real enemies, cutting their quotas and signalling to Morocco that that is the way to go, without proposing an alternative."
"Can anybody be sure today that all the Community boats that have had anything to do with fishing in Morocco are tied up?"
"Well, then, Morocco-European Union relations must be seriously affected."
"All the funds poured into this agreement should be used to finance alternatives in the areas affected."
"Meanwhile, the Commission Presidency is trying to settle a very long-standing problem at the last minute."
"We are concerned that the solution proposed is just a makeshift solution for the sake of the media and not a real solution to the problem."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, globalisation is a growing phenomenon which will entail innovations and will bring substantial change to all sectors of the economy."
"I fully agree with Mr Varela when he describes globalisation as a phenomenon whose repercussions vary according to specific cases."
"Although, for many, it is a challenge which generates wealth and opportunities, for others, those who have difficulty in adapting to change or are unable to do so, it is a source of problems and discontent."
"Adaptation to a global economy has had varying effects on the fisheries sector."
"In fact, in situations such as that of Sicily or Sardinia, some of the traditional coastal fleets, which have grown up and survived in a local context thus far, feel threatened by the impact of globalisation."
"The work of such fleets is frequently the lifeblood of local communities."
"Therefore, when we talk of negotiations underway within the World Trade Organisation on the liberalisation of trade, we must take into account the different specific circumstances in order to avoid bringing about total liberalisation of customs duties which could lead to irreparable damage and the destruction of the entire sector."
"We must, therefore, uphold a tariff policy based on reciprocal trade, taking into account the fact that, in many countries, imports from Europe are subject to non-tariff barriers which hamper the smooth functioning of the free market."
"Moreover, we must prevent the fishing of certain migratory species which, in Europe, are subject to tying-up periods but which, in other countries, can be fished and then sold on the Community market."
"It would also be appropriate to revise the system of existing trade preferences, for sometimes the level of development of third countries no longer justifies the granting of these preferences."
"Finally, we must uphold the European Union policy which makes access to the Community market for products coming from third countries dependent upon access for the European fleet to the fishing waters of the countries with which we are negotiating."
"Mr President, honourable Members, on behalf of the Commission, I should first like to thank all the rapporteurs, the Committee on Fisheries and the other committees involved for their comprehensive work in the run up to today's debate."
"I should also like to extend special thanks to the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela, for coordinating all the work and for his interesting own-initiative report."
"Mr Varela, you make it quite plain in your report that it is impossible to discuss the future of the common fisheries policy without taking account of the broader economy surrounding fisheries."
"Like every other economic activity, fisheries are affected by globalisation."
"I fully endorse much of what you say in your report and in the resolution attached to it."
"You highlight the fact that European fishing is committed to the principle of multifunctionality, i.e. the principle of a sustainable fisheries economy which preserves fish stocks and protects the marine environment and makes an important contribution to the economic and social structures of coastal areas engaged in fishing."
"I particularly welcome your support in the fight against illegal and irresponsible fishing."
"We shall have an opportunity to discuss Community solutions to this burning issue."
"But I can already see that you, too, are in favour of a more resolute approach here."
"I think that we need further discussion on three points in the report."
"First, the report shows a certain tendency towards more protection from international competition on the grounds that fisheries provide a great many jobs in certain coastal areas."
"That is certainly true, but if we unilaterally insist that jobs must be safeguarded solely with the help of the fisheries policy, without taking overall local conditions in a coastal area into account, then we run the risk, under certain circumstances, of subsidising in the wrong direction."
"That would be counterproductive, both for fish stocks and for jobs."
"Fisheries needs to stand on their own two feet."
"This may lead, in numerous cases, to a reduction in the status quo, but when regions are affected by such structural adjustments, then the Community must, of course, help."
"The most efficient form of help we can provide is by giving young people a future and offering them alternative employment to fishing."
"Secondly, I should like to comment on the WTO negotiations which you mention."
"As you are aware, we do not yet know if a new WTO round will even start and, if so, to what extent."
"But even if there is a comprehensive round, I very much doubt that the Community would be willing to accept reciprocity in fisheries on the questions at issue, such as investments or the right of establishment."
"Until now, only natives or nationals of an EU Member State have been allowed to invest in the fisheries sector."
"Thirdly and finally, I should like to remind you that it has been accepted since the beginning of the common fisheries policy that the Community has one seat and one vote."
"This purely numerical disadvantage is more than offset by the advantage of having a greater say in the shaping of international fisheries policy."
"To summarise, Mr Varela, your report makes an important contribution to the continuing debate on the future of the common fisheries policy."
"The Commission will certainly take your thoughts into maximum consideration in its forthcoming Green Paper."
"That brings me to the reports and motions for resolutions from Mr Gallagher and Mr Poignant."
"Both reports start from the same premise."
"The fisheries sector in the Community is under equal pressure from several quarters."
"Fish stocks are declining, there is excess capacity in the fleet and it is becoming more and more difficult to access third country waters."
"I am delighted that you basically subscribe to the analysis in the Commission report on the application of the system for fisheries in 1996-1998."
"It is true that some progress was made - I need only mention the flexibility in year-to-year stock management or the new TACs in the North Sea for non-regulated species or the regulation on technical measures or the introduction of the VMS - but we still have to admit that we have failed to reverse the negative trend in numerous important stocks, such as cod or hake."
"Both rapporteurs also highlight the following serious shortcomings, as identified in the Commission report: effort limitation has either not worked or has been unsatisfactory, the regulation on technical measures in the Mediterranean has been patchily implemented, the fourth MAGP is not nearly ambitious enough and control arrangements have not been made stricter, as we proposed in 1998."
"Meetings with various representatives of the fisheries sector have also shown that we need either to improve or to overhaul numerous aspects of the fisheries policy if we are to achieve responsible, sustainable fisheries."
"Differences of opinion notwithstanding, the majority of those affected are agreed that we need to do more."
"In particular, we need stricter controls, we need better application of the rules, we need to reduce discards, we need to promote scientific research and we need to involve those affected, especially the fishermen themselves, at an earlier stage and more intensively when taking decisions on fisheries policy."
"The Commission therefore agrees to the motions for resolutions on several points."
"However, it has the impression, as regards the delicate question of the 6/12-mile zone, that the majority of those affected are in favour of maintaining the status quo."
"The Commission will publish its Green Paper in a few weeks' time, together with the reports under Article 14 paragraph 2 of Regulation 3760."
"We must use the ensuing debate to discuss how to rectify the shortcomings identified in the reports and suitable solutions for doing so in order to put the fisheries sector in the Community back on a viable basis."
"On the evidence of the motions for resolutions, the main objectives of the reform process identified by all three rapporteurs are as follows: to reduce excess capacity and improve coherence with environmental policy measures in order to maintain and re-establish stocks; to ensure that the people directly affected are more closely involved in decision making and to resolve local or urgent problems more efficiently in order to ensure that the rules are adhered to and applied and fisheries management is improved overall - in other words, everything which qualifies as good governance."
"Then, to create a fisheries sector which is both sustainable and economically viable and internationally competitive - while at the same time helping those who are forced to look elsewhere for work; to develop a modern foreign fisheries policy which is closely coordinated with other Community policies in order to achieve responsible and rational use of resources, and, most importantly, to redevelop the Mediterranean dimension."
"This brings me to Mr Cunha's report on Guinea-Bissau."
"This resolution will guarantee the activities of the Community fleet in question, while at the same time supporting the local sector."
"I am delighted that the rapporteur supports our proposal."
"The sum of EUR 6.5 million now released will be used specifically to restore the fisheries-related installations which suffered serious damage during the armed conflict in Guinea-Bissau."
"This will help the Community fleet to make better use of the agreement."
"In detail, we want to support the following activities: reconstruction of the infrastructure, controls on and monitoring of the fleet and new research programmes."
"I should like to make a few comments here on the terms of payment: a tranche of 50% of the overall amount will be paid out first, as soon as the government has submitted an action programme."
"The remainder, in other words the second half, will be paid out once Guinea-Bissau has filed a detailed report on the implementation of individual activities under the action programme and the use of the funds earmarked for them."
"Finally, a brief word on the proposed amendments."
"Proposed Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 extend the deadline for implementing the activities required to 2003."
"I think this proposed amendment is both reasonable and justified and the Commission can therefore support it."
"We fully share the concern expressed in proposed Amendment No 4 but, as we already inform the budgetary authority of all financial and budgetary transactions under the terms of our Interinstitutional Agreement, proposed Amendment No 4 is in fact superfluous."
"As far as the contributions to the debate on the current state of negotiations with Morocco are concerned, I should like to thank Parliament for its obvious confidence in the Commission's work."
"I have to tell you that the agreement ceased de facto to apply 14 months ago, and that the Moroccan side was, unfortunately, not prepared to enter into serious negotiation on a new agreement until the end of October last year, in other words, just three and a half months ago."
"We did, however, make good use of the time up to Christmas, with one technical discussion a week in either Brussels or Rabat."
"Negotiations were held practically every day in Rabat between 2 January and 9 January."
"We really have done our utmost here."
"For the rest, it is wrong to say that we have received no support from the Council."
"Both the main countries affected and the presidency have supported us in our efforts and I think that, at the end of the day, the meeting between the King of Morocco and our Commission President was a useful one."
"I hope that negotiations will again get properly under way, and that hopefully we shall soon be on the home straight."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Bangladesh"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A5-0360/2000) by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the People' s Republic of Bangladesh [7595/1/1999 - COM(1999) 155 - C5-0356/2000 - 1999/0086(ACC)];"
"the oral question (B5-0004/2001) by Mr Miranda, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, to the Commission, on Bangladesh."
"Mr President, Bangladesh is rich and poor at the same time."
"Rich in human resources, poor in capital means."
"It is one of the world' s poorest and most densely populated countries."
"It is regularly afflicted by natural disasters."
"This is why it is important for Europe to give as much aid as possible."
"The agreement with the European Union bears witness to good relations and provides an excellent backdrop to stepping up development cooperation and trade."
"In addition, the agreement lays the foundation to the political dialogue which provides for human rights, good governance and democratic freedoms."
"On my recent visit to Bangladesh with Mr Miranda, I noticed that they attach far greater importance to relations with Europe than we often realise."
"The government as well as the opposition, but also academics, journalists, industry and non-governmental organisations look up to Europe and expect a great deal from us, more than America, for instance."
"We should not disappoint them in this expectation, and make every effort to promote positive developments."
"The following recent trends can be cited as favourable: economic growth by more than 4%, a fall in the population increase, falling illiteracy and greater participation of women in the political and social arenas."
"This is in contrast to the fact that the country labours under the burden of an increase in domestic violence against women, but also in violence on the streets and in political confrontations."
"Abused women accounted for more than 30% of the patients in a hospital we visited."
"Child labour is still widespread, despite the recent progress made and initiatives presented by the government and industry."
"Mass-scale political strikes regularly bring life in Bangladesh to a standstill."
"Foreign investment is only possible if the government ensures more peaceful social conditions."
"There is also instability politically speaking."
"There is a deep historic distrust between the two major parties, despite the fact that you can hardly tell them apart in terms of content."
"The opposition must resume its constructive role."
"Without peaceful cooperation between the key parties, the country cannot come out of its political and economic impasse."
"It is therefore essential for the forthcoming elections to be above board."
"The European Union should not fail to send observers, including members of this Parliament."
"In addition to flooding and erosion of the river banks, the population is also suffering on a large scale from the poisoning of drinking water."
"In principle, the European Union can provide valuable aid to help alleviate all of these problems."
"Reinforcement of the government apparatus should take centre stage in aid provision."
"The state is functioning ineffectively in very many ways, especially in the finance and education sectors."
"It is unfortunate that with regard to aid, the European Commission does not have the sound reputation among donors which it should really have."
"Often, funds only become available after long delays, it at all."
"The delegation is not sufficiently involved in defining the programme."
"The shortage of personnel leads to a lack of supervision in projects."
"In short, this is a good, practical example which illustrates the need for reforms in the management sector."
"In order to provide efficient aid, it is vital for the European Commission, the EU Member States and other donors to dovetail their policies."
"The many non-governmental organisations which are present fulfil a key role in the implementation of programmes."
"The resources are pooled sector-by-sector, which benefits effectiveness and harms European visibility."
"But the advantage outweighs the disadvantage."
"Premier Hasina assured us that the Chittagong Hills peace agreement is being implemented to the letter."
"From our visit to the site, we gleaned a different impression, if the truth be told."
"Neither the Land Commission nor the Regional Council were functioning."
"The military presence has not let up."
"European aid can only be given to this region if substantial progress is made when the peace agreement is being implemented, which, unfortunately is not yet the case."
"The development of Bangladesh hinges on the good governance of the country' s own leaders. Europe cannot offer anything but aid."
"My conclusion is that the country should not be as poor as it is now."
"Absolutely not. If only the country' s resources were better employed."
"Mr President, in actual fact, suffice it to say that I concur with Mr van den Bos, and I would like to take the opportunity to emphasise how fitting Parliament' s recommendations are here."
"Bangladesh has always been one of those poor countries which are regularly in the news, and the disasters which hit that country are always heart-rending."
"When we now study the statistics, we notice that, all of a sudden, the country could be considered a success story, with economic growth of 5% of the GNP per capita, with growth in export of no less than 12.8% in the five years between 1993 and 1998, and even boasting a decrease in the population growth."
"Mothers now have three children instead of seven."
"In short, you could be forgiven for thinking that everything is moving in the right direction, but, of course, this is the difference between a country which is very, very, very poor and a country which is only very, very poor."
"It remains a problem if you realise that 60 million people live under the poverty line, and you have economic growth which cannot keep up with the population growth."
"Out of the 162 countries on the Human Development Index, Bangladesh does not come last, but 145th, which is very sad indeed."
"So we welcome this toll-free access of the country' s goods into the European market."
"We think that this will have a favourable impact, but we believe that we, ourselves, should make a greater effort to, for example, breathe new life into the jute organisation which died a death."
"Finally, I, too, would appeal for more use to be made of the human rights clause which is encapsulated in the first article of the agreement, so as to realise those aspects which Mr van den Bos expressed so eloquently."
"Mr President, Commissioner, today, at last, we have an opportunity to express our opinion on the new cooperation agreement concluded with Bangladesh."
"Our fellow Member and rapporteur, Mr van den Bos, with whom I visited that country last year, has already stated that we have approved this."
"But he also outlined some of the central thoughts of the Committee on Development and Cooperation as to what the Community' s future action in Bangladesh should be."
"Without wishing to repeat what has already been stated, I would nevertheless like to highlight some issues, on which we would also like to hear the Commission' s thoughts."
"This is the most heavily populated of the so-called 'less-developed countries' ."
"The fragility of its economic situation, marked by the predominance of the primary sector, which involves around 65% of the working population, and also the acuteness of social problems, are highlighted by the most varied indicators."
"And as if this were not enough, there are also the terrible disasters that constantly afflict the country."
"In addition to these factors, the political situation, as has already been mentioned, still shows a worrying degree of instability on all counts."
"We were able to confirm this for ourselves during our visit to this still young country."
"We saw the widespread poverty and the problems facing health and education but also some possibilities that are opening up, such as initiatives arising from cooperation, which are taking place at every level, either under the auspices of the government or which are being implemented by NGOs, the interesting use of microcredit, even though it benefits limited numbers of people, and the role and the particularly difficult situation of women."
"We also saw the disastrous effects of erosion and of successive floods, and also the dangers and consequences of the huge environmental and health disaster caused by the presence of arsenic in drinking water."
"We were also able to see the shortcomings in the political arena, which were quite clear in the climate of great violence that marks relations between the government of Mrs Hasina Wajed of the Awani League and the opposition, particularly the Nationalist Party of Bangladesh, which does not participate on a regular basis in the work of the national parliament."
"We also saw the problems and delays in resolving the conflict with the people in the southern part of the country, specifically the Chittagong Hill Tracts."
"As you all know, the European Union is Bangladesh' s main trading partner."
"Around 45% of that country' s exports come to the European Union."
"Bangladesh has also benefited from various development instruments, such as aid for technical and financial cooperation with Asian countries, food and humanitarian aid and exemption from customs duties on exports."
"The European Union has also provided Bangladesh with a considerable amount of external aid that has been earmarked for it and on which, in fact, the country is heavily dependent."
"We also know that the current agreement carries on from the 1976 agreement, and can be extended according to future needs."
"The question we now face now with regard to the circumstances I have just described is to know what real objectives and priorities this new agreement hopes to achieve and in general, what effects we hope to have on sustainable development in the field of administration and on the participation of the public and public organisations in national life."
"In the resolution that we adopted in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, we indicated the directions that we felt to be the most appropriate. Mr van den Bos has already mentioned them in his speech."
"We now hope that the Commission will express its agreement or disagreement with the guidelines that we proposed. We also hope, however, that the Commission will state to what extent it will be willing to provide political support for Bangladesh in order to overcome the problems to which I referred earlier."
"Given the requests that the government and the opposition have already made we would also like the Commission to tell us how it intends to support the forthcoming electoral process and whether it will be sending a mission to observe the elections that have already been scheduled for this year."
"Mr President, let me first of all say that I feel it is a privilege to discuss these matters, as we are doing here on the basis of your report."
"For me it represents a sort of idyllic political consensus."
"We agree on your report and we welcome it very much and this is not just nice, it is also really valuable for Bangladesh and other partners."
"It is very useful that we in Europe should profoundly agree on how to work with our partners."
"If we were discussing aimlessly without any sort of direction, they would not have a good partner, so it is really important that we agree."
"A year ago I deliberately chose Bangladesh as my first destination on a normal bilateral field trip."
"We went there after the UNCTAD conference in Bangkok."
"I wanted to go to a non-ACP LDC country to start in the right place."
"I also wanted to start in a country as Commissioner doing field trips, a country that I knew well already in order to better be able to assess how the Commission works."
"If I went to a country I did not know, there would be too many disturbing impressions, but this one I knew quite well and I am happy to say that I was positively surprised by what I saw in the field."
"We were closer to the poor women, we were further out in the villages than I had expected and we worked more through Bangladeshi NGOs than I had expected."
"This is a good basis and also one of the reasons why Parliament and Commission are in harmony about where we go now."
"There are big problems to discuss with the Government of Bangladesh, notably its inefficiency: it performs as badly as the Commission, so the two of them have a lot to talk about, but we know that and we are clear about it saying ""our delivery problems are clear and well-known, but please do not add to them by also being slow and unclear in your decision-taking process""."
"This is why the new agreement that we are now deciding on is so important, because it, in fact, brings cooperation one step further forward and clarifies priorities."
"We will go from one country to another across the world and bring what we are doing up to normal standards concerning the basis of cooperation and priorities."
"So this is all very good"
"As to the questions that have been put concerning the elections, on 27 January we are sending the assessment team from the Commission over there and we will be ready, willing and eager to include representatives of Parliament in an observation capacity."
"If this is what we finally decide to do, we think it may be very useful."
"Bangladesh has done quite a number of valuable things in recent years: regionally, agreeing more with her neighbours and approaching solutions to very old problems."
"As to the Chittagong Hill tribes, we take the view that the issue there is moving too slowly."
"I clarified this when I was there in February last year."
"On the other hand, problems relating to land-ownership and other things are very difficult to solve in any country."
"The attitude is important and I believe they are trying to do something meaningful."
"What Mr van den Bos has mentioned concerning donor coordination and the many NGOs in Bangladesh is interesting and important."
"Many innovations have taken place there."
"Microcredit is a great achievement and it is not only one very famous organisation that has been successful."
"But I would come back, when we talk about development in Bangladesh, to the role of women."
"This is quite remarkable."
"Their ability to change the life and the situation of families is extraordinary, but I would, in fact, point to the many young women and girls in the textile factories who in a strange way represent the chaotic way of modernisation."
"The alternative - not having jobs - is quite problematical, but the kinds of jobs they have are also very problematical."
"At the end of the day our liberalisation, the access for them to our market, is part of the hope of these women and of Bangladesh, so I think we are on the right track and I very much appreciate the support and the agreement that we have on what to do in Bangladesh."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to speak in this debate on European Union cooperation with Bangladesh, a country I know well, a country I was proud to visit with the European Parliament's delegation in the autumn of 1998."
"There are, of course, a great number of people with Bengali roots settled in London and other parts of the European Union, people originally from Dhaka, Sylhet and other parts of Bangladesh."
"I know from them and from my visit that Bangladesh is a country of proud, hard-working people and a country with great prospects, but one which does need assistance from the more wealthy and developed parts of the world like the European Union."
"This report helps provide that support and should be commended, and accordingly I pay warm tribute to the rapporteur and my other colleague."
"But the rapporteur said something which struck me, as did Mrs Maes."
"The rapporteur said that state structures in Bangladesh work badly and Mrs Maes derided some of the advances that Bangladesh has made in recent years."
"Yet in many ways I think that Bangladesh is amazing for the way that it does work."
"It does work despite its turbulent and violent history, despite the political problems, despite its other difficulties and despite the poverty."
"It does function and, as the Commissioner has just said, that is amazing considering all the difficulties."
"I believe that this is fundamentally a credit to the people and indeed to the Government of Bangladesh."
"Now on the positive side - and some of you from other countries may not be aware of this - Bangladesh has lately been admitted as a full test cricket playing nation."
"Perhaps more significantly, reserves of natural gas have now been discovered in the Bay of Bengal."
"The European Parliament has to help ensure that Bangladesh is not exploited by the big multinational companies, that it is able to use its reserves properly and to sell them at the most competitive price, which may not mean just to India or to Russia."
"The cricket aspect may seem irrelevant but it does show a determination to succeed and Bangladesh will do well in this field of test cricket and this will be an inspiration to millions of people in that country."
"The report makes it clear that if the European Union works in partnership with local people it can help on big issues."
"It can help with family planning, the key to stability for Bangladesh."
"A poor or developing country cannot sustain a birth rate above two children per woman."
"The idea that a large family is automatically the route out of poverty must be eradicated and women, all women, must be able to choose whether or not to have children."
"European companies must also make certain that they do not exploit the cheap labour and do not continually perpetuate the working environment in factories, where the women suffer and work very long hours for very little money."
"Furthermore the European Union has the expertise to help with other problems in Bangladesh - the flooding that we have heard about, that destroys great swathes of the land on a regular basis is not inevitable."
"Europe has the know-how to prevent the deforestation."
"We have the knowledge and experience, for example in the Netherlands, to help improve low-lying land and land susceptible to flooding."
"We, as a European Union, already help Bangladesh with grants, with least-developed country status, and with the preferential access to markets that this brings with it."
"But we can, I believe, and we must do more."
"The future of Bangladesh also depends on its youth."
"To my mind too many of the young people in Bangladesh leave to be educated abroad in Europe and the United States, which I commend, which is good; but then many of them do not go back to Bangladesh to take back their education, their experience and their great strength."
"We must encourage them to do so."
"I will end as I began, by saying that Bangladesh is a country with a future."
"Just as the last part of the twentieth century belonged to the countries of south-east Asia, the Tiger economies, I believe that the first part of this century can belong to the countries of south Asia."
"With help from this Parliament, Bangladesh can share in that sense of belonging, in the wealth, the prosperity and ultimately the success that will bring."
"Mr President, like others in this Chamber, I am one of the fortunate group of people who has visited Bangladesh, not several times like the Commissioner but in such a way as to be able to form some modest impression, and it is against that background that I wish to emphasise how important it is for cooperation between the EU and Bangladesh to be continued and developed further."
"There are a number of conditions present in Bangladesh that are not present in a number of other developing countries, in as much as Bangladesh - and this, I think, is very important - has only one language and one religion and consists of only one ethnic group, which means that the ethnic conflicts we see, for example, in Africa do not exist there. Nor do religious wars."
"However, it also means that it would be still worse if we were to let down just such a country, precisely because Bangladesh does not have a number of the problems we see in other countries, and we should be failing the country if we were not to commit a good deal in terms of aid, including development aid. Bangladesh can only hold its own if we are willing to help the country, and that means both the EU, as the Commissioner mentioned, and also the Member States, among which I can call attention to my own country, Denmark, which is one of the largest providers of aid in the area."
"There are three points I should like to emphasise in addition to the general need for aid and development."
"There is the need for good governance and support for democracy."
"Others have touched upon these, so I shall not comment further upon them."
"There is the need to continue helping to promote women' s independence, for example by continuing and developing further our support for microcredits."
"Women suffer a good deal of oppression in Bangladesh and, as a number of speakers have already pointed this out I shall not go into any more detail on this subject either."
"In this connection, I should like to say that women were precisely those who left me feeling most encouraged following my visit."
"However, I should like to emphasise our need to make further progress now."
"We cannot be satisfied with microcredits. We must move on to the next phase of development, whether it be concerned with textiles or something else."
"I come, then, to my third point, which the Commissioner perhaps takes a rather different view of."
"I believe that, in this context, we can perhaps make use of information and communications technology, precisely in order to support women too - since they are now a mainstay of society - and so as to give a boost to their cause and, all in all, to strengthen the country' s further development."
"Mr President, we very much welcome the cooperation agreement which is an affirmation of the good relations between the European Union and Bangladesh and provides a framework for their further expansion."
"Article 7 of the agreement deals with regional cooperation, and I would firstly like to touch on two points which relate to Bangladesh's regional situation and her relationship with neighbouring countries."
"Although there is still some tension in border areas with India, there has been a great improvement in relations between the two countries."
"Evidence of this has been the signature of the water sharing Treaty with India."
"Following this there has been an interim agreement for sharing the waters of the Tista river and Indian assistance in preparing the project report on the proposed Ganges barrage which will be located on Bangladeshi territory."
"The two countries have also recently begun talks on fighting floods which have deluged both countries with tragic consequences."
"This cooperation is good news and to be encouraged and supported."
"I have to say I do not see the same positive approach on the part of the Burmese authorities."
"In fact, in the last few days, there have been troop deployments by the Burmese in support of Burmese attempts to construct a dam on the Naf river close to the Bangladesh border, sixty miles south east of Cox's Bazar."
"In the past, such actions have resulted in military action."
"A particularly regrettable aspect of this activity is that anti-personnel landmines have reportedly been laid along the border by the Burmese."
"Bangladesh is the only south Asian country to have signed the Ottawa Convention banning these weapons."
"Deplorably, Myanmar is not a signatory to the Convention and there are indications that she has planted mines inside Bangladeshi territory including on agricultural land."
"Myanmar should accede to the mine ban Treaty immediately and Bangladesh should take steps to ratify the Treaty."
"I hope the Commission and Council will pursue these points in their dealings with both countries."
"On a separate matter, the report describes the impact of population growth in Bangladesh on food security and economic development."
"The population of 127 million is likely to grow to over 200 million by 2030."
"This represents a huge push factor for emigration including to the European Union."
"Bangladesh must facilitate the re-admission of nationals who are illegally in the territory of an EU Member State."
"This is recognised in the declaration attached to the cooperation agreement."
"It is important that the Government of Bangladesh should take early steps to enter into negotiations with those Member States that so wish and to conclude mutually acceptable re-admission agreements."
"I trust the Commission will also attach importance to this."
"Mr President, I would first like to say a few words about the intervention of jute organisations and Bangladesh's role as a host of the old organisation."
"A year ago there were quite dramatic problems and I tried to see if it were possible to rejuvenate the old organisation."
"There was no agreement between our Member States to do what we in the Commission would have liked to do, which explains the phase that we have been going through with this organisation."
"The good news, however, is that the need has been accepted for a special effort, based in Bangladesh I hope, to promote the use and new uses of jute as a raw material, so perhaps it is now possible to continue with the substance of what the old jute organisation could do."
"There was a meeting in Dhaka at the beginning of October and all the different parties agreed to create what is called an international jute study group."
"The draft proposal for the constitution of this body will be discussed and hopefully finalised at the meeting of the International Jute Organisation to be held in Dhaka at the end of this month."
"Subsequently it will be submitted to UNCTAD in Geneva and, once adopted, sent for signing and ratification to the governments concerned and the UN treaties section."
"So we now have very high hopes that a new body that can promote renewed international cooperation in the jute sector will come out of the long painful discussion about the old jute organisation."
"This is very good because the International Jute Organisation is the only international organisation of this kind that is actually based in a least-developed country."
"This is what I can report on this matter that was brought up in our discussion here."
"To Mrs Djubkaer I would say: yes, it is a strong asset for Bangladesh that it is a nation and we definitely should encourage the use of that potential."
"The Chittagong Hill Tracts problem is a challenge to that picture of Bangladesh but fortunately, compared to the past, the tensions are lower and they still seem set on the right course."
"As to the role of IT in Bangladesh, yes of course we will try to be useful and do something but I do not honestly see it as an easy shortcut, so we will stick to the basic priorities of our agreement with Bangladesh."
"But we will use IT in all possible applications."
"As to what you say about focusing specifically on women in this respect, I would say that Bangladesh may be one of the places where it would be possible to experiment with this."
"So we should be open to these possibilities."
"I agree very much with what Mr van Orden said about the regional aspects."
"It seems that Bangladesh is the nice guy around and we certainly should recognise this as a fact and we should relate to Bangladesh in that perspective."
"It has neighbours who are not all very easy and the whole region is more problematic than we may often think."
"There are some eleven million Bangladeshi living illegally in India."
"That is a large number in a European context, so from the point of view of stability, democratisation, orderly elections and so on, it really is facing quite some challenges."
"Let me once again thank you for this very positive debate."
"I look forward to working with Parliament on our relations with Bangladesh."
"Things are moving so rapidly there that compared to the past we may be able in just a few years to expect and to detect real changes as a result of our cooperation there, and it is a great inspiration."
"Finally, we look forward very much to welcoming Bangladesh as one of the leading participants in our conference in May in Brussels on LDCs, to be held with UNCTAD."
"This will be a big opportunity for Bangladesh and the other least-developed countries to present themselves not as patients on a sick bed in hospital, with the rest of the world looking at them like curious doctors, but as partners in the global society, representing cultures and potentials which are important in keeping alive the diversity of globalisation."
"So we are also looking forward to that partnership."
"The first EC-Bangladesh Joint Committee meeting under the new cooperation agreement is now planned for the first half of March 2001, so the train is on the move."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Article 42(5)."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)"
"Use of depleted uranium in Bosnia and Kosovo (Balkan syndrome)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission declarations on the use of depleted uranium in Bosnia and Kosovo."
"I shall give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Danielsson straightaway."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Commission, the information concerning health risks posed by depleted uranium to the population and to staff in peace-making missions in the Balkans, as well as its possible environmental consequences, has caused great concern in Europe."
"It is a concern which must be taken with the greatest seriousness."
"The issue ought to be investigated by organisations and institutions with competence within this area."
"In November of last year, representatives of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visited Kosovo."
"UNEP has been working for some time on a report on the toxicological and radiological consequences of the use of depleted uranium in the Balkans."
"We welcome this report, together with the report which the World Health Organisation (WHO) is at present in the process of compiling on the same subject."
"The issue of possible health risks to those soldiers who take part in peace-making efforts in the Balkans is mainly a responsibility for NATO and participating States."
"The EU countries which take part in these missions do so on the basis of national decisions."
"In the interests of the greatest possible transparency on the issue, views are, however, being exchanged within relevant consultative bodies."
"A discussion is to take place over lunch during the meeting with the General Affairs Council on 22 January."
"This also reminds us of how important it is that the effects upon health and the environment of military crisis management initiatives should be discussed now that the EU is developing its crisis management capacity."
"This is a natural part of a crisis management organisation' s activities, and work of this kind is being done both within NATO and the WEU, as well as within the UN."
"The issue of the possible health risks and environmental consequences involved in the use of depleted uranium also draws attention to a very important issue: that of the general environmental problems in the Balkans."
"The populations of Kosovo, Yugoslavia and other war-torn countries in the Balkans have been sorely tried, with tragic and long-term consequences."
"It is in the interests of Europe as a whole to overcome these consequences in cooperation with the governments in the region, which are all democratic and peace-oriented."
"Through the Commission' s aid programme, the EU is offering support to the countries of the region in their efforts to get to grips with their environmental problems."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to speak on a matter which I believe, as I am sure you will agree, rightly deserves to be dealt with as a matter of top priority by Parliament."
"It is only right that we should be concerned for the health of our military personnel, of the citizens of the Balkans and of those working for Community institutions, non-governmental institutions, international organisations and Member State organisations operating in the area."
"I therefore share the anxiety expressed regarding the health of all these people."
"I should like to begin by expressing my solidarity with all those who are experiencing health problems, who are concerned about their families and who are suffering from illness."
"The fact is that there are many such individuals and they are entitled to receive the best care available."
"They have the right to be informed of the cause of their condition without delay, and we shall devote all our energy to doing so."
"We are all under an obligation to do what is needed to ensure that the relevant information is available to those concerned."
"I stand before you today as Secretary-General of the Council, but I am also here in my capacity as the High Representative for the Union' s Foreign and Security Policy."
"In dealing with the matters which have given rise to concern in the House, I shall endeavour to do so from the Council' s point of view."
"I should first like to reiterate my personal commitment and the commitment of all Members of Council to this region, namely the Balkans."
"I am sure they will make every effort to help clarify the situation."
"Our states are democracies, they have nothing to hide, and it is our intention to forward Parliament all the information available at any given time."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crucial issue we are confronted with is to establish clearly whether there is a link between the use of these weapons and the illnesses notified by the troops or by those who served in peace-keeping operations in the Balkans, or whether, on the contrary, the incidence of these illnesses is no different from that usually recorded amongst our troops."
"This is the question we have to answer."
"If we are to provide a clear answer to it, we must proceed in as rational a manner as possible."
"We should investigate: if this really were a syndrome in the etymological sense of the word, then all those affected would show similar symptoms."
"That is what is generally understood by the word syndrome."
"So these are the indications we must seek and we should deal with them in a fully open and transparent manner."
"All of us involved in establishing the truth must base our conclusions on facts and not on mere assumptions."
"Furthermore, if we are to assess the facts, we must have access to all the information available."
"We must make a particular point of fostering openness and transparency amongst ourselves."
"Once we are aware of the facts, we should study them in such a way that all the results we make public generate calm and inspire confidence."
"Our work is indeed inspired by this spirit."
"Such openness and transparency must be common to all: they must permeate all the Member States of the European Union, relationships between the Member States of the Union and NATO, and those between NATO and other allies involved in peace-keeping operations in the Balkans."
"Obviously they must also characterise relationships between governments in the region."
"Accordingly, the European Union' s Political and Security Committee dealt with this matter on 9 January."
"Member States shared their concerns and information on the measures each had taken, as the current presidency stated."
"There was broad agreement that NATO, as the institution that had assumed responsibility for handling the Balkan crisis, should be charged with assembling information from all those involved regarding the use of depleted uranium, the location of military contingents, and all medical data."
"As you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, at that meeting the Commission also explained the measures it intended to take. I am sure that the Commission will today be able to supply information on the measures it has taken, either through Commissioner Wallstr√∂m or through her representative."
"We have remained in constant contact ever since. The Secretary-General, his assistants and the Council' s assistants have ensured that we have all kept each other as well-informed and up to date with developments as possible."
"Allow me to recall briefly the measures taken by NATO at its meeting on 10 January: first, it convened a meeting of national military medical experts to allow them to make contact with each other and exchange the whole gamut of ideas, background information, objectives, etc."
"A working group was set up immediately to serve as a forum for exchanging information. I think it is important to highlight that membership of this group was open to all countries who had played some part in peace-keeping operations in the Balkans, not just to NATO members."
"Hence the matter was raised with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Mr Goran Svilanovic, on 10 January. He was assured that all of us, especially NATO, would forward all available information."
"In addition, it was agreed to make all information concerning this incident available to the United Nations Environment Programme."
"Furthermore, as you are aware, NATO members reiterated their view that at that time there was no evidence to suggest that the use of the weapons in question constituted a significant risk for the armed forces of the countries involved, or for the civilian population of the Balkans."
"It is therefore required to submit all the necessary information to the European Union. It fully intends to do so, to enable better qualified organisations, notably the World Health Organisation, the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Atomic Energy Agency to draw the appropriate conclusions."
"As you know ladies and gentlemen, NATO' s Medical Committee held its first meeting on Monday 15 January, and the newly established group for the exchange of information met for the first time yesterday."
"You are aware of the outcome of that initial discussion, it has been published and placed on the NATO web site, together with the scientific data exchanged at yesterday' s meeting."
"I think it is worth emphasising once again that, at NATO' s suggestion, membership of the group dealing with the exchange of information will be open to all fifteen Member States of the European Union, and that maximum transparency is fully guaranteed."
"As the presidency has correctly stated, the next step will be to review the body of scientific material as it becomes available. Together with Mr Persson, Prime Minister and President of Council, Union Foreign Ministers will also deal with the matter at the first meeting of the General Affairs Council on 22 January."
"I am convinced that this is a sensible way of proceeding at the moment, to ensure that we assemble all the information required and arrive at conclusions soundly based on facts."
"As you may imagine, I have remained in contact with the governments of all Member States, and I must say to you, quite sincerely, that if a report pointing to a possible link does emerge, I will personally see that it is forwarded to the House. I promise you that."
"I should, however, state that to date, the Council has not received a single scientific report establishing a link between these illnesses and the use of depleted uranium weapons."
"Let me stress once more, ladies and gentlemen, that if such a report does emerge you will be made aware of it immediately."
"I should mention that since I was called to appear before the House, that is, in the last few days and hours, some countries have submitted scientific reports."
"I refer for example to the reports submitted by the Committee of the Belgian Federal Nuclear Monitoring Agency. I believe this is a document well worth reading."
"In connection with the monitoring of radioactivity levels, I ought to say that Portugal and Spain have already submitted what are to all intents and purposes their final measurements."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is what the European Union is doing, wants to go on doing and will continue to do, in that spirit of transparency and good cooperation the Presidency-in-Office mentioned earlier."
"So much then, for information."
"I do not however believe that it would be right, at a formal sitting like today' s, simply to pass on the sum total of information currently available without putting it in the actual context we find ourselves in."
"As I stand before this House, which represents the people of Europe, I am bound to say that we need to remember our starting point and the fundamental cause underlying today' s debate."
"We must not shy away from it."
"The fundamental cause underlying this debate is that there was a problem involving failure to respect human rights in Bosnia, which this very House condemned time and again."
"Madam President, I cannot forget how, when serving as Foreign Minister for my country in 1994, I used to study the findings and conclusions arrived at in this House very carefully. Through them, Foreign Ministers of Union countries were being urged to take action and not to allow such violent disregard for human rights in Bosnia Herzegovina to prevail."
"(Applause and protests)"
"I have an even clearer recollection of when I stood before you in this very House in 1995, as President of the Council of Ministers of the European Union, and you pleaded passionately with me, calling for action to prevent a disaster."
"We did take action, spurred on of course by the good intentions of all democratic countries who wish to defend the rights being violated in others."
"That is what we tried to do."
"And I should like to remind you..."
"(Protests and applause) with all due respect and in a spirit of fellowship, that the House later adopted important resolutions on the situation in Kosovo."
"We must not forget our starting point."
"I believe we have to find time in this global debate not only for the causes which are the subject of current research, research we are determined to carry through to the end because we represent democratic societies, but also for the underlying cause of the whole problem. That is none other than the serious violation of human rights in the Balkans, part of Europe, our own continent."
"As I conclude, I would like to take you back to the last emotive moment we shared together."
"You will recall that on 5 October, in this very House, seated in this very seat, I was privileged to share a highly emotive moment with you all: the time when the Parliament in Belgrade began to fall to the democrats."
"Let us not forget what we have achieved."
"Let us not forget the positive developments leading up to the Zagreb summit. That was the first time that the fifteen governments of the European Union met with all the governments of the Balkan countries, and that every one of them had been democratically elected."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say with some feeling that in recent years I have, as you can imagine, been intensely involved in trying to build a more democratic Europe, a Europe in which human rights are respected. I shall do everything in my power to ensure respect for the qualities I mentioned earlier: the scientific approach, the spirit of transparency, community spirit, since that is what we are."
"I shall also do my best to ensure that the facts we have available at any given time are forwarded to the House."
"As I have said in all sincerity, no link has so far emerged between the facts and the consequences."
"That is what the scientific committees are saying."
"I also want to state, however, that we cannot and must not be satisfied with this. Let me reiterate that the Council and I are fully committed to pursuing the investigation of this matter through to the end."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have absolutely no doubt that we shall all be true to those guiding principles I referred to: responsibility, transparency and honesty."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(Applause and protests)"
"Before giving the floor to Mrs Wallstr√∂m, to speak on behalf of the Commission, I have received a request for a procedural motion from Mr Alavanos."
"In view of the fact that we cannot possible reorganise our debate on the basis of procedural motions, I would ask you to please tell me immediately, Mr Alavanos, in accordance with the terms of the Rules of Procedure, to which Rule your procedural motion refers."
"(The President gave Mr Alavanos the floor after he had clarified that his point related to Rule 37)"
"Madam President, under Rule 37 of our Rules of Procedure, the Council and the Commission may ask to make a statement to the European Parliament; however it is up to the President of the European Parliament, it is specifically up to you to organise the debate."
"In this sense, and because the debate is public and European public opinion is horrified by what it has heard, I think that we all have an obligation, if we are to avoid being accused of complicity, to ask the High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union who, until recently was the Secretary-General of √ç√Å√î√è and who is under investigation by the International Tribunal in the Hague for crimes against humanity, according to a statement by the public prosecutor in the Republica and other newspapers, to explain why, as Secretary-General of √ç√Å√î√è, he gave the go-ahead for a mini nuclear war in the Balkans."
"Especially as Mr Solana has thrown part of the blame on to the European Parliament."
"You must give a reply here."
"He has said that we, too, are partly responsible for the mini nuclear war because we called for action in the Balkans."
"I would remind you that we agreed on the organisation of this debate at the Conference of Presidents last week."
"I shall give the floor straight away to Mrs Wallstr√∂m, to speak on behalf of the Commission."
"Madam President, before I turn to the specific question of depleted uranium, let me first put the issue in context by saying a word about the environmental situation in the Balkans and what the European Commission has been doing to tackle it."
"Nearly a decade of regional conflicts, combined with weak institutions, old-fashioned polluting industry and a legacy of years of unchecked pollution, have left the environment of the Balkan region in a state of serious neglect."
"In June 1999, a report conducted for the Commission by the Regional Environment Centre in Budapest gave a preliminary assessment of the environmental effects of the conflict in the Balkan region."
"In October 1999, the United Nations Balkans Task Force then provided its assessment of the environmental damage arising as a result of the Kosovo conflict."
"In our efforts to tackle the health and environmental situation in the Balkans, the Commission has established a twin-track approach."
"This combines action on the one hand to address immediate problems with longer term assistance."
"Our longer-term assistance is designed to embed a process of sustainable environmental protection in the countries in the region, all of which are potential candidate members of the Union."
"Let me set out briefly what we have been doing."
"In the framework of the Stability Pact, the Commission has been the driving force in the development of the Regional Environmental Reconstruction Programme."
"This provides a framework in which environmental actions can be pursued at regional level in the Balkans."
"By bringing together the various bilateral donors and the countries in the region, we are providing a focus for the coordination of otherwise disparate and overlapping bilateral actions."
"To help launch the Regional Environmental Reconstruction Programme the Commission is currently funding actions to the value of EUR 5m."
"Other donors have committed a further EUR 2.5m, and others still have expressed their intention to commit around another EUR 5.8m, bringing a total of around EUR 13.3m."
"Through these actions we have targeted institution building, participation in the activities of the European Environment Agency in the region and two environmental hotspots in Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Our contribution reflects the balance between setting the basis for long-term environmental protection and urgent remedial action."
"Let me now come to the specific issue of depleted uranium and the public concern about the possible health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium weapons in Kosovo and Bosnia for the local populations, as well as the international personnel serving, or who have served, in the region."
"The Commission is naturally also concerned to ensure that the interests of its own staff and contractors placed in the region are properly assessed."
"Let me stress again that this is an issue which has aroused considerable public anxiety and that anxiety must be addressed."
"But it can only be addressed on the basis of facts and the provision of all the information on this issue."
"Our watchword must be ""openness""."
"That is why it is essential to proceed rationally and on the basis of scientific evidence."
"What then are the facts?"
"Uranium itself, as you know, is a radioactive and toxic element that occurs in several minerals."
"Depleted uranium is less radioactive than natural uranium."
"It is readily available as a by-product of the nuclear fuel cycle and it is very hard and self-sharpening."
"As such, it is used to make tips to shells to increase their penetrating capacity."
"However, there is currently no unanimously held scientific opinion on the health and environmental effects of depleted uranium."
"At the time that the UN Balkans Task Force provided its original assessment of the environmental damage arising as a result of the Kosovo conflict, it had not received any official document confirming whether or not depleted uranium had been used during the conflict."
"When that confirmation was given, UNEP carried out a mission to collect, for example, soil, water and vegetation samples in autumn last year."
"We expect that the results of their examinations will be known in March this year."
"For our part, the Commission has acted swiftly in the face of recent concerns to ensure that any Commission action on depleted uranium is based on sound scientific knowledge."
"We have used existing structures to convene a meeting of an independent group of experts under the Euratom Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health consequences in general of exposure to depleted uranium."
"In their opinion the experts will be expected to draw upon all available scientific evidence."
"We expect to have the scientific opinion of the independent experts within a month from now."
"In the light of the opinion the Commission will review whether or not follow-up actions are indicated, for our own staff for example."
"We will also decide whether it is appropriate to adapt existing assistance programmes within the longer term with the aim of ensuring the sustainable development of the region."
"The Commission will, of course, invite Member States and international authorities to share information on their findings and approaches and to discuss any proposed follow-up actions resulting from the opinion provided by the independent scientific experts."
"The twin-track approach I have set out underlines the value added of the Community contribution to addressing the health and environmental situation in the Balkan region."
"The Commission confirms its commitment to strengthening our medium and long-term support to improve the environmental and human health situation in the Balkan region."
"Madam President, the population is concerned, because there are indications of a link between this depleted uranium in munitions and effects on people's health and on the environment."
"At the same time, however, we are aware that there is no proof yet of the existence of such a link."
"Not a single scientific study, not one of the studies that have been conducted in Spain, Italy or other countries, has come up with evidence."
"For this reason, following on from the remarks made here by the High Representative of the EU, Dr Solana, I should like to say that this discussion does not in any way amount to a rehabilitation of Slobodan Milosevic."
"The missions undertaken in Bosnia and in Kosovo by the troops of NATO and of EU Member States were missions against a war criminal."
"We owe an undiminished debt of gratitude to these people for having committed themselves in this way to the cause of human rights."
"Those who bear political and military responsibility also deserve our appreciation."
"Let me state that here categorically on behalf of my group."
"We hear, however, that the deployed weapons set off chemical processes on impact, processes which result in the creation of uranium oxide, for example, and which may pose problems."
"Over the past few days we have been hearing about examinations conducted by the Pentagon in January 2000 from which it emerged that this ammunition sometimes contains small amounts of plutonium too."
"This entails risks, and the troops must be instructed to take particular care in areas where these munitions have been deployed."
"In view of these considerations, it is indeed necessary to conduct tests for safety's sake."
"These tests are not a sign of weakness but a sign of the credibility of democracies which investigate such matters and sweep nothing under the carpet."
"We owe that to the military personnel and the staff of non-governmental organisations who were involved, as well as to the civilian population of the region."
"We must establish whether there are actually effects on human health and the environment, so that we can either sound the all-clear or take such weapons out of circulation for all time."
"At the same time, it is also essential, during the period in which these weapons and their effects are being studied, that existing alternative ammunition be used which is equally efficient without having any of the feared effects."
"May I express my thanks to Dr Solana and the Commission for their willingness to keep the European Parliament informed, so that we can make our final assessment in due course on the basis of their information and thus guarantee the safety of our citizens and our troops as well as ensuring the credibility of any military operations we may have to undertake in future in defence of human rights."
"Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the Commission, the Council and the High Representative for agreeing to take part in a debate on this subject and to reassure the High Representative that we are not going to reopen here a backdated debate on the motives behind the operations in the former Yugoslavia; it would not be right, apart from anything else because the context has changed radically."
"Today we have a reasonable hope of including these countries in the European Union; yesterday we were in the thick of the nightmare of ethnic cleansing and atrocities encouraged by the nationalistic dictatorships of Izetbegovic, Karadzic and Milosevic."
"It is appropriate for the European Parliament to be the forum for a responsible, transparent debate on the issue of the possible relationship between the use of depleted uranium shells and a substantial number of deaths and cases of ill health among the soldiers of different countries who have participated in operations, initially in Bosnia and more recently in Kosovo, and on the concern regarding the direct and indirect impact on the civilians involved."
"There would be no cause for alarm if there were no more than the suspicion that the frequency of these cases exceeded the average for the same age categories, and it is precisely for this reason that we must establish the exact causes."
"To this end, various initiatives have already been undertaken at national and international level."
"We call upon NATO itself to support these initiatives, making use of the contribution of the US administration where necessary."
"In order to obtain all possible reassurance from the world of science, we call upon the Council and the Commission to take an active part in this coordination operation and exchange of information and we urge the Commission to set in motion its own autonomous scientific enquiry."
"Lastly, the moratorium and the precautionary principle: this is not a question of asserting a principle, the precautionary principle, which was established in the context of food safety, and transferring it wholesale to foreign policy."
"Rather, it is a matter of realising that the military problem has become a civilian problem and concerns the protection, for a long time after the operation itself, of the health and lives of civilians as well as soldiers."
"Madam President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wants to see uncertainty replaced by certainty and confidence."
"Young men and women must be able to report for peace-keeping and peace-making service in the confident assurance that everything is being done in the interests of their safety."
"Every risk must be investigated, every soldier who is concerned must be able to obtain a thorough examination free of charge, and civilians who may have been exposed to danger must receive every attention and, if necessary, be examined, partly so that we can learn from experience."
"It was, of course, out of regard for civilians that we intervened in Kosovo and Bosnia, and we did so on sound moral grounds."
"The examinations must be thorough, they must be carried out by independent experts and there must be transparency about methods and possible factors of uncertainty."
"If there are any reasons at all for concern, alternatives to depleted uranium must be invested in and, until certainty has been arrived at, its use may have to be suspended."
"I should like to thank Mr Solana for promising that all information will be published."
"We shall hold him to this, and he will also be held to account if the promise is not kept."
"I should also like to thank Mr Solana for pointing out our common responsibility for the military and humanitarian action, which is the reason why we are sitting here."
"It did in fact produce results and paved the way for democracy in the Balkans."
"It was a moral duty to take that action, and we can be proud that we complied with that duty."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, High Representative, a month ago, in adopting the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Fifteen intended to set themselves out as a community of values."
"The credibility of such an ambition is not won by texts alone, but by our real-life responses to significant events, by means of strong political actions underpinned by ethical principles, even though this action, quite possibly, costs a great deal to those taking it."
"True merit is recognised when one' s back is against the wall."
"The Balkan syndrome, ten years after the Gulf War, is one such significant event."
"It brings the Fifteen face-to-face with their responsibilities in a spectacular fashion."
"In my opinion and that of my group, accepting these responsibilities means taking bold decisions in at least three respects."
"There is, firstly, the human aspect of the problem."
"People have died, more are suffering, and still more are now living in anxiety and in fear of the future."
"These people include military personnel and many civilians."
"The barbarous thing about some types of weapons is that they continue to cause casualties, indiscriminately, after the war."
"We are clearly faced with a situation of this type in the Balkans."
"In the past, the international community has done itself credit by prohibiting anti-personnel mines on these grounds."
"It should now, by the same token, ban weapons containing depleted uranium."
"It is up to the European countries which manufacture them, including Great Britain, Portugal and, unfortunately, my own country, France, to agree to put an end to the manufacture, storage and, of course, the use, even experimentally, of such arms."
"This would be doing no more than to comply with the principles of the 1980 Geneva Convention, which prohibits weapons with indiscriminate effects."
"At the same time, all victims must be granted the right to health care, all potential victims must be granted the right to scanning, and all the regions concerned must be granted the right to decontamination and rehabilitation."
"Is ducking one' s responsibilities by claiming today that the dangerous nature of these arms had not been identified at the time, even though a great many government inquiries and internal reports clearly demonstrated as much, really a serious and fitting attitude?"
"I sincerely feel that this is a rearguard action, out of step in terms of the information now available to our fellow citizens."
"This brings me to my second point, the democratic challenge which this tragic case poses for us, for there is a long litany of culpable silence, counter-truths and lying by omission in which both NATO and some Member States have indulged as much as possible."
"Having agreed in the past to act as a sort of intermediary between these parties, Mr Solana, you cannot now be surprised to find that we are asking you to give us some explanations regarding the serious matters which are gradually emerging."
"There is, as you have said, an undeniable demand for truth regarding past matters and transparency regarding future matters, but, in all honesty, in this respect I do not think that either the Fifteen or NATO can possibly think they have paid their dues after what you have just told us, Mr Solana."
"(Applause)In the end, we must take this difficult ordeal as an opportunity to reassess our concept of the organisation of European security and relations between the European Union and NATO."
"In our opinion it is high time that we ceased to allow ourselves, both on the European continent and in the rest of the world, to be dragged into the tragic deadlocks of American strategic options."
"I am thinking of the horrific effects of the Gulf War on the Iraqi people, particularly the children."
"I am thinking of the systematic destruction of the economic potential and the ecological heritage not only of Yugoslavia but also of its neighbouring countries - take the Danube, for example - compounded, as we have just seen, by confirmation of the widespread use in this conflict of arms and munitions which, in addition to causing countless innocent casualties in the short term also represent a long-term threat for people coming into contact with the areas which have been bombed."
"This, Mr Solana, has nothing to do with defending human rights."
"No, as far as Europe is concerned, the end must not justify the means."
"I am convinced that, one way or another, these are questions which many people now have in mind."
"Today is one stage in the process, and it will be followed by other stages."
"I hope that increasing numbers of us will align ourselves with this move for change."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Solana, there are few occasions on which it can have been so important that the truth of the matter, the whole truth, emerges in a parliamentary debate as this one."
"The vast majority of countries that comprise the European Union, whether they are members of NATO or not, participated in various military and police operations in the Balkans, through their armed forces and security forces."
"They did so because they felt that this was the most appropriate way to protect civilian populations and their fundamental rights and to contribute to peace and to the country' s reconstruction and democratic rehabilitation."
"The situation is that in some of these countries, including my own country, Portugal, several worrying cases have arisen."
"In Portugal, these cases are of leukaemia and other pathologies associated with radiation in soldiers who served either in Bosnia or Kosovo, one of which has already proved fatal."
"These cases have raised and continue to raise, in medical, scientific, military and political circles and consequently in the mind of the public of these countries, justified concern at the possible relationship - which, I emphasise, has not been proved - between exposure to depleted uranium contained in used missiles and the outbreak of the diseases I have just mentioned."
"It is therefore crucial to ascertain the truth of this relationship, first of all because important human values that require respect and serenity in the face of the legitimate concerns of the soldiers and their families are under threat."
"Secondly, because scientific information is as yet incomplete and we need to establish beyond a doubt whether there is a cause and effect relationship between the use of weapons containing depleted uranium and the health problems that we have been seeing."
"Also, because it is unacceptable that there should still be controversy over the degree of information that NATO claims to have given the governments and military authorities of the countries participating in missions in good time and the conditions under which their armed forces and the security forces took part in military and police operations."
"Lastly, because it would be incomprehensible and even paradoxical for our countries to have participated in missions for peace and to promote human rights in the Balkan region and to possibly left there an unsolved public health and environmental problem that affects precisely the populations that they seeking to protect."
"This is a matter which, in any event, must be taken seriously and to its conclusion, regardless of the consequences."
"Mr Solana, I thank you for your first speech, not least because of the spirit of openness that you demonstrated."
"You were Secretary-General of NATO at the time of the military operations under question and you are now responsible for the implementation of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy."
"You are therefore in a position, if you like, to make an enormous contribution to the European Parliament's ability to find, together with the governments of the Member States, NATO and other international organisations, the best solutions to this case at scientific, political or even military levels."
"That is what we hope for from the Council and from you."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1950, when I was 20 years old, a campaign exploded throughout the entire world: in Europe, in our universities, in schools - they attempted without success as yet to penetrate the churches - and it was the campaign against Ridgway, the ""Plague General""."
"It was the time of the war waged by the US, by the West, by the capitalists in Korea against the rights of the Koreans. The entire communist organisation, the entire hypocritical structure of you good old communists of the '50s, '60s and '70s, mobilised itself to inform us that Ridgway, the ""Plague General"", was on the 50th parallel - this was before the Atlantic Alliance in the Far East - and was using chemical and bacteriological weapons to defend the unjust, capitalist society oppressing the Third World and his own people."
"Communist campaigns, socialist campaigns - for then you had the Stalin Peace Awards at various crucial moments, between 1950 and 1953 - a few trembling papists here and there, would you mind conceding us a moment of respite from your retrospective moralising, from your constant quest to apportion blame?"
"You conceded very little."
"Of course the Dresden bombings in the Great War may not have been necessary and may have been criminal, but the truth is that you do not gloss over this: you communists will not leave us alone with your pacifist line-up."
"Well then, a European Parliament which is now faced with a motion calling for such respite is cowardly, reckless, antidemocratic and irresponsible: antidemocratic in any case because it is disregarding the commitments called for by parliaments and governments in times of need."
"We cannot wait to find out the scientific truth about these weapons, but if they had been used to prevent Vukovar being raised to the ground as it was, we would have spared the lives of tens, hundreds of thousands of Bosnians, Kosovars, Serbs and others in Croatia."
"I therefore thank you, Madam President, and I await the revelation of the truth which must be ascertained in the face of our tendency to distort and abuse it ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, we need to establish the facts in this case."
"We have received certain assurances from Mr Solana but we know, and our Italian colleagues in particular will remind us of this, that it will be difficult for those whose sons have died of leukaemia to accept that assurance unreservedly."
"These days we cannot easily accept death when better health and prosperity seem to have brought us so near to immortality."
"We now need to reinforce Mr Solana's assurance with repeated testing offered as widely as possible and with the maximum openness from the American authorities."
"I have been asked, particularly by my colleague Lord Inglewood, who represents the area of Cumbria where test-firing of these weapons has taken place, to insist that the question as to the possible effect upon the civilian population should be taken into account when this testing is carried out."
"If he is going to reply to this debate, Mr Solana might like to address that point."
"There were a large number of British soldiers in the Balkan War and, of course in the Gulf, and as a British Conservative I will say this: Of course, we are concerned about the possible impact of the use of depleted uranium, but against the background of Mr Solana's statement, we do not believe that NATO should adopt a moratorium on the use of such weapons."
"We have to fight terrible wars against terrible people."
"Such a moratorium could place our forces at a potential disadvantage and thereby potentially endanger more lives than the NATO forces."
"As Mrs Wallstr√∂m has said: The real and immediate danger in the Balkans comes from general environmental degradation following years of neglect, corruption and war."
"This is what the European Union needs to address while we monitor very carefully the results of medical testing."
"In conclusion let me say that Mr Wurtz's contribution was very revealing of the constant agenda of the left which aims to separate the European Union from the United States and would result in depriving Europe of any real influence in the world."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a quite remarkable as well as a cynical debate that we are holding here."
"I am almost inclined to resist any involvement in a discussion about which type of lethal ammunition is the better."
"And yet that is what we are doing today."
"I have never taken any part in debates about which wars are expedient and which are unavoidable either."
"That is not our subject today."
"We have a different subject to discuss."
"In the past, we have repeatedly said that, if it is necessary to use armed force - and we have always agreed on this - we must ensure that our intervention has no more impact than is absolutely essential and that it does the least possible damage to the environment and to the health of those who survive it."
"This, of course, is why we have constantly condemned and denounced chemical weapons, for example, and have always agreed that these weapons must never be used, because the havoc they wreak on the environment and on human health is out of all proportion to their military effectiveness."
"If we are discussing today whether munitions containing uranium do or do not cause leukaemia, then I have no desire to hear anyone tell us, not even Dr Solana, whom I greatly respect, whether or not there is definitive proof."
"We are not talking about definitive proof, and when we spoke in this House about our own health and about BSE, we certainly all agreed that the precautionary principle had to be applied, even though we were never able to prove that infected substances are the cause of new-variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease."
"We recently discussed the precautionary principle and put it to the vote, and we said that we must ban particular substances or procedures if there are justifiable concerns about them, even if there is no definitive proof."
"We know today that there are numerous cases of leukaemia."
"And as long as the scientists are still arguing, as long as all of us do not know which of the scientists is correct, we must agree that this ammunition cannot be used until every last aspect of the issue has been resolved."
"Surely nothing less than a moratorium on this ammunition would be an acceptable decision for us to take today."
"But in addition to this we must also care for the people who live in the regions, for their health and the health of their children."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I saw a short film on German television this morning which was produced on behalf of the American army before the Gulf War."
"It literally said that dust which is released through the combustion of depleted uranium constitutes a danger if it ends up inside the body."
"So the risks involved were known prior to the Gulf War."
"Were the allies aware of this before the Balkan War and before the intervention, which, I hasten to add, I do not dispute?"
"Did the governments and the military know?"
"If so, why were soldiers not given warnings in a similar way?"
"Why are you now saying today that the alliance did not have any proof of risk?"
"People became ill having been to the Balkans, just as they did after the Gulf War."
"Nobody knows how many more will fall ill in those regions."
"Who will provide them with a convincing answer tomorrow?"
"The ban on the use of depleted uranium will be the only measure which can restore confidence."
"Mr President, the evidence coming from Bosnia in particular points clearly to a massive increase in cases of cancer where bombings took place during the Balkans war and where ammunition rounds of depleted uranium were used."
"It is now believed that the depleted uranium rounds were used by the bombers which carried out attacks on the suburbs of Sarajevo and elsewhere during the Balkans war."
"The people of the Balkans are entitled to full and unequivocal answers with regard to the carcenogenic effects of the depleted uranium shells which were used during the war."
"This Parliament and the European Union should, and must, be most vigorous in pursuing full answers to these most important public health and human rights issues."
"On a separate but related matter, I was quite disturbed to read that depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Irish Sea by British Ministry of Defence forces at the Solway Firth between England and Scotland and also at a range on the Cumbrian coast, just seven miles from a British nuclear plant."
"This depleted uranium has been used in Cumbria up to 1995, and it is believed that as many as 1400 depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Solway Firth, which is an inlet of the Irish Sea."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, representing Leinster, which is along the Irish Sea, I am deeply concerned at these revelations."
"I am calling on the British government to make a full statement on the matter."
"I want to know whether there are any possible public health consequences from the use of depleted uranium shells in the location to which I have referred to today."
"It is up to the British government to make a statement on these matters."
"Mr President, the scandal of the depleted uranium missiles is just the latest chapter in the despicable war you have waged against Serbia."
"Mr Solana, you are discussing transparency now that the scandal has emerged but you are two years too late."
"Do you take us for fools?"
"Do you really think the United States will let you get away with this even though it has taken forty years to see the films, the documentation and the victims of the human experiments they carried out on their own forces on the ships irradiated following the Bikini nuclear tests?"
"All we know, at any event, is that you have paid little heed to the precautionary principle that people keep harping on about here."
"All we know, as Commissioner Wallstr√∂m has just said, is that the smiling face of your spokesman, Mr Shed, concealed the use of these shells."
"All we know is that the incidence of leukaemia among our soldiers is abnormally high."
"If a causal link were to be established, then you would be responsible for a war crime, as the statements made referred only to military personnel, as if the uranium were capable of differentiating between military and civilian personnel."
"Quite frankly, ladies and gentlemen, if you want the truth, then look for it yourselves, and do not expect Mr Solana, the European High Representative, to condemn Mr Solana, the former Secretary General of NATO."
"Mr President, today we are tackling an extremely important subject which requires great reflection over extremely long periods of time, and, moreover, we are doing so on the basis of a wave of emotion which, seeing as we are not specialists, is ill-suited to the politics we are obliged to carry out here."
"With regard to the precautionary principle, to which previous speakers have referred, I am somewhat concerned because, although we are tackling the issue of BSE, I do not imagine anyone would ever contemplate saying that we should not eat any type of meat, even in the absence of well-founded scientific results."
"As the Commissioner, with whom I am in complete agreement, said just now, we must first examine what the environmental situation in the region was, but we must also ascertain, with great care of course, the relationship of cause and effect between the equipment used - the weapons - and the impact on health."
"I must, moreover, point out that depleted uranium is used in civil contexts in many other sectors, and we should certainly investigate these extremely thoroughly."
"We must also bear in mind the risk of inciting panic, where strong positions are adopted, among those who send staff to the region and those who are sent there by the Member States."
"It is my view that we should analyse this issue extremely carefully and confirm that we certainly all have good cause to be grateful to NATO for its past and future interventions."
"We do not support the call for a moratorium."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are holding this debate today because of the concern we have for people."
"Some of these people are the military personnel, our troops, who are there, but we are also concerned about the civilian population, the millions who live in Yugoslavia and in Kosovo."
"We do not seek to establish here and now whether the war in Kosovo was justified or not."
"It would be inappropriate to engage in such a debate."
"What we must do - and I entirely agree here with the High Representative of the CFSP - is to examine with the utmost care and precision whether a link exists between the incidences of illness and the quantities of ammunition with depleted uranium which were fired during the war in Yugoslavia and Kosovo and in Bosnia too."
"If we intend to do that, we must pledge ourselves to certain important principles, so that we at least, as elected representatives of the peoples of Europe, can restore the credibility which NATO has forfeited through this and similar episodes."
"Foremost priority attaches to precise and independent tests by international experts with the aid of every possible scientific method."
"Secondly, we need a radical change in our information policy, and in this respect I must thank the Council, and above all the High Representative of the CFSP, for their undertaking to make all information available to Parliament."
"Thirdly, and finally, we must demand an immediate moratorium on all arms and ammunition of this type until we have the complete results of the tests we have commissioned, so that we can then take our decisions in a responsible manner."
"Mr President, to become embroiled in a scientific debate, in which many see a link - and some do not - between the use of depleted uranium and an increase in the number of fatalities, is every politician' s nightmare."
"There is the risk that in this way, the political debate tips over into a scientific one."
"I believe we should uphold the task of the politician, which is twofold, in my opinion."
"First of all, the European Union' s responsibility is towards the local population."
"It is up to the Member States to assume responsibility for their soldiers."
"In my view, it should be the EU' s responsibility to look after the local population out there."
"The second responsibility we have is not to be tricked into focusing all statements on the use of depleted uranium."
"There might well be other causes for the increased number of fatalities."
"I therefore believe that a comprehensive enquiry should be instituted into all the abnormalities which occur locally and in the national armies."
"Finally, something which irritates me no end is that Mr Solana, as well as a number of fellow MEPs, establish a false link between the end and means to used to reach the end, or the link between the war and the means deployed."
"I was in favour of intervening in the war, but I am against taking irresponsible risks."
"Mr President, the toxic nature of the DU shells, and the implications thereof for the military and civilian personnel that have been in contact with the effects of these in Iraq, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, is a matter that we must approach carefully and cautiously."
"We must be cautious, as has been said, for, despite the research undertaken, it has not been possible to establish any clear correlation between the use of these arms and the cases of leukaemia that came to light following these military operations, but also, you should be aware, during the long process of developing and testing these weapons."
"The veil of uncertainty must, of course, be lifted."
"We can therefore only welcome the establishment of inquiry bodies at every level within our States, the Alliance and the European Union."
"However, the commotion caused by the revelations of recent weeks must not push us down the path of what I would call ""precautionary excess"" at the very time, Mrs Roth-Berendt, when the European Union is devoting itself to defining the precise limits of the precautionary principle in order to prevent it being applied incorrectly."
"Today, the DU shells stored in our various countries are the arms best capable of penetrating tanks, since technical developments in armour plating have made the use of hollow charges and tungsten shell ineffective."
"You should be aware that the development of new arms will take many years."
"During this period can we sacrifice our defence on the altar of unfounded fears?"
"I do not think so."
"That is why I shall oppose the request for a moratorium which has been included in point 6 of the compromise resolution when it is put to the vote before this House."
"I would concede that the present debate does have one merit: the fact that it demonstrates, if there were any need, that we must not dream of a clean war, something I have always considered as not merely an illusion but an outright perversion."
"War is always dirty because its objective is to attack human life."
"It can only be considered as a lesser evil when every other means of resolving or preventing attacks on human dignity and freedom have failed, and yes, Mr Solana, that was the case in both Iraq and Kosovo."
"Mr President, we have a responsibility towards two parties: on the one hand, the young people who took part - commendably - in the military operations in Bosnia and Kosovo and, of course, their families, and, on the other, the beneficiaries of those peace-keeping missions, the Balkan peoples."
"It is true, the direct or indirect relationship between the use of depleted uranium shells and the cases of leukaemia, which are multiplying, has not yet been proved indisputably, although the link appears more than likely, but these cases exist and are so numerous as to justify the greatest concern."
"It is therefore right to pursue, with a coordinated approach, all the scientific investigations necessary to clarify the impact of this type of arm on health and the environment, but, in the meantime, it is also right to apply the precautionary principle, which has never been so appropriate as on this occasion, and that is why it is urgent and vital to impose a moratorium."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, daily, and indeed almost hourly, we receive new information about potential dangers."
"That is why it is very gratifying that Parliament is dealing with this issue today."
"I thank the High Representative for promising us complete information and transparency."
"For us too, it is a new experience to be discussing matters of security and defence policy in this way."
"It will certainly benefit European security and defence policy to be discussed outside the constellation that prevails in the Member States, where governments and oppositions are constantly trying to score political points on these issues."
"In Germany, for example, the Red-Green coalition Government under their Minister of Defence has been trivialising all these risks, which is something that has certainly not been happening here in Parliament."
"We in the European Parliament have an opportunity to receive factual briefings and information, and that is a very good thing."
"What is damaging - and it has been a feature of this debate too - are belated recriminations about the Gulf War and the war in Kosovo."
"Mr Wurtz, if you cite the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our high European principles in this context, I must remind you that, at the time when fundamental European principles were at stake, when ethnic cleansing, expulsions and terror were the order of the day in the Balkans, your political grouping stood helplessly on the sidelines."
"This also has to be said in such a debate."
"We are calling for relevant information to be collected, for the information available in the Member States to be coordinated at the European level with UN data through the specialised agencies of the United Nations and submitted to Parliament again."
"An armed conflict must always be governed by the precept that no more force may be used than is necessary to achieve the military objective."
"For this reason we need information and research on weapons systems which are less harmful than the one we have been discussing today."
"This is where the European Parliament can exercise its responsibility in the framework of European security and defence policy by making its own constructive contributions."
"Mr President, High-Representative, the mandate which you had for action in Yugoslavia was not a mandate to use weapons which the conscience of humanity rejects and condemns and the potential toxicity of which, as measured now, was known to military leaders at the time."
"If now that disclosures have begun and more will follow, you feel alarmed by this fact, to seek accomplices in this Parliament that is, I am sorry to say, evidence of cowardice and bad taste."
"Mr President, we are worried about the effects of these bombings in the Balkans, we are worried about the soldiers who took part and we are worried about the inhabitants of the areas which became battlefields. We call for a broad environmental inquiry into any deterioration in the environment throughout the Balkans."
"Our concern has reached proportions which you cannot begin to imagine here in the House, at least among public opinion in my country."
"The joint motion for a resolution also calls for a moratorium..."
"(The President cut the speaker off) (Applause)"
"Mr President, just three points, because a great deal has already been said."
"First: I should like to say to Mr Solana that when, in 1999, we and some of our fellow members tried to find out if depleted uranium was being used in Kosovo, there was a cover-up and Mrs Wallstr√∂m - I have the Minutes here - said in reply to a question that there was still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict."
"That is what it says in the verbatim report."
"Secondly: depleted uranium is a dangerous and harmful substance, especially when used in shells because on impact it vaporises, produces uranium oxide and turns into a cloud which can be inhaled and the uranium oxide is readily soluble and can get into the water and food chain."
"Consequently - and you must know that there is no harmful cause which does not actually cause harm, even in small doses - an ongoing epidemiological study is needed both in the Gulf and in Bosnia and, of course, in Kosovo, although any results there, if they do appear, will not do so until a later date."
"Thirdly: if we accept, and you Mr Solana accept, that this research is needed, in short, to uncover the truth, should the precautionary principle not apply?"
"If someone says to me, or to anyone for that matter, look, we need to carry out a survey because your house may collapse, am I going to stay indoors while the survey is carried out or am I going to get out and wait for the results?"
"It stands to reason and I do not accept that depleted uranium is the only weapon at NATO's disposal; it has a host of other efficient weapons in its arsenal."
"Mr President, we here have now been assured from various quarters that information will be given and matters discussed openly."
"Until now that openness has been missing."
"Naturally we must have the right information to support our action, but I have the same opinions as have been expressed here with regard to putting the precautionary principle into practice."
"We have as our next point for discussion the issue of a rapid reaction force."
"In this connection we clearly have to adopt a position on our approach to the matter of people' s health, although we might not see a direct connection, for instance, with leukaemia."
"It is very possible that other harmful effects, for example in connection with drinking water, will be evident in the long term."
"Can we really work on the basis that when we do good and solve conflicts, at the same time we will be causing the civilian population so much anxiety and insecurity in the future?"
"Mr President, I find it slightly bizarre to talk about the precautionary principle in relation to weapons, which are after all designed to be bad for your health."
"The problem, of course, is that you only have to mention the word ""uranium"" and there is an outbreak of what can only be described as mass hysteria."
"Of course, the illnesses and deaths must be investigated and I welcome the action taken by NATO member states to that end, but we have to make a judgment on the facts and the facts are very clear at the moment."
"There is no link between depleted uranium and the illnesses."
"If we look at the study of Gulf War veterans that was done in the United States and compare that with the study of the control group, there is no difference in the death rates, or illness rates, or the rates of cancer between the two groups."
"We must ensure that we are working on the basis of scientific fact and that is why it is not appropriate to call for a moratorium at the moment, when there is no scientific link between the two."
"There are a lot of other issues to do with the Balkan War which we should be investigating, like unexploded cluster bombs and the environmental damage which the Commission has outlined, but let us stick to the facts."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank all the Members who have spoken, since the way they have spoken and their frankness clearly demonstrate that we all share the same wish for clarification on this situation. The chief concern we all must have is undoubtedly for the people who are currently ill and those who may become ill and suffer in the future."
"I therefore once again promise to provide all the information I can."
"What you cannot ask me to do is to provide information when I am unable to do so or when I have no information."
"This is an issue which by its very nature lies within the remit of national governments and we are necessarily therefore dependent on the information provided by the individual governments."
"As I said in my opening speech, I am in contact with the governments and organisations working on this issue and once again I can assure you that the Council and I personally will make available all the information we have with the maximum of transparency."
"It would be rather difficult to provide you with information we do not have."
"Secondly, I would like to say that, as some of you have pointed out, we must keep all the variables open in the scientific analyses."
"We must not focus on certain parameters and forget others which may have effects which are equally damaging to health."
"I am therefore delighted to have heard both the Commission and some of the Members who have spoken express a willingness to analyse all the aspects which may have an environmental impact."
"I can tell you that I, too, am a scientist, a physicist, by training."
"I am not going to regale you with all I learnt at the time, even if I could remember much of it, but I do think it important for us to adopt a rational attitude to this problem and to wait to collate all the available information before assessing the full implications."
"Right now, nobody should have any doubt but that all the countries and all the international organisations are doing their utmost to find a solution to this problem, bringing together the most relevant information as quickly as possible."
"A great many things have been said, all very interesting."
"I have taken note of everything, but I do not want to go through each point individually since not many actual questions have been asked."
"I would, however, like to respond to some of the statements that have been made in order to prevent any misunderstandings."
"Let me, in all frankness and affection, confirm that I received the letter from the representatives of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and - as they themselves know, because I spoke to them - I conveyed the message and made the letter available to the Heads of Government and Ministers of the Union."
"The letter was answered verbally and not in writing, but you are aware that the decision which the governments took was to continue along the route they had already undertaken in May, which was the time I actually received the letter."
"So, please do not think that no one paid any attention to the letter I received."
"The message was taken into consideration, but the governments still decided upon a course other than that proposed in the letter."
"Letters from any of the members of political groups in this Parliament are always taken into consideration, and I would like you to be assured of that."
"I have two observations which are almost personal observations."
"Firstly, I make a very clear distinction between ends and means."
"I would not like to be accused of confusing the ends with the means."
"I am perfectly capable of distinguishing between ends and means and I know very well that ends are the important thing and that achieving the ends depends very much on the means employed."
"Different means, and our assessment of them, change over time."
"There are occasions when the information available suggests that particular means may be useful or may have ceased to be useful, and in considering these cases we have to take account of the information available at the precise time when decisions are taken."
"I would therefore like to make it clear that that I am not confusing ends with means."
"I have never done so and I would hope never to do so."
"I would like to say something to those who accuse me of having asked this Parliament for its complicity."
"In no way am I asking Parliament for its complicity, not now, not ever."
"You represent the will of the people of the European Union and you are responsible for your own actions."
"What I have, and what I believe I must share with you, are the moments when we have agreed years or months ago."
"That does not mean I am using Parliament or making it complicit."
"If I say it once or if I say it a thousand times, I fully accept my responsibilities, I always have and I always will, that is my intention, without the need to make anybody complicit."
"What I need to do is to ask you to accept your own responsibility."
"I am accepting mine and you must accept yours."
"And we cannot deny that the resolutions adopted by this Parliament gave me food for thought."
"Your resolutions were important to me when I chaired the Council of Ministers of the European Union and also to the Heads of State and Government of the European Union."
"That is not making anybody complicit."
"That is sharing responsibility like the responsible Europeans all of us are here."
"We must be able to share and to accept our collective responsibility."
"I have nothing else to say."
"I would like to thank you and also to inform you that I shall be coming back here on 31 January for a debate on the Middle East, but I shall remain at your disposal during the plenary session to continue discussing this very important issue since it is one in which we have a lot at stake, namely our credibility and also our ability to continue to make progress in the area of European Union crisis management."
"In this respect, ladies and gentlemen, please be assured that you can count on me, at least on my good will."
"That you can count on my knowledge is not so certain."
"Mr President, I also want to start by saying thank you to all the Members of the European Parliament for their statements, because they have underlined the need to take seriously the fears and anxieties in respect of all those who suffer from symptoms and illnesses as well as the need to gather all available information and to examine also the long-term health effects."
"The Commission, I assure you, will do all in its power and competence to establish a sound scientific basis in relation to this issue and we will also, of course, cooperate fully with other national and international bodies working in this field: NATO, UNEP, IAEA and the World Health Organisation."
"The Commission's efforts will be integrated into our wider programme of support in the Balkans with respect to health and the environment, because we must look at the accumulated effects."
"We also welcome the opportunity to report back to the European Parliament on the progress of our efforts to establish a solid scientific basis on the effects of depleted uranium."
"We would like to come back to report to you and of course we are always willing to answer any questions that you might have."
"Mr President, I just want to take the opportunity of asking Commissioner Wallstr√∂m and others to speak in their respective native languages here in the Chamber - in Mrs Wallstr√∂m' s case, Swedish."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Eriksson. The Charter of Fundamental Rights says that the European Union is a union of free countries, and everyone is free to speak in whatever language he or she chooses."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I have just been looking at the text of the joint motion for a resolution."
"I should like to point out that the name indicated as signing for the Liberal Group, the Lord Bethell, is most welcome to join our Group."
"I should like to place on the record how pleased we are to have a new member today who signs on our behalf."
"Well, by the time of the vote we shall have established which groups Lord Bethell does and does not belong to."
"I should like to inform the House that I have received seven motions for resolutions under Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure as well as one joint motion for a resolution sponsored by six groups."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon tomorrow."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Perhaps we could just settle that point of order now."
"Lord Bethell is, and remains, firmly a member of the British Conservative Group."
"Mr Van Orden, I cannot allow you to make statements on behalf of Lord Bethell unless you have written authorisation from him."
"Mr President, since we are discussing the joint resolution on the Balkan syndrome, I would just like to point out that my own name and that of my group have been included erroneously on this joint resolution."
"Mr Wurtz, I explicitly said a joint motion for a resolution sponsored by six groups, not seven."
"I am thoroughly familiar with the sensitivities of your group on this point, which is why I specified it quite explicitly."
"Rapid reaction facility"
"The next item is the report (A5-0392/2000) by Mr Newton Dunn, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(2000) 119 - C5-0272/2000 - 2000/0081(CNS)] on the creation of a Rapid Reaction Facility."
"Mr President, this proposal is about money for an instant, non-military response by the Union to crises."
"It is first pillar - for those who understand Union jargon - and is driven by the Commission."
"It is not a military, rapid reaction force, which is, of course, second pillar, and driven by the Council of Ministers."
"However, I have been invited, lobbied and asked how I am going to deploy the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy's soldiers, tanks and planes."
"I have been asked whether we are going to use naval bases in Cyprus and to address a conference of Canadian soldiers."
"I want to make it absolutely clear that this is nothing to do with the military rapid reaction force: this is a financial facility for the Commission to respond to crises very rapidly."
"Although the Commission will deploy the money as fast as is necessary, Parliament retains control as one half of the budgetary authority."
"We shall vote the money and we shall look forward to the reports from the Commission on how it has spent the money."
"We expect the Commission to spend the money on responding to crises by buying medicines, hiring doctors or nurses, chartering aircraft to carry the medicines, nurses or policemen - whatever is required - to the crisis, wherever it is - not necessarily within Europe."
"In the past the Union has been rightly criticised for being slow in responding to crises."
"We have failed to send an immediate response when it was most obviously required, and this proposal is part of Commissioner Patten's praiseworthy efforts to improve the Union's aid programme, which is in a bit of a mess, to say the least."
"I hope very much that Parliament will support it, and I will come back to that."
"We would be very interested to know whether, when the Commissioner responds to this debate, he would be able to outline the types of situations that he envisages this may be used for - although, of course, we have some ideas ourselves."
"I have been asked by a number of colleagues who have read the report why, if it is such a good idea, there are so many amendments in it."
"The original Commission proposal was dated April last year, but after that nothing happened."
"It was blocked, it appears, by the French Presidency, with no explanation of what was happening."
"So I tabled a question at Question Time asking for an explanation and miraculously - but maybe there was no connection - the French Presidency and the Commission got together to negotiate to remove the blockage."
"They came up with an alternative text but, I am sorry to say, the Council has never had the courtesy to inform Parliament of the new version of the text."
"So the many amendments in my report are an attempt to amend the original proposal and for us to comment on the new compromise text which we happened to obtain, even though it was never given to us officially."
"Parliament has only one reading on this, which is another reflection which was not corrected at the Nice Summit of the democratic deficit."
"It should, of course, be codecision, but it is not."
"However, we were able to threaten to use our single reading to withhold it - like the famous isoglucose case some years ago - and if we withhold an opinion, nothing further can happen."
"So we have an effective veto."
"But, happily, the committee in Parliament has looked at this proposal in great detail and is in favour of it."
"Hence the many amendments proposed by the committee."
"Finally - I am not going to go into the details of the amendments - I am happy to say that the committee adopted the amendments almost unanimously, with the single exception of the British Conservatives."
"They will no doubt explain why that was so."
"That was the party which I felt obliged to abandon because it had become totally negative about Europe."
"I very much hope that when we vote on this proposal they will at last feel positive and give it their wholehearted support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets welcomes the proposed rapid reaction facility."
"We support this Community mechanism, which is designed to make resources available for urgent non-combat activities related to crisis management and conflict prevention."
"It is right and fitting that the European Union should help to preserve or restore public order and to facilitate dialogue, conciliation, mediation and the prevention of human rights abuses."
"All of this, however, can only be achieved or become achievable if the facility really is able to respond rapidly."
"That is why we emphatically support the Commission's proposal that implementation be based on the committee system, including the involvement of an advisory committee, with the emphasis on the word 'advisory'."
"Now over the years, as you know, the Commission - with Parliamentary backing, I hasten to add - has been pursuing a strategy of gradually transferring activities from the ambit of the common foreign and security policy, in other words from the second pillar of the European unification process, to that of the Community, the first pillar."
"This trend is continued by the current proposal for the rapid reaction facility."
"So far, so good."
"But the funds for this purpose must be allocated under Heading 4 of the Financial Perspective."
"And all Members of this House have been made aware by at least the last two budgetary processes just how tight our finances are in the foreign-policy budget."
"Every year, this allocation has been the subject of our bitterest budgetary wrangling with the Council."
"We have no need of a crystal ball to predict a similar situation this year."
"For that reason we have asked the lead committee to do two things: firstly, to call on the Commission and Council to outline their intentions and particularly to explain how they intend to divide up responsibilities between themselves in this field and how they intend to finance the relevant activities, and, secondly, to add a recital to the proposed text stating quite clearly that rapid reaction interventions must be financed within Heading 4."
"Should that be impossible, provision must be made for a revision of the Financial Perspective."
"In addition, we want an obligation to consult Parliament on each action to be financed under the facility."
"The rapporteur and the lead committee have complied with these budgetary wishes."
"For this we are very grateful to them."
"Mr President, the European Commission boasts a whole raft of competences which are important in terms of a civil contribution to keeping those situations under control which threaten to get out of hand."
"Those competences can be deployed in the stabilisation phase following a violent conflict, to prevent the situation from hitting crisis point again."
"In addition to the usual aid personnel, these competences also involve monitors, the deployment of government officials, trainers and police."
"They translate into projects and aid policy specifically designed to bring stability to a certain region."
"We very much welcome the dimension of political and organisational coherence in all these civil instruments in the form of a rapid reaction facility."
"In this way, the EU' s responsibility for the international legal order can be developed much more effectively."
"Furthermore, it gives the Commission and the competent Commissioner a chance to bring forward their own initiatives and proposals in this field."
"In our opinion, the interplay between the rapporteur and the Commission has led to an excellent resolution."
"Particular efforts have been made to avoid introducing or maintaining superfluous structures which delay the decision-making process."
"The rapporteur is right to point out the need for funding this facility and the need for a well-trained unit for financial management and implementation."
"My group prefers the Commission text to the rapporteur' s amendments on a number of scores."
"For instance, I find the list of examples and goals in Article 1 (1), which is what the rapid reaction facility will serve to achieve, very useful."
"The report mentions the clear involvement of the European Parliament in the policy."
"Given the fragmented commitment of the Member States, also in the future, the report is right to call for a system of information exchange."
"Who knows whether more far-reaching coordination and guidance will be possible in the time to come."
"We learn from our knock-backs, albeit with some delay."
"Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo are important examples where a great deal went wrong and, slowly but surely, we learnt from our mistakes."
"The rapid reaction facility is, as far as this is concerned, an enormous step forward."
"We hope, of course, that it will need to be deployed as little as possible, but that is wishful thinking."
"We know that in politics, it is useful to have this option up your sleeve, as a complement to the rapidly mobilised military unit which falls within the remit of Mr Solana."
"We think that in future, the European Union' s civil instruments will matter most in the sphere of maintaining law and order, and this is, of course, also what we want."
"For we too, like everyone else, would like to choose civil instruments over military instruments, but we need not press this point too much in this arena, given the large degree of hesitation whenever the need arises to deploy military instruments."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Newton Dunn, who guided us so expertly through this complex preparation of the report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence, and has done so again."
"By way of example and evidence, I can confirm that only one amendment was tabled for the plenary with regard to his report."
"Our group will, incidentally, support that amendment."
"The proposal to institute a rapid reaction facility by means of which financial resources can be freed up quickly, receives the unqualified support of my group."
"It is our express preference to deploy civil instruments first in the event of a threatening conflict situation."
"This is the second concrete step in that connection, after formulating the requirement of a rapidly mobilised police force."
"We are waiting with bated breath for a detailed proposal for a total package with so-called ""headline goals"" in this area."
"We would like to see a balance struck between the EU efforts in the fields of civil and military crisis management."
"The EU must be able to respond quickly in emergency situations with a wide and well-attuned range of instruments at its disposal."
"This is why simple procedures are being proposed for the rapid reaction facility."
"Comitology can be avoided by remaining within the Community framework."
"However, in theory this limits the number of countries where the instrument can be deployed, but we do not foresee any practical problems."
"Where is the European Union not active?"
"In cases where the Commission makes a formal proposal - which is understandable - to deploy the facility so as to guarantee the implementation of EU programmes, we would like to see the term 'EU policy' added."
"This will widen the scope."
"In order not to hinder effectiveness, we have suggested not defining the financial boundaries beforehand, or including timeframes in the scheme."
"The rapid reaction facility must be flexible by nature."
"We would ask the Commission, especially in the beginning, to carry out many and frequent assessments, and to report on these to our Parliament."
"In this context, we are also very keen to find out how the facility will relate to the ECHO programme."
"This is a new instrument, and we can learn from its growing pains."
"Finally, I should like to ask whether the Commissioner would be prepared to discuss possible scenarios for commitment at some point in the future, for we are now theorising about instruments, but we must also talk about the practical implications at some stage, and for this purpose, a scenario discussion would, I believe, be very desirable."
"Mr President, when things go wrong in a certain region, the world has come to expect ever more from Europe, and rightly so."
"We have the means, the organisational set-up and intention to help in emergency situations, and from that point of view, Africa can expect precious little from America under Bush."
"That is why I welcome the Commission proposal to set up a rapid reaction mechanism alongside the military unit and to supplement ECHO."
"This new mechanism will certainly meet a need, so much so that demand could soon exceed supply."
"In my opinion, the resources available for this year are an insult to the serious commitment of the RRM."
"Even if the amount is doubled or trebled in later years, it remains a joke compared to the many initiatives which can qualify for RRM action."
"It is about fast decision-making, acting and funding."
"The impressive list of operations from the otherwise excellent Newton Dunn report comes, therefore, as a bit of a surprise."
"It contains many important tasks of a not entirely pressing nature, such as providing education, monitoring elections or clearing mines."
"Could the Commissioner clarify what, according to him, the scope of application will need to be, also in the light of limited financial resources?"
"The RRM initiative, a first pillar construction under the remit of the Commission, appeals to me."
"It is of utmost importance for our Parliament to be totally involved."
"Will we be informed about proposed action in good time?"
"We often hear about issues of competence and rivalry between Mr Patten and Mr Solana; a distribution of tasks between the governments and the Commission in terms of military and civil affairs is very much an option on paper, but could well lead to major problems in reality."
"Can the Commissioner give us any reassurance in this respect?"
"European politics, military and civilian action must be coordinated effectively. This is another expectation which the world has of us, and rightly so."
"Mr President, ever since Amsterdam the Union has been proudly proclaiming its role as a fire brigade for crises in Europe."
"The only problem is that it does not even possess buckets with which to draw water. With the rapid reaction facility, the Union has now acquired some buckets at least, and I do welcome that."
"However, I should have liked to see this fire brigade equip itself with hoses too, but Members of this House are among those who have told us that, while this fund does not meet all our needs, fire hoses are simply expensive commodities."
"Nevertheless, the facility is a step forward, but I must re-emphasise that it is still a lopsided mechanism, because it only funds action after the event."
"Far greater importance surely attaches to action before the event, to preventive measures."
"Police forces alone cannot prevent crises, which is why we also expect funding to be provided for the European civilian peace corps that Parliament called for in its resolution of 1999, and we ask Dr Solana to pursue these things more persistently."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Newton Dunn on his report and for the ease with which the committee has taken on board all sorts of suggestions."
"We consider the Commission' s initiative to be an important one."
"Nevertheless, I must point out that, although in our Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, there is, understandably, no single point of view on this issue, the majority of us are in favour of this rapid reaction force."
"We believe that it is important, that it must be established as a European Community policy, and that greater emphasis must be placed on conflict prevention as part of Europe' s contribution to peace."
"We would therefore have liked to have seen greater funding allocated, and better coordination between the various applicable programmes to improve their effectiveness, as well as greater co-responsibility when it comes to the eventual - and sometimes, unfortunately, necessary - military intervention, which would perhaps not become necessary if the earlier stages were carried out properly."
"Mr President, the discussion on the rapid reaction facility is starting to drag."
"Member States are still not agreed on the nuts and bolts of this mechanism."
"Apparently, it will also be some time before agreement is reached, and that while the financial implications for the Member States are minimal."
"There is no need for them to increase their contributions to the Union' s external policy, they only need to grant approval to facilitate the shifting of existing resources."
"Laborious negotiations have once again shown that ambitious goals regarding one of the Union' s external policies evaporate in practice because of the firm positions held by the national Member States."
"Removing the geographical restriction of programmes created by the Union is not a licence for the European Union to intervene anywhere in the world at will."
"I therefore applaud the specifics which have been added to the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy with regard to this proposal."
"This mechanism specifically focuses on actions within the context of European programmes."
"This mechanism can provide help where the implementation of those programmes is at risk due to crisis situations."
"However, I do not share the conclusions of the report on a different score."
"Indeed, unlike the rapporteur, I wish to retain the crisis committee from the Commission proposal."
"In this way, we will prevent a situation from arising where initiatives meet with insufficient backing within Member States."
"Furthermore, we will lend the Union' s and Member States' initiatives the necessary coherence."
"Not insignificant, in the light of all the criticism which the Union' s external action has had to put up with over the years."
"I also have my reservations about the suggestions made in the explanatory statement with regard to the amendment of the legal basis of this regulation."
"Article 308 is the only article on which this proposal can be based."
"Moreover, I wonder whether the addition of Article 179 will benefit the speed of this mechanism."
"It appears to me that codecision for Parliament will delay matters unnecessarily."
"What we do need to be able to do is to call the Commission to account afterwards on the use of this mechanism."
"Mr President, the proposal for a regulation creating a rapid reaction facility is one of those which are founded on thoroughly laudable intentions but which are liable to fail as a result of red tape and turf wars."
"The European Union has played a rather unconvincing role hitherto in the realm of rapid reaction and conflict resolution."
"The reason for this does not seem to lie so much in a shortage of manpower or financial commitment as in a failure to manage, plan and coordinate initiatives and activities."
"Be that as it may, the declaration of intent to become more active in the resolution of conflicts and in crisis management must be interpreted as an important step in the right direction."
"The EU has sometimes done marvellous things to improve the situation in crisis-torn areas, especially with financial resources."
"But money is no substitute for political will and political influence."
"If the EU wishes to play a more prominent role in future, it must have the political will to involve itself more actively in the implementation of appropriate measures."
"I am only the representative of a small country, but I can assure you that Austria, with its long tradition of neutrality and non-alignment, has amassed a particular wealth of experience in the domains of political mediation and crisis management, which makes parties to a conflict more willing to accept it as a mediator."
"Perhaps this is one of the very areas in which the EU should be making greater use of the experience of its smaller countries."
"Crisis management and mediation attempts are not so much about huge financial resources and large bloated organisations as about the trust that warring parties are prepared to place in an offer of intervention."
"And this is precisely where the EU has been failing."
"We have an image problem in the eyes of the parties to the numerous conflicts in the world today."
"That cannot be surmounted with new administrative units and financial plans alone."
"What is really lacking is a credible desire to assume greater global responsibility in the realms of mediation and crisis management."
"Mr President, I hope I have the Commissioner's attention, as he is in conversation with Mr Brok at the moment."
"Throughout this Parliament we have been calling for the Commission to introduce more efficient financial management and administrative procedures so that it can deliver external assistance and implement its programmes such as mine action urgently, in times of crisis or when lives are at stake."
"It seems to us that this was the underlying motive behind Mr Patten's proposal for the rapid reaction facility."
"I hope this is the case and I would ask for a reassurance on this point from the Commissioner."
"It is a pity that the term ""Rapid Reaction Facility"" has been used for what after all should be a procedural matter, a financial management instrument."
"It is easily confused with ""Rapid Reaction Force""; it has been confused in the media and even in Parliament's own session news this week."
"Perhaps in the interest of clarity and to avoid confusion, the Commission could change the title to something like ""Urgent Financing Facility""."
"We support the principle as I have described it, but one or two unfortunate elements seem to have crept in."
"Firstly, instead of referring to the facility in the context of CFSP and the Commission's own first pillar external actions, it has been put into the context of the common security and defence policy."
"Now we have expressed our concerns about the EU meddling in military matters on many occasions and our reservations have not been eased by developments at Nice."
"This is a separate issue."
"The Commission's financial facility should not be mixed up with these defence issues."
"Secondly, there is a thread of political correctness running through the proposal."
"I am baffled for instance by the idea that the fight against gender discrimination would fall into the crisis management category, triggering the use of the rapid reaction facility."
"Thirdly, for us more importantly, Mr Newton Dunn, the rapporteur, has taken the opportunity to introduce an amendment in pursuit of one of his pet subjects, namely the establishment of a European public security force, in other words a European gendarmerie or armed police."
"This is the main reason why we cannot accept this report."
"We do not want a European army and we certainly to not want a European police force."
"We do want the Commission to carry out its external assistance with greater efficiency and we welcome measures to that effect."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has always upheld the need to increase the European Union' s non-military intervention capabilities."
"We therefore welcome the Council' s proposal and support Mr Newton Dunn' s report, which puts forward proposals that improve the text."
"These are clearly issues which come under the first pillar."
"Nevertheless, we all know that, in the context of the second pillar, the military mechanism of a rapid reaction force, designed to fulfil Petersberg-type tasks, is being created. It is envisaged that these tasks will be carried out in third countries where the non-military rapid reaction mechanism will also operate."
"But how, and in what cases?"
"What kind of procedures will this relationship employ?"
"What kind of coordination?"
"I therefore think it would have been beneficial for the document to have addressed this aspect as well."
"As a Member of this Parliament, I wish to contribute to the breaking down of some of the barriers that separate fields of competence from one another so that greater cooperation within the European Union is achieved."
"Mr President, my party fully recognises the need for the developed countries to make available resources for international crises and for our response to be rapid and effective."
"In this context, the Commission's proposal looks attractive in that it provides the mechanisms for affording a response to crisis situations."
"However, we believe that for our efforts to be both rapid and effective, they should be planned, funded and executed on a truly international scale, utilising the resources and the capabilities of the whole free world, including the technical genius and the good will of the United States."
"The mechanisms for ensuring this already exist in the form of the United Nations and its various agencies."
"Although imperfect and always capable of reform, these agencies have provided good service and have relieved much suffering."
"For the future, the way to ensure that responses are maximised is to continue working through these agencies, ensuring that resources are used wisely and efficiently."
"As far as the Commission's proposal is concerned, this is simply reinventing the wheel, putting the political ambitions of the European Union before the needs of suffering people."
"People in crises need a European rapid reaction facility as much as a fish needs a bicycle."
"We should abandon these grandiose plans and instead support and develop the existing agencies which have a better track record that the EU will ever have."
"Mr President, in discussing this matter I very much welcome the proposal from the Swedish Foreign Ministry that I have just seen today for a goal-oriented action plan for conflict prevention, because as I have said before, we in the European Union should be sending a philosophy for peace to areas of conflict and not just armies."
"The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution and that is something we tend to forget."
"Look at the last century: the first half of it was marked by the worst conflict the world had ever seen: two world wars and millions of people dead and killed."
"Yet who could have foreseen that in the second half of that century those same people would come together in the European Union."
"As I know from my own experience, the principles at the heart of European Union will resolve conflict wherever they are applied in the world."
"Therefore do you not think it is a very positive and sensible suggestion for the European Union to have a department that does precisely that?"
"In other words, the Commission should have a department of peace and reconciliation and a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation to go to areas of conflict in advance and apply the principles of conflict resolution, particularly those principles at the heart of European Union itself."
"Mr President, I am very sorry to have heard in the debate MEPs from my own region in the UK from different parties say that they will be opposing this report."
"I am pleased to support the rapid reaction facility and I do so as a Member of Parliament's Development Committee."
"In the week that 600 people lay dead after the earthquake in El Salvador, this European Union must be able to move more quickly just as we failed to do in response to the impact of hurricane Mitch in that same country back in 1998."
"I ask Commissioner Patten in closing the debate, first to assure us that the facility will be utilised in response to crises world-wide in support of the EU's development goals and not just in Europe's own backyard."
"Second, could he tell us how he could make such a promise when year after year the Commission proposes funding interventions in Central and Eastern Europe and in the former Yugoslavia at the expense of budget lines benefiting the developing countries."
"Third, will he undertake to bring forward a detailed operational relationship between the rapid reaction facility and the financing of ECHO and indeed explain why he has not at one and the same time brought forward proposals to speed up our humanitarian assistance as part of the reform programme which he knows we support."
"Finally, can he tell us is he shares our belief that development is the best form of conflict prevention and to commit himself to enhancing the EU's development programme to avoid the need for crisis intervention in future years."
"N. Korea"
"The next item is the following oral questions:"
"B5-0560/2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council, on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,"
"B5-0825/2000 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Commission, on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say a few words on the question tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, especially on the basis of the findings obtained by Mr Santer and other colleagues of ours on their visit to North Korea."
"I believe that we in the European Union have a more important role to play there than we have previously done and that our policy cannot stop at support for the KEDO programme."
"It is certainly regrettable that, with eight Member States having now established bilateral diplomatic relations, we have not been able to adopt a concerted approach in our dealings with North Korea."
"Last year was an exceptionally interesting one in the Korean peninsula, especially on account of the rapprochement between North and South Korea and the reuniting of families that was made possible by this thaw in North-South relations."
"We must be aware that this area still has the potential to be a major trouble spot, but there is nevertheless a real political opportunity now to achieve a lasting peace settlement."
"That is why it is essential that the European Union, as an international player in a multipolar political world, should become active in this domain."
"It is a matter of supporting a policy which can pave the way for democracy and human rights in North Korea and which, on that basis, can play a significant part in the development of ever greater understanding between the two parts of Korea, an understanding which, following the meeting between the two Presidents, has sparked off the first public debates about national reunification for many decades."
"Such a policy must also be combined with a means of obtaining details of the food situation and the health system in North Korea and must enable us to incorporate appropriate measures of aid into a political strategy so as to bring about an improvement in the general situation and perhaps also to initiate the development on which the long-term peace of the region depends, for the peace of that region, of course, is of global importance too."
"As an arms supplier, North Korea is an important player on the world stage, and its development of modern weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems makes it a country which could undoubtedly pose a serious threat to other parts of the Asian continent and to other continents."
"Madam President, I believe that we must therefore seek improvements in these domains, so as to curb the proliferation of armaments and thus contribute to global stability."
"I hope that you will support this motion for a resolution and that the Council and the Commission can agree on a coordinated approach with Parliament which will enable us to make our contribution in that part of the world, not least in our own interests."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, during the meeting held in Pyongyang between 25 and 27 November of last year within the framework of the political dialogue, the European troika emphasised the most important parts of the European Union' s strategies towards the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea - strategies which had been approved by the Council at its meetings on 9 October and 20 November."
"Allow me just briefly to mention the three most important of these strategies."
"First of all, the European Union' s support for work on achieving lasting peace between the two Korean States."
"Secondly, the importance of the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea' s adopting a responsible attitude when it comes to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, as well as putting a stop to exports of missiles."
"Thirdly, respect for the UN' s Convention on Human Rights."
"When it comes to establishing diplomatic relations with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea, the Council agreed on 20 November of last year that the interested parties must consult between themselves and inform the Council of the content of their discussions with Pyongyang."
"The Council has repeatedly urged the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea to comply fully with its commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and cease to produce, test or export any missiles or missile technology."
"The European Union has also called upon the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty."
"Furthermore, the European Union has informed the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea that it expects concrete measures to be taken on these issues."
"In all contacts with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea, the European Union has emphasised its great concern about the serious violations of human rights in the country, about the number of political prisoners, about the absence of national legislation and about the Korean authorities' refusal to cooperate with international mechanisms in defence of human rights."
"Demands have been made for improvements on these issues."
"We shall continue to highlight the importance of these issues."
"The European Union welcomes the decision by the Democratic People' s Republic to resume its reporting under the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights during the year 2000 and hopes that the country will now, on the basis of its own report, be able to enter into a useful and constructive dialogue with the UN Human Rights Committee"
"On the issue of measures to be taken, the Council has called upon the Commission to begin dealing with the issue of technical measures of support which may be taken within those sectors to which priority has been given."
"The Council and the Commission will, as soon as possible, be examining what measures are possible in order to open the European market to North Korean products."
"Feasibility studies will be conducted in those areas regarded as having priority."
"The European Union will make efforts to extend the political consultations with the Republic of Korea, whose efforts to effect a rapprochement between the two Korean States are fully supported by the European Union."
"It is also a question of establishing areas in which joint measures might be taken, for example on the issue of technical aid and economic cooperation with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea."
"Madam President, I very much welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this extremely important subject."
"Recent events on the Korean Peninsula are of great interest and concern to all of us in Europe and the contribution that we make in helping to promote reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula, in helping to bring, as it were, the North Korean government and society in out of the cold."
"Those efforts reflect the extent to which Europe has a global role to play and they match, in a sense, the role that Japan has been playing the Balkans - helping to support stability there."
"We similarly have responsibilities in other continents."
"A European Union approach towards recent developments in the Korean Peninsula was agreed at the General Affairs Councils of 9 October and 20 November last year."
"This approach aims, as I have said, to support the inter-Korean reconciliation process in order to bring about peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."
"Taking this approach as the basis for Commission action, the Commission will maintain and is considering increasing its assistance to North Korea."
"Overall, in the last few years, that assistance has totalled - including the contribution to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation - about EUR 275m."
"However, any increases should be measured in response to signs of progress of the DPRK in areas of principal concern to us and, I know, to Members of this House."
"Respect, for example, for human rights; non-proliferation issues; access for the population to external aid; better operating conditions for NGOs - a point I was able to make to the DPRK Foreign Minister in Bangkok last summer - and the opening up of the DPRK's economy and the structural reform that will be a necessary part of that."
"This approach has been outlined to the North Korean authorities at the recent Senior Officials Troika meeting in Pyongyang at the end of November."
"I understand that my services are keeping Parliament fully informed of this issue."
"Parliament has shown an active interest in this subject for some time."
"The humanitarian and food assistance delivered to the DPRK - around EUR 200m since 1993 - will continue."
"A new food security programme for 2000, totalling EUR 20m, has just been adopted by the Commission."
"I should point out that we have moved from regular food aid to structural food assistance and, in particular, the provision of inputs and technical assistance to enhance agricultural production."
"The implementation of humanitarian projects approved in the year 2000 will extend well into the summer of this year."
"Humanitarian aid - mainly medicines, water, sanitation and winter clothes - is planned to continue on a more selective basis, but at a level adequate to respond to real humanitarian needs."
"We also have the scope to match, with additional assistance, any further progress made by the DPRK authorities, notably in terms of access to the most vulnerable populations and the improvement of working conditions for non-governmental organisations."
"In addition, the Commission is now considering possible measures in the fields of technical assistance and trade, which could be gradually extended if North Korea makes progress in the areas I have mentioned."
"As a first step, these measures include a general increase in the DPRK textile quota by 60%, 50% in the case of a few product categories."
"A fact-finding expert mission will be sent shortly to assess needs and identify areas in which pilot technical assistance projects could be pursued."
"But they certainly include an area which, I know, has been of interest to Mr Ford - that is the whole question of the energy industries in North Korea which will be so important to the country's economic future."
"As to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the European Community and the DPRK, the Commission is considering the appropriate timing of such a step in close coordination with Member States."
"Finally, clearly the Nobel prize-winner, President Kim Dae-Jung, has been typically visionary in the efforts that he has made to promote reconciliation on the peninsula."
"Equally clearly, President Kim Dae-Jung has been very realistic about what can be achieved in the short term."
"I do not think he makes extravagant claims about the pace and development."
"What is important is to keep our eyes on the horizon and to keep working towards it."
"We should take our inspiration from President Kim Dae-Jung, who is one of the great statesmen of our age."
"I hope that with his encouragement the European Union will continue to play its part in ensuring that the Korean Peninsula, the region and, indeed, the world, enjoy peace and prosperity."
"The consequences if we were to continue to isolate the DPRK, if the DPRK was to continue to be prepared to be isolated, are too grim to contemplate."
"Madam President, the resolution on North Korea, on which Parliament is about to vote, has a political significance of the first water."
"Not only will the European Parliament itself establish its position on the northern half of the Korean peninsula, but it will also have defined the new direction of this position for all the European institutions."
"In my capacity as president of the ad hoc delegation, whose visit to North Korea inspired the drafting of this resolution, I should like to share three key considerations with you."
"The first is the advent of a new era in bilateral relations between the two Koreas, characterised by the policy of rapprochement, or Sunshine Policy, of President Kim Dae Jung, who made an important initial gesture with his historic visit in June 2000 to Pyongyang."
"Europe has a duty to support the efforts of the Korean people as a whole and the Korean political leaders with a view to achieving stability and lasting peace in Korea."
"This is the context in which our policy on Korea must be viewed and the scope of our policy actions must be defined."
"Secondly, Korea is the last nation in the world that is still divided by a wall."
"Following the example of Germany and Yemen, Korea can now begin to see the prospect of cooperation with a view to overcoming this internal frontier."
"Europe, which the two Korean states have asked to assist them in defining new economic and political relations within Korea, must accept the challenge and point the Koreans towards the path to integration after a long and difficult time as a divided nation."
"The European example of the gradual creation of area without internal frontiers is being called upon to serve as an example in this instance."
"Once again we have a political responsibility to provide every conceivable aid to a Korea which is slowly overcoming its historic divide."
"Finally, I would like to tell you that, more specifically as regards North Korea, confrontation and isolation must be consigned to the past once and for all."
"The North Korean leadership seems willing to be open and to pursue dialogue with South Korea, the United States, Europe and Japan, and although, in the final analysis, they must be judged on their actions, I am convinced that a European policy of dialogue, structured and critical dialogue, will make a significant contribution to changes in the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea that will benefit the entire world."
"Madam President, can I say we have made enormous progress over the last three years in terms of relations with the DPRK."
"We have now had three interparliamentary delegation meetings and the resolution calls for the Koreans to come here again to continue the dialogue."
"We have seen the European Commission move from not talking to the North Koreans to having an ECHO representative in Pyongyang and we have now moved from five Member States with diplomatic relations to, I understand, thirteen in the process of establishing diplomatic relations with the DPRK."
"I would like very much to see the European Community also establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK."
"We give money to the KEDO project as Mr Patten has said, we give humanitarian and food aid and are hoping to give other structural assistance, a total of EUR 275 m."
"It is crazy to be doing that without having the ability to have a political dialogue."
"We need a dialogue on human rights, we need a dialogue on weapon sales, we need a dialogue on economic development."
"The reality is that with the collapse of the Soviet empire, the failure to make the transition from the Stakhanovite heavy industries of the past to the new light industries and a series of natural disasters, the economy is in complete crisis."
"Observers are estimating that the resulting food crisis has led to the premature deaths of 3 million North Koreans, one in eight of the population."
"Today their only exports are raw materials and military hardware."
"If we can find a solution, we can help the people of the DPRK to help themselves with food aid and assistance in restarting and rebuilding agriculture, mining and non-nuclear energy projects."
"And if we involve ourselves in removing the imperative to export military material then we may force the incoming Bush administration to reconsider its apparent blind commitment to national missile defence with the threat to world peace and stability that poses."
"I would like to congratulate President Kim Dae-Jung of the Republic of Korea on his commitment to the sunshine policy which will allow the normalisation of inter-Korean relations and welcome Kim Jong Il's positive response."
"Dialogue is the way forward."
"Europe should pursue this not only because it is currently the policy of the Republic of Korea but because it is the right way to go."
"Our advantage is that we are not Japan or the United States and we can act as honest brokers in this most dangerous area of the world."
"Mr President, it would appear that the hopes raised by the June Summit between the two Kims from North and South Korea are not going to be fulfilled. The optimism is fading."
"North Korea is finding it difficult to make good those few, largely symbolic commitments it made in the military field, it is delaying the reunification of families who were separated by the war and have remained so for 50 years and it is showing no sign of intending to make the return visit of Kim Jong Il to Seoul, planned for spring this year, a practical reality, and it is not yet known when or whether this will take place."
"President Clinton's decision not to go to North Korea, even though he wanted to in order to finish his presidency with a historic visit, could now mean a long pause in Korea's process of opening up to the outside world."
"In spite of this, I hear tones of optimism and I see European countries queuing up - Mr Brok touched on the issue just now - and falling over themselves in the rush to recognise the Stalinist Pyongyang regime, turning a blind eye to what goes on in the country, to the tragic violations of human rights."
"Therefore, I say: yes, certainly, let us encourage rapprochement between the two Koreas; of course we must provide assistance for the North Koreans to save them from starving to death - Mr Ford mentioned this just now - but, at the same time, we must lay down stringent conditions to ensure that the aid reaches the places where it is genuinely needed and does not serve to support a paranoid, unpredictable regime which is wont to resort to the threat of missiles and nuclear arms to ensure its survival."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for the valuable interventions that have been made in this discussion on the important issue of the European Union' s relationship with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea."
"Allow me just to make a few brief concluding remarks."
"It is gratifying that an agreement has now been made within the European Union to make a better attempt to coordinate the issue of establishing diplomatic relations with the DPRK."
"A number of EU Member States, including my own country, have had diplomatic relations with the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea the whole time. Others have recently decided to establish relations, while a further group is waiting to take a decision on establishing relations."
"I personally believe that a diplomatic presence is of great importance."
"Twenty years ago, I myself had the opportunity to serve in Pyongyang and know what it means to be confronted directly with the reality of that country."
"I would also remind you of the statement made by South Korea' s President Kim Dae Young on his visit to Stockholm in connection with receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo."
"He made a public appeal at that time for a more important role for the European Union where the situation on the Korean peninsula is concerned."
"I believe we must take his appeal seriously."
"We should be prepared also to respond to this type of appeal when the time is right."
"It is important for us to agree within the European Union about what we are to do when we adopt a position on such measures."
"We ought to have an agreed view on to what extent there are reasonable opportunities of making progress in what we are doing, and it is obviously also important for conditions in the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea to be such that it makes sense to do something."
"Thank you, Minister."
"I must inform you that I have received a motion for a resolution under Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"I propose adjourning the sitting."
"We shall resume at noon for the voting."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 11.45 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)"
"VOTE"
"Mr President, our group, as you know, did not vote for the Sj√∂stedt report in committee."
"We would support it here, however, if Amendments Nos 5 and 6 were adopted."
"We have discussed this with the other groups."
"In the case of Amendment No 5, I am informed that other groups would be able to support the amendment if two linguistic alterations were made."
"The first is the replacement of the word 'review' by the word 'examination' as the English translation of the German √úberpr√ºfung; this is only a linguistic adjustment."
"The second, however, would be an oral amendment."
"We ask that the word Rechtssicherheit in the German version of Amendment No 5 be replaced by the word Klarheit and that the English term 'legal certainty' be accordingly replaced by the word 'clarification'."
"May I ask you to note this oral amendment and to put the adjusted version of Amendment No 5 to the vote."
"Mr President, I want to propose a technical oral amendment to Amendment No 28."
"I apologise for not spotting the technicality in committee."
"Amendment No 28 reads at present: ""The Community shall each year set a global ceiling for funding action under this Regulation."""
"As Commissioner Patten pointed out during the debate, it is not the ""Community"" which sets the budgetary ceiling, it is the Budgetary Authority."
"I should like to propose orally that we delete the word ""Community"" and insert instead the words ""Budgetary Authority"", so that the amendment would now read: ""The Budgetary Authority shall each year set a global ceiling for funding action under this Regulation."""
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0338/2000) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the situation of frontier workers [2000/2010(INI)]"
"After paragraph 2"
"Mr President, I would like to correct an apparent slip of the pen by means of an oral amendment."
"I would point out that only 'the country of employment principle' is referred to in the paragraph, when it should read 'the country of residence or employment principle' because of course I cannot determine what choice the Commission has to make, it must do that for itself. But I would like to add 'the country of residence or employment principle' , twice."
"Before Amendment No 6"
"Mr President, it has been agreed with the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, that when it comes to Amendment No 2 of Paragraph 6, we should regard this amendment as an addition to the original paragraph."
"This means, therefore, that if Amendment No 2 is approved, the original paragraph will also have to be put to the vote."
"Mr President, I would suggest we vote on Amendment No 6 first, and then on the original paragraph two, because that would be a more logical way of proceeding."
"After the vote on Amendment No 6"
"Mr President, I would now like us to vote on the paragraph all the same."
"After the vote on paragraph 6"
"Mr President, you mentioned that I had signed that motion on behalf of the Liberal Group."
"I want to make it absolutely clear that this is a mistake, or if it is not a mistake, it is some mischievous prank by the dirty tricks department of the Liberal Party."
"I was born a Conservative and I trust that I will die a Conservative."
"(Applause)"
"We would never have thought otherwise."
"It was a mistake on the part of the services."
"Mr President, I would like to make it just as clear that although my first name is Bertel, I have not become a Lord."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0037/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, on relations between the European Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Sj√∂stedt report (A5-0387/2000)"
"(FR) We think the report presented by Jonas Sj√∂stedt, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the protection of natural habitats in Europe is particularly important, especially for France, as this is one of the countries where the implementation of the Habitats Directive, which is now over eight years old, and the Wild Birds Directive, which is now over 20 years old - as well as the establishment of the Natura 2000 Network - has suffered the greatest delays, to the point that it has been seriously compromised."
"Yet, the more time that passes, the more the (semi-) natural habitats are destroyed, and the more difficult it becomes to preserve or to re-establish the ecosystems in all their diversity and richness."
"Far from being ""marginal"" , the need to maintain and promote biodiversity (and hence the diversity of the ecosystems) stands out as a political issue of prime importance, with universal implications for our living conditions (including for climate change)."
"It is not a matter of setting up localised ""reserves"" where species would be protected as if they were in a museum, but of incorporating environmental concerns in all Community and Member State policy."
"The implementation of the Habitats and Wild Birds Directives must henceforth be implemented speedily and effectively across the board."
". (NL) The VU&ID (Flemish People' s Union) MEPs Nelly Maes and Bart Staes did not support the amendments tabled by the ELDR and PPE-DE Groups in relation to the habitat directive."
"We regard these amendments as an attempt to undermine the existing habitat directive."
"We would point out that the existing habitat directive affords the government sufficient opportunity to step in when the implementation of existing projects is hampered by the habitat provisions."
"After all, Article 6 (4) of Directive 92/43/EC states: ""If, in spite of a negative assessment of the implications for the site and in the absence of alternative solutions, a plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature, the Member State shall take all compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected."
"It shall inform the Commission of the compensatory measures adopted."""
"The VU&ID MEPs have since submitted a parliamentary question to the Commission, asking it to provide an overview of all the notifications it has received in this matter since the directive came into force."
"I am in total agreement with the Habitats Directive and its objectives in terms of protecting the endangered outstanding natural heritage of the countries of the European Union."
"This heritage and its biological and genetic diversity are the planet' s most precious assets and we must indeed ensure that they are protected, reproduced and handed down to future generations."
"Even so, I voted against the Sj√∂stedt report for two crucial reasons."
"Firstly, it is unacceptable to blackmail European appropriations allocated to our countries by making them conditional, in article 11, upon compliance with the Habitats Directive as it stands."
"If it were simply a matter of ensuring that European funds are not used to finance projects destroying these outstanding ecosystems, then I should have endorsed the resolution and voted in favour of it, but it is unacceptable and unprecedented to make a European Union policy conditional upon compliance with another and that social conditions should be subject, for example, to environmental conditions."
"My second reason is that the resolution does not clarify the concept of ""disturbance"" and the legal discussion, which is so deliberately vague that legal battles could be revived, which might lead to bans on traditional hunts where these are authorised under the Birds Directive and the subsidiary law in the states."
"It is precisely because the European Union deliberately maintains this ambiguity that some countries experience problems in issuing their ""Nature 2000"" lists and in implementing the Habitats Directive calmly, without resistance on the part of the farmers in those countries, even though everyone acknowledges the noble nature of the objectives of the directive."
"Cunha report (A5-0367/2000)"
"Mr President, last summer I went on holiday to Guinea-Bissau, and, as is my wont, I exchanged a few words with one of the local elderly pensioners, or rather with a fisherman from Guinea-Bissau would have dearly loved to have become a pensioner."
"Having been told that I am the representative of the Italian Pensioners' Party, he complained to me: ""I go out to sea to fish, I work whenever it is possible and I would like to work many days so that I can have a pension as well."
"However, unfortunately, because our sea is fished by European Union fishing boats, I cannot find enough work to contribute to a pension, and I do not see anything of the European Union financing allocated to the Government of Guinea-Bissau for the Government does not give me anything at all""."
"I therefore voted for the report, but on condition that things improve in future."
"This report and its amendments deal with financial support to Guinea-Bissau in the fisheries sector."
"Despite our many reservations, we voted in favour of them out of solidarity with the people of that country, especially its fishermen."
"Firstly, because the objective of the fisheries agreements between the European Union and third countries are, as is explicitly stated in some other reports, intended to spare European Union fisheries resources and, consequently, to increase catches from the waters of other countries."
"Next, because we do not know exactly how this aid will be used and what its precise ultimate destination will be."
"Unfortunately, however, too much of this aid is often nothing more than a de facto rebate granted to the European companies investing in these countries."
"Moreover, such aid is often also misappropriated by the local administration."
"Despite all that, at the end of the day, this money, which is supposed to assist the local people, will, even so, be better employed over there than the money given to major employers over here who are shedding jobs."
"Van den Bos report (A5-0360/2000)"
"Mr President, after staying in Guinea-Bissau for a fortnight last summer, I went on to Bangladesh, where I did not stay very long for it is not a very wealthy State."
"I approached an elderly man there as well, and he, aware that I am the representative of the Italian Pensioners' Party, asked me: ""But what is a pension?"""
"Sadly, Mr President, the people of Bangladesh are so badly off that they do not even know the meaning of the word ""pension""."
"So I said to myself: ""When the Van den Bos document is put to the vote, remember to vote for the motion, Fatuzzo, but also remember that we ought to monitor the transaction and ensure that the aid given to the people of Bangladesh through this agreement also serves to provide a pensioner or two with a State pension""."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation welcomes the fact that the rate of growth of Bangladesh' s export industry is thrice that of the country' s domestic production."
"These exports, however, are almost exclusively the work of the major companies, mostly Western, which have set up factories in this country."
"While there is no doubt that these firms are getting rich by exploiting the underpaid workers of this country, including children, this is not about to enable Bangladesh to emerge from its underdeveloped state or to enable its working population to escape poverty."
"The report calls for an increase in ""the efficiency and competitiveness of the private sector"" on world markets."
"This is a clear indication of who it hopes to benefit from the elimination of the ""infrastructure bottlenecks"" , especially ""transport and energy infrastructure"" , as well as making ""the financial system efficient"" , or ensuring ""a transparent and accountable institutional environment"" , a euphemism for taking action to penalise anyone who, in the widespread corruption, upsets the Western investors."
"In these circumstances, the proposal to release European funds is chiefly targeted at supplementing the shortfalls of the Bangladeshi State and at having the European institutions bear the costs of the development of infrastructure that the large corporations need in order to enable them to derive most profit from one of the poorest peoples in the world."
". I am pleased to join with our colleagues in the Development Committee in adding my full support for the Commission' s proposal for a new Cooperation Agreement with Bangladesh."
"This new agreement is a further sign of our continuing wish to strengthen our relations with Bangladesh."
"I hope it will leave the way open for the Bangladesh government to also intensify their efforts to develop the potential of SAARC as a further means of boosting the economy and creating jobs in the region."
"The report by Mr Van den Bos and the Miranda resolution clearly set out the main characteristics of the Bangladesh economy and the many challenges facing the government, its institutions, its politicians and its people."
"Bangladesh is one of the poorest developing countries."
"Almost half of its population of 127 million people is living below the poverty line."
"It has lived with and is constantly faced with the dangers of flooding and cyclones."
"Despite this, it has managed to show some improvement in the standard of living over the past 25 years."
"Economic reforms in the 1990s have recorded significant achievements with GDP, on average, rising to 4.8% during the 1994-1999 period."
"Bangladesh is very dependent on foreign aid."
"The EU is a major provider of aid-17% of all funds."
"The EU is its biggest trading partner."
"In 1998 we imported 45% of its exports."
"Bangladesh has a trade surplus with the EU."
"Almost a billion euros have been provided by the EU since 1976 for EU-financed projects: EUR 660 million were provided for food and humanitarian aid;"
"I fully endorse the objectives of the EU-financed programmes to: Help raise the incomes and improve the food security of the poor; help to improve access of very poor women and children to quality health and public health services; improve the access of these children to education."
"This is of fundamental importance to the future of Bangladesh."
"I was particularly pleased that Bangladesh joined the ILO' s programme for the abolition of child labour in 1984 and that ¬´ significant progress ¬ª has been recorded since then."
"I welcome these efforts and look forward to further progress in this regard."
"I want to fully endorse the main objectives of the agreement, namely: support for sustainable economic development, especially as regards the poorest in society, women and children."
"The Development Committee' s resolution stresses the importance of the up-coming general election in Bangladesh in November of this year."
"The European Union should respond favourably to the invitations received from both the government and the opposition to send election monitors as was the case in the 1996 and 1991 general elections."
"I hope that members of the European Parliament will form part of the team."
"Newton Dunn report (A5-0392/2000)"
"Mr President, I certainly voted against Amendment No 9 about creating a European rapid reaction facility."
"I nonetheless voted in favour of the report as a whole because I think it good that the European Parliament should once again make it clear that the EU ought to give priority to non-military crisis management measures."
"That is an important observation that cannot be repeated often enough."
"Against that background, I note that the justification, in any case, refers to the European Parliament' s unanimous recommendation to establish a civil peace corps."
"I think it is good for that to be repeated."
"That too cannot be repeated often enough."
"Unfortunately, the countries holding the presidency - Finland, Portugal and France - chose not to pay any attention to the European Parliament' s unanimous recommendation."
"Against that background, I think that the Swedish Presidency has a brilliant opportunity to take the initiative."
"I have on a number of occasions had occasion to suggest this directly to Foreign Minister Lindh and Prime Minister Persson."
"Unfortunately, however, it would appear that the Swedish Government has not properly understood what is meant by a civil peace corps but believes that other measures under way are the same as a civil peace corps."
"It is unfortunate that it does not want to study the report properly and that it does not respect the European Parliament's point of view by at least doing something."
"I hope that this is a misunderstanding between myself and the Swedish Government."
"In spite of our having discussed this many times, misunderstandings may of course arise."
"I therefore wish to take the opportunity to challenge the Swedish Government once again."
"Now that Sweden has the Presidency of the Council, it should, if it is serious about the EU' s not becoming a military superpower but a factor for peace, immediately ensure that an initiative is taken in accordance with the European Parliament' s recommendation for a civil peace corps."
"Mr President, what is the Rapid Reaction Mechanism?"
"I asked myself this question when, upon my arrival in hospital to have my foot put in plaster, I saw some doctors knocking a small hammer against the knee of a patient, which immediately jerked upwards."
"But then, as I examined this morning's documents, I realised that the Rapid Reaction Mechanism is a major financial initiative which will make it possible for Europe to intervene swiftly and immediately in order to take peace to places where peace is under threat."
"This is a commendable undertaking, and I therefore voted for the report, but I fear that it may be too ambitious for us to implement since we do not yet have a genuinely united Europe."
"- (DA) We have voted in favour of the report because the intentions behind non-military crisis management are sound."
"At the same time, however, we would emphasise that it is in practice impossible to separate desirable civil intervention from unacceptable military intervention."
"Moreover, we call upon initiatives to be carried out through international organisations such as the UN, the Council of Europe or the OSCE."
". (FR) Given that rapid police intervention is, like war, the continuation of politics by other means, and in view of the fact that we have no more confidence in European Union policy than we do in that of Member States, we are opposed to any form of military or police intervention by the European Union, wherever it may be."
"The report gives the Balkans as an example, but an ""independent"" European police intervention force would be no better than that provided under the auspices of the United Nations, or the United States, in other words."
"At the most, it would support the position in the region held by the major European industrial groups that are casting covetous glances at the market for the reconstruction of what the NATO bombers destroyed."
"Indeed, the expressed wish that ""the RRF will have no geographical limitation"" foreshadows acts of piracy to benefit the former colonial powers in Africa or elsewhere, like those that France has committed in the past to protect dictators from the opposition of their peoples, or like those that Great Britain is committing at this very moment in Sierra Leone."
"We therefore voted against the creation of the Rapid Reaction Facility, just as we shall vote against any budget allocations to support it."
"We must welcome the fact that the Council proposal follows on directly from the conclusions of the Cologne, Helsinki and Feira European Councils which urged the Union to ""improve and make more effective use of resources in civilian crisis management."""
"The European Union has vast experience and the resources necessary to set up, at very short notice, operations such as the monitoring of elections, border control, police force training and outfitting."
"This potential must be exploited to the full, especially as the Union has not been capable of reacting quickly enough and the instruments for funding operations of this type were not flexible enough."
"The European Commission does not provide for any ""geographical limitation"" to the Rapid Reaction Facility (RRF)."
"It does, however, stipulate that the interventions must have a ""short life span"" ."
"If events call for more long-term intervention, then the resources currently available, such as the thematic programmes, should be used."
"Under the MEDA Programme, by way of example, the RRF will be used in particular for the training of immigration service officials and cooperation in combating terrorism."
"(EL) The proposal for a regulation creating a rapid reaction facility is nothing more than the framework for what may well be non-military but which is equally imperialistic political and economic intervention What the sovereign masters of the European Union want is a rapid facility to mobilise human and financial resources which can intervene directly not just when there is a ""crisis"" (which the authors of the text would do well to define), but even when there is simply concern that so-called assistance and cooperation programmes with these countries might be at risk or even merely affected."
"Of course, the brains behind the text do not conceal their intention to supplement the proposed measures with the European Public Security Force (armed obviously) which can be deployed in ""law and order operations""."
"Typically enough, the Committee on Foreign Affairs outdoes the Commission with its amendments abolishing the EUR 12 million ceiling on each intervention, the Crisis Committee and the nine-month limit on each intervention."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will never cease to condemn this EU policy, which aims to make third countries politically and economically dependent and suppress the grass-roots movement."
"Not only are we opposed to any form of imperialist rapid or even slow reaction facility, we shall do everything within our power to unite all the people in these countries against any imperialist plans to subjugate them and to claim the place which they deserve in a new, fair, international order."
"In deciding to create the core of a European army, the Nice Summit has opened a new chapter in the history of the European Union."
"For twenty years, it has been attempting to win popular backing by claiming to be building a social Europe."
"Faced with failure, following the Balkan conflict, it has had a change of heart."
"It now openly admits that its objective is the establishment of a European superpower that will defend European interests ""all over the world"" ."
"The imperialist nature of this is plain to see."
"It will do so in conjunction with the United States within NATO."
"In future, by coordinating its diplomatic and military forces, the EU will be trying to optimise what its Member States have done individually throughout the last century."
"This is to be carried out in the name of ""maintaining"" or ""imposing"" peace, and ""humanitarian operations"" ."
"Both within and outside NATO, which is dominated by the United States, the EU is attempting to 'sell' us on its scheme in the name of Europe' s ""independence"" vis-√†-vis the United States."
"We do not need this Euro-militarism."
"We are just as radically opposed to this European army as we were to the NATO army, as the first effect will be a dramatic increase in the military budget, which will inevitably go hand in hand with heightened militaristic propaganda."
"Scientific and technological research will be siphoned off into the military sector."
"It will transfer an increased share of the state budget to businesses in that sector, with the goal of establishing a European military industry (EADS, Dassault, BAE) capable of getting the better of the United States."
"The workers have nothing to gain and everything to lose in the EU' s ""new"" imperial designs."
". (IT) There is clearly no doubt that it would be highly appropriate to create a Rapid Reaction Facility and, moreover, the three Community institutions have already expressed positive views."
"However, over and above our common goal, we feel that certain elements of the Council's proposal deserve careful consideration."
"The first is essentially theoretical: the objectives of the mechanism in question do not appear to be very clear, apart from the tasks of supranational policing."
"The rapporteur goes so far as to propose explicitly the establishment of a European Police Force."
"And if this were the case we could consider the proposal, but it would have to have a different legal basis and, most importantly, a different Community institutional system from that defined by the recent Intergovernmental Summit at Nice."
"In actual fact, in our opinion, the ultimate purpose of the Rapid Reaction Mechanism is to make Community policies and programmes effective more quickly and to maintain that effectiveness more consistently."
"Moreover, the original impression came from the description of the conditions for triggering the Facility, which, being very general, still does not give a practical idea of them, when it would have been enough, without prejudice to the normal intervention conditions laid down by Community regulations, to highlight those conditions which, on the basis of their urgency, trigger the Reaction Mechanism."
"Then, it appears strange that the governments of the States within which the Mechanism may be triggered are not among the parties notified of the triggering of the Mechanism."
"Moreover, it seems odd that they are not notified, since they have been targeted by policies and programmes which, in the case in point, need to be safeguarded."
"Finally, objections could be raised to the increase in the volume of information sent to the European Parliament, even through the consultation procedure alone, but, since we hope that the list of topics subject to codecision will be extended, we feel that, in specific cases of geographical or political importance, the Commission must not hold back from informing Parliament."
"In the light of these considerations, we support the changes proposed by the rapporteur and we have therefore voted for the motion."
". For the past eighteen months, British Conservatives have been calling for the Commission to introduce more efficient financial management and administrative procedures so that it can deliver external assistance and implement programmes, such as mine action, urgently in time of crisis or when lives are at stake."
"They support proposals with these objectives in mind and therefore welcome the Commission initiative for a Rapid Reaction Facility (or Mechanism), in spite of its confusing title and some unnecessarily politically-correct elements."
"Their fundamental objection is to the amendments which seek to use this proposal as a vehicle for establishing a ""European Public Security Force""."
"This concept, for some sort of European gendarmerie, has far-reaching implications and no place in the Commission proposal under discussion."
"We were prepared to support the Commission proposal if it did not contain these amendments (9 or 39) but abstain if they were included."
"Oomen-Ruijten report (A5-0338/2000)"
"Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, how could I not speak on this document, which lays down how the pensions and health care of frontier and other workers, who work in different regions from those in which they live and work at other times of their lives, should be regulated."
"A pensioner from the border between Italy and Switzerland, which is party to these agreements, asked me whether it was true that the pensions of people who work in other States of the European Union had been raised."
"""If only they had!"" I replied."
"""I would be very happy, and so would you, for you would be able to find much more, much better work in the other European States."
"In any case, I will raise the issue when I give my explanation of vote on the Oomen-Ruijten report, which deals with this subject""."
"- (DA) The Left party attaches importance to removing obstacles to the free movement of labour."
"We have therefore supported this own-initiative report which proposes greater efforts to combat the problems created by differences in social and fiscal systems."
"However, we are not in favour of producing a directive obliging the Member States to assess the impact of new legislation on frontier workers."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report on the situation of frontier workers in the European Union."
"We have done so because this report highlights the many serious problems faced by frontier workers."
"A large proportion of these problems can be solved if the Council demonstrates a capacity for action."
"In spite of the failure to introduce qualified majority voting in this area at the Intergovernmental Conference in Nice, we want to use our vote today to send a powerful signal to the Council and call upon them to complete a thoroughgoing review and simplification of Regulation No 1408."
"We believe that the rules for coordination must be simple and easy to administer. We cannot therefore support a new directive which adds new procedures to Regulation No 1408."
"In connection with the debate, we have emphasised that we cannot support the remarks in the report concerning the financing of social security arrangements through taxation."
"In addition, we want to stress that we do not consider, either, that health benefits such as medical treatment can be compared with general services, and that responsibility for this area must continue solely to be the responsibility of the Member States."
"For the most part, this report confines itself to general considerations without putting forward any practical decisions."
"Even when it does put forward a positive measure such as ""proposals to extend access by dependent family members of frontier workers, retired frontier workers and dependent members of their families to health care provisions and benefits"" , the Council is asked only ""with all possible expedition to adopt a position"" ."
"While we support this request, we abstained from the vote on the report."
"All the workers of the European Union ought to benefit from the same social protection, with each of the component areas (social security, retirement pensions, family benefits) standardised according to the practices of the country where they are most favourable to workers."
"In the meantime, in order to improve the situation of frontier workers, they and their families should be able to choose, in each of these areas, between their country of residence and their country of employment, according to the situation most favourable to them."
"."
"(DE) Finding practical solutions to the problems of the 420 000 cross-border commuters also means making people aware and appreciative of the single market and the freedom of movement it guarantees."
"This is why I warmly welcome the fact that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report addresses a number of these problems and their origins as well as proposing measures which will mitigate the effects of these disparities between the systems of taxation and social welfare for those who are affected by them."
"The discrepancies between national legal provisions and the principle of free movement are primarily due to the fact that Regulation 1408/71 is outdated and, because of the many changes that have occurred in the period since its adoption, can no longer offer employees the legal certainty they require."
"The direct consequence of this inadequate coordination is that frontier workers are often at a disadvantage in terms of welfare benefits, unemployment, pension provision and health care."
"In the last-named area, I particularly welcome the initiative of players in the health sector to offer 'exportable' services which take account of the specific circumstances of cross-border commuters."
"Just as numerous legal uncertainties have arisen in the domains of health and social welfare, a similar situation has occurred in the realm of tax legislation, and the various bilateral taxation agreements have not succeeded in resolving these uncertainties."
"This creates areas of inequality, both between cross-border commuters and between local authorities, and these can only be eliminated in the foreseeable future through coordination of all our tax systems on a European scale."
"For this reason, we cannot but support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's proposal that a directive be adopted which commits the Member States to examine all legislative bills concerning tax and social welfare for their effects on cross-border commuters and to create compensatory mechanisms."
"Despite numerous opinions that have been delivered by the European Parliament in favour of the harmonisation of social and fiscal legislation, and despite the presentation by the Commission of concrete proposals for the updating and simplification of Regulation 1408/71, the Ministers of the Member States have been blocking this necessary reform process in the Council, thereby preventing the single market from becoming a reality for people in Europe."
"- (DE) The report on the situation of frontier workers with which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has presented us undoubtedly stems from the laudable intention of ensuring that frontier workers are not subject to discrimination in terms of pay, working conditions and social security and of resolving the problems that still persist in these areas."
"That is what we all want."
"However, it is an exaggeration to suggest, as the explanatory statement of this report suggests, that the internal market, of which the free movement of workers is a cornerstone, is an absolute farce in the daily lives of these people."
"That is just as much divorced from reality as various assertions in the resolution; some of the demands it makes are tantamount to kicking at open doors, at least in relation to the circumstances of the 85,000 frontier workers in Luxembourg."
"It is simply untrue that family members are excluded from provisions and benefits in the country of employment."
"Of course there are differences between private schemes and the public welfare systems, but such differences apply equally to those who are not frontier workers."
"Of course there are differing systems of provision for the elderly."
"These not only differ from one Member State to another but even differ within Member States."
"My pension entitlement would be greater if I had been employed in the public sector."
"That, however, is not a problem that specifically concerns frontier workers."
"Of course there are differences between Member States in terms of the structure of pension schemes, contributions and pensionable ages."
"The frontier workers who are employed in Luxembourg rejoice in these differences, because our pensions are far more generous than those in Belgium, France and Germany, where our frontier workers live."
"Although some elements of the social security system are tax-funded in Luxembourg, this does not result in inequalities, because frontier workers are also entitled to the relevant benefits, such as those under the care-insurance scheme, a right which even applies in Belgium and France."
"The resolution bemoans the fact that there is no longer a clear distinction in Member States between social assistance and social security."
"This is not true either."
"Social assistance is not really a problem for frontier workers at all, because they are employees with no need of social assistance."
"Nor do I understand what periods of secondment have to do with frontier workers."
"There is, of course, a directive covering employees seconded by their employer, but that directive cannot be applied to frontier workers."
"And as far as the judgments of the European Court of Justice in the Kohl and Decker cases are concerned, it is clear that all citizens of the Union, and hence frontier workers too, can benefit from health services in other Member States."
"Here too, the report is trying to force an open door."
"I felt it was important to make this clear, because it is not the first time that Parliament has made such half-baked demands in one of its reports."
"Back in 1998, when we discussed the Lancker report, I emphasised that it was absurd to claim that there was any inherent discrimination against frontier workers."
"At that time the Belgian Socialists had made the ridiculous proposal that a compensatory fund be created for loss of income suffered by frontier workers."
"It is important to frontier workers that there should be no tampering with the principle that income taxes and welfare contributions are payable in the country of employment."
"This is the prerequisite if frontier workers are to enjoy all the social benefits that are granted in the country of employment to workers who reside there and to their dependants."
"That is how it is in Luxembourg, and that is how it is supposed to be everywhere - no more and no less."
"Motion for a resolution on environment directives (B5-0038/2001)"
"Although the directives on conservation of natural habitats, the elimination of PCBs and PCTs, and the protection of waters from nitrate pollution are only inadequately applied in the Member States, this does not mean by any means that these are poor directives which must be changed, as some people in this House would seek to have us believe."
"These directives fully live up to the ambitions of the citizens of Europe, who are demanding that greater attention be paid to environmental matters and are seeking arbitration from the European authorities."
"The great numbers of complaints and petitions received by the Committee on Petitions regarding environmental infractions and violations of these directives testify to these expectations."
"The fact is, if the directives are only partially implemented, it is because the Member States had not weighed the consequences when adopting them."
"They had not taken on board the implications of the financial costs or the amendments, which could be fundamental, that these directives would require in their policies."
"This is true both of the Habitats Directive and the Nitrates Directive since they both require the review of agricultural and regional planning policies which may cause pollution or destruction of natural environments."
"The implementation of the Habitats Directive is intended to provide long-term protection for a European network of biologically outstanding natural habitats and to exempt them from future redevelopment in order to prevent conflicts in land use or damage to those environments."
"These objectives have, admittedly, been very badly presented in the Member States, causing occasionally very bitter conflicts between the owners and users of these areas."
"Yet there was no shortage of positive results in those instances where proper coordination was achieved, since the Habitats Directive does indeed make it possible to support heritage-friendly management methods by making adequate compensation available."
"This Habitats Directive is truly innovative in terms of regional planning and nature conservation in that it reconciles the management and the use of outstanding natural sites in order to make the best use of land."
"To this end, the European Union must make every effort to support the implementation of this directive."
"The European Union absolutely must not yield to the industrial interests which would negate the very spirit of the directive."
"The Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties, must firstly adopt a firm stance with regard to the Member States in order to ensure that they implement these directives and, secondly, to stand firm against attempts to amend these directives even before they have been able to demonstrate their full relevance, particularly in the areas of dealing with nitrate pollution in water and protecting and raising the profile of outstanding natural sites."
"For the above reasons, the Group of the Greens supports all the reports presented, particularly the Sj√∂stedt report, which will contribute to improving the implementation of the Habitats Directive."
"The reason why we abstained, then, is that we do not feel that the last-minute attempts to change the nature of the report, seeking to weaken the Habitats Directive and to urge that it be amended, are in line with respecting the directives on which we are voting."
"Parish report (A5-0357/2000)"
"Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Mr President, I would be most grateful if you would reserve just a snippet of your attention, which I am sure is in no short supply, for the explanation of my vote for the Parish report on young farmers."
"I would stress the importance of milk produced by young farmers and of supporting the product at this difficult time for the farming world."
"I remember a film from the 1960s, directed by the famous Federico Fellini with Anita Akberg in the leading roll. There was a poster of her urging all the passers-by to drink milk."
"She was extremely successful and the ideal actress to persuade the Italians to drink milk."
"Well then, I would like similar appeals to be made to the European citizens now as well, so that farmers can sell their milk, which is, I regret to say, under threat from ""mad milk""."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the Parish report is the future of young farmers in the European Union."
"Once again we hear calls for new subsidies, for so-called installation aid."
"I voted against the report."
"The report presents the situation as if all were well with the farming world."
"But nothing is well with it."
"BSE has cast doubt on the entire agricultural system."
"We spend almost DEM 100 billion of our petty cash on agriculture every year."
"That, indeed, represents half of the European budget."
"We are starting to ask ourselves what we get in return for this money - swine fever, hormone-treated calves, dioxin-infested hens and now the BSE epidemic."
"I believe we are slowly becoming disgusted by this food chain we produce and perhaps disgusted with ourselves too."
"Instead of grasses and cereals, we are feeding cattle with corpses of domestic cats, caged rats and other animals, and I believe this is precisely the point that must now be included in this discussion."
"The use of waste products and excrement in food production is the logical consequence of a senseless agricultural policy, which undoubtedly has to be brought to an end right here and now."
"We must discuss first principles, so that these subsidisation payouts, the instruments of a command economy, can be consigned to the history books."
"That is precisely what we have to tell the young farmers."
"We must talk about that with young farmers, about the fact that they will have to be able to survive in the market without subsidisation."
"This is certainly not the thrust of the report, which is why it must be rejected."
". (EL) The report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a move in the right direction."
"More funds are needed to set young farmers up and reverse the exodus towards the towns."
"Young farmers may be the key to reviving abandoned areas, small islands and traditional communities from which the life force is draining."
"What we need is to use new technologies, such as the Internet, to create a new pleasant, cultural, technically advanced environment with a human dimension for them to work in."
"One important point not contained in the Agricultural Committee report is that young farmers need to be given a basis on which to develop alternative, organic, family holdings, given that over-intensive farming leads nowhere except to mad cows."
"- (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats welcome many of the measures proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to improve the situation for young farmers."
"We nonetheless believe that the EU' s agricultural subsidy ought to be reduced considerably and are therefore opposed to the demands for an increase in the agricultural subsidy, presented in paragraphs 7, 11 and 14 of Mr Parish' s report."
"We are in favour of assisting young farmers without financial resources to meet the considerable expenses involved in setting up business, purchasing farms and equipment."
"We therefore voted in favour of this report in spite of our reservations, for there is no guarantee that the bulk, if not all of this aid will not go to the children of wealthy farm owners and that, once again, those least well off will be left by the wayside."
"At this early stage, we would denounce the misappropriation of these funds to benefit the children of wealthy farm owners."
". I believe that the report from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is most balanced and should be welcomed."
"As a representative of a rural constituency, I am acutely aware of the concerns expressed by farmers over the very future of farming in Ireland."
"It seems incredible but it is true, that in Ireland, where agriculture has long been one of the economic bases of the country, farmers are now beginning to wonder whether their sons or daughters will be able to carry on the family tradition."
"Mr Parish' s report is very timely, and the study on ""The Future of Young Farmers in the European Union"" by independent consultants which was commissioned at his request at the beginning of last year provides a much-needed focus on the whole issue."
"Young farmers are an essential part of the farming future."
"They perform a very important role in the social life of villages and rural communities, promoting a whole range of activities and participating in local associations."
"Farmers help to promote a healthy and prosperous countryside by maintaining the landscape."
"In Ireland the National Development Plan for 2000-2006 provides a wide range of measures which will assist young farmers embarking on their farming career."
"These include a new enhanced Scheme of Installation Aid to encourage the taking-over of farms by younger farmers and assist young farmers as they first set up in farming."
"Some ¬£30 million has been provided for this scheme, which I hope will shortly be approved by the Commission."
"In addition, a comprehensive range of tax incentives are in place, aimed at reducing the cost of ownership transfer."
"These incentives include Stock Relief, Stamp Duty, Capital Acquisition and Probate Tax."
"Coupled with the Early Retirement Scheme, it is clear that the supports available to young farmers setting out on a career in agriculture will be of considerable benefit, and these measures should assist in the earlier and more efficient transfer of land to younger farmers."
"Many young farmers taking over a holding have to make necessary on-farm investments in order to optimise production efficiency and to ensure the economic sustainability of their holdings."
"In this regard some GBP 230 million have been provided for on-farm investment under the National Development Plan."
"Investment schemes will cover Farm Waste Management, Improvement in Dairy Hygiene Standards and Housing and Handling Facilities for Alternative Enterprises."
"These Schemes will be open to an increased number of part-time and full-time farmers, including young trained farmers, and will contribute to securing the viability of many farmers."
"They will focus in particular on young farmers."
"It should also be noted that the nature of these schemes shows a clear commitment to the protection of the environment, an issue which will figure strongly in the future development of both Irish and European agriculture."
"To conclude, it is imperative that we, at European level, address ourselves towards ensuring a future for European agriculture."
"The Common Agricultural Policy has been a European success story, and we want to keep it that way."
"The future lies with our young farmers and with agricultural practices which are sustainable and protect the environment."
"We must lend our full support to these objectives."
". (PT) The situation and the prospects of young farmers depend a great deal on the situation and prospects of Agriculture in the EU itself."
"As we all know, agriculture and the rural world are in decline, a decline in which the common agricultural policy has played a large part, promoting, as it does, land concentration, intensification of production, the gradual verticalisation of agricultural produce, all of which contribute to desertification and rural depopulation, as proved by a fall in the number of those employed and in the number of farms of around 22% and 20%, respectively, since 1990."
"Young farmers represent the new lifeblood of farms and are crucial to guaranteeing the future of agriculture in the various regions of the EU."
"The fall of around 28%, in the last decade, in farms whose owners are under 35 years of age proves the current negative prospects."
"Special measures for Community support for young farmers are therefore crucial, although the fundamental problem lies in the need for a sea change in the CAP."
"The Parish report, with which I broadly agree, despite its lack of coherence, does not focus on the necessary changes to policy."
"It toys with the existing framework."
"Nevertheless, three amendments which I tabled and which I believe to be important have been adopted. These are:"
"the need to commit ourselves to high-quality, sustainable agricultural production, which yields products which are safe and have a high added value, through support for biological agriculture, support for natural breeds and the consolidation of designations of origin and the creation of support mechanisms for regional products of special quality;"
"improving appropriations for rural development and structural funds to support and create broad public service networks, create infrastructures and give a boost to local markets in the rural world;"
"the need to simplify and integrate legislation affecting young farmers."
"The fact that we are discussing a report on the situation and prospects of young farmers in the European Union assumes very special significance in the light of the BSE crisis."
"What has happened since the well and truly hysterical dramatisation of the crisis in most of our Member States will surely do nothing to motivate young people to remain in farming, let alone encourage them to see their future in rural areas, where, as the report so admirably states, they have a very important role to perform in the social life of villages and rural communities, promoting and maintaining the countryside and contributing to the economic, social and environmental needs of the community,"
"We have greater cause for concern about the future of farming in the European Union than ever before as a result of this mainly consumer-led crisis of confidence, given that the number of farmers under the age of 35 has been showing the sharpest decline for some time and now stands at 28% and that the percentage of farmers in the population of almost every Member State is falling."
"Our report contains all the most important and correct diagnoses as well as all the demands which have to be fulfilled if sufficient numbers of young people are to continue to see their future in farming."
"This is a list of demands to which not only the European Commission but also the Council and all the Member States must pledge themselves if they want to prevent the depopulation, desolation and decline of rural areas in the European Union and the accompanying exacerbation of our social and cultural problems."
"In the EU we need sustainable, high-quality agricultural production."
"We must defend and safeguard the designations of origin of our quality produce, such as our wines, in the wider world, including the World Trade Organisation, because our future in the European Union and that of our export trade depends on top-quality products, for which there is a prosperous and discerning consumer market within and beyond the frontiers of the Union."
"There is a tendency to put the blame for the present problems, and especially for the BSE crisis, on the agricultural community, which is expected to produce increasingly cheap food."
"Because I was a member of the Consumers' Consultative Council of the European Commission for many years, I should also like to refer here to the responsibility of consumer organisations, which, heedless of producers' incomes, have been pressing incessantly for lower consumer prices for food."
"Again and again in the seventies and eighties, and more recently too, they spoke out against the payment of appropriate producer prices in the framework of the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products."
"So they too are partly responsible for the industrialisation of farming, for the fact that cows have been turned into carnivores and that the right of farmers to receive proper reward for their efforts has been disregarded."
"This has to be emphasised in the present debate."
"I am an enthusiastic proponent of this report, because it contains and clearly enunciates all the things that are right and important for the preservation of family-owned farms in Europe, without which there can be no support for organic farming with its high-quality regional specialities, which consumers must learn to appreciate and for which they must be prepared to pay a fair price."
"It has been noted that the situation of young farmers is a serious problem in the European Union and they do not have any real prospects despite the support provided by the Union and the Member States."
"This is why I consider this report to be so important and why I am delighted that we have voted in favour of it."
"The economic situation is unfavourable and sometimes extremely serious, particularly for young people."
"There is a real lack of prospects for young farmers, as well as a significant decrease in the numbers of farmers in general, with an increase in the age of those remaining."
"What can the European Union do?"
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, having been asked to give its opinion on this subject, did not wish to focus on aspects which fell within the remits of other committees."
"We therefore chose to highlight the issues associated with education, training and information policies and the social and cultural life of young farmers."
"We note that young farmers experience problems resulting from education and training that is often poorly suited to their needs."
"Even Agenda 2000 neglects these fundamentally important aspects."
"The European Union must encourage, through its Socrates and Leonardo Programmes, measures to strengthen education and training facilities for young farmers in order to raise their skills to the required level."
"IT training must be set up."
"Internet access must become a reality, and young farmers must be able to become acquainted with integrated production and marketing management systems so as to manage their holdings effectively."
"Depopulation may be combated, in particular by maintaining public services in rural areas (schools, post offices, transport services), and social facilities may be maintained by pooling the resources of several communes, for example, or by resorting to the use of mobile services."
"If the right conditions for revitalising farming are fulfilled, then young urban dwellers enthusiastic about nature and keen to improve their quality of life will be able to settle in the country and rural youth will no longer abandon the farms passed on to them by their parents."
"- (SV) The Swedish Christian Democrats have voted against the draft report since we find it incompatible with the principle of subsidiarity, in spite of the fact that the subject as such - the situation of young farmers - is of pressing importance."
"We especially object to paragraph 10 in which the unreasonable proposal is made that the 'EU should consider making it mandatory for the Member States to provide minimum levels of installation aid to young farmers' ."
"In our view, this is emphatically not a supranational issue."
"Varela Suanzes-Carpegna report (A5-0365/2000)"
"Mr President, the Pensioners' Party, which I represent at the European Parliament, considers that the Commission, Parliament and the Council should change a major part of the fisheries policy and calls upon them to do so. The section in question is the part which refers to the now established practice of fishing the waters of other countries and then relieving our conscience by paying a sum of money to the governments whose waters we have fished."
"I have always been told to give to those who have not."
"However, I am afraid that we Europeans are not giving anybody anything but are going to fish the waters of others instead."
"I am quite aware of the problems of fishermen, which we do have to resolve, but we must resolve them in some other way, not to the detriment of the peoples whose only livelihood is fishing."
"Gallagher report (A5-0333/2000)"
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying, on behalf of my group, that we are very strongly in favour of continuing a form of common fisheries policy within the European Union, because we understand that the management of resources is the best way forward for securing guarantees for the continuation of social and economic development in a lot of coastal regions of the European Union, which would have no other benefit and could not get employment or other developments except from their own natural resources, for example fishing and aquaculture."
"However, that said and giving credit where credit is due, we must also recognise that there are a lot of deficiencies within the common fisheries policy."
"In particular, the total objection to having a regionalised policy within the common fisheries policy is incorrect."
"This House has rejected that proposal again today."
"Regionalisation does not mean renationalisation or moving away from a Community model; it means giving communities which are bordering each other and are fishing similar species the opportunity to come together to manage those species."
"On top of that, we must also put greater emphasis on a uniform inspection system across all European Union waters and give more powers to the Community inspectors to ensure that all regulations are being properly enforced."
"Finally, I must say that there is a need for conservation."
"We have seen a huge depletion in the fishing stocks within the European Union waters."
"The way to resolve conservation questions is not by moving to different fish stocks and bringing them into a quota system, but by ensuring that we have certain no-go areas where we can allow fishing stocks to re-mature."
"This example has already been proven in certain areas by voluntary agreements in Irish waters and by maintenance of these non-fishing areas - so-called set-aside areas, to give the analogy with the common agricultural policy - for a certain period of time."
"That is the one way of guaranteeing that we can keep a food source going, provide employment and protect environmental considerations within our fishing waters."
"That is why we supported the Gallagher report."
"Mr President, I voted for this report on the common fisheries policy, but I call upon the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to monitor more effectively one of the factors referred to in paragraph 20 of the report, which is disregarded, namely how and whether the size of the pensions and situation of the pensioners in the fisheries sector and, in particular, in the small-scale fishing sector, are monitored."
"We have a responsibility to pensioners to concern ourselves, as well as with all the other important aspects of fisheries, with how the national States protect retired fishermen, as they are the last to receive sufficient protection in the area of pensions."
". (EL) My group voted in favour of the resolution."
"However, I must highlight one particular issue."
"According to current Community legislation, Greek fishermen have exclusive fishing rights within a zone of 6 nautical miles, as opposed to the 12 nautical miles which apply to the other Member States of the EU, especially the Mediterranean countries."
"This means that Greek fishermen are not being treated equally and are at a disadvantage compared with the other countries under the common fisheries policy."
"Given that, according to the statement in Article 5, paragraph 1 of Annex IX to the International Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Community has sole responsibility for conserving and managing marine fish stocks and, by extension, the competence to adopt the relevant rules and regulations, the Commission should make use of these powers and give Greek fishermen exclusive fishing rights within a zone of 12 nautical miles."
"Similarly, the European Parliament called in resolution √Å4-0018/99 (C-153/1-6-99) for the Commission to propose extending the exclusive fishing zone to 24 nautical miles in order to guarantee a suitable decentralisation policy and protection for the interests of coastal areas."
"The Commission should adopt this resolution by the European Parliament."
"The parliamentary reports on which we are required to deliver our opinion cover various aspects of the common fisheries policy, including the management and conservation of fisheries resources, structural policy, the European Union' s external relations on fishing, market organisation, monitoring and controls."
"The Commission has expressed the following priorities: improving the coherence between the various objectives of the CFP, especially between the conservation of resources, economic effectiveness and employment in fishing-dependent regions; greater consideration of the economic side of fishing; improving the integration of environmental and fishing policy; improving administrative instruments, particularly integrating multiannual instruments; seeking a more transparent decision making process and maintaining the external aspects of the CFP."
"We can, of course, support all these points in principle."
"I think it necessary, however, to highlight the following points which the Commission does not seem to have emphasised sufficiently."
"While it is true that the TACs must be determined chiefly on an objective scientific basis, dialogue with workers in the sector must certainly be established at institutional level and must be stepped up."
"The representatives of fishermen must be involved at the earliest stages prior to the scientists' deliberations in order to increase confidence and to enable decisions to be taken which are well-founded and more readily acceptable."
"Such consultation will be even more essential when the time comes to draw up multiannual guidelines."
"Inspection and penalty systems must absolutely be harmonised between the various fishing areas, in order to prevent distortions between Member States."
"The system of inspections carried out by Community countries on third country fleets operating in Community waters must be intensified."
"Finally, while maintaining the TAC and quota system at the heart of the CFP, we wish to restate the value we attach to respecting the principle of relative stability and our opposition to the privatisation of quotas."
"Poignant report (A5-0332/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for this report for I - and the Pensioners' Party - consider that, before taking important decisions, the European Parliament - and not only Parliament but all the government bodies - should consult the groups, peoples and citizens concerned."
"The document states that the Commission consulted a large number of bodies before taking a decision on the common fisheries policy: representatives of the fishermen, representatives of the companies which live off fishing and representatives of the fishing boat equipment companies."
"It has consulted them all, performing a sort of consultation regionalisation."
"That is all well and good, but has it also consulted the fish, Mr President?"
"In 2003, Blue Europe, with its common fisheries policy, will be changed."
"2001 already marks the end of one of the fisheries management instruments, the MAGP IV, or the Multiannual Guidance Programme."
"We have two years before 31 December 2002 to consider and make a decision on a common policy which, according to the European Commission' s tally, raises 18 questions, ranging from free access to territorial waters, the control and management of the market in fishery and aquaculture products to international fisheries agreements, scientific research into fish stocks and the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean."
"The CFP is being reviewed, and even overhauled, against a complex, multi-sided context."
"Firstly, resources are finite."
"Stocks such as hake, cod, sardine and tuna, are endangered or at risk."
"There is wastage."
"Every year, worldwide, over 15% of fish caught are thrown back into the sea, particularly in the EU, on the pretext of maintaining prices or in order to respect restrictions, whereas countries such as Norway make the most of fish that fall outside the permitted limits."
"They make up 20 million tonnes of the total global catch of 122 million tonnes."
"International and regional organisations are also concerned about fisheries management, from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the General Fisheries Council for the Mediterranean, to the North West Atlantic fisheries institutions, in which the EC participates."
"Europe has also passed 25 bilateral agreements with countries including Angola, the Seychelles and Madagascar and is attempting to come to an agreement with Morocco, no mean process and one that is currently in difficulties."
"More importantly, globalisation, and the associated problem of cheap imports, is now affecting the market."
"Essentially, the CFP, which often contains too many excessively obscure regulations, must reconcile contradictory objectives, i.e. conserve fish stocks, according to the precautionary principle, while protecting coastal communities and economies which sometimes depend on the fishing industry for employment, as in the case of the Manche region."
"Similarly, we need a clear CFP that is flexible enough to take into account specific regional characteristics, from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and even, as the Italians hope, those of the Adriatic or other sub-regional ""seas"" ."
"In particular, we must reconcile the major opening up of the European market, importing 60% of consumption, with the need to protect our fishermen, who see the Japanese, American and Korean markets closing."
"In order to handle such diverse problems, the European Commission has used an effective method that involves extensive consultation of fisheries and environmental organisations as well as producers."
"(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on depleted uranium"
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I would like to welcome the compromise resolution which we have just passed."
"A strong and united voice calling unequivocally for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons is a positive step forward, even if it does not go as far as we would have liked."
"The Greens and EFA were calling for a complete ban on the production, export and use of depleted uranium weapons and we believe that we have a legal as well as a moral basis for doing so."
"The UN Convention of October 1980 banned the use of certain indiscriminate weapons; the 1996 resolution of the Sub-Commission on Human Rights also explicitly condemned depleted uranium weapons because of their non-discriminatory character. The use of these weapons has already, therefore, been condemned in international law."
"We would also have been more reassured if the resolution had included our concerns about the methodology which is being used to assess the risks of depleted uranium."
"A growing number of scientists are now challenging the conventional methodology, which is based on doses of external radioactive rays rather than internally ingested or inhaled particles."
"Research shows that deaths from leukaemia resulting from the Chernobyl explosion have been one hundred times more than predicted by the relevant radiological protection boards, which have based their predictions on external rays."
"The enormity of this error conceals the fact that even very low doses of radiation, like that from depleted uranium, can in fact have devastating health impacts."
"It is therefore essential that we get this methodology right or else all the tests and screening in the world will be simply worthless."
"Finally, I would like to refer to the report on the front page of last week's European Voice, which proclaims that the new EU rapid reaction force is apparently planning to use depleted uranium weapons."
"Now remember this is a humanitarian force, which is planning to use a weapon that will leave an enormous legacy of cancers among the very civilians it is supposed to be there to protect."
"This is nothing short of scandalous and must be overturned."
"Mr President, I voted against this document because I feel that there has been too much hypocrisy at play in this issue."
"I suspect, or rather, I fear, that this is what happened:"
"""Mr President, which weapons shall we use against Milosevic?"""
"""The ones we usually use!"" replied the President."
"""Which weapons do we usually use?"" asked the general."
"""Do you mean depleted uranium shells as well?"""
"""Yes, why not?"" said the President."
"""But,"" the general protested, ""they can be extremely harmful to those who use them because they are dangerous in war - we have tested them."""
"""But, as you know, my dear general,"" replied the President, ""war involves calculated risks and we must run these risks as well."""
"Mr President, in times of war we have to make do, as they say."
"I do not think we can be surprised at these sad incidents, which could only have been prevented by having a united, independent Europe."
"Mr President, I supported the joint resolution on depleted uranium and I welcome the fact that Parliament decided to retain the reference and the call for a moratorium on these weapons."
"I would have preferred a stronger resolution but I know how difficult it is to achieve that."
"What I do want to say, however, is that I deplore the attitude displayed by Mr Solana here this morning."
"At the same time as declaring he was in favour of transparency and openness in relation to this issue, he admitted that he only began to take action on it when it became a public issue about a week ago, despite his role as Secretary-General of NATO during the Balkans War."
"He also failed to mention or to give a view on the question whether there ought to be a moratorium on these weapons."
"I deplore also his attempt to make this Parliament complicit in the decision by NATO to use these weapons."
"The use of these weapons was disproportionate to the challenge that was being faced by NATO, particularly in the war against Serbia, and was therefore unnecessary and was a callous disregard of the effects on the population at large. It was a callous disregard of the effect it would have on the NATO troops, and indeed it was a callous disregard of the after-effects on aid workers and peacekeeping forces, both military and police, in the aftermath of that war."
"I would urge, as others have urged, that the new rapid reaction force should not have available to it these types of weapons."
"Indeed I will be calling on my own government in Ireland to refuse to participate in this rapid reaction force unless there is a clear commitment that these weapons will not be used."
". (EL) √îhe only purpose which the joint motion for a resolution on the ""Balkan syndrome"" serves is to cover up the criminal policy of NATO and the European Union which, on the pretext of defending human rights, invaded Yugoslavia, causing incalculable personal injury and material damage."
"And to ensure that the bombings were even more destructive, they had no qualms about using weapons with depleted uranium shells, despite the fact that they were well aware of their deadly long-term impact from the war against Iraq."
"Because the joint motion for a resolution refuses to acknowledge the correlation between cases of cancer and leukaemia in soldiers who served in the occupying forces in Bosnia and Kosovo and during the Gulf War and depleted uranium, it confines itself to a wish list of transparent discussions and working parties and merely calls for the Member States who are members of √ç√Å√î√è to propose that the use of depleted uranium weapons be stopped and for √ç√Å√î√è to study the possibility of using different types of weapons, in other words to continue killing, but with ""clean"" weapons."
"Typically, the proposed amendment from the group of the left calling for a ban on the production, testing, use and sale of depleted uranium weapons was ostentatiously rejected by the conservative majority of the members of the European Parliament, attracting a mere 23% of the votes."
"Of course, the European Parliament acted true to form, as the war criminal, the former Secretary-General of NATO and the current High Representative of the EU, Javier Solana, cynically pointed out in his intervention, because it was the European Parliament itself which insisted on military intervention in the Balkans, both in Bosnia and Kosovo."
"We would, of course, be deluding ourselves if we expected war criminals to accuse themselves."
"That job belongs to the people."
"The Communist Party of Greece has repeatedly called both for a ban on the use of depleted uranium and for the occupying forces to leave the Balkans immediately and for NATO and the EU to bear the cost of treating and compensating victims and cleaning up the environment."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the joint motion for a resolution and call on the people to organise and develop their own united resistance to, and launch their own counter-attack on, the barbaric new order."
"- (DA) The joint motion for a resolution contains many sensible ideas but does not do justice to the very difficult situation in which NATO has placed the civilian population in the Balkans, the soldiers who were stationed there and their dependents."
"Approximately 20 Balkans veterans have died from leukaemia, and the figure is growing."
"American soldiers in KFOR were warned against breathing in depleted uranium."
"They were warned against touching anything which might be suspected of having been in contact with depleted uranium; they were called upon to leave areas suspected of having been polluted by dust from depleted uranium weapons; and they were urged to wash their uniforms often."
"We do not think that the American army provides warnings of this kind without good reason."
"There have also been a number of investigations showing that breathing in depleted uranium is extremely dangerous to health."
"The consequences for the civil population in those areas exposed to military action by NATO have by no means been thoroughly investigated."
"However, only the future will decide the matter."
"We therefore believe it is quite inadequate merely to carry out another investigation into the consequences of using depleted uranium weapons."
"We believe the matter has now been quite carefully examined."
"In our view, the precautionary principle must, in any case, also cover those who report for international assignments, as well as the civil population in war zones."
"These weapons should be covered by the provisions of the Geneva Convention concerning chemical and nuclear weapons."
"All production ought to be stopped, and all stockpiles destroyed."
"We demand an end to the use of depleted uranium weapons now."
"The fact that, for at least 10 years, the armies of the most powerful countries have known about the harmful effects of depleted uranium weapons, including the effects on those using them, proves that army leaders have as much contempt for their own soldiers as they have for the civilian population and the enemy forces."
"We have good cause to be outraged at the effects that using such weapons has had upon NATO soldiers."
"We have even more reason to be outraged at the effects on the civilian population, the people who were killed by depleted uranium weapons in just the same way as those killed by conventional bombs."
"Yet, what should we make of the hypocritical surprise shown by the representatives of all these political parties that took part in the decision to bomb Serbia and Kosovo, the majority of whom did so after supporting the Gulf War?"
"They gave army leaders a free hand and, today, faced with the public' s reaction, they are pretending to be concerned about the consequences of their decision while trying to shirk their own responsibilities."
"We voted in favour of the draft amendment from the Confederal Group of the European United Left which requested a ""ban on the manufacture, testing, use and sale of depleted uranium munitions"" , even though we accepted that this would not turn an unjust war into a ""clean war"" ."
"We voted against the compromise resolution to register our protest against the use of depleted uranium weapons, against warfare itself whenever it is used, but also against the hypocrisy of the parties supporting such wars."
"The general public is particularly concerned about the link between the depleted uranium used in weapons and public health."
"At the moment of impact, these weapons unleash chemical reactions, whose effects upon soldiers, civilians and the environment are still not known."
"Moreover, uranium, even the depleted variety which is 20% less radioactive than natural uranium, is still a form of nuclear waste and dangerous to use."
"There may be a link between the cases of leukaemia found in soldiers who have served in the Balkans and the use of such weapons by NATO."
"Even though conclusive proof has not yet been brought forward, and even if there is no consensus among scientists, what we have today is more than mere suspicion, as is shown by the results of various enquiries."
"This concern is therefore well grounded and should not be treated lightly."
"Until we obtain conclusive proof, we should apply the precautionary principle and impose a moratorium on the use of such weapons."
"This is the very least on which we can decide today, before a total ban is imposed, should the studies confirm the danger."
"NATO should be totally open about the use of these weapons and about the conduct of its operations in general, and the European Commission should itself begin an independent scientific enquiry."
"We owe it to all the people who are currently suffering or living under this threat to demand truth and transparency."
"At a time when international law is tending towards the obligation to intervene legitimately on humanitarian grounds in defence of human rights, the civilian population cannot be put at risk by the armed forces supposed to protect it."
"The explanatory statement sets out our justified concerns regarding this important issue, which affects the health of soldiers involved in operations in difficult areas."
"The local populations involved naturally have a vested interest in this, especially in relation to the necessary criteria for the social, economic and environmental reconstruction of the affected areas."
"In its entirety, therefore, the resolution is fair and I fully support it."
"However, as it stands, paragraph 6 goes too far, as it stands, in calling upon NATO member states to propose a moratorium, as the precautionary principle is included in the draft which urges NATO to consider other types of weapons until the results of the enquiry on depleted uranium are published."
"Since I am unable to support paragraph 6, I have therefore decided to abstain from voting on the whole text."
". (PT) We are voting against the joint motion for a resolution that has been tabled because we cannot accept that we are still trying to deny the obvious, i.e. the serious effects on the health of people in areas affected by the use of weapons containing depleted uranium."
"Since the beginning of the nuclear age, which started at the time of the Second World War, we have been aware of the risks and the precautions when dealing with uranium and other radioactive substances because this is a highly toxic element (both chemically and radiologically), when inhaled or ingested and is also a threat in genetic terms."
"The use of this type of ammunition by the US and other NATO countries during the Gulf war, in Bosnia and in Kosovo has already caused the death of thousands of soldiers, suffering and death for the inhabitants of areas that were bombed and the environmental pollution in affected areas, with medium- and long-term consequences, which will affect not only the present generation but also future generations, which is prohibited by the Geneva Convention. This makes it quite clear that there is no such thing as a ""clean war"" ."
"Therefore, given the scale of the crime that has been committed against whole civilian populations, it is crucial that we investigate, try and convict the leaders responsible for this crime against humanity, and immediately ban the manufacture, testing, use and sale of this type of weapon containing depleted uranium, not simply approve a moratorium."
". The British delegation of Labour MEPs welcomes the action taken by NATO member states to investigate the causes of deaths and illnesses suffered by troops who served in the Balkans."
"We believe that consideration of the use of depleted uranium should be based on scientific fact."
"We note that as yet there is no evidence to link depleted uranium and ill health suffered either by troops or civilians."
"For that reason, we do not believe that it is appropriate at this time to call for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons."
"Did the discovery of the dangerous nature of depleted uranium weapons really come as a surprise?"
"We all know that these weapons, used by NATO during the Gulf War (1991), and the conflicts in Bosnia (1994-5) and Kosovo (1999) had serious consequences, firstly, for the civilian population that was bombed, for their environment, and for the soldiers there, whether NATO, Iraqi, Bosnian, Serbian or Kosovan forces."
"For a long time, the military and political authorities simply poured scorn on anyone who expressed concern about this matter."
"American and then French soldiers had to get organised before the scandal was eventually unearthed, following the suspicious death of an Italian."
"There is no such thing as a 'clean' war."
"The unspoken confession of forces formerly involved in combat should allow us to get right to the bottom of the responsibilities of the government and army leaders, primarily Mr Solana, the former Secretary-General of NATO."
"We must demand a ban on the manufacture, testing, use and sale of depleted uranium weapons."
"We are in favour of signing an international treaty and, in the short term, we demand a programme for the medical examination of soldiers who have taken part in operations in the Balkans, members of humanitarian organisations who have worked in the field and the people living in the areas in question."
". I voted for the moritorium on weapons using depleted uranium."
"Ideally I would have preferred a total ban in view of the very high probability that they cause indiscriminate damage to health."
"I further deplore them on account of their unacceptable impact on the human and natural environment more widely."
"I particularly wish to register profound concern about the environmental damage that is almost certainly being caused by test firing at the Dundrennan Range on the Solway Firth."
"These waters already suffer unacceptable levels of radioactive pollution from Sellafield."
"Mr President, after all the distressing incidents which occurred during the bombing of Yugoslavia and the disclosures about the use of depleted uranium ammunition, the top priority today is to ban this type of ammunition, which has dangerous consequences both the second it is fired and for a long time afterwards, and which is undiscriminating, i.e. which makes no distinction between those who are at risk of suffering its effects."
"We also need, equally urgently, to formulate a large-scale assistance, prevention and reconstruction policy for the whole of Yugoslavia affected by the use of this ammunition, in order to protect public health and the environment, clean up the ground and the waters and safeguard the unimpeded development of the country and the region in general."
"The joint motion for a resolution under discussion does not completely cover the first objective, but it does have the merit of calling for a moratorium on the use of these weapons."
"As for the second objective, a few general, abstract references are made to existing assistance programmes which, however you look at it, are of limited scope, while there appears to be no sign of any intention to engage in new, efficient intervention at the level of real needs, as circumstances requires."
"For the rest, the motion for a resolution extends - with a few brief references - to very serious matters, such as the analysis of and the need for research into depleted uranium, but makes no mention whatsoever of the constant efforts being made to confuse and conceal the facts, independent research which we all know about and even official texts issued by NATO countries on the danger of depleted uranium and the protective measures which they themselves impose on their forces."
"It is for these reasons that I am unable to vote in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"I shall return a blank ballot paper because the call for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium may be a positive step in the right direction, not that this means that war, internationally illegal bombings and other similar, fruitless interventions will stop."
"In all events, constant efforts must be made and a mass movement throughout Europe and the whole world must endeavour to bring about a definitive ban on all these weapons, thereby dealing a blow to the high-handedness and arrogance of the militaristic perception of politics and the world."
"Finally, I wish to state that I am nonplussed by the political sleight of hand during our debate: just as we were accused in the past of serving NATO and the bombings by criticising Milosevic's policy, now Mr Solana accuses us, in our criticism of the use of depleted uranium, of forgetting the human rights of Milosevic's victims."
"In both cases, anyone with a lack of arguments on the matter at issue will forget the principles of rationalism and flirt with the irrational, which is the precursor to any type of totalitarianism or Stalinism."
"Resolution on Korea"
"Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of the resolution on Communist Korea."
"It goes without saying that we thoroughly deplore the deeds committed by the Communist dictatorship in North Korea since 1950."
"The scorn for human dignity that has been displayed is nothing more than the result of the unbridled materialism on which Communism in particular and revolutionary ideology in general are based."
"This group expresses the hope that North Korea will in the near future resume a policy of genuine freedom that is an indispensable condition for peace."
"In this respect, we are delighted that both North and South Korea have been on better terms for some time now."
"This drive to find peace is a source of great hope for thousands of families that have been separated for half a century."
"We must do all we can to encourage this change."
"Nevertheless, we can but condemn the willingness, indicated in the resolution, to entrust the task of managing relations with Communist Korea to the European Union rather than to Member States."
"Need we remind you that diplomacy is one of the regal powers of every sovereign state?"
"Each state is free to conduct diplomatic relations with any other."
"Each nation should be able to retain the freedom to conduct the foreign policy of its choice, the one most suited to its political and economic interests."
"However, I sincerely doubt that the Community institutions, swollen as they are with fine-sounding but half-baked principles, are mature enough to deal with the reality."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Council priorities for the meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Council priorities for the meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the European Commission, I am very pleased that, at an early stage in the Swedish Presidency, the opportunity has already been provided to debate this important issue concerning the preparations for the forthcoming meeting with the UN Human Rights Commission."
"In the course of the debate, I shall, of course, follow carefully the points of view put forward and interpret the mood of the Assembly before the continued discussion to establish the EU' s position."
"The presidency' s objective in the run-up to this year' s session is to unite the EU behind agreed positions, to encourage the applicant countries to back the EU' s statements and resolutions and, as far as at all possible, to muster general support for the proposals - especially, this year, regarding the situations in Iran and Chechnya."
"For understandable reasons, it is still unclear quite how the Human Rights Commission' s special session on the situation in the Middle East, held last autumn, is to be followed up."
"What is, however, clear is that the issue may be expected to become one of the dominant issues during this year' s session and that the EU will be one of the central players."
"In March of last year, the Council requested an assessment of the EU' s human rights dialogue with China."
"The conclusions are expected to be adopted at the Council' s meeting at the end of January."
"These will define the objectives of the dialogue and specify the forms to be taken both by the dialogue itself and by the regular assessments of the outcome of the dialogue."
"It is still unclear whether a resolution on China is to be adopted in this year' s session."
"The EU is in close contact with the United States, which was last year' s proposer."
"The same applies to another issue that has attracted attention in the Human Rights Commission, namely the resolution regarding the human rights situation in Cuba, for which the Czech Republic and Poland took responsibility last year."
"Among the resolutions on particular themes, the EU will, in the future too, take responsibility for the resolutions concerning the rights of the child and the death penalty."
"Where women' s rights are concerned, the Human Rights Commission will be deciding upon a number of resolutions to which the EU is strongly committed, even though they are not EU initiatives."
"It is as yet uncertain what initiatives will be required from the EU when it comes to the Human Rights Commission' s resolution concerning the World Conference Against Racism, while the EU's participation in the preparations for this World Conference will undoubtedly be one of the greatest challenges during this six-month period."
"The so-called omnibus resolution on the rights of the child, prepared in cooperation with the Latin American group, has unfortunately become so extensive that it has become almost impossible to deal with."
"It is therefore the EU' s ambition to reduce the size of the resolution to a minimum and, in the process, make the rights perspective central."
"This ambition is reinforced by the desire to make a useful contribution to the preparations for the UN' s special session on children in September 2001."
"Work in opposition to the death penalty is a priority issue for the EU' s common foreign policy within the area of human rights, as may partly be seen from the EU' s guidelines adopted in 1998."
"An important feature of this work is the Human Rights Commission' s resolution concerning the death penalty."
"The ambition, this year too, is to achieve as strong support as possible for this resolution."
"An important prerequisite for the EU' s active involvement in issues affecting human rights is good access to relevant information."
"In this area, the EU countries' and the Commission' s representatives around the world have an important role to play when it comes to gathering information."
"Close cooperation with private organisations is a central factor, as is cooperation with regional organisations."
"Last but not least, the EU will continue to give every support to the UN' s High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my colleague, Mr Patten, who had to leave to go to Moscow for a meeting, I should like to praise Parliament for holding this debate today, because it affords us a valuable opportunity for an exchange of views on the forthcoming Commission on Human Rights."
"It is important that the views of Parliament are taken into account, as the European Union works towards establishing positions on the main issues which will be covered in Geneva."
"New positions on the initiatives in Geneva will only be finally determined after lengthy negotiations, which are, of course, an integral part of the process."
"NGOs and others are right to highlight the usefulness of discussion and scrutiny of the positions."
"Representatives of the presidency, the Commission services and several Member States attended a meeting of the Human Rights Contact Group held in Brussels on 11 January."
"A wide range of NGOs got an opportunity to set out their views with regard to key country and thematic concerns and this input will no doubt prove helpful to the deliberation process."
"The 56th Commission on Human Rights of last year inevitably had its high and low points."
"The adoption of the resolution tabled by the European Union on the death penalty was a welcome achievement."
"The European Union may repeat this move this year, reflecting the fact that the issue remains of paramount concern."
"The Swedish Presidency has signalled more generally that the efforts made by the European Union in connection with the death penalty will be continued and intensified."
"There was disappointment at the adoption of a no-action motion on China."
"Some members of the Human Rights Commission voted against, making clear that such motions can only serve to stifle discussion and undermine the very raison d'√™tre of the gathering."
"As I have noted, decisions regarding EU resolutions for this year's 57th Commission in Geneva have not been finalised, as is usual for this stage of the process."
"The presidency and Member States are examining the situation in several countries, taking into account, where appropriate, the information from the United Nations' special rapporteurs and other evidence available."
"I will venture brief comments on some issues of interest which, whether or not they form part of an EU initiative, will doubtless be topics of discussion for those attending the 57th Commission."
"Familiar concerns remain with respect to China, concerns which continue to be heard as part of the EU-China dialogue."
"Positive developments in recent months include the signature of a memorandum of understanding on human rights with the United Nations High Commissioner last November."
"It is nonetheless essential that dialogue leads to concrete change, a point reiterated by the European Union in Geneva last year."
