"Text"
"Clearly the attainment of all these objectives will depend on the spread of these technologies, which - as the rapporteur, whom I congratulate on a very good report, rightly points out - depends, among other things, on the existence of a network of hydrogen filling stations."
"Such stations should come into being at the same time in all Member States to enable every European consumer to have access to them."
"I also hope that vehicle manufacturers will respond to rising consumer demand for hydrogen powered vehicles so that a common market in this sphere can function properly."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is a good example of how politics is able to take action, because type-approval permits for hydrogen powered vehicles will be available in the future, even though the technology itself is not yet available."
"We talk a lot about reducing CO2 produced by vehicles, particularly trucks."
"This could be one way of reducing CO2 emissions, but it is important - and I am speaking as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for which I was the shadow rapporteur - that we generate the hydrogen from renewable energies."
"This also offers the possibility of storing energy from renewable sources, which we could then use for vehicles, and that would be a good direction to take."
"We should continue to concentrate on this in future."
"However, it is also important to create a filling station infrastructure."
"We see, for example, that the infrastructure for CNG vehicles is still very patchy."
"The vehicles are available but the customers, the drivers, are still holding back from purchasing them because availability of the fuel is not guaranteed."
"We need to keep the focus on that in future discussions."
"(PL) Madam President, may I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, and also the Commission, on an initiative that is aimed at seeking out new power sources for vehicles and sources from which energy may be obtained."
"There are three important objectives: firstly, our continuing escape from dependence on oil."
"The second objective relates to CO2 emissions."
"Finally, the third objective - and this is an important one - is to stabilise and lower the costs of vehicle use for those using them."
"In my view, the document under discussion covers three areas, and these are: one - the labelling of hydrogen powered vehicles; two - requirements for filling stations (their siting and introduction)."
"Finally, the third area that I consider important is the safety of operation of hydrogen vehicles."
"This regulation firstly establishes a legal framework that lays down how we should utilise this energy and secondly provides the infrastructure requirements, ensuring that the basic ex ante conditions for developing the new technology are essentially met."
"(RO) In the transport sector, constant efforts should be made towards introducing alternative fuel vehicles in the market, which contribute to the significant improvement of air quality in the urban environment."
"Common standards for the approval of hydrogen-powered engines are required in order to guarantee the safe use of hydrogen for vehicle propulsion."
"The use of hydrogen as fuel, either as fuel cells or as internal combustion engines, generates no carbon emissions or greenhouse gases."
"The type-approval of hydrogen powered motor vehicles is based on the specification and meeting of the technical requirements for hydrogen-based components."
"Taking into consideration the characteristics of hydrogen, vehicles require specific treatment from rescue services."
"I emphasize the need for Member States to invest in the infrastructure required for the storage and distribution of alternative fuels, without which the number of less polluting vehicles cannot increase significantly."
"(PL) Madam President, as I wished to keep within the time limit, namely one minute, I failed to get across an important point, which I would like to emphasise as an advantage of the solution."
"This is that we are coming up with a proposed solution well ahead of time, creating conditions for modernity."
"This may also mean an incentive to look for even more technologies, and for that reason I would like to express recognition for both Commissioner Verheugen and the Commission."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see that this debate has shown broad consensus in many respects: firstly, a broad consensus that hydrogen technology is an interesting potential way of helping to solve our energy problems; secondly, consensus that hydrogen technology is a potentially interesting option for road traffic; and thirdly, a very wide consensus that, of course, hydrogen technology in general makes sense only if the overall ecological effect is positive - that is, if hydrogen is made from clean sources of energy."
"That is a very important result."
"I would also like to inform you that the Commission has placed particular importance on the development of hydrogen technology in the 7th Framework Research Programme."
"EUR 800 million have been made available for research into hydrogen technology, and not only for vehicles, in a joint technology initiative."
"I want to avoid giving the impression that we are spending EUR 800 million to enable research into hydrogen as a fuel technology."
"That is only part of the project; overall, the project is about creating clear principles in terms of the extent to which hydrogen can actually contribute to drastically reducing our society's CO2 emissions."
"Along with the President of this Parliament, Mr PÃ¶ttering, I had the opportunity to drive a hydrogen powered vehicle for a time."
"My personal impression was that the technical problems connected with the use of hydrogen in vehicles have basically been solved."
"The technology is there."
"It can be done."
"What is totally lacking - and this has been mentioned several times already - is the infrastructure."
"I can imagine that, once this proposal has been accepted and provided encouragement to the industry, we will then have to deal with the question that Mr Bulfon also raised in this debate. That is the question of whether perhaps those who run large fleets of vehicles used mainly locally, such as parliaments, including this Parliament, national parliaments, governments, and the European Commission, should set a good example as soon as practicable and, through their procurement policies, facilitate the bringing onto the market of vehicles of this type."
"At the moment that is still only a pipe dream, but it is something we should think about when the time comes."
"Let me thank the rapporteur again for her truly excellent work, as well as all the speakers from the groups and committees, who have shown that we have a common vision here of what the future for vehicles in Europe could look like."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the very interesting speeches."
"I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission, the representatives of the Council and the staff for their fantastic cooperation, which was the key to achieving this political unity at first reading."
"As we have seen, hydrogen is a technology of the future."
"Hydrogen can be part of the answer to the challenges posed by climate change and the need to reduce emissions."
"It is a clean alternative to fossil fuels and the use of hydrogen as an energy vector - as has been stated, it is indeed an energy vector - is totally sustainable if it is produced from renewable energies or nuclear energy."
"This is the direction we have to take in the coming years."
"I am fascinated by the idea of having a totally hazard-free hydrogen cycle in which hydrogen is ultimately produced from renewable energies and then vaporised."
"It is truly fascinating."
"I supported this technology long before I came to the European Parliament, and have also worked voluntarily on it for a long time."
"Today we have set things going in the right direction."
"We have created the necessary preconditions so that we can eventually have unified type-approval regulations."
"We have also shown the way to an international type-approval regulation and set the future direction for research and development."
"The technology is already here, as Commissioner Verheugen has rightly said."
"Now we must deal with the other questions relating to infrastructure."
"The question of filling station infrastructure will be handled by a public-private partnership."
"Perhaps then we will find that it will not be long before hydrogen powered vehicles are on our streets, and not just as prototypes."
"Thank you once again for the good cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (SK) Reserves of raw materials for the production of traditional hydrocarbon fuels are constantly declining and therefore the subject of research and development of new alternative drive systems in the motor vehicle industry is most urgent."
"The EU Seventh Framework Programme allocated EUR 800 million for research into hydrogen technology."
"On the basis of research, hydrogen appears to be the ideal alternative to traditional fossil fuels."
"The use of hydrogen as a future fuel in road vehicles offers a solution which is exceptionally favourable for the environment. It causes zero emissions of carbon compounds and greenhouse gases."
"The first prototype cars have already been successfully tested in the European Economic Area."
"In order for the internal market to be able to operate and also to provide a high degree of safety for the population and environmental protection, there is a need to lay down European-wide rules for the design of hydrogen powered motor vehicles."
"Unified approval rules throughout the EU are the minimum prerequisite for placing hydrogen powered vehicles on the market."
"The successful introduction of new technologies also depends on the timely construction of an appropriate network of hydrogen filling stations."
"I believe that today's debate will improve the confidence of European consumers in the use of new technologies in the motor vehicle industry and increase the share of such vehicles on the European market."
"I am convinced that only a technically well-prepared EU will be able to achieve success in competition with the USA, Japan and Korea where there has been considerable activity in this field."
"In view of this, I consider this initiative to be very positive."

"Statement by the President"
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to send a message of solidarity to the victims of hurricane Gustav in the Caribbean."
"Nearly 100 people lost their lives in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cuba, and thousands of others are now homeless."
"Once again, the citizens of these developing countries with which we maintain close links through the Cotonou Agreement - the ACP countries group - are suffering the ravages of a new natural disaster in these regions."
"The European Union is closely monitoring the situation in the affected countries and is sending humanitarian aid."
"The European Parliament will, of course, be closely monitoring the supply of humanitarian assistance to countries in the region, particularly through the work of its Committee on Development and the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."

"- Before the vote on paragraph 19:"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, when we drafted the resolution, we used the previous text, the wording of which does not entirely convey that the European Council has met in the meantime."
"I would therefore suggest to you that the second part of the text should read: 'and therefore welcomes the decision of the European Council to deploy'."
"Our text currently says that we call on the Council to do so, but it has already done it."
"Therefore, we ought to adjust the wording accordingly."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on the resolution:"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my group had a vigorous debate about this compromise resolution yesterday."
"On some essential points, it deviates from the text that we as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament originally contributed."
"By this I do not mean in any way to call the negotiations into question or to minimise negotiators' success in achieving a compromise resolution with the other groups, but there is one element that we cannot get through, but which plays a key role in our resolution."
"Even though this element, which I will name in a minute, is no longer included in the text, our group has decided to vote in favour of the compromise resolution because we believe that it is important that the European Parliament sends a unified signal."
"However, I want to make it clear here that we would very much have liked to see President Saakashvili's aggressive attitude restrained and also, at the start of the conflict, a firm hold put on a totally inappropriate ..."
"(Protests from the right and applause from the left)"
"We would have liked to have seen what happened at the start included in this resolution, if only to make it plain that the very people who are protesting so loudly here now are the same people who want to intensify the conflicts rather than reduce them."
"(Applause from the left and protests from the right)"
"You surely understand that at this point in the voting I have no intention of re-opening a debate."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament thought it was worth explaining its final vote with that remark, and I think everyone understood what that was about."
"There is no need to re-open a debate."

"Formal sitting - Costa Rica"
"Bienvenido al Parlamento Europeo, Presidente Arias!"
"President of the Republic of Costa Rica, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to you, President Arias."
"Your visit is a milestone in relations between the European Parliament, the European Union, Costa Rica and Latin America."
"Dr Ãscar Arias, you have been President of Costa Rica already, from 1986 to 1990, and in 2006 you were re-elected for a four-year term."
"You are best known as a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to you in 1987 to acknowledge the enormous efforts you have made in the quest for paths to peace in Central America."
"President Arias's efforts in his role as an international broker came to fruition in the Esquipulas Peace Agreement, which was signed by the presidents of all Central American countries on 7 August 1987."
"The European Union supported these efforts wholeheartedly."
"The President of Costa Rica is therefore a role model for people throughout the world."
"He once said it was vital to have values, principles and ideals and to fight for them."
"President Arias, you have been committed to this for many years and the citizens of Costa Rica honoured the results of that work by re-electing you two years ago."
"In my speech at the 5th EU-Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) summit meeting in Lima, Peru, which took place in May this year, I emphasised the foundational significance of regional integration for the 21st century."
"As Jean Monnet, one of the founding fathers of the European Union, expressed it so succinctly, it is a case of 'building union among people, not cooperation between states'."
"President Aria, you too have subscribed to this ideal and worked actively to achieve it."
"From the point of view of the European Parliament, it is desirable to conclude an association agreement between Central America and the European Union in the near future - and I said so in Lima as well - and I would like to add, as we discussed in detail in our meeting just now: whenever war breaks out somewhere, vast amounts of money are made available in dollars or euros or whichever currency, but when support is required to establish peaceful relations, then countries argue about far smaller amounts of money."
"We must give peace a chance!"
"(Applause)"
"That is our message today to the other European institutions."
"President Aria, let me say, in conclusion, that we believe that you and your country will continue to play a crucial role in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"On behalf of all the Members of the European Parliament, I would like to welcome you again."
"I hope that your visit will give us the opportunity to strengthen the bonds of friendship between Europe, Costa Rica and Latin America."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to add something a little 'off the record': it is wonderful that the President of Costa Rica is here; and it is a very nice coincidence - by way of exception, I am allowed to mention somebody's age today - that the Member of the European Commission responsible for external policy, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, is celebrating her 60th birthday today."
"That is another happy occasion, and good reason to wish her many happy returns of the day."
"(Applause)"
"President Arias, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you most sincerely for this brilliant, distinguished speech."
"Your words expressed that you and your country represent democracy and freedom; you work against violence, against terror, against dictatorship."
"When you say that Costa Rica is a small country, then I would like to point out that the population of a country or its geographical area are not the most important things."
"What is important is the spirit of a country and its president."
"Anyone who has heard your speech knows that President Arias and Costa Rica stand for freedom and democracy."
"That makes Costa Rica a big country in the world."
"(Applause)"
"You are a man of peace; that is why you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987."
"However, you did not retire after that; 21 years have passed, and now you are advocating peace between people and peace with nature."
"The European Parliament stands alongside you in upholding these principles."
"I would also like to give a warm welcome to the ministers of your government who are accompanying you - the Minister of Foreign Relations, Stagno Ugarte, and the Minister of Foreign Trade, Ruiz GutiÃ©rrez, who are also here in the Chamber, together with many citizens of Costa Rica, who live here in Brussels and in Belgium."
"Be proud of your country!"
"Not in a nationalistic sense, because then countries that have dictatorships and are ruled by violence could also be proud of themselves, but be proud of your country, of Costa Rica, because you champion the right values: democracy, freedom and peace."
"Thank you very much once again."
"Muchas gracias, President Arias!"
"(Applause)"

"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution and would especially like to thank Mr Brok for his efforts to achieve a broad consensus on it."
"I believe that, vital though it is to dialogue with Russia, we must ensure that we do not become totally or predominantly dependent on Russia in terms of energy policy, because that seriously diminishes our potential to hold discussions."
"It should not be forgotten that Georgia's military response relates back to a long history of provocation from the separatist forces, which has recently become very intense, and that Russia used this self-defence measure as grounds for the invasion."
"Nevertheless, we should make it our utmost priority to achieve a peaceful solution to this conflict and I wish all those involved speedy success, so that Crimea, Latvia, Lithuania and Kazakhstan do not also go the way of South Ossetia."
"(LT) European politicians are now breaking a long silence and are describing Russia's actions in Georgia as disproportionate."
"No, this is a case of the rights of Russians in other countries being protected by means of military aggression."
"Some EU countries that blocked the prospects of Georgia and Ukraine for joining NATO have enabled Russia to pursue its aggressive policy of annexing territories."
"Most EU countries are dependent on energy imports from Russia; they are afraid of the gas tap being turned off."
"This allows Russia to start dictating its conditions to the whole of the EU in a truly disproportionate way."
"I voted in favour of the resolution, although I feel that the position of both the Commission and Parliament with regard to future relations with Russia has not been defined clearly enough."
"(SK) I believe that we should terminate the visa liberalisation agreement, withdraw the Russian 'peacemaking' units and replace them with international ones and, thirdly, break off discussions on partnership and cooperation with Russia."
"I also think that Europe should adopt a unified and clear stance on the situation in Georgia and not turn a blind eye to Russia's crude interference with the sovereignty and integrity of a neighbouring state."
"Moscow broke international agreements when, at the beginning of August, its troops crossed the border into Georgia, a border which it had itself recognised in the past."
"Russian troops not only entered the territory of South Ossetia, but advanced further into the country itself."
"I utterly condemn Russia's recognition of the declaration of independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"We must not forget that, while some celebrate independence, Georgia is mourning the innocent people who lost their lives and homes when the Russian troops invaded."
"I am convinced that Europe must bring pressure to bear and, as part of the international community, push for the territorial integrity of Georgia."
"The Slovak Republic adhered to the principle of territorial integrity in the case of Kosovo and still does not recognise its separation from Serbia."
"In the same spirit, I do not recognise the independence of the Georgian regions and South Ossetia."
"Mr President, as one of the authors of the motion for a resolution on the situation in Georgia, I voted in favour of Amendment 1, inviting the International Olympic Committee to seriously consider whether its decision to grant the 2014 Winter Olympic Games to Sochi is still valid in the light of recent events in the near vicinity of the future Olympic venues."
"It would be very irresponsible if the IOC endangered the lives of the Olympic athletes by holding the games in such an unpredictable region."
"I need not remind you that, on 5 September 1972, 11 Olympic athletes were massacred in Munich."
"I was there as a doctor for the Soviet Olympic team, and I remember the impact of those tragic events on the Olympic spirit."
"Such events should never reoccur."
"(DE) Mr President, I have a lot of respect for Mr Schulz, but his statement today was unacceptable."
"Early this morning, President Medvedev described the democratically elected President of Georgia, President Saakashvili, as a 'political corpse'."
"Even from a democratic perspective, that would be outrageous, but when you consider that Mr Medvedev represents a regime that had the predecessor to his predecessor, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, murdered, had the President of Chechnya murdered and has now had an Ingushetian civil rights activist murdered, then it almost amounts to a physical threat."
"This is not about whether or not we like Mr Saakashvili; it is a case of an obligation to support the elected representative of the Georgian people, who have become the victim of an imperialistic act and on whom an attempt at strangulation is being made."
"Therefore, I believe it is vital that, following our resolution, which I welcome, we go a step further and station European peacekeeping troops in Georgia."
"We do not need a mandate from the United Nations or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as Georgia is a sovereign nation and has asked us for a European presence."
"We must also ensure that this country can survive and continue in peace, because having Russian troops as peacekeepers, as the UN and the OSCE have organised, is giving the arsonist the role of fire chief."
"(PL) Mr President, this resolution on Georgia is important, and I voted in favour of it, although I feel that the European Union, which was faced with an important test as a result of events in Georgia, failed to pass that test."
"The main reason it failed, in my view, is because some very important German interests are involved here, particularly the interests of the German left wing and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der."
"Mr Schulz expressed them here today in no uncertain terms."
"The European Union must understand that the Baltic pipeline may be the cause of what effectively amounts to the blackmail of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and also Belarus."
"This pipeline must be got rid of, and the European Union, despite its declarations, must finally take a stance on a unified energy policy that has no place for the Baltic pipeline under any circumstances, even though this goes against certain German interests."
"The Germans must come to terms with the fact that they are either forging a united European Union and their declarations are genuine, or they are acting hypocritically and putting their own interests ahead of those of the EU."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution, but with some heartache."
"The war between Russia and Georgia has highlighted differences in dealing with crises."
"Georgia has various unsolved problems, but Russia is behaving in the long-established tradition of semi-Asiatic dictators, with skulduggery, provocation and warlike brutality."
"This is a danger not only for Ukraine, but also for us."
"Our strengths are human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the freedom we have all fought hard together to achieve - freedom from dependency and bondage."
"These values urgently require that we defend them through a common foreign and security policy."
"Mr President, the British Conservative delegation supported the motion for a resolution on Georgia, which was a balanced one overall."
"However, we have objections to paragraph 19, which calls for a military ESDP mission in Georgia - although we would see nothing controversial in an EU civilian observer presence."
"Similarly, paragraph 30, which claims that the Lisbon Treaty would help the EU's position with regard to managing this crisis, is, in our view, unfounded."
"We support a more robust common external energy security policy under the CFSP with regard to Russian oil and gas imports, but we do not see what difference the Lisbon Treaty would have made to managing this crisis."
"This is not about EU global weakness in foreign affairs, but about Russian bullying and revanchism in the South Caucasus."
"(CS) I abstained, because the answer to the question 'is it true that the Georgians attacked a sleeping city with rocket launchers?' is 'yes'."
"(FR) Mr President, we go along with the question Mr Lehne would like to ask the Commission."
"In fact, we think that the problems of contract law in Europe should respond to two key needs, which go hand in hand."
"The first is the need for clarity and simplicity, the second is for security."
"We are pleased that the rapporteur has taken account of the remarkable work done by the 'SociÃ©tÃ© de legislation comparÃ©e', and we hope this work will be done with reference to our common heritage, Roman law."
"The rules of contractual autonomy, the rules on validity, defects of consent and publicity have been fixed in our civilisation since ancient times."
"It is to those we need to refer; to this common legal heritage of our civilisation."
"We also hope that, for transactions to be secure, the unification of rules on conflict of laws should precede the unification of the substantive rules."
"Contracts entered into between people in different places, and particularly the difficult issue of the tentative offer, or pollicitation, and acceptance, the procedures, timings and proof can all be unified without necessarily having to unify the substantive rules of our different legislations."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago on a small island near Sardinia, without violence and in the interests of environmental conservation, Sardinian separatists declared a new republic with the poetic, Polynesian-sounding name of the 'Republic of Maluventu'."
"I would like to point out that the President has already received the map inspired by the UN map and the sacrosanct principle of the self-determination of peoples."
"Europe has always stood side by side with anyone fighting for freedom by peaceful and democratic means."
"Long live the battle of the Sardinian people for self-determination!"
"(NL) Mr President, I voted against the GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez report in spite of my conviction that men and women are of course equal and must of course receive equal pay for equal work."
"We still forget far too often that gender equality is one of the definite achievements of today's Europe, of the European world, of the Western world, and that this principle is by no means established in some other parts of the world."
"We should never forget this."
"That is only one aspect of this report, however."
"The report is also brimming with a great many other points with which I fundamentally disagree."
"One example is its support for the endless electoral quotas for women, as though women were helpless creatures unable to obtain posts themselves based on their own abilities."
"Another is the constant support for abortion: I ask myself what this is doing in this report."
"It was for all these reasons and many others that I voted against the GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez report."
"Mr President, for some bizarre reason I broke the trend of a lifetime in this Parliament today by not voting against a report by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - I abstained."
"In the past, I have constantly voted against these reports because they are normally full of complete rubbish."
"But, as a married father with two girls, I try to read every word of these reports and guess what they actually mean."
"I have some concerns about the committee this stuff comes from - I do not really think we need a Women's Committee in this place when we have a Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"There are some phrases in this report - the 'feminisation of poverty', for example - which mean absolutely nothing but sound great to the PC brigade that resides out there."
"I do wonder what this committee would feel about, say, those who break the glass ceiling: for example, a mother of five, whose youngest child suffers from Down's syndrome, whose eldest daughter might be five months pregnant - as in the potential Vice-President of the United States, Sarah Palin?"
"I think that committee would not like the fact that she has broken through the glass ceiling."
"But I abstained on this report."
"(PL) Mr President, although I am a supporter of equal rights, I voted against the resolution on equality between women and men."
"This resolution incorporated some crypto-abortionist points and thus violates the principle of subsidiarity in this sphere."
"The fact that Amendment 2 - an amendment that removes these points - was rejected in the vote made it necessary to reject the entire resolution."
"It is a shame that the European Parliament can so frivolously violate the basic principles according to which the European Union functions."
"(CS) Mr President, I voted against the ban on cloning."
"A ban on cloning is an attack on the freedom of scientific research and on the freedom of enterprise."
"Restricting these freedoms will not do the European Union any good, but will lead to a further drain of scientists to the United States of America and other countries around the world where there are no such bans."
"A ban on trade in such products will then lead to further trade disputes within the World Trade Organization."
"We do not want such developments."
"The health and other risks of cloning must be properly assessed in accordance with the applicable processes and procedures and the results must be communicated to the public."
"The European Food Safety Authority carried out a scientific consultation on this subject in the first half of this year and the results of the consultation do not provide any reasons to ban cloning."
"Mr President, I voted against the resolution on banning cloned animals in our food chain, due to the lack of scientific rigour underpinning our approach in Parliament."
"Whether it is a legislative vote, a resolution on a parliamentary question, or an own-initiative report, decisions taken by the European Parliament and plenary votes are seriously devalued if they do not stand up to peer-reviewed scientific scrutiny."
"The credibility and integrity of our work, therefore, is legitimately opened to question."
"Mr President, I voted against the Svensson report, and I am grateful for the opportunity to say why."
"My reasons are as follows."
"First, no consumer knows everything, nor does any legislator. That is why advertising is a vital part of commerce and trade."
"Second, each advertisement (unfortunately or fortunately) must be obtrusive, attractive, striking and eye-catching."
"This is the result of the fact that there are always at least a few producers selling the same product, and each of them wants to sell just its own product."
"Third, Ms Svensson's attempt is attentive to these principles and tries to improve market forces with artificial legislating steps, which will harm and distort natural market forces stemming from the supply and demand relationship."
"That is why I voted against."
"(NL) Mr President, if I had to summarise my reasons for voting against the Svensson report, I could say quite simply that, in my opinion, this report is complete nonsense."
"It is the umpteenth report in which this House - which is after all officially deemed to defend the freedom of European citizens - has called for restriction of freedom and for censorship."
"Indeed, several provisions of the Svensson report, such as paragraph 14 on censorship, are straight out of Fahrenheit 451, a book portraying a world in which books are banned and critical thought suppressed."
"I am very critical of this European Parliament in any case, but it does have to take care not to make itself a hopeless laughing stock and turn into a kind of clone of the Supreme Soviet."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Svensson."
"Her report is one of the most patronising, interventionist, politically correct texts of this whole parliamentary term."
"She really does seem to be convinced that advertising and marketing are a big conspiracy to contribute, right from the first years of a child's socialisation, towards the gender discrimination which reinforces the perpetuation of lifelong inequalities between women and men."
"I am not making this up: the majority of that sentence was taken verbatim from Recital M of the text."
"The report of course advocates more legislation and the establishment of bodies specifically concerned with monitoring compliance with all these new rules."
"I would say 'jobs for the boys', if that phrase were not so terribly 'gender insensitive'."
"Paragraph 14 of the text takes the biscuit, advocating the elimination of what it calls 'messages conveying gender stereotypes' from textbooks, toys, video games, the Internet and advertising."
"Censorship, in other words."
"I do not know whether the term 'textbooks' is also aimed at literature but, if that is the case, we can start straight away by burning works by Shakespeare in the street."
"Mr President, I reverted to type for this report, and voted against."
"I would like to detail some of the reasons why."
"I have a huge amount of respect for the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, who has done a lot of work in this area and is one of the strongest female role models that this Parliament could put forward."
"However, certain points in the report - some of which were voted down - were almost beyond belief."
"There were the calls for the gender thought police in paragraph 9."
"There was the challenge to traditional gender roles in paragraph 13 and, in paragraph 14, something approaching a hatred of new images on the internet."
"Male and female forms have always been used in advertising."
"The male forms tend to look better than mine and the female forms tend to look better, say, than some Members of this House."
"That is advertising for you."
"Even the European Commission - if you look at its website, or any of the publicity it drapes upon its buildings - uses images of men and women who are slightly better-looking than the average."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote in favour of the report because its aim is global harmonisation of the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals."
"This can contribute to safer handling of chemicals, which improves the environment and health."
"However, we would have liked to see the labelling of chemicals in category five."
"These chemicals are often found in the home and are a major cause of poisoning in children."
"The opening at international level of the debate on chemical substances and the part they play in our lives dates back to 1980, first within the International Labour Organization and then within the United Nations, which adopted the GHS (Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals) in December 2002, with a revision in 2005."
"These decisions have had an impact at Community level with the adoption of several documents."
"At this point in time, what we are dealing with is merely the proposal for a regulation on classification and labelling of substances and mixtures whereby the European Union aims to implement the international criteria agreed by the United Nations Economic and Social Council for the classification and labelling of hazardous substances and mixtures, also known as the Globally Harmonised System (GHS)."
"Using this system, the aim is to focus on protecting human health and the environment without hindering the movement of substances and mixtures, setting out classification and information criteria, including requirements for labelling and safety data sheets."
"This relates to upholding safety in the transport of hazardous goods and health and safety prevention for consumers, workers and the environment."
"We therefore voted in favour of these reports."
"in writing. -(RO) Chemicals are produced and marketed globally and their risk is the same all over the world."
"Substances considered dangerous in one country may have a different regime in another country."
"There should be no different description of the same product in various countries."
"In addition to the need for information, the main goal of GHS (Globally Harmonised System) is consumer protection."
"The new legislation in the field of classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures shall offer increased protection to human health and the environment."
"I believe compromises have been reached, which contain good solutions for consumer health."
"The professional users of chemicals and worldwide consumers can benefit from global harmonisation."
"Following the enforcement of this report, the protection of people using these dangerous substances shall increase and enterprises shall be more efficient, reducing the number of accidents."
"The use of these dangerous substances shall be safer and shall provide users with correct, complete and accurate information, ensuring better consumer protection."
"in writing. - The Sartori reports deal with important matters of relevance to all our citizens."
"Chemicals are manufactured and traded on a global basis and their hazards remain the same wherever they are used; accordingly it is appropriate that the classification and labelling of hazardous substances be suitably harmonised."
"The package agreed today represents a sensible compromise reached between the political groups and the institutions and I was therefore able to support it."
"The report legalises the production of hydrogen powered vehicles."
"This is one of the rare documents that takes a deliberate approach to the problem of alternative fuel for vehicles."
"It is particularly praiseworthy in so far as this is an entirely innovative technology that is totally harmless to the environment, as the combustion gases are water."
"I have no doubt that the document is inspired by the manufacturer of the vehicle used by Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, but I deliberately voted in favour of it."
"The June Movement is evaluating fuel cells that use hydrogen as an energy carrier based on renewable energy such as solar, wind and wave power as a system for transport because it is a clean fuel, i.e. there is no particle pollution and at the same time the fuel can be produced using renewable energy."
"However, overall, hydrogen powered vehicles have a very low energy efficiency of 20% from source to wheel."
"This is far outperformed by electric vehicles running on computer-controlled lithium batteries, which have an energy efficiency level of 80-90%. At the same time, millions of batteries could solve the storage problem for renewable energy."
"Therefore, we would like to work towards the Commission taking steps towards promoting this alternative."
"in writing. - This report allows for the bridging of the internal market gap for hydrogen vehicles, having in mind the imperatives of consumer protection."
"It is urgent to include hydrogen vehicles in the EU type approval framework, thus fostering the research and development of this environmentally friendly technology throughout the whole of the internal market."
"Moreover, technical specifications have been established to ensure the reliability and safety of hydrogen components and systems, as well as the clear identification of hydrogen powered vehicles through labelling, which would be important should an emergency arise."
"in writing. - I voted in favour on the Weisgerber report."
"The potential of hydrogen as a clean form of power has long been recognised, and technologies in this area are constantly being improved."
"Nevertheless, hydrogen power can only be truly effective as a clean and green energy if the hydrogen comes from sustainable and, ideally, renewable sources, and this fact has been noted in the final report."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of Mrs Weisgerber's report on type-approval of hydrogen powered vehicles."
"Fostering environmentally friendly alternative fuels in the EU is an important step that absolutely must be supported in these times."
"Hydrogen powered vehicles lend themselves to this purpose but they must guarantee a high level of safety and environmental protection."
"To ensure that this is so, unified conditions for type-approval in the European Union are urgently needed."
"Without EU-wide regulations on the classification of hydrogen powered vehicles there is a risk that the one-off permits issued by the Member States will distort competition and that enterprises will find that investing in hydrogen vehicles no longer pays off."
"A unified type-approval system offers citizens the protection of an EU-wide directive and promotes an increase in the number of environmentally safe vehicles, which is very important."
"in writing. - I welcome Anja Weisgerber's report on type-approval of hydrogen-powered motor vehicles."
"The report is a positive step in helping to stimulate the industry to intensify research and development efforts."
"Encouraging the entrance of hydrogen-powered vehicles into the internal market will contribute considerably to achieving Europe's climate change targets."
"I voted in favour of the report's recommendations."
"in writing. - (DE) There is no doubt that hydrogen power is a technology with future potential, but it has by no means reached maturity."
"Not only are acquisition costs still too high to be financed, but the manufacture and storage of hydrogen is expensive."
"Furthermore, even if the cars themselves do not produce any harmful emissions, it is still not clear how the hydrogen is to be produced in a way that uses as little energy as possible and does not generate CO2."
"In conclusion, we also do not yet know whether battery- or fuel-cell-powered vehicles will become the norm, but it is important in any case that we support alternative technologies in order to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels."
"Accordingly, I voted in favour of the Weisgerber report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as this legislation will pave the way for full-scale production of these cars and provide European drivers with real alternatives in the near future."
"This new law will help boost the development of these vehicles while ensuring they are reliable and safe, and measures included in this report will ensure that the maximum environmental benefits from hydrogen-powered vehicles can be achieved."
"in writing. - (RO) Building car engines based on hydrogen represents a guarantee for the development of ecological means of transport in the future and the protection of public health."
"In order to obtain environmental benefits related to the use of vehicles based on hydrogen, the latter should be produced sustainably, improving noise and air quality in advance."
"This regulation will make sure that hydrogen-based systems are as safe as the conventional propulsion technologies, contributing to the stimulation of industry for building such type of vehicles."
"It is necessary to create an adequate framework in order to accelerate the placing on the market of vehicles with innovating propulsion technologies, so that the transportation industry would contribute significantly to a cleaner and safer future."
"Taking into consideration the global problems caused by climate change and the lack of energy sources, the hydrogen vehicles should be promoted at international level, especially in the countries under development, as well as in the USA, in order to guarantee a better environmental protection against global warming."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of this proposal for regulation, which represents a first step toward a cleaner Europe."
"in writing. - Given the current and future problems affecting motor vehicle engines run on petroleum, it is clear that developments of alternatives are vital."
"The approval of specifics relating to this are a solid step forward."
"The relationship between aggregate consumption of oil through motor car use and that of increasing respiratory diseases, as well as concomitant rises in pollution, means that 'next-generation' vehicle design has to reflect this."
"Clearly, the aspect of hydrogen generation through the use of electricity raises wider considerations, including how to locate the energy for the generation of the original electricity."
"However, this report helps to move the debate and the industry behind the car of the future and in the right direction."
"Hydrogen is universally acknowledged as the environmentally 'cleanest' and most acceptable fuel, as its combustion in air or oxygen produces only water."
"Despite the significant problems associated with storing hydrogen and putting it into a fuel tank, the ceaseless work being carried out by research centres all over the world indicates that this is the fuel of the future."
"As a fuel, hydrogen will provide us with an environmentally safe renewable energy source."
"The introduction of EU type-approval criteria for hydrogen powered vehicles is essential to the proper functioning of a single market and to ensuring a high level of safety and protection of the natural environment."
"I am voting in favour of this resolution in the hope that it will bring a swift and peaceful end to this tragic crisis."
"I think that two aspects need to be confirmed: on the one hand, the principle of the inviolability of the territorial integrity of the various states is unassailable, and on the other, the need should be underlined for absolute respect for the rights of the minorities concerned."
"Evidently, following the events in Kosovo, the voice of the international community is undoubtedly weaker and far less credible, but diplomatic efforts must be stepped up to bring about a credible and concrete solution."
"However, while the world's governments are busy, we need to act urgently to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis linked with the presence of an increasing number of refugees."
"The European Union must set up a task force to relieve the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people who are in need."
"I am in touch with the international liaison at UNICEF, who has confirmed the severity of the situation."
"I hope that the European Commission will play its part, as it has done in other situations."
"The MEPs of the New Democracy (ND) party have decided to abstain from the final vote on the resolution on the situation in Georgia."
"This decision was taken because the final draft resolution, which was put to the vote, was worded in such a way that the sense of equilibrium present in the previous draft resolutions was removed."
"in writing. - I will be voting in favour of this joint resolution because it is important that the Union send a strong message to Russia's leadership."
"Nevertheless, it fails to adequately criticise and apportion blame to the Georgian leadership's role in triggering the crisis."
"As far as I am concerned, under the current leadership, Georgia is definitely not on track to join NATO in the foreseeable future."
"My second point is that this crisis reinforces and strengthens the requirement for a European common foreign and security policy."
"The sooner this element of the Lisbon Treaty is implemented, the better."
"in writing. - (SV) The situation in Georgia and the position taken regarding it are foreign policy issues."
"The opinion of the June List is that neither the European Parliament nor any other EU institution should issue a statement on such matters because foreign policy is to be pursued at national level, not by the European Union."
"Hardly surprisingly, the European Parliament is making the most of the opportunity to issue propaganda in favour of a stronger common foreign and security policy and, even worse, the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Here today we can already see that different Member States have different opinions on the question of Georgia."
"Thus it is not desirable for the EU to speak with a single voice because that voice will have to speak counter to the opinions of many Member States."
"The numerous references to NATO are also very problematic as there are countries which are members of the EU but not members of NATO."
"The situation in Georgia is very serious, especially in view of all the civilian victims of the conflict."
"However, the EU should not pursue a foreign policy and therefore we have voted no to this resolution."
"The resolution approved by the majority in Parliament, which we voted against, is part and parcel of the anti-Russian campaign of those using this course of action to try to cover up their own deep responsibility for the worsening international situation and to provide a pretext for dangerous new steps in the escalating confrontation."
"Among other aspects, the resolution hides the fact that at the root of the current international situation and the situation in the Caucasus is the new arms race and the militarisation of international relations championed by the USA and NATO (with its offensive strategic concept and its enlargement to Russia's borders), the stationing of new US bases and missiles in Europe and the growing militarisation of this continent, the aggression against and dismembering of Yugoslavia and the recognition of the independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo outside international law, the attacks on and occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq, that is to say, imperialism (and inter-capitalist contradictions)."
"Some of those who are now calling for international law, territorial integrity, sovereignty and the independence of States to be respected are the very same people who championed and supported the aggression against Yugoslavia or Iraq."
"What hypocrisy!"
"The road to peace and safeguarding the future of humanity lies in respecting the principles laid down in Article 7(1), (2) and (3) of the Portuguese Constitution."
"in writing. - I am satisfied that my own group's amendment was successful."
"We have asked that the Russian and Georgian authorities provide information as to the location of cluster bombs dropped during hostilities, so as to hasten de-mining activities."
"Parliament has condemned the use of force and believes that conflicts in the Caucasus cannot be solved by violence; the speedy clear-up of mines will prevent future casualties of civilians."
"I voted in favour of Amendments 2 and 5, as in my opinion Russia is making a claim to restore the territorial boundaries of the former Soviet Union by employing various means."
"By its actions in Georgia, Russia has once again demonstrated its readiness to invade and occupy the territory of a sovereign state under the pretence of defending the rights of its citizens."
"To my mind, in its resolution the EU must clearly show the gratuitousness of Russia's expansionist plans, especially regarding the Baltic countries."
"In voting against clause 2 of paragraph 27 I would like to say that the EU cannot and has no right to decide whether Georgia is still in the process of joining NATO."
"We are only able to state the fact that on 3 March 2008 NATO confirmed the possibility of Georgia joining this organisation; however, it is up to the sovereign state of Georgia to make the decision."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the resolution on the situation in Georgia."
"I did so not because this is an ideal resolution; there is no doubt in my mind that our resolution could be better."
"I wavered on whether to support the draft resolution."
"My doubts were stirred up by Mr Schulz just before the vote."
"He expressed his regret that the resolution failed to criticise the Georgian President."
"This remarkable statement convinced me that the resolution could have been a lot worse and could have been wrecked by the pro-Russian lobby in the European Parliament."
"In what he said, Mr Schulz underestimated Parliament's unity over the crisis in the Caucasus."
"It is now clear that it would have been better if the European Parliament had held an extraordinary session earlier on the subject of Georgia."
"It is a shame that we did not present our position during a Council sitting."
"It is a shame that we did not put forward our prescriptions and our views before the leaders of the Member States got together."
"in writing. - Mr President, by taking an unequivocal position against Russia and engaging Europe in the resolution of the conflict, the European Council and a majority in Parliament are launching a process as dangerous as the one which plunged the continent into the First World War."
"This process is the result of the ill-prepared enlargements to the East, which bring us closer to the conflict zones of the Balkans and the Caucasus."
"What then will the consequences of Turkey's membership be, which borders Iraq and Iran?"
"Furthermore, by recognising the independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo, our governments have opened a Pandora's box, challenging the territorial integrity not only of Georgia, but of most of the European countries, both East and West."
"If, as the Socialists, Liberals, PPE and Verts would like, Georgia became a member of NATO and joined a European Union governed by the Treaty of Lisbon, our nations would enter into conflict with Russia."
"The Europe of Brussels signifies war."
"More than ever, faced with a more powerful China and the Islamist threat, it is time to build another Europe, the Europe of sovereign states, united with Russia through the bonds of civilisation constituted by our Greek and Christian heritage."
"in writing. - I welcome the swift action taken by the French presidency in working towards a solution to the conflict between Georgia and Russia."
"While criticism could be aimed at Tbilisi's military engagement in South Ossetia, the retaliatory action taken by Moscow is both disproportionate and a clear violation of Georgia's territorial integrity."
"I would call on the European Parliament to send a clear message to the Russian executive that its actions are unacceptable."
"I therefore voted in favour of the resolution."
"There is every reason to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Georgia and also to condemn military intervention in the region not in dispute and the use of cluster bombs by Russia."
"The aspects of this resolution I reject are its taking sides with Georgia and its attempt to punish and isolate Russia and surround it by NATO for recognising the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"A great many of today's European countries were created by in effect breaking away from another country, issuing a unilateral declaration of independence and ultimately gaining recognition from other countries."
"Most European countries came into being after 1830, particularly in waves after 1918 and 1991."
"Kosovo has been the most recent example."
"There is absolutely no reason to declare Kosovo's genesis exceptional, or to pretend this will be the last time a new country is created."
"It is never the last time."
"As long as there are regions where the majority of inhabitants consider the ruling government useless or even threatening, perceiving it as foreign domination, new countries will continue to form."
"Let us acknowledge that the inhabitants of Abkhazia and South Ossetia do not wish to be subordinate to Georgia."
"in writing. - (DE) Russia is important to the EU not only as a supplier of energy but also as a counterbalance to America's drive for world domination."
"For these reasons, but also to avoid jeopardising its credibility, it is important for the EU to play a neutral role as a mediator between Georgia and Russia."
"There are very large Russian populations in many states of the former Soviet Union, such as Ukraine."
"That makes it easy to understand why the Kremlin feels it has a particular responsibility to these Russian people groups."
"The EU could help to negotiate a solution that would be acceptable to all parties and, for example, speak up for generous ethnic minority rights for Russians in the post-Soviet era, which would fit in with the European Union's oft-quoted human rights goals."
"With this in mind, then, I favour the position worked out at the special summit and am against the 'vassals' attitude towards the United States in this report, which is why I voted against it."
"The joint resolution upholds EU policy, which is exploiting the crisis in the Caucasus."
"This is an attempt to step up the EU's intervention and presence in this key region."
"Masquerading as a peacemaker, it is proposing a series of measures to facilitate its consolidation and intervention in the Caucasus."
"The resolution is provocative because it does not condemn the brutal attack by the Euro-NATO government of Georgia and the murder of thousands of civilians."
"On the contrary, it offers every possible support to Georgia's policy and its accession to NATO."
"The condemnation of the breakaway move by South Ossetia and Abkhazia is laughable hypocrisy, to say the least, in the light of the dismemberment of Yugoslavia and the recent EU decision on Kosovo."
"Amid the web of conflict and rivalry between the EU, the United States and Russia, the European Parliament's resolution is almost identical to the US policy because it takes a one-sided stance against Russia in order to gain a better negotiating position for a share of Eurasia's markets and wealth-generating resources."
"The aggravation of the conflict and rivalry by the imperialists and Russia's attempt to enhance its position in the imperialist pyramid create new dangers for the peoples of the Caucasus and the wider area."
"The people's answer can and must be to join in the anti-imperialist struggle."
"I have voted, as did all the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left as one, against the resolution on the situation in the Caucasus, because it views the crisis through the distorting lens of pro-Bush policy and expediency."
"The worst and most provocative aspect of the resolution is the fact that it avoids the slightest criticism of the opportunistic course of action taken by Georgian Prime Minister Saakashvili, who sparked off the crisis so as not to displease his American protectors."
"The position taken by the majority in the European Parliament directly opposes that held by the same political forces six months ago on the Kosovo issue."
"Stability in the Caucasus region cannot be achieved through a policy of playing second fiddle to the United States, which turns a blind eye to the true state of affairs and itself pursues a policy of double standards."
"in writing. - I have voted in favour of Amendment 2 because I consider it inadmissible that borders could be changed under the pretext of 'care' for the minorities in neighbouring countries."
"I also voted for mentioning that Georgia was promised NATO membership at the Bucharest Summit and that she is on right track for the following reasons:"
"a."
"It is true: Georgia was assured that she would become a NATO member and that is officially inscribed in the Final CommuniquÃ© of the Bucharest NATO summit,"
"b. At least one important European leader has said - in the context of the recent war with Russia - that Georgia's vocation for NATO would be fulfilled,"
"c. The EU is bound to guarantee Georgia's security, independence and territorial integrity by virtue of the Partnership Agreement concluded by the EU with Georgia within the European Neighbourhood Policy and since it cannot do it - because it is not structured for that - it means that the only institution which can do so is NATO, of which the majority of the EU countries are also members."
"in writing. - (FR) Though not perfect, the resolution adopted by the European Parliament deserves to be supported in that it confirms the unity demonstrated by Europe on the resolution of the situation in Georgia."
"This complex crisis proves how urgent it is for the EU to develop a proper regional strategy towards the Caucasus and Russia."
"Consequently, the EU would be well advised to put forward the idea of holding an international conference like the Helsinki Conference, which gave birth to the OSCE in 1975."
"For the time being, it is necessary to stop the justified report concerning the negotiations on strengthening the partnership between the EU and Russia from failing to mention the need to construct a balanced dialogue with the country encompassing all issues of common interest, including democratic values and the energy dimension."
"In this regard, it is a pity that the European Parliament is not making a clearer call for a review of our energy strategy which, in addition to the announced diversification of our sources of supply, should also provide for the development of renewable energies and of energy saving."
"I abstained from voting on the European Parliament resolution on the events in South Ossetia and Abkhazia since the Parliament took a one-sided, unbalanced position towards Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from a normalised, democratised Serbia."
"Parliament did not consider it appropriate to take a similar resolution on Kosovo in the name of the same principles of respect for international law and integrity of national borders that it is invoking today to denounce recognition of the independence of Ossetia and Abkhazia by Moscow."
"We all know why: we did not want to criticise the countries of the West - which were quick to recognise the unilateral and illegal declaration of independence by Kosovo - for the things for which we are today quite rightly criticising Russia."
"Although the Georgian government's military initiatives, like those of Russia, should be firmly condemned and should make way for a diplomatic settlement and international mediation, the European Union cannot allow itself to apply double standards to the many 'frozen conflicts' of the aftermath of the Cold War."
"Nothing would be worse for the security of our continent than for the European Union to confuse alliances and allegiance to the 'crime-inducing' politics of the Bush government in this part of the world, as it has in other parts."
"in writing. - While the resolution expresses many views that I can support - in particular, the approach to the final status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and the call for Russian troops to be withdrawn from Georgia proper - it also contains many unhelpful elements."
"The EU could play a useful role in providing civil observers and monitors and in humanitarian assistance."
"However, it should not seek to exploit the Georgia crisis for its own ends by calling for a strengthening of EU defence and security policy, by putting monitors under an ESDP rubric, or by endorsing the rejected Treaty of Lisbon."
"Furthermore, it was disappointing that the phrase 'Georgia is still on track eventually to join the (NATO) Alliance' was removed in the vote."
"I therefore abstained on this resolution."
"in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this resolution, which shows strong and clear unity between EU Member States in the Council and the European Parliament on this vital issue."
"We mourn the tragic loss of life in this conflict and condemn the violent actions of both sides."
"We support moves towards supporting a lasting peace, the provision of humanitarian aid to victims and reconstruction efforts."
"We voted to abstain on the second part of Paragraph 27, as we are clear that this is a resolution aimed at resolving the situation in Georgia."
"To discuss the future membership of an external organisation such as NATO would only distract from this important focus."
"We wholeheartedly support the resolution's call to ensure a lasting resolution to the conflict on the basis of the EU-brokered six-point agreement, and we call on Russia to act decisively to meet the agreed conditions of this ceasefire plan, thus allowing for the resumption of negotiations on the EU-Russia Partnership Agreement."
"in writing. - (CS) I abstained from voting on the European Parliament's resolution on the situation in Georgia, not because I would be casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Georgian stance but, on the contrary, because I would have been approving the improper and aggressive steps taken by Russia."
"As has often been the case recently, some Eurofederalist Members have once more misused the conflict in Georgia and the associated resolution to call for the early ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"It was this improper behaviour that caused me to abstain."
"in writing. - The Extraordinary European Council of September 1 demonstrated and affirmed the unity of the EU, which represents progress compared to 2003, when the situation in Iraq created questions regarding EU unity."
"Europe must continue to express its solidarity and determination concerning Russian compliance with international laws and standards."
"The resolution that we voted for today emphasises that the partnership between Europe and Russia must be based on mutual respect for the fundamental rules of European cooperation."
"Russia continues to violate certain conditions of the cease-fire agreements, behaviour that must be met with unified political and economic pressure to encourage Russia to completely withdraw all troops from Georgian territory and reduce their military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"It is critical that immediate action is taken to ensure the continued delivery of assistance to displaced victims of this conflict."
"These troubling events perpetrated by Russia should be met with unified European resolve."
"In order to protect against future challenges of this nature, Europe must find alternative energy sources and strengthen the European Security and Defence Policy as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution from the Legal Affairs committee."
"The Common Frame of Reference will be an important legal development, and we as yet do not know what form it will take."
"It is vital that this Parliament and stakeholders in all countries and legal systems are fully informed of all future developments."
"in writing. - Despite the complex title this report concerns a complaint in 2001 of maladministration by the Commission in relation to the German Government's failure to properly implement the Working Time Directive."
"The case was referred to the European Parliament by way of a special report from the European Ombudsman."
"Referring a special report to the European Parliament is the last substantive step the Ombudsman may take in seeking a satisfactory response on behalf of a citizen."
"My report, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, endorses the Ombudsman's conclusion that the failure of the Commission to deal with the petitioner's complaint for almost eight years constitutes an instance of maladministration."
"The report does not address the content of the Working Time Directive itself and therefore an amendment which sought to raise the content of the Directive was opposed as irrelevant to this report."
"The report on the Commission's refusal to examine a German doctor's complaint regarding violation of labour legislation on working hours by the German State highlights the EU's class-ridden nature."
"The Commission reacts with lightning speed when the interests of capital are at stake; it forces Member States to comply with Community law, but when workers complain of violation of their rights, the Commission disregards their complaints."
"The Commission's provocative position is a natural consequence of the EU's anti-popular policy, which promotes a return to mediaeval employment conditions for the working class in order to safeguard the profitability of the European monopolies."
"In this context, the Council of Employment Ministers last July adopted an amendment to the EU Working Time Directive."
"This anti-labour travesty divides the concept of working time into active and inactive time - the latter is not considered to be paid working time - and gives employers the right to employ their workers for up to 13 hours a day, 65 hours a week, while paying them nothing whatsoever in overtime."
"The rights of the working class and employees are not secured by complaining to the Commission, but by rallying and intensifying the class struggle against capital and the EU to overturn this policy."
"in writing. - (SV) The June List considers that working hours should be regulated at national level."
"This report should therefore not be dealt with in the European Parliament, even if it formally addresses the Commission's treatment of a case of infringement."
"The principle of subsidiarity, which is praised on every conceivable ceremonial occasion, is fundamental here."
"When the majority of the European Parliament gets into the details, it is exactly the opposite; nothing can in fact be left to the Member States."
"The Working Time Directive is in itself a clear infringement of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Countries have different business structures."
"Some have heavy processing industries, others have light industry, others again have a great deal of tourism and seasonal industries, and the public sector is structured in different ways."
"It is therefore entirely inappropriate to attempt to regulate the working hours of the whole of the EU, nor is there any reason to do so."
"Those who argue in favour of this say that we will otherwise have problems with social dumping in the EU."
"This is an extremely severe accusation against the countries which we have accepted as members of the EU, which all fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and which are all states governed by law with a free right to unionise."
"This report is yet another attempt by the EU to interfere in the working hours issue which is the responsibility of the Member States."
"We have voted no, with reference to the principle of subsidiarity."
"in writing. - I was able to support the De Rossa report and hope that the Commission fully takes on board the Ombudsman's recommendations in relation to the rule of law and the principle of good administration."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues are fully supportive of the principle of equality of opportunity between women and men."
"We agree with some aspects of this report such as: the need to make greater progress on dealing with the pay gap between women and men; the promotion of entrepreneurship among women; the importance of policies at national level that seeks to promote an improving work-life balance."
"As our Shadow Minister for Women has said: ""A Conservative approach to gender equality will be based upon a belief in equality of opportunity and equitable legal, commercial, social and political treatment""."
"However, we are concerned by certain aspects of the report such as: the call for new legal bases in EU law and the request for a decision on the ""full communitarisation of policies""."
"Also, we cannot support the creation of a costly ""European Institute for Gender Equality"" as set out in the report; such matters must be for individual Member States to pursue."
"For these reasons, we have decided to abstain on this report."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution based on the report by my Spanish fellow Member Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez on equality between men and women."
"More than ever we need to attend to the double dimension of the subject: on the one hand, ensuring equality in all policy areas (gender mainstreaming) and, on the other hand, introducing targeted measures to curb discrimination against women, including awareness-raising campaigns, the exchange of best practice, dialogue with citizens and public-private partnership initiatives."
"All subjects are important: unequal pay, participation in decision-making, particularly public decisions, the reconciliation of private and professional life, and violence against women."
"Gender equality is an important cause, for which much has already been done, but it must receive the full attention of the humanist political forces for progress and must be debated everywhere, including in intercultural dialogue."
"in writing. - (FR) There are sometimes fortunate, perhaps even amusing, coincidences."
"Indeed, we are taking the opportunity given to us by this annual report on equality between men and women, coming at the same time as the French Presidency of the European Union, to highlight a marginal but entertaining point which is at worst a lack of tact and at best a perfect application of the principle of equality between women and men, which means not discriminating between them."
"A few days ago, on the occasion of the start of Mr Sarkozy's Presidency, which received such a lot of media attention, MEPs were given gifts."
"In the free document wallet, notably there was a tie."
"Of the 785 MEPs, nearly a third are women."
"Were they not entitled to a small personalised gift too, or are we supposed to conclude from this that women also have to wear ties?"
"It still seems to be the case that, when big debates are taking place on the role and position of women in political life, boorish behaviour very often still gets the better of courteousness."
"We cannot vote in favour of the Report on Equality between women and men - 2008, because it is trying to persuade women that settling for flexible labour relations and the reduction and commercialisation of whatever social benefits remain for the working-class family is a necessary evil, so that women will adapt to the EU policy of reconciliation of family obligations and professional engagements."
"The valid findings on the pay gap between men and women are not being addressed, let alone eliminated; instead, there are mere exhortations or the instituting of an International Equal Pay Day."
"The measures proposed to combat gender stereotypes and for equal representation in decision-making, elimination of every kind of gender-based violence, etc. are a move in the right direction but will remain wishful thinking as long as the root cause responsible for these conditions and maintaining them remains, namely the capitalist system, which generates and aggravates discrimination and inequality."
"True equality requires a struggle for a change in the balance of power."
"Such a policy favours the workers and abolition of the EU strategy."
"There should also be a fight against the profiteering of capital and the unaccountability of employers."
"No measure will be effective unless the popular movement in each country is strengthened and targets are set for substantial change, right up to the level where power is exercised."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez on 'Equality between women and men - 2008' as I consider that reducing the disparities between women and men is fundamental to establishing a fairer society as well as being a determining factor for the European Union's economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness."
"I should like to reiterate the rapporteur's proposal, which seeks to strengthen European gender equality legislation."
"Despite the actions that have been carried out in this area, there has not been significant progress at European level, in particular with regard to the pay gap between women and men, the participation of women in decision making, combating violence against women, access to education and lifelong learning or even in reconciling professional, family and personal life."
"However, I regret that Amendment 1 has been approved, thereby removing the important reference to the need for the Commission and the Council to create a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women."
"This report underlines important aspects concerning the types of discrimination that persist in society, focusing especially on the area of work, pay, poverty, pensions and reforms."
"It also broaches the issues of violence against and trafficking of women, the issues of education and training, lack of social facilities and access to services for the care of children and dependants and promoting women's sexual and reproductive health."
"However, there are still some contradictions, as is the case with the actions proposed in the field of employment, where a proposal we put forward was rejected despite another having been approved that safeguards important aspects for women."
"I am referring to the following proposal that is now part of the EP's final resolution: '...calls upon the Member States to take effective action designed to enforce the rules on welfare and employment and to make jobs which respect the rights of employees available in the various activity sectors, thereby ensuring that workers (in particular women) earn decent wages and are entitled to health and safety at work, to social protection and to trade-union freedom, as a contribution to eliminating discrimination between men and women at work'."
"Hence our vote in favour, although we regret that other positive proposals were rejected."
"in writing. - (SV) The June List strongly distances itself from all forms of discrimination."
"The EU is a union of values, and the Member States must treat all groups in society in a fair and equal manner."
"However, the report contains a proposal from which we strongly distance ourselves, namely that the European Parliament is to call on the Commission and Council to take a decision on the full communitarisation of policies on immigration and asylum."
"These issues must be taken care of by the respective Member State."
"In general the report contains many views as to how equality is to be achieved."
"The measures proposed include labour market policy measures, information campaigns, dialogue with citizens, quotas, closing the pay gap, measures to combat the segregation of work in the education sector, and improvements to maternity facilities for self-employed women."
"The report also welcomes the establishment of the European Institute for Gender Equality and calls on the Community institutions and the Member States to introduce an International Equal Pay Day."
"Equality between men and women must be a goal for all Member States."
"The political measures used to achieve these goals must, however, be determined at national level."
"The international coordination which is desirable should take place at global level, preferably within the UN."
"We have therefore chosen to vote no to this report."
"in writing. - In general, I am very supportive of most of what is in this report."
"However, I have a problem with Paragraph 9."
"I believe that the text of Paragraph 9 should be qualified by stating the need to respect national legislative processes when considering the issue of abortion."
"Ireland has a protocol to the Treaty of Maastricht on this issue and furthermore the area of abortion is not an EU competence."
"It is up to each Member State to make its own legislation in this area and Parliament must therefore respect the principle of subsidiarity."
"Unfortunately, the text is not clear on this matter."
"in writing. - The GarcÃ­a Perez report deals with many important issues relating to gender equality, social justice and fundamental rights."
"One issue which is of increasing concern across Europe is that of human trafficking, which involves victims from both within and outside the EU."
"Combating serious organised crime of this nature requires a cross-border and multi-agency approach, and it is clear that the EU has a key role to play in this area."
"in writing. - While progress has been made on the issue of gender equality in Europe, we are far from full parity."
"The report highlights various areas that require the Commission's attention, such as job quality and the need for better instruments to tackle violence against women."
"I would also support the call for Member States to urgently ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings."
"I voted in support of Iratxe GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez's report 'Equality between women and men - 2008'."
"in writing. - I welcome the report on Equality between women and men - 2008, and support much of its contents."
"However, I abstained in the final vote because amendment 2 was rejected."
"In my view, the wording of that amendment was better than the original paragraph."
"in writing. - I voted for this report which aims to tackle gender inequality."
"It is clear that women do not have the same opportunities as men to progress in their career."
"Working mothers will never be able to balance family and professional life without stronger parental rights for both men and women."
"This is why I fully support the calls for increasing the duration of parental leave, and in particular increasing the incentives for fathers to take parental leave, and flexible working conditions."
"It is only with these kinds of rights that we will be able to tackle gender inequality."
"Women will never gain true equality until men take their fair share of responsibility for childcare and running the home, just as my fantastic husband does."
"He cooks, he shops, but he's not so good at making the bed!"
"in writing. - (RO) As a Shadow-Rapporteur from the PSE group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I voted for this report because I consider it very important as regards the proposals for ensuring equal treatment of women and men with regard to the labour market."
"In this context, I would like to emphasize the importance of item 42 in the report, which requests the Commission and the Member States to establish a set of feasible, comparable and available quality and quantity indicators, as well as gender statistics, to be used for monitoring the enforcement of Lisbon Strategy for economic growth and employment."
"Taking into account that one of the decisive factors for increasing employment is the reconciliation of professional and family life, I would like to also mention item 34, which requests the Commission to unify and disperse best practices regarding the balance between the professional and private life."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament must think that its Members are suffering from Alzheimer's disease!"
"Every year, at about the same time, two different reports appear: one on human rights in the EU and the other on equality between men and women."
"Though the content of the first can vary slightly from one year to the next, quite clearly the same is not true of the second."
"To believe this, all you need to do is read the previous ones: the Kauppi report in 2007 or the Estrela report in 2006 on equality between men and women."
"They list the same challenges to be met, report the existence of the same inequalities and make the same recommendations."
"Do we conclude that there has been no change?"
"No, because progress has been made with employment and with the participation of women in decision-making at local, national and European level."
"It is just that we Eurocrats, spurred on by the women's lobbies - and I am thinking particularly of the powerful European Women's Lobby - are not satisfied with the progress; they want and are advocating even greater equality, even greater similarity between women and men, to the point of absurdity."
"Do we have to go along with this forced equality obtained through compulsory, discriminatory and minority-focused quotas?"
"I do not believe so."
"The battle of the sexes does not have to take place."
"in writing. - (SV) Mrs GarcÃ­a PÃ©rez's report on equality between women and men - 2008 was essentially good."
"It included a great deal which is important, not least the opportunity for women (and men!) to combine work with family life and the importance of generous parental allowances."
"I would have been able to live with a certain amount of hot air and repetition. What was more difficult was paragraph 4, which seeks to create a clear legal basis at EU level for combating 'all forms of violence against women'."
"There is nothing wrong with this ambition and, had it concerned human trafficking, which crosses borders, there would not have been any problem."
"However, here the aim is 'the full communitarisation of policies' in an area which is primarily a national matter, and that is more worrying."
"The reason why I finally abstained, however, was the second sentence of paragraph 6, which encourages the use of quotas."
"This is something which I would rather not see at national level, and absolutely not introduced as a diktat from Brussels."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues are fully supportive of the principle of equality of opportunity between women and men."
"We support the fundamental principle as outlined in paragraph 1 of the report: 'Emphasises the importance of giving women and men the same opportunities to develop as individuals regardless of gender'."
"However, we believe that this report is overly-prescriptive and heavy-handed in its approach and conclusions."
"We do not believe the EU should have greater powers in this area."
"Such matters are for individual Member States to decide upon."
"We reject the approach as outlined in Recital I which states: 'whereas gender stereotyping in advertising thus echoes the unequal distribution of gender power'."
"Such statements do not advance a healthy debate on equality."
"Likewise, we cannot support the thinking behind, inter alia, recitals F and G. The calls for 'zero tolerance' mentioned in the report are too vague and could lead to bad legislation if followed through."
"For these reasons, we have decided to vote against this report."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Svensson's report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men, as I agree with the need to develop a 'Code of Conduct' for advertising that is applicable in all Member States and that guarantees respect for the principle of equality between men and women and combats the use of gender stereotypes."
"I believe that advertising and marketing communications are dangerous vehicles of gender stereotyping and give rise to restrictions on freedom, both for women and men, in their various dimensions and roles throughout their lives, having a negative impact on their role in society."
"This report by Swedish MEP, Mrs Svensson, of our Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, has enabled us to take a broadly positive stance on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men."
"As the rapporteur mentions, the very purpose of advertising is to influence each and every one of us - women and men alike."
"Indeed, the choices we make throughout our lives are influenced by a whole range of factors, including the social class to which we belong, our gender, the images and concepts of gender and gender roles that are ever present around us through education, the media and advertising."
"For this reason, it is important to continue to combat the gender stereotypes that persist in our societies, despite various Community programmes to promote gender equality."
"As mentioned in the report, the school system has a fundamental role to play in developing children's critical faculties with regard to images and the media in general, in order to prevent the disastrous effects of the recurrence of gender stereotypes in marketing and advertising."
"Yet positive actions to promote best practice in advertising are also needed, examples of which are put forward in the EP resolution that has now been approved."
"in writing. - (RO) I decided that abstention is the position that expresses in the best way the heterogeneous content of the report."
"More clearly, we are discussing a real problem which has been answered, in my opinion, under inadequate terms."
"It is not enough to state that ""gender stereotypes must be eliminatedâ."
"I do not believe that it is a question of ""providing rewards to mass-media and publicity experts for compliance with gender equalityâ, as certain articles in the report advise (art. 9, 27), but we should rather draft precise Community regulations and programmes that would make such rewards useless."
"Since the various forms of publicity marking the daily life are realities with deep and immediate social-cultural impact, this activity needs a unified and coherent legislative framework."
"For this reason, a descriptive set of references to such a current and important matter (as the Britt-Svensson report) has not managed to plead with convincing arguments and determine a favourable vote and has not answered in a clear and applied manner to the solutions considered."
"in writing. - I believe that advertising is a powerful tool shaping identity, values, beliefs and attitudes and has an undeniable impact on public behaviour."
"On the other hand, uncontrollable advertising can have adverse affects on the self-esteem of women - in the case of sexual services advertisements in newspapers - and particularly teenagers and those susceptible to eating disorders."
"We must ensure the protection of our children from damaging influences and, in this regard, the role of schools and education must not be underestimated."
"I also support the proposal that the Commission and the Member States should develop a 'Code of Conduct' for advertising based on the principle of equality between men and women."
"in writing. - (FI) I voted against Mrs Svensson's report in line with the view of our group."
"This I did because, although the report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men contained a lot of good ideas that I wholeheartedly support, including teaching children to use their critical faculties when it comes to the media and teaching people to question sex stereotypes, I thought it went too far in general."
"The proposals to establish a Code of Conduct at EU level and a monitoring body to which people can complain about sex stereotyping in advertising and marketing represent just the sort of patronising policy that engenders hostility towards the EU."
"Marketing and advertising are an important part of communications, and if manufacturers' products are to compete on the market, advertising must obviously use means that catch people's attention."
"I think that establishing rules for marketing and advertising is something that should be done at national level, however, and criticism of the media and healthy questioning of sex stereotypes begins with education and upbringing."
"in writing. - (FR) I am delighted by the adoption of this report, which highlights the role played by marketing and advertising in the emergence and perpetuation of gender stereotypes and proposes a number of avenues for combating these."
"The development of awareness actions seems to me, for example, to be a worthwhile measure, particularly with regard to children, who constitute a particularly vulnerable group."
"Exposure from a very young age to gender stereotyping in the media makes a major contribution to the perpetuation of lifelong inequalities between women and men, hence the importance of developing children's critical faculties with regard to images and the media in general."
"I also agree with the notion that marketing and advertising have a major responsibility for the increase in the number of people suffering from eating disorders and should consequently be more careful about the choice of female role models."
"However, it is a pity that the proposal aimed at explicitly integrating the fight against gender stereotypes into existing or future codes of practice, giving those working in the sectors concerned responsibility for ensuring the commitments are adhered to, was not upheld by a majority."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting in favour of Mrs Svensson's report on advertising, which continues to be discriminatory."
"Despite the measures that have been taken against it, gender stereotyping remains a major issue in society."
"Advertisements, in particular, tend to perpetuate tired old stereotypes of men and women."
"Children and young people, especially, identify with characters in advertisements and absorb the clichÃ©s they present."
"This should be prevented, so that the younger generation can deal more practically with the issue of gender equality."
"In my opinion, specific training programmes on gender equality would be a good place to start and, above all, something must be done about the ubiquitous stereotyping in textbooks."
"In summary, it can be said that advertising confronts all citizens in their daily life and it must therefore present good role models."
"The report paves the way towards achieving the goal that has been set."
"in writing. - (FR) In Parliament we have the bad habit of producing own-initiative reports on trivial matters, and on matters that should really be dealt with by subsidiarity."
"In other words, the EU should avoid meddling in matters that come under the sovereignty of the Member States and that are better settled at national level."
"In the state it was voted for by a majority of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the report is unacceptable."
"I should point out that of course we are concerned about the gender stereotypes conveyed by some advertising."
"Of course we are against the advertising of sexual services, which reinforce stereotypes of women as objects."
"Of course we want to protect children against adverts that incite violence and sexism, among other things."
"Of course we are aware of the importance of codes of ethics and codes of conduct, but it is not up to the Commission to impose these on the Member States."
"Advertising should respect the values dear to us, but it must be able to exist and to play its role in a market economy without being accused of all evils, which is the tenor of this report."
"in writing. - (SV) The motion for a resolution contains many different ideas and wishes."
"However, we would like to emphasise that the European Parliament cannot solve any problems in this area, nor is legislation at EU level the right way to go."
"Finally, we think that it is through opinion-forming and debate in the Member States that we can succeed in eradicating advertising for sexual services from the daily newspapers."
"Threats of boycotts by consumers can force newspapers to refuse such ads and force hotels to become porn-free."
"However, this necessitates opinion being built up from below. Not through measures at EU level."
"After a certain amount of heart-searching, we have voted in favour of the report in its entirety. However, we would like to emphasise that we have done so because we consider that many of the values and demands it contains are essential, but our opinions differ regarding the means to achieve them."
"in writing. - I welcome Eva-Britt Svensson's report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men."
"The global character of modern advertising demands a concerted European effort to encourage advertisers to move away from gender stereotyping."
"Self-regulatory practices in the UK are already quite rigorous, and I would hope that other Member States would be open to embracing similar measures."
"I therefore voted in support of the report."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted this report because it renders very well the moment of the intervention required to reduce the negative influence of marketing and publicity on equality between men and women, namely: the first years of a child's socialisation."
"The formation of stereotypes and prejudices at an early age decisively contributes to gender discrimination, with a direct effect on accentuating inequalities between women and men throughout their entire life."
"The information explosion can hardly be prevented among children."
"A study recently conducted at the beginning of this year, in Romania, shows that the biggest consumers of advertising are children of 6 years old."
"I welcome the idea of establishing a specific department for matters related to gender equality within the national mass-media monitoring bodies of Member States, but it is extremely necessary that they have a double role: regular and systematic monitoring of gender images in the mass-media, as well as the coercive monitoring of their information media."
"In the absence of coerciveness, our initiatives shall prove useless."
"I voted in favour of a good report on a crucial issue: advertising and marketing, which have a great deal of power in terms of having a decisive influence on sexist stereotypes."
"All of the European institutions should establish mechanisms to ensure that these instruments are used in a positive way to promote the equal treatment of men and women and to convey an image of women that is in line with reality."
"It is worth making special mention of the commitment made by all the public authorities to eradicate violence against women and on the role that advertising and marketing should play in this process."
"It should be recognised that many professionals are working towards this, but this report highlights the fact that there is still a great deal to be done; we therefore need to establish mechanisms that ensure that these conditions are complied with and that the resources are available to provide an effective response to complaints."
"The new European Institute for Gender Equality should have the resources to closely monitor images and language and to eradicate violent images and those that subtly allude to women as objects that can be controlled and owned, and that are therefore susceptible to attack."
"in writing. - (SV) Mrs Svensson's report created quite a major headache before the vote."
"In its original format, the report was full of sweeping generalisations and - in my view - exaggerations."
"It veered wildly between media and advertising, codes of behaviour and proposed legislation, self-regulation and new agencies."
"The report which remained after all the voting, however, was completely different."
"The worst exaggerations had gone, leaving a quite reasonably expressed problem, that advertising sometimes, but not always, involves caricatures and gender stereotypes."
"I do not think it is the slightest bit problematic to express concern over the impression children and young girls are given, especially from images of extremely thin women."
"The report was not entirely free of socialist undertones, but the problem is a real one, not an ideological one."
"Therefore in the end I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting against this own-initiative report, because it interferes too much with freedom of opinion and smacks of imperious censorship."
"All matters of legitimacy and ethics in relation to advertising are already regulated at national level."
"The EU has no place trying to control the diversity of freedom of opinion and freedom in advertising."
"Fortunately, this is only an own-initiative report."
"in writing. - (SK) I voted for the adoption of this resolution."
"It is the result of cooperation within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and also the result of compromises to give the report wider support."
"The objective of this report was to use the law to govern all aspects of life, even though it has certain centralised features."
"On the other hand, however, I am sure that, if Members of the European Parliament are able to intervene to promote and support the common good, then we have a moral duty to do so."
"We are obliged to ask for a ban on sexist images, which degrade women's dignity."
"Asking for the young to be guided and directed in relation to the media is also a part of this strategy."
"The report also refers to the protection of children, on whom advertising with violent and sexual undertones has a serious impact and creates unrealistic illusions."
"In all events, we need to be vigilant."
"No European directive can change the nature of men and women."
"Before we can demand the elimination of gender stereotypes, we need to have sociologists and psychologists undertake a thorough analysis as to how this will affect future generations."
"Analyses by independent experts often go unpublished, since they contradict political views."
"The laws of nature cannot be changed by a parliamentary resolution."
"On the contrary, if Parliament wishes to gain respect, it should take more account of the laws of nature."
"The report on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men is nowhere near being a good one, but opens up several problems, which Parliament would prefer to avoid."
"in writing. - (CS) I voted against the report and against the majority of the tabled amendments which are intended, in a planned and unified way, using six comprehensive priority areas, to achieve equality between women and men in advertising and deal with the way in which advertising supports and reinforces certain types of discriminatory stereotype, which have a negative effect on equality between women and men."
"I voted against because this report is a serious threat to and, what is more, a dangerous interference in an area in which pronounced individual and different cultures prevail in the various Member States."
"What is considered embarrassing or unacceptable in one country may be seen as funny or amusing in another."
"Indeed, an attempt to impose Europe-wide regulation of the presentation of the two genders in advertising would create some kind of homogenised sterile stereotype."
"This report makes comprehensive proposals for actions going far beyond the competence of the EU."
"Member States have self-regulating bodies like the Advertising Council, through which the national advertising industries gradually create and adjust acceptable models for advertising activities."
"Advertising, in view of its specific national characteristics, is a suitable area for self-regulation, far more sensitively reflecting national cultural traditions, customs and models."
"These should never be replaced by unified and homogenised outside regulation which might fundamentally damage advertising as a quite legitimate and essential sector of national economies."
"This resolution follows an important debate on the cloning of animals for food supply and its possible implications for genetic diversity within livestock populations, food safety, animal health and welfare and the environment."
"It is clear that there are still many doubts at this juncture and a dearth of studies with clear and precise conclusions on its implications, thereby posing a serious threat to the image of agricultural production in the countries of the European Union."
"That is why the European Parliament, following a proposal by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, decided to call on the European Commission to submit proposals prohibiting the cloning of animals for food supply purposes, the farming of cloned animals or their offspring, the placing on the market of meat or dairy products derived from cloned animals or their offspring and the importing of cloned animals or their offspring, and meat or dairy products derived from cloned animals or their offspring."
"The proposal appears sound to us at this stage and takes the precautionary principle into account, and we therefore voted in favour."
"in writing. - (RO) My vote ""in favourâ is based on the following doctrinaire and practical grounds."
"First of all, any type of cloning, either human or animal, infringes the Christian principle and doctrine upon which the doctrine of the European People's Party is based."
"From the ethical point of view, there are still controversial matters to be debated and entirely clarified."
"As regards the practical aspects, we cannot exactly quantify the effects of cloning yet."
"Moreover, there is also the issue of the incapacity to control access to and follow-up these products of animal origin once they enter the commercial system."
"For this reason, I believe that the best decision, at this moment, is to ban animal cloning for food supply."
"in writing. - Given the scientific uncertainty and ethical questions involved, I fully support calls for the Commission to bring forward proposals seeking to prohibit the cloning of animals for food supplies."
"in writing. - The cloning of animals for food supply, I feel, carries with it various risks both to human health and animal welfare."
"I am not convinced that embracing this type of technology for consumption purposes is beneficial to European citizens."
"I therefore voted in favour of calling for a ban on the cloning of animals for food supply."
"in writing. - I welcome the debate on animal cloning."
"I abstained in the final vote on the resolution on cloning of animals for food supply because I have some concerns about an outright ban as proposed in this resolution."
"To date concerns have been raised about the animal welfare implications of cloning and they need to be addressed."
"Food safety issues do not appear to arise."
"However, what we need is more accurate and scientific information and advice before taking a decision to ban."
"That is why I await with interest the Commission's proposals in this area, taking into account the recommendations of EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) and EGE (European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technology)."
"in writing. - (DE) Only 12 years ago, a new technology, which is apparently associated with high death rates and considerable suffering, stunned the world with the cloning of Dolly the sheep."
"The commercial sector is already rubbing its hands, dreaming of 'healthy' cloned pork enriched with Omega 3 fatty acids."
"They claim that this cruelty to animals also benefits the pigs, which are supposedly healthier thanks to cloning."
"Of course, the breeders benefit too, because their financial losses are reduced."
"The whole thing is disturbingly like the many and varied temptations to genetic technology, by which multitudes of farmers have been brought to ruin, because the seed was not re-useable and they could not afford any more."
"It is also reminiscent of the sudden, unnatural death of entire herds after the animals had eaten genetically modified feedstuffs."
"The long-term consequences of radioactive radiation and genetic technology have not yet been ascertained in sufficient detail, and it is impossible to estimate the effects of cloning, let alone cross-breeds."
"What would happen if a cloned animal is fed genetic feedstuff? What effects would that have on humans?"
"Frankenstein is lurking at the door!"
"That is why I am voting 'no' this time."
"in writing. - Cloning animals for food is a topical issue at the moment."
"Broadly speaking, I am not against cloning in terms of scientific research and animal breeding development."
"However, in terms of animal welfare and food safety, I am totally opposed to cloned animals entering the food chain."
"Research and past experience have proven that cloned animals are more prone to disease and have a reduced life expectancy."
"Although I do not wish to stand in the way of science, it is clear that we are not yet fully aware of the all the consequences and implications of cloning, both in terms of animal welfare and human consumption."
"It is for this reason that clear criteria and controls should be implemented to ensure that cloned animals are prevented from entering the food chain."
"While I realise that this is a sensitive topic, I believe that we should err on the side of caution."
"Product quality, animal welfare and environmental concerns should remain our priority in terms of food production."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting in favour of the resolution tabled by Mr Parish on the cloning of animals for food supply."
"I agree with the reasons for the proposal and the concerns it raises."
"It is true that in the past, the more 'revolutionary' innovations have been regarded with suspicion and have generated benefits only in the medium and long term; it is also true that the aim of this resolution could fall into this category."
"Nevertheless, we need to take into serious consideration the dangers arising from animal cloning for food supply: food safety, the welfare of cloned animals and the genetic and zootechnical diversity of these animals."
"These aspects are clearly interrelated."
"I therefore applaud this initiative and remain confident that measures will be adopted to protect both human health, by maintaining the high quality of the food that we eat, as well as animal welfare."
"in writing. - (SK) I voted for this resolution."
"Consumers in EU Member States must be protected against the negative effects on their health which may potentially be caused by products cloned for food purposes."
"It is the principle of foresight which must be applied appropriately."
"Parliament emphasises the many advantages of high-quality agriculture which I support."
"Despite this, I am surprised by a sad fact: Parliament voted against the cloning of animals, but supports human cloning for research purposes involving experiments on human embryonic stem cells."
"The Seventh Framework Programme for Research is already financing such projects for the cloning of human beings."
"We are destroying human life simply for research purposes."
"These experiments are also financed from taxpayers' money, even in States where the legislation considers cloning to be a crime."
"It seems that European legislators are more concerned about the cloning of animals for food supply than protecting man against scientific research."

"Composition of Parliament : see Minutes"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Evaluation of EU sanctions as part of the EU's actions and policies in the area of human rights (debate)"
"The next item is the report by HÃ©lÃ¨ne Flautre, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the evaluation of EU sanctions as part of the EU's actions and policies in the area of human rights ."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Mr Lavrov accused Mr Kouchner of having a 'sick imagination' when he talked about sanctions against Russia."
"It was on this 'imagination' that I was asked to work during this report."
"I would like to thank the Commission and the Council, which proved perfectly available and helpful."
"What is today's debate on sanctions in fact about?"
"It is essentially about two things: the first is a critique of the use of sanctions to punish dirty rotten scoundrels on the international scene, namely anyone who tries to block my strategic interests: politicised sanctions with double standards."
"The second critique considers the fact that sanctions are not effective, essentially because they have perverse effects, people always get round them, and they should therefore not be used."
"The purpose of this report is not to call for more sanctions, or for harsher sanctions, or for sanctions to be abandoned."
"It is essential for us to find out what conditions make sanctions effective and the aim of this report is actually to examine them from all angles."
"Effective in relation to what?"
"In relation to what we are trying to achieve."
"As regards violations of human rights or international or humanitarian law, what we must aim for is a change in the behaviour of those being targeted."
"That is the key point."
"Sanctions are neither a punishment nor the application of a kind of European criminal code for international use."
"Sanctions are, politically, a tricky tool to handle and are very demanding to implement, and they seek to achieve a change in practices and behaviour."
"Very reluctant to go for all-out sanctions, the EU is currently maintaining 31 sanctions regimes against third countries or entities, mostly arms embargoes and targeted sanctions designed to have maximum impact on the entities whose behaviour they intend to influence, while limiting as far as possible any harmful humanitarian effects."
"On the face of it, this is something positive but I cannot tell you any more at this stage."
"The EU continues to act without ever having carried out any overall impact assessments."
"We therefore remain rather powerless to evaluate the ability of our sanctions to solve crises and promote human rights."
"The aim of this report is therefore to speak up for a more transparent, more consistent and therefore more credible European sanctions policy."
"The first essential job is to undertake an evaluation exercise."
"The second is to adopt a stringent method, through prior studies of specific situations where sanctions are required to decide the best response to bring about a change."
"Over the last few days, you have been through the measures at the EU's disposal to influence the Russian authorities, for example."
"The positive conclusion we can draw is that the stated objective is clear and can be evaluated practically."
"That is, compliance with the six points of the agreement."
"It has to be this way in all circumstances."
"It is essential to include clear benchmarks, which should, until the end - and that sometimes means for a long time - remain necessary and sufficient conditions to be met for the sanctions to be lifted."
"These benchmarks therefore need to be realistic and objectively measurable."
"Although the arms embargo imposed on China after Tiananmen is perfectly legitimate, we should not be surprised if it is not having any positive effects since the European Union did not make the lifting of the embargo dependent on any particular demands."
"All too often, the sanctions policy is vague and flexible, swayed by the political contingencies of the most influential Member States or the commercial or geopolitical importance of the targeted entity."
"That is why, to give the EU's policy credibility, I am proposing the creation of a network of independent experts responsible for helping the Commission with the difficult job it does, under incredible circumstances since it has almost no resources to do this."
"I am not talking about taking away the Council's prerogatives of political impetus or the Commission's right of proposal; I am simply talking about offering the guarantee of an informed decision."
"However, that is not all."
"Sanctions are an instrument."
"They are one instrument of many - I am referring back to the first two reports by the Subcommittee on Human Rights - a comprehensive and integrated policy needs to be developed; there can be no effective sanctions without a human rights strategy for the country in question."
"Sanctions must be discussed at all levels and the monitoring mechanisms, for example the 'human rights' clause, must be used to the full."
"All sanctions against a country must be accompanied by visible, and therefore political, but also concrete support for human rights defenders in the country."
"That is also one of the report's key points."
"To finish, this report also considers that any voluntary and irreversible damage to the environment generates human rights violations and it therefore asks for its inclusion among the reasons for applying sanctions."
"It recalls that EU sanctions are not just against third countries but also against physical and legal entities such as mercenaries or indeed multinationals, which defy international law by operating almost with impunity."
"In short, this report tries to respond to the current nature of world crises."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Flautre, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to express our gratitude for the job done by the parliamentary committees, and in particular by Mrs Flautre as chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"It is an important job, primarily because the relationship between the use of restrictive measures and human rights is a prominent issue, which attracted the attention of the various players on the international scene again recently - as you mentioned, Mrs Flautre."
"I feel it is worth mentioning that, within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, one of the aims of restrictive measures remains the foundation of democracy and the rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Yet it is right to question, as we are doing and as you have done in your report, the possible impact of such measures on the fundamental rights of those individuals who are subject to them."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has drafted a concept paper on restrictive measures, entitled 'Basic principles on the use of restrictive measures', which mentions the attention paid to, I quote 'full respect of human rights and the rule of law [...] in full conformity with our obligations under international law'."
"Obviously this commitment remains at the heart of our priorities."
"It should not be forgotten that the use of restrictive measures is not limited to human rights policy."
"It is one of many tools available to the foreign and security policy and there are other objectives, apart from defence and human rights, which concern peacekeeping, strengthening international security, protecting fundamental interests and reinforcing the security of the EU, or simply promoting international cooperation."
"Sanctions should therefore - as you pointed out - be part of an integrated, comprehensive approach to a country, which in parallel should include political dialogue, incentives, conditionality and other foreign policy instruments and, from that point of view, I am delighted that the report converges with the Council's idea that all its instruments, including restrictive measures, should be deployed flexibly."
"You will understand that it is not easy to make a comparative analysis by looking at the different sanctions regimes and using the human rights situation in each country as the only benchmark. It is important not to take a regime of restrictive measures out of context, or when implementing these measures, to believe that everything will fall into place automatically."
"When applying restrictive measures as part of the fight against terrorism, the measures are primarily aimed at preventing acts of terrorism, particularly anything that could contribute to the financing of these acts."
"The lists are well known; they are published, as are the measures they lead to."
"One of the conditions for the continuation of this system rests on two pillars: the first is that these measures need to be credible, which means that great care must be taken with updating these lists so that they reflect reality."
"The second is respect for the rule of law, and consequently for a number of fundamental principles: the transparency of procedures, the possibility of taking legal action and the right to defence."
"In this debate, - I am sorry to go on, but this is particularly topical - we naturally have to take note of the Court of Justice judgment given this morning which, from 3 December, cancels the effects of a Community regulation freezing funds in application of a Security Council resolution, against two plaintiffs because they could not find out why they had been included on terrorist lists."
"What we find is that the Court is not preventing the Council from taking new measures to freeze funds provided that those concerned can access information about why they have been targeted by these measures, either at the time the measure is taken or as soon as possible after the decision has been made."
"We also note that the Court of Justice judgment specifies that the primacy of United Nations Security Council resolutions is not challenged and that it is therefore on this basis that the regulations will be modified before 3 December, having first informed Parliament."
"The report by Mrs Flautre deals more specifically with the mechanism for evaluating sanctions, asking the Council for an evaluation or an impact assessment of the EU's sanctions policy."
"I want to point out that the Council is prepared to do this, and particularly to ensure that experiences are exchanged and national best practices for the application of restrictive measures are developed."
"Experience acquired in the design and implementation of measures in different contexts continually feeds into each political debate we have in the Council, and the Council also conducts in-depth discussions on the pertinence, nature and anticipated effectiveness of sanctions, relying on reports by European Union heads of mission and on observations sent in by the Member States."
"On the nature of sanctions, we are therefore pleased that our views converge with those of the report and particularly that the preference is for targeted sanctions over generalised sanctions."
"We have noted that the report invites the Council and Commission to take a varied approach - which could be summed up as a carrot and stick approach - which indeed we believe is the approach that should be taken."
"We also agree with the report's analysis of the importance of international cooperation, which is what underpins credibility."
"We give particular priority to action taken within a United Nations framework."
"In the Council, we ensure that, based on United Nations resolutions and measures decided in the Security Council, there is alignment with the countries closest to the European Union."
"We also ensure that the issue of sanctions is raised in political dialogue meetings and the consultations on human rights which we hold with a number of target countries."
"Finally, in this draft report, the European Parliament expresses the wish to be involved in all the stages of the process leading to the design, implementation and review of restrictive measures."
"The Council is fully aware of this and is delighted by the keen interest shown by the European Parliament in EU sanctions policy."
"That is why the Council is particularly keen to ensure Parliament is kept regularly informed of events affecting this domain."
"To finish, I would like to applaud the European Parliament's commitment in this area and encourage it to make the most of the parliamentary contacts it has with third countries to improve understanding of the European Union's sanctions regime and explore the possibilities of coordinated action to promote human rights."
"It is for these reasons that I am so pleased with the report Mrs Flautre has just presented to us."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-office of the Council, Mrs Flautre, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission was interested to read the report on the application of sanctions and on the evaluation of sanctions in the area of human rights."
"Sanctions are one of the European Union's most effective instruments for promoting respect for human rights in third countries, and they have been applied for this purpose notably in Belarus, China, Myanmar, Uzbekistan, the former Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe, to mention only a few of the more important examples."
"The Commission is pleased that this debate is being held on the implementation and evaluation of this important instrument for the common foreign and security policy."
"As the President said - while fully aware that the policy has a number of objectives - any decision to apply sanctions under the CFSP must be taken after evaluating and weighing up a number of objective interests."
"That is why an evaluation of the consistency of the sanctions policy must be conducted, not only to look at third countries' human rights records but also to take account of the other objectives and criteria of the CFSP."
"The systematic, unilateral and, you could say automatic application of sanctions against any country whose politicians do not fully respect human rights does not seem desirable."
"The European Union has to take account of the impact on relations with countries that are the target of sanctions, since sanctions are economic as much as political."
"Nevertheless, we need not only to take account of the impact on our diplomatic relations but also to evaluate the impact on the international activities of our economic operators."
"Generally speaking, sanctions must be targeted and affect only the leaders of the countries concerned, sparing populations already suffering as a result of failure to respect human rights."
"Furthermore, when sanctions are agreed, we also need to decide the benchmarks that will be used to lift them - the 'exit strategy' - while retaining a small amount of flexibility for cases where the third countries concerned fulfil most of the benchmarks but not all."
"I am also keen to point out that the purpose of sanctions is not to replace judicial proceedings against those responsible for human rights violations."
"These crimes fall within the competence of the courts, including the International Criminal Court."
"However, sanctions do aim to achieve policy changes within a third country, for example to promote respect for human rights in the legal system of the country concerned."
"They therefore pursue an objective of change and may be lifted when the policies of the country concerned change."
"For example, the European Union applied sanctions on the former Yugoslavia in support of the International Criminal Court."
"We believe it is important to promote respect for human rights in third countries and we keep a constant watch on what is applied in third countries."
"In each case, it would be necessary to identify from among all the possible instruments, those that will naturally be most effective."
"An in-depth analysis of the application of sanctions to promote policies that respect human rights consequently seems to us a worthwhile policy and I would therefore like to thank you, Mrs Flautre, for having taken the initiative."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on this report, I would like to state that the European Union should use this remarkable tool of external policy with wisdom and prudence."
"No matter what the circumstances or the type of sanctions applied, there is always the potential of negative side effects that could generate regrettable situations."
"I strongly believe that sanctions should apply only when diplomatic persuasion has failed, and, in order to be efficient, the EU must always have a comprehensive assessment of the situation, a coherent strategy and an accurate evaluation of the results."
"To uphold credibility and avoid the accusation of double standards, the EU has to be able to justify the adoption or non-adoption of sanctions based primarily on human rights grounds and arguments of effectiveness."
"I think it is crucial that, by imposing sanctions, the European Union reveals its strengths and not its weaknesses."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of my group on the Flautre report to confirm here what has already been voiced by the committee: on the whole we welcome the text, particularly after a few modifications and, dare I say it, improvements resulting from our amendments, which were accepted by Mrs Flautre."
"We would like to thank her for being so open-minded."
"This report adds interesting new elements and brings a new approach to the subject (i.e. the environment as sufficient grounds for adopting restrictive measures)."
"My group wanted to underline the importance of establishing clear conditions, achievable objectives and adequate reference parameters when the sanctions are applied."
"To make them more effective, I have also tried to emphasise that these should be as targeted as possible - Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said so herself a minute ago."
"These sanctions do not involve civilians, for example, they do not entail indiscriminate measures that would result in the isolation of the population."
"One paragraph of the report states that UN sanctions are preferable to European Union sanctions."
"On this point, clarification is probably needed to show that this priority does not prevent the European Union from adopting its own sanctions for particular situations where these measures would be more direct and easier to apply in terms of time, specificity and geographical proximity, according to the principle of subsidiarity."
"With the cross-party compromise amendment, it is now established that in the fight against terrorism, the secret services, custodians of the infamous blacklists that we discussed here in Parliament a short while ago, must be able to act with the necessary discretion for the system to function properly."
"Furthermore, they are called secret services precisely because they must be able to operate in secret - although not with impunity, and not in violation of international laws."
"Evidently, the European Union must carry out a political assessment of the sanctions. The actions that we take must have a significant impact, without which the procedures for sanctions must themselves be reviewed."
"However, the report proposes that networks of independent experts should be set up to assess these sanctions, as Mrs Flautre described in her speech."
"Our group would prefer the Council to take the proper decisions itself, since it is more competent and has more authority than external experts when it comes to a system which is not controlled by governments."
"It is in this spirit that we are proposing to vote against the new amendment that is to be tabled tomorrow in the Chamber by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"While on the whole we welcome the work carried out, my group, Madam President, will be voting in favour of the Flautre report."
"We offer the rapporteur our congratulations."
"Mr President, first I should like to thank Mrs Flautre and congratulate her on her excellent work."
"However, I must at the same time express my disappointment and that of our group that the report was significantly altered during the voting on amendments in the relevant committee."
"Sanctions are a further means at our disposal for protecting human rights around the world."
"The crucial thing, however, is that these sanctions themselves should not constitute a violation of human rights: in trying to resolve an injustice, we should not respond with an even greater injustice."
"We must also give attention to better-targeted economic measures that respect humanitarian international law."
"For this reason, I attach great importance to the provision made in the report for a mechanism allowing judicial review during the enforcement of sanctions, and also the rapporteur's idea of creating a network of experts who will make proposals to the Council regarding the most appropriate restrictive measures."
"Former practices, such as embargoes on medicines and other essentials, affect the population indiscriminately, especially children."
"They can only be condemned as unacceptable."
"Similarly, the decisions of the competent judicial institutions must be enforced."
"The Council and the Commission must ultimately review the procedure for inclusion on the EU terrorism blacklist, so that the fundamental rights of blacklisted individuals or organisations are respected and the EU's credibility as a champion of human rights around the world is protected."
"It is particularly important that we guarantee the effectiveness of sanctions and arrive at a shared understanding of this issue within the Union, and also that we secure cooperation with other international organisations such as the African Union and ASEAN, which are often closer to the problem areas."
"However, in addition to adopting and enforcing sanctions, there must be specific provisions concerning the lifting of sanctions."
"There is a need for ongoing monitoring and set terms, so that the aim of the sanctions can be better understood and can be ended when the aim is achieved."
"Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of sanctions and gives our policy credibility."
"Lastly, I should like to point out that I originally felt there should be no reference to specific countries."
"However, since the choice has been made to mention some countries in the text, I think it is essential that we should not forget Palestine."
"Here there is a telling inconsistency in European policy."
"It supports the spread of democracy in the world, but has chosen to impose EU sanctions against the Palestinian Government, which came into being through demonstrably free and democratic elections."
"Sanctions are not a means of changing the world, but they can be an important tool for compelling countries that violate international law and human rights to change their policy."
"It is sufficient that sanctions are targeted, justified and subject to constant review and assessment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done."
"I believe that the proposal to identify more homogenous criteria for the sanctions policy comes at the right time."
"I would particularly like to emphasise a specific element contained in paragraph 6 of the report concerning environmental crime and damage, where it is proposed that this type of voluntary act should also be subject to sanctions."
"I believe that this proposal should be given serious consideration."
"For the rest, evidently the limitation of the sanctions policy is often its inconsistency, but it is especially linked with the limitations of the EU common foreign and security policy: the stronger and more coherent that policy is, and the more it can be said to exist, the stronger and more coherent a set of sanctions will be."
"Our problem, in the European Union, is that we are often too timid."
"It is sometimes so difficult to find the necessary cross-party consensus between Member States to lift sanctions that we find ourselves unable and powerless to act."
"Allow me to take this opportunity, before the French Presidency, of reminding everyone how in a regime such as Myanmar, it is clear that to exclude energy from the list of sanctions would make those sanctions much less effective."
"There is also the question of human rights and democracy, which should be made a priority of international policy and therefore also a priority of sanction policies."
"This is not the case, because of the issue raised in paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Flautre report, namely the cooperation agreements containing clauses and rules that impose respect for human rights."
"These are binding clauses for the European Union, and yet these clauses are systematically ignored."
"Therefore, before we come to sanctions, we must first identify the mechanisms to enforce these clauses."
"We are in talks again with Vietnam and other Asian countries."
"We must identify mechanisms - even gradual mechanisms - to avoid sanctions - I have almost finished, Mr President - but we can only do this if we respect the legality of the clauses and written agreements that the EU has signed."
"Mr President, it is no accident that the term 'sanctions' stands undefined in international law."
"This is an instrument of pressure that is difficult to capture precisely."
"Consequently the rapporteur's ambitious proposals to harmonise the principles of use of sanctions are even harder to achieve."
"They could also be counter-productive."
"Sanctions are an indispensable instrument of EU foreign policy."
"In view of the EU's broad competences in trade and border control, they are of considerable importance for implementing objectives in the spheres of both security and the defence of human rights."
"This is why sanctions are part of our foreign policy instrument palette, and this is why we do not shirk from applying them in a fairly free and, at times, inappropriate way."
"Instead of subjecting sanctions to some kind of rigid set of rules, we should, in the name of the efficacy of our impact on world politics, leave their application to sagacious political evaluation."
"With this general reservation, our political group supports the report."
"Mr President, the double standards and the lack of specific evaluation and monitoring tools that tend to characterise the European Union's foreign policy in terms of sanctions are now one of the most serious threats to European credibility."
"On numerous occasions these sanctions or restrictive measures, as they are also called, are based more on particular likes and dislikes than on a clear, coherent and convincing strategy, the objective of which should be not only to ensure the security of the European Union, as established in the objectives of the CFSP, but also to improve the situation of human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and good governance in the world, as laid down in Article 11 of the Treaty on European Union."
"This requires that evaluations and studies of the impact of the sanctions system be undertaken immediately in order to equip us with a policy that is both legitimate and effective in terms of sanction systems."
"This, in short, is the objective of the Flautre report."
"The basis of the report, as it emerged from the work of the Human Rights Subcommittee, is reasonably good, and it has some elements that I believe are essential."
"For example, it insists on the fact that the Council, by adopting the above-mentioned Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures, has committed itself to doing so as part of a comprehensive approach, which should have room for tools such as human rights and democracy clauses, the system of generalised preferences and development aid."
"It also reiterates the request that the Council of the European Union should immediately adopt a common position on controlling arms exports that will make the current Code of Conduct in this area legally binding, as we have repeatedly approved in this House in the past."
"However, some aspects that I consider to be key were left out of the report and I hope that they can be incorporated in the debate and the vote in plenary tomorrow."
"Firstly, with regard to the blacklists, in the context of the fight against terrorism they need to be reviewed so that human rights and fundamental legal guarantees are respected for those that are on them."
"Secondly, as has also already been said, I am in favour of the Commission setting up a network of independent experts responsible for proposing the most appropriate restrictive measures to the Council based on the situation, producing regular reports on the development of the situation on the basis of the criteria and objectives established, and, if appropriate, proposing improvements in the application of sanctions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Flautre on her excellent work."
"However, this was misrepresented, at least in part, by the Committee on Foreign Affairs during the vote, which caused the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to abstain, while only the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe approved the substantially amended text, precisely because the adoption of a series of amendments tabled by them altered its political balance."
"I also recall that my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, voted against this in committee."
"As a group, we recognise that the 13 amendments tabled, even if adopted, cannot alter the political tone of the report. Therefore, although we will be voting in favour of the majority of the amendments, our final vote remains critical."
"In our opinion, the problem is that international relations must be founded on dialogue and mutual respect, even if there is a difference of opinion."
"Sanctions such as these must be the last resort available to Member States and international organisations, yet the report hails them as the principal instrument of EU foreign policy."
"We also believe that priority should be given to so-called positive incentive measures."
"A country must be rewarded if it undertakes to promote and respect human rights by signing specific economic, trade and financial agreements."
"Instead, however, the report places the emphasis on negative measures, which strangely enough are always against the usual suspects, such as Cuba."
"These examples show how flawed the sanctions policy is."
"In short, we need more cooperation and less unilateral punishment."
"Not even the European Union has a monopoly on rights, as demonstrated by the insufferable way in which we treat migrants and Roma."
"Perhaps we should sanction ourselves!"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, the rapporteur considers it important that the European sanctions policy be assessed in the first instance, and be reassessed in the second instance (see paragraph 11)."
"European action in the form of sanctions can indeed have positive value if it brings a real improvement in the human rights situation in the relevant partner country."
"Therefore, thorough assessment is indeed important in order to examine the effectiveness of the sanctions policy."
"The Council and the Commission must enter into a serious debate on the use of the sanctions policy, however."
"After all, as Mrs Flautre has already rightly noted, it is difficult to impose effective sanctions in the absence of a clear framework."
"I ask myself whether unanimous sanctions are even possible in view of the various Member States of the Union - the case of Cuba, and also of Zimbabwe, spring to mind here."
"In view of the possibility, also advocated by Mrs Flautre, of reassessing the sanctions policy, it is doubtful whether the sanctions policy is indeed such an appropriate instrument."
"In short, in order to improve the security and human rights situation in the Union's partner countries, it is important that we give some thought to the correct instrument."
"For example, could serious violations of freedom of religion in China and India prompt the European Union to take genuine formal action?"
"Currently, rethinking European action in this kind of case is more appropriate than hasty reassessment of the sanctions policy."
"Apart from that, I hope to support the Flautre report provided that a number of amendments are not adopted."
"(NL) Mr President, allow me to start with some words of criticism."
"I think that it is rather cynical to make repeated reference, in a report on human rights, to the need to apply a number of provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As we all know, the Treaty was rejected in a democratic referendum in Ireland, and the reason it was rejected only in Ireland is that no other country has granted citizens the human right to give their democratic opinion on this Treaty."
"Besides, Lisbon was merely a carbon copy of a European constitution that had already been crushed in referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"Let us therefore begin by respecting the human rights of our own voters and no longer systematically referring to a treaty that has been voted down and is legally dead."
"A second criticism is that this report is chock-full of good intentions, but the reality is rather different."
"We have just seen the end of the Olympic Games in China, where all our European democrats joined in standing side by side with a communist regime in a repeat performance of Nazi Germany in 1936."
"In these circumstances, it may be advisable for us to observe a couple of months' ashamed silence - although I do admit that the report in its present form can be described as remarkably balanced by the standards of this House, and rightly criticises a large number of matters such as the situation in Cuba and Zimbabwe."
"However, it lacks a serious warning regarding worldwide Islamisation, which poses a threat to all the freedoms forming the very basis of our society."
"Finally, a further objection regarding a matter close to my heart."
"In our own European countries, particularly my home country, Belgium, we are increasingly seeing muzzling laws that restrict freedom of expression and even introduce prison sentences for opinions constituting an offence, particularly in matters of immigration and Islamisation."
"I consider this a particularly worrying development and think that, in this regard, we must fight tooth and nail - including in this House, when we discuss human rights - to defend freedom of expression in our own EU Member States, too."
"These have been three critical remarks on a report that, for the rest, is certainly not the worst we have seen here, and which we shall support provided no unacceptable amendments are adopted tomorrow."
"(LT) It is obvious that opinions on the political impact of sanctions vary greatly."
"There are cases where sanctions on a ruling regime cause suffering to innocent people, indirectly encouraging a shadow economy and black market."
"In some cases the danger of human rights violations can occur owing to the inclusion of people's names on blacklists."
"The credibility of sanctions is further compromised by the fact that they are imposed using double standards, depending on the strategic importance of the EU partner."
"The most recent example is the EU's failure to impose any sanctions on Russia, even though Russia had violated rules of international law by invading the territory of a sovereign country - Georgia - under the pretence of defending its citizens."
"However, sanctions still remain one of the weapons in the EU arsenal."
"In my opinion, sanctions are and should remain an integral part of the common foreign and security policy, or, to be more exact, a means of supporting human rights and democracy."
"Understandably, the EU is trying to use the 'carrot and stick' method and avoid having to impose sanctions."
"However, they should be imposed if necessary, and it is very important that sanctions play a wider, more consistent role in the strategy for protecting human rights."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Flautre, has mentioned the China arms embargo imposed in the wake of the Tiananmen Square Massacre."
"There are suggestions to lift the embargo; however, ladies and gentlemen, so far we have received no explanation for the Tiananmen Square Massacre, which shook the free world, nor any apology for it."
"Why, then, should this sanction be lifted?"
"I would like to point out that, with regard to the imposition of sanctions, the European Union should cooperate more closely with other countries and international organisations and coordinate its policy and actions with a view to making the sanctions more effective."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, sanctions form an integral part of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy in upholding the observance of human rights and preserving democracy and sovereignty."
"Although the European Union has been using many and varied sanctions for almost 20 years, no evaluation or study of the impacts of the EU sanctions policy has ever been undertaken."
"I therefore welcome HÃ©lÃ¨ne Flautre's report as an important contribution in this field."
"I also welcome its many conclusions."
"I too am of the view that it is essential to strengthen the European Union's expertise and analytical capabilities in the evaluation of sanctions."
"Ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and the creation of a European Foreign Service would provide a good opportunity for this."
"Sanctions, if used, should form part of a global concept for foreign policy, in other words, they should not be used in isolation, just on their own, without regard to the other instruments of foreign policy and without cooperation with the other players in the international system."
"Sanctions should also be accompanied by positive measures and stimuli to support human rights and to support civil society and democracy."
"Finally, sanctions should not be linked to humanitarian aid."
"Sanctions should be directed against actual people, for example with a view to restricting their movements or confiscating their assets, and not against the victims of their malicious behaviour."
"(PL) Mr President, sanctions are an important tool in foreign policy."
"They undoubtedly led to the fall of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa."
"In fact I am a beneficiary of sanctions myself, in so far as in 1983, as a result of an amnesty enforced by sanctions, I was released from jail, although sadly not for long."
"They do, however, very often fail, as can be seen from the examples of Zimbabwe and Cuba."
"Economic sanctions are often used to justify difficulties that are primarily the result of incompetent dictatorial government."
"There is, however, one type of sanction that does not give rise to such propaganda opportunities."
"This is a ban on entry into the European Union."
"It cannot, however, embrace only representatives of the highest authorities, as is the case with Belarus, for example; it must also take in individuals from the middle level of the apparatus of repression and violation of human rights."
"Then ordinary people will see that the measures taken are not targeted at them, but at the apparatus of dictatorial power."
"(LV) I would like to commend the attempts by Mrs Flautre to strengthen the European Union's capability and increase its authority."
"I have no doubt that sanctions need to be applied flexibly, but at the same time the rapporteur also points to the inadmissibility of double standards."
"Lack of consistency threatens the credibility of Europe's sanctions and policies."
"The European Union compromises itself if it introduces a sanctions regime and then breaches it itself, as is the case regarding Robert Mugabe."
"The European Union not infrequently treats non-EU countries differently."
"That has its consequences."
"The EU's acquiescent stance on the Georgia issue gave rise in Russia to a real explosion of enthusiasm."
"In their opinion, military aggression is the best instrument for protecting human rights."
"Certainly, throughout the world differing values hold sway."
"The CFSP's toothlessness is proof of the fact that the EU is led by business interests."
"When we assess it in practical terms, this must be the case."
"Unfortunately, it increases the sense of impunity on the part of certain major powers, and their awareness that they can violate international rights."
"Today's double standards will give rise to even more problems in the future."
"(NL) Mr President, sanctions were a suitable instrument to gradually put an end to the worst forms of colonial rule and to apartheid in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia."
"In the past, it was always the opponents of change who rejected sanctions and above all called attention to the negative side effects."
"On the other hand, the representatives of the poor and oppressed in those countries pointed out that they accepted the disadvantages of the boycott as the price that had to be paid for their liberation."
"The sustained economic boycott of the hideous regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq has taught us that such boycotts can also sometimes result in the inhabitants of the relevant country becoming isolated and afraid of the outside world and supporting their government."
"A boycott certainly does not help to push the wishes of the outside world through against domestic public opinion, but it is and remains an appropriate means of supporting suppressed public opinion and the fight for improvement in a country."
"If we make a sharp distinction along these lines, sanctions remain a useful instrument to bring about more equality and democracy."
"(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"I feel that the evaluation of Union measures and sanctions that form part of Union policies is extremely important in the area of human rights, especially at such a tense time, which currently means the Georgian crisis, and was preceded by the question of Tibet or even Zimbabwe."
"I would therefore like to congratulate Mrs Flautre on her report."
"This policy of sanctions is based on well-defined principles of human rights and international law, which are fortified by numerous UN and Union documents."
"The problems occur not at the level of principles but at the level of their application in practice, where we are experiencing a lack of consistency, effectiveness and balance."
"Systematic enforcement of human rights criteria is essential in preserving the credibility of the Union."
"I find consistency to be wanting, since it is often a victim of daily political interests."
"Unified action is just as crucial."
"There is no point in us having common standards if there are major deviations between the different Member States in their practical application."
"For example, whilst the EU defended the protection of human rights in the case of Tibet, the Union has a Member State that expels Tibetan refugees."
"In the interests of political effectiveness, we must construct a policy of sanctions that is transparent, unified and has well-defined aims."
"In addition to unified action, rapid or even immediate reaction is also important."
"We can see that the diplomatic wrangling makes a joke not only of our policy of sanctions but also of the whole Union."
"However, all of this will achieve its sole objective if it is accompanied by positive measures that support the relevant civil society. Thank you for your attention."
"(RO) I hope this report will play an important role in strengthening the European policy on applying Community sanctions."
"I believe it is essential to have more cohesion between Member States in the future, both during the decision-making process as regards sanctions and in relation to their correct application."
"If we want the European Union to be a strong and respected presence on the international stage and its actions, including as regards sanctions, to have the biggest possible impact, it is essential to demonstrate great solidarity and avoid using different units of measurements."
"It is essential that sanctions affect as little as possible the population of countries whose political regions are subject to sanctions."
"Let's not make those peoples suffer twice, as long as they are already victims of oppressive regimes or corrupt governments."
"I am glad that Madam Commissioner has also emphasized this aspect."
"Last but not least, I would like to bring up the matter of the opportunity of sanctions."
"At the beginning of this week, we were facing a specific case: the Georgian crisis and the position of the 27 Member States toward Russia."
"The results of Monday's Summit are subject to heated debates, precisely due to the discrepancy between the firm and almost vehement tone of the attitude expressed and the reticence to resort to sanctions."
"I consider that, as long as things can still be remedied and dialogue can prevent the deterioration of the situation, sanctions should remain the last measure to resort to."
"(ES) Mr President, the thoughts raised in this report on the issue of sanctions are very welcome."
"It is obvious that the issue needs some serious thought: too many times sanctions have proven to be entirely futile and, in many cases, entirely unfair; too many times they have harmed the weakest in society."
"Why do fishermen in Mauritania have to pay for the fact that, suddenly, there has been a coup in their country?"
"Where is the sense in that?"
"The sanctions should therefore be reviewed and analysed: both the concept itself and its application."
"Moreover, when they are imposed too frequently, and incoherently, as the European Union does, they lose credibility and so does the European Union."
"It is one thing to take into account our own interests and quite another for this to be the barometer for whether or not to impose sanctions."
"It is essential that we have specific monitoring of the effectiveness of these measures; it is essential that we promote intelligent sanction methods, so that they affect those responsible for human rights violations directly and personally."
"We are learning from what the United States have done in North Korea and the freezing of bank accounts in Macao."
"We are studying this example, which received very little publicity but was much more effective than holding numerous press conferences against a particular government."
"I therefore support this report, but there is still work to be done by the Commission and the Council in order to genuinely monitor what is being done, why it is being done and how it is being done."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and assure her that we will be supporting her report."
"The European Union is right to have at its disposal a tough set of political and economic instruments which can be used against regimes around the world which violate the human rights of their people."
"But the European Union must be very careful when it comes to imposing political and economic sanctions."
"The EU is the largest contributor to overseas development aid, but it must act with wisdom and prudence when it comes to sanctions."
"The effect of sanctions in Zimbabwe, Sudan and Burma, to name but three countries, has been very detrimental to ordinary people in those countries."
"So we must try and make sure that it does not affect the poorest and most oppressed in these countries but attacks and gets after the people who are leading these countries."
"Some people have mentioned Cuba."
"I cannot understand why we have sanctions against Cuba."
"Cuba should be returned to normal trading: in 10 years' time Cuba would be a radically different country if we did that instead having of these ridiculous sanctions on the place."
"We must be careful, as I said, when imposing sanctions, and when imposing economic and political sanctions they must be targeted at those who are in charge."
"Let us target their financial affairs abroad or their travel situation."
"Sanctions can be useful but they are limited, especially if they are only being used by European Union countries."
"UN sanctions are far stronger and can be far more effective."
"I support this report but I do think that sanctions are limited."
"They can be effective, but we must also use prudence and wisdom when we implement them."
"(EL) Mr President, under the pretext of human rights, the report under discussion proposes the most effective use of the unacceptable and inhuman weapon of sanctions and embargoes to impose the EU's policies by extortion and pressure on countries, peoples and governments that stand up to capitalist barbarity."
"The cleverly targeted sanctions being proposed, in combination with the financing of non-governmental organisations as EU mercenaries, constitute the most shameless open intervention in countries' internal affairs."
"This violates even the basic principles of what remains of international law."
"The report in practice adopts the embargo policy applied by the United States against Cuba under the Helms-Burton Act, which, among other things, obliges even third-country companies trading with the United States to abide by the sanctions it imposes."
"This law and embargo have been condemned repeatedly by the overwhelming majority of UN members at General Assemblies."
"It amounts to the export of national law, which is an abuse and denial of the international principles and Charter of the United Nations."
"Appealing to the UN and referring to human rights is a fig leaf covering up the EU's aggressive imperialist policy."
"It is incredibly hypocritical."
"We ask you: why do you not take any measures against Russia?"
"We should not agree to that, of course."
"Why do you not take measures against China?"
"We should not agree, of course, to your taking such measures."
"The explanation is that you have economic interests there."
"Those who introduced the human rights clause in the Agnoletto report have a great deal to answer for, because they gave the EU an alibi and pretext for its criminal policies against the people."
"Those who are competent among us and responsible enough to solve their own problems are, we believe, the people themselves."
"They do not need self-appointed protectors, least of all the EU."
"(PL) Mr President, the use of sanctions should become a real and effective part of EU foreign policy in the sphere of human rights."
"The conclusions incorporated into Mrs Flautre's report are well-intentioned."
"The policy of double standards used up to now needs to be changed."
"It makes sense to expand the application of the clause relating to human rights and democracy to cover all commercial agreements concluded by the EU with third countries."
"It is important to apply political and economic sanctions at the same time, with the former intended to hit hardest at sectors that constitute a strategic source of income for governments."
"When we apply sanctions, we should also support civil society and non-governmental organisations in the country in question."
"I have the impression, though, that passing resolutions is not enough of a solution."
"Examples where individual Member States have been guided by their own specific interests and have violated EU solidarity provide the best evidence of this."
"Without genuine political will on the part of the EU Member States, resolutions will remain on paper only."
"The position of the EU authorities with regard to Russia's actions in Georgia will be a measure of whether EU foreign policy passes the test."
"It is no longer enough simply to announce relevant principles and demands; it is high time they started to be applied."
"That is precisely what this report is about, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Flautre for that."
"(ET) In my view, one of the most important topics in this report is benchmarking."
"When we impose sanctions we also need to establish the benchmarks on how, when and under what conditions those sanctions are to be lifted."
"Without such benchmarks sanctions themselves are pointless."
"Take Andijan as an example."
"For the first time the sanctions regime incorporated a policy mechanism of positive measures, which means that there was a six-month period before sanctions were applied and Uzbekistan had the choice of whether to comply with our criteria and the time in which to do so."
"It is good that the positive mechanism was applied, but it too should be benchmarked: until there are very positive developments in the Andijan massacre the sanctions will not be lifted."
"This brings me to the next important point raised in the report. Namely, the establishment of an independent group of experts on sanctions, who would assess the types of sanctions and when they should be imposed."
"Consideration must also be given to the symbolic significance of sanctions, something which I experienced in Uzbekistan."
"It is difficult to quantify."
"Despite the fact that the effect in practice there was not great, for example the visa system (the officials, mostly those against whom it had been imposed, had left) and the arms embargo (arms were not supplied there), they had great symbolic value."
"That was the view expressed by everyone, from the taxi driver to the minister."
"Mr President, the European Union's foreign policy has been a pioneer of a positive conditionality model - the 'method of the carrot' -implementing it successfully in relations with its candidate countries."
"Unfortunately, rewarding progress in the field of human rights in developing countries has not always proven to be the most effective measure to encourage them to move forward, as new players have emerged in the international arena practising political dumping."
"China's policy in Africa, for example, does not hold any reference to human rights or democracy."
"But instead of backing down on the fundamental values of the EU, we should not be afraid of applying the 'method of the stick' where necessary to show that, when certain basic requirements are not met, there will also be dire consequences that third parties are wisely advised to avoid."
"(PL) Mr President, the use of double standards in the sphere of violation of human rights is a disaster for the EU."
"For a long time now, and also recently in the context of Russia's aggression against Georgia, we have been dealing with a situation in which a special lightweight tariff has been used for countries that, despite being dictatorial or semi-dictatorial, are rich or large, and for countries that are violating human rights but are less important from a European aspect, or for American business."
"We should not give up the instrument of sanctions against countries that violate human and citizens' rights and show contempt for European standards in that area."
"This instrument should not, however, be devalued - we should use it flexibly."
"In this context we should not reject the threat of the possible use of sanctions against Russia for the war in the Caucasus."
"To conclude, I am very glad that we wish to recognise the conscious infliction of damage to the environment as a violation of human rights."
"Colleagues from Finland, Sweden and the Baltic States are talking in this context of the potential dramatic environmental consequences of the investment in the Nord Stream gas pipeline on the bed of the Baltic Sea."
"(PT) Mr President, Europe needs a major change to take rights seriously."
"Smart and effective sanctions need to be linked to a structural and systemic response."
"Europe needs more unity."
"The myth of borders still makes its presence felt at the table when we are making decisions."
"Also seated around it are post-colonial nostalgias and current interests."
"Yet human rights require European authority and more intensive and extensive inclusion."
"A new Europe is not a Europe where each one decides what they want and how they want it."
"A new Europe is a single body and in human rights has not merely an end, but the very instrument for its geopolitics."
"The path is simple: a strong European political centre, a European Parliament with the power to decide, shared responsibility in the diplomatic dealings of the Member States in defending human rights, with the European Commission steering this task, more political and less bureaucratic European Commission delegations in third countries, pressure on the World Trade Organization to research the democratic dignity of its members, promotion of organisational structures identical to those of the Union, intensive dialogue with the African Union and the Union of South American Nations and other regional groupings, pressure on reform of the United Nations with the European Union playing a key role, creation of an internal strategy against dependence, centred on a single energy policy and a consistent defence policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need a policy revolution in this area of human rights."
"(DE) Mr President, the current debate on possible sanctions against Russia in reaction to the conflict in the Caucasus once again shows how irresponsibly sanctions are sometimes handled."
"It is questionable whether they are legitimate as an all-purpose, non-differentiating instrument and unclear when and how their effectiveness is in fact guaranteed."
"It is particularly important to evaluate the effectiveness of EU sanctions correctly."
"They should not be deceptive; on the contrary, they must be tailored."
"Repressive regimes are often responsible."
"What evaluation criteria are applied remains a central question, despite all efforts."
"When do sanctions actually lead to a change in behaviour?"
"Instead of ad hoc sanctions being imposed, I would like an EU strategy resulting in a coherent and sustainable sanctions policy."
"There would have to be a consensus here on their optimum conditions of use, however."
"An effective sanctions strategy is still lacking up to now."
"This report, however, is a step in the right direction."
"The European Parliament is currently the most important agent for promoting human rights."
"EU sanctions ought not to be an aggressive political instrument, but should be there in the people's interest."
"Sanctions that punish the civil population are counterproductive and miss the actual point."
"(RO) Sanctions represent one of the instruments the Union can use to implement its human rights policy."
"Nevertheless, as the Rapporteur also noticed, the absence of a study regarding the impact of the sanctions policy provided by the European Union makes the assessment of this policy's effects and effectiveness on the ground difficult and, consequently, indicates a lack of transparency, coherence and even legitimacy of Community sanctions."
"As long as the European Union does not speak with only one voice in its common security policy, it is very difficult for us to impose efficient and systematic Community sanctions."
"It is regrettable that the Union and the Member States have not used the sanctions systematically; this is why I consider, Mr. President, that the creation of a coherent strategy for the sanctions policy is required, in order to respect human rights, a strategy that would take into account the agreements and clauses already signed, avoiding the double standard and thus contributing to the increase in the Union's credibility."
"I congratulate Mrs. Flautre for this report."
"(PL) Mr President, in international law there is a Latin principle that goes like this: 'par in parem non habet imperium'."
"This means that a state cannot judge another state or impose sanctions on it, but that is in the past, that is history."
"International society, guided by common sense and rationalism, has completed an enormous about-turn."
"The primitive sanctions that states used to use against each other according to the retaliation principle, following the Biblical principle, drawn from the Old Testament, of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth', has been replaced by the excellent mechanism of collective, organised sanctions whereby procedures decide on who may use this mechanism, when and how."
"I am glad that the European Union is working out an ever more refined mechanism for applying sanctions, which includes differentiation to take account of the situation and the level of blame."
"There are two things I should like to emphasise."
"I am in favour of wise and intelligent sanctions that are sensibly applied, but I am against what are called preventive sanctions."
"In my view, preventive sanctions are an abuse."
"Secondly, I would like to appeal for us to give greater attention to society, to our citizens, by informing them that sanctions are not a primitive punishment, but a natural, healthy reaction to a serious violation of the law, and that they serve to defend democracy."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to pick up on a subject that several Members have addressed."
"Sanctions should not be wrongly targeted."
"In particular they should not harm the poorest of the poor."
"Here we have something that has been developing for quite some time, but we have to continue along this path."
"In the past we have seen again and again that corrupt regimes contemptuous of human rights very often have the attendant symptoms of very large amounts of public money being converted as a rule into private capital and then put on hold somewhere in fabulous accounts until the respective member of the regime is able to retrieve and enjoy this money."
"This involves us similarly seeking and finding worldwide cooperation, such as in the approach we have created at the International Criminal Court."
"The European Union can play an important role here in ensuring that the fruits of this policy do not arrive where we do not want them to arrive."
"(HU) Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Flautre on her excellent, balanced report."
"I can see three cases where the European Union is applying double standards."
"On the one hand, there are double standards when we weigh up two small countries, of which one opposes us and is hostile and the other declares itself to be pro-Western and pro-Europe."
"We see double standards between small countries and the bigger powers, Russia and China, because that is when economic interests come into play."
"And there is a third double standard, which raises the question of our credibility and whether the European Union has the right to criticise third countries with regard to human rights and minority rights when there are some countries in the Union where several hundreds of thousands of people do not have nationality, like two of the Baltic States, or when there is a leading power in the European Union whose constitution still rejects the recognition of regional languages. Thank you for your attention."
"(HU) Mr President, I would like to join those who have drawn attention to double standards and inconsistency, and I would like to draw Mrs Flautre's attention to point 22 of the report, concerning the substantiation of the country reports and the legality of sanctions or of a sanctions policy."
"In September 2004, this House made a decision to send a fact-finding mission to Vojvodina, the northern part of Serbia, which is not only a human rights matter but also a solidarity matter since there are very many Hungarians, and also Romanians and Germans, living there who ended up there through the storms of history."
"We examined the grave human rights situation there."
"And this decision said that the Subcommittee on Human Rights would investigate it."
"This has not happened, even after three and a half years."
"I would therefore ask that the subcommittee investigate this grave situation in accordance with the decision, because it is only then that Parliament will be able to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the actual situation and to assume a role in the sanctions policy."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by responding to Mrs Flautre, also to Mr Romeva I Rueda and to those who spoke of the need to have an appraisal, to have an evaluation and impact assessments."
"This does indeed seem very important to me, and the Council shares Parliament's concern to be able to take these sanctions decisions, and to update them, on the basis of the best possible information. The existing measures are regularly re-evaluated on the basis of impact assessments and the Council bases its decisions as often as possible on reports from the heads of mission in the country, who are best placed to judge their effectiveness."
"The Council has also considerably developed its consultations with local and international non-governmental organisations, and today Parliament has shown that it has a very important role to play in this evaluation."
"What is also true, however, is that sanctions are an instrument that must remain political in nature."
"We do need to have a strategy from the point of view of methodology, but we cannot fence ourselves in, nor can we give the process an automatic nature - I just want to say that as clearly and responsibly as possible here - therefore there will always be differences in our assessment."
"To answer Mrs Koppa as well, whose speech was very sophisticated, sanctions remain a political instrument."
"They are not the only instrument for promoting human rights."
"There are two other instruments which stigmatise the countries they are targeting less, but which are also a tool for promoting human rights, and these are the conditionalities provided for in the enlargement policy of the Stabilisation and Association Process with the Balkans and the Neighbourhood Policy, and mandatory human rights clauses in all the agreements that the European Union enters into with third countries or groups of countries, the violation of which can lead to the suspension of these agreements."
"I would like to reassure Mrs Koppa that there is no embargo on pharmaceutical products, but a system of control where these products have dual uses and are therefore subject to the non-proliferation regime."
"The Council shares the view of many that sanctions should remain targeted and should not affect civilian populations."
"Mr Cappato and Mr Gawronski also raised an important issue, and several speakers came back to the question of environmental damage."
"At the moment, damage to the environment does not feature among the objectives of the common foreign and security policy, so it is true that from that point of view, it is not taken into account and we should be thinking about whether to include damage to the environment where it constitutes a threat either to international security or to the rights of people, to human rights."
"That is a discussion we need to start."
"I would also like to say to Mr Cappato that in the cases mentioned, energy sanctions have already been used by the European Union and this has been in a variety of circumstances."
"I just wanted to go over a few cases that several of you mentioned: recent events, obviously."
"Concerning the war between Russia and Georgia, I would say very clearly here that sanctions cannot achieve their aim if the consequence is to break off all contact with the country concerned, in this case Russia."
"Finally, we also need to think about whether imposing sanctions in this case would be in Georgia's interest."
"I would ask you all to think about that."
"I will also come back to what has been said about the benchmarking process."
"It was mentioned by Mrs Saks."
"It is a very important issue, particularly as regards Uzbekistan; it is true, having been there for a conference on Central Asia and the European Union's presence in Central Asia."
"When I was there I also met Mrs Tadjibaeva, a political prisoner, who has now been released; we hope that her health will improve and she can be given the proper care, but I was also able to see that a good benchmarking policy meant that progress could be achieved and that there was commitment from the authorities to meeting more fully the criteria defined by the European Union. As it happens, we will be returning to the country in October."
"As regards Cuba and those who mentioned it, I would like to remind you that the sanctions against Cuba were lifted in June 2008, which is not stopping us from keeping up rigorous monitoring of human rights developments in the country."
"Those were the clarifications I wished to make at the end of this extremely detailed and rich debate, which demonstrates the necessity of Parliament's involvement."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think this was a very useful discussion which highlighted a number of very important issues that we have to reflect upon when we opt for sanctions, because sanctions are just one of our foreign policy tools."
"We always have to apply them, after careful overall reflection, in conjunction with all other tools, including development work or political and economic reform in third countries."
"With all these tools we want to achieve one thing: upholding and promoting human rights."
"Mrs Flautre's report clearly shows that we need to refine this instrument further and make sure that our system of sanctions is in itself fully in line with international law, and does not violate fundamental human rights we all subscribe to."
"I believe that our courts - as indeed the European Court of Justice has done today - contribute substantially to developing our sanctions system while at the same time safeguarding fundamental principles like the rule of law and due process."
"Again, we should promote human rights and save the wider population, not punish them, either economically or otherwise."
"This is very important."
"I shall repeat, therefore, that we must target sanctions at those responsible for human rights violations and - as Mr Rack said - opt for instance for freezing accounts and visa bans so as to deprive those leaders or those responsible for human rights violations of any positive possibilities."
"A number of speakers, indeed Mrs Flautre herself, have also asked for a proper evaluation of EU sanctions and have suggested the development of a certain methodology."
"I think Jean-Pierre Jouyet has already briefly referred to the work done in this respect in the Council, which I would like to support, and in particular I think we should improve somewhat on the ex ante evaluation before imposing sanctions."
"Here I could also offer again the services of our delegations because they are sur place and they have a very good knowledge of what is going on; contributions by civil society and human rights organisations are certainly very useful there."
"With regard to coherence I would like to say that sanctions are an important tool, but they must be complemented with a proactive approach in our development work: support for human rights institutions, political reform, promoting of civil society."
"Burma/Myanmar is a good example of that."
"Sanctions are there while, at the same time, keeping open the possibility of working with NGOs and human rights organisations."
"I think this is one important way forward."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am pleased that this discussion has been held and about what each of you, and the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, have contributed."
"I believe that through this discussion, something resembling a common philosophy is emerging."
"I have heard many calls for a more consistent policy, a more credible policy, which avoids double standards, and it seems to me that these are the issues we need to keep working on. I learned a lot in writing this report, through discussions with various people."
"I truly believe there is still a lot of work to do, and that the basis of this future work shall and must be a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation of the current sanctions policy because, when the question is asked - and we see it today with Russia - things immediately get very heated, and the media are instantly on the lookout."
"We therefore need a very solid philosophy and we really have to be in step and in agreement about our procedures and policy."
"I think that to do this - I am coming back to the question of the network of experts - it is not a matter of using technical expertise to replace sensitive political decisions, but of ensuring that the sensitive political decisions are based as far as possible on objective information."
"When you engage in a sanctions policy, you have to see it through and to respect what many of you have called 'completely objective benchmarks', which let you measure the real effectiveness of the sanctions."
"I believe we are making really concrete progress."
"There are still a few points to be clarified - you will all have realised this from several of the speeches - and these were the reason for my abstention in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot sell ourselves short on requirements for full respect for human rights and international law in drawing up blacklists, in putting people's names on these lists or taking them off."
"The Court of Justice judgment you have just talked about, Mr Jouyet, fully encourages us to pursue this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to adopt, not a perfect report, but a very honourable report of which we can be proud, and which will be a good working tool."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 September 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in written form. - (BG) Mr. PÃ¶ttering, Ms Flautre, most of you have been in opposition at one moment or another of your political career."
"You are familiar with this experience - the incumbent pretend that you do not exist while you denounce them for their thefts and [shady] deals."
"In Bulgaria, however, heirs to terrorists and outright fascists are currently in power."
"These are the parties that constitute the three-party coalition in Bulgaria: godless individuals who bombed churches to make an impression on the Comintern, such as the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is; a party compiled around the heir of Boris III who involved Bulgaria in World War II and did not miss kissing with Hitler - these are the thieves from the Simeon II National Movement (SNM) - and, finally, the anti-constitutional Muslim party of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) which consists of terrorists who blew up railway carriages for mothers with children just about twenty years ago."
"On 30 July 2008 these incumbents beat up my colleague Dimitar Stoyanov."
"A medical examination established 34 injuries sustained from the thugs in police uniforms."
"Against the backdrop of the EU effective policy for the application of sanctions in cases of gross violation of human rights, about which you speak in your report, I insist that this Parliament and each of its Members voice an opinion in respect to this shameful for all of us incident, and severely condemn the governing mafia in my country."
"in writing. - The criminal justice system serves to punish, deter and to rehabilitate the offender."
"In the same way sanctions broadly serve the same purposes."
"Our criminal justice systems may punish, but how successful they are in deterring and rehabilitating is open to question."
"Likewise, sanctions often have limited impact on deterring and rehabilitating nations which break international law and violate human rights."
"Research based on the effectiveness of over 100 instances of economic sanctions since World War I has shown that they are most likely to be effective if: the change we demand is modest; large powerful nations or groups of nations act against a weaker nation; the target nation is truly dependent on trade with those imposing the sanctions; sanctions are imposed quickly and damage to the imposer of sanctions is limited."
"When the EU does impose sanctions they should be precise and well targeted."
"Measures to consider include: freezing of financial assets, ban on transactions, investment restrictions; trade restrictions on particular goods; travel restrictions; diplomatic constraints and cultural and sports restrictions."
"It is vital that the EU reviews its sanctions policy, not only with the aim of achieving the desired changes in offending nations, but also to ensure its own credibility."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament, playing at being the UN, is claiming to establish the reign of human rights throughout the world."
"It would do better to keep its own house in order."
"In France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, thousands of citizens, including academics, public lawyers and elected representatives chosen by their fellow countrymen, are tried, sentenced, ruined, removed from employment, imprisoned and accused of racism for criticising immigration, accused of xenophobia for defending legitimate national preference, accused of revisionism for criticising the 'official' but changing truths of contemporary history, accused of homophobia for expressing a legitimate preference for natural families, which are the only ones capable of passing on life."
"This political and judicial persecution even extends to lawyers."
"In Germany, Sylvia Stolz was arrested for defending her client's views in court."
"In France, the Council of the Paris Bar Association, by rejecting the honorary membership of retired lawyer Eric Delcroix instead of taking his defence, brought dishonour on itself."
"Judges like Estoup in Versailles, Schir in Lyon and Cotte in Paris are vying to get these arbitrary laws extensively applied out of disregard for any principles that protect freedom."
"Most of all, however, some of those responsible for this freedom-killing legislation sit in this Parliament."
"It is at them that our indignation should be directed first of all."
"in writing. - The European Union is based on values, such as democracy and respect for human rights."
"Protecting and speaking up for these is the core of any policy made in the European Union."
"Human rights have been mainstreamed into the EU's foreign policy."
"Nevertheless, all too often the EU is not speaking with one voice and lacks the ability to react fast and efficiently on massive violations of human rights."
"Sanctions are part of the human rights policy, yet they are not applied equally."
"The EU should not turn a blind eye and make exceptions for big countries, such as Russia and China, which is in fact trading human rights for economic benefits."
"Economic relations with third countries have to be carefully considered in cases of continuing human rights violations, which have to be met with sanctions and the freezing of further negotiations."
"Therefore, I strongly call upon the Commission and the Council to react with determination, unity and strength."
"Furthermore, I call on the EU to apply the human rights policy equally and to set sanctions on every country where massive human rights violations are proven."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Flautre, for a balanced and worthy report, whose insistence on the re-evaluation of EU sanctions and research as part of the EU's wider human rights policy is only right and proper."
"As long as we lack information based on large-scale research, the debate on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of sanctions will remain a fruitless task."
"Sanctions can be of significance in human rights policy in two complementary ways."
"On the one hand, they are a moral message from the European community of values and, as such, a valuable signal."
"On the other hand, they can have a tangible impact on the development of the target state."
"Both these aspects have definitely been important in cases where actual lasting results have been achieved, for example in the dismantling of South Africa's apartheid policy."
"It is probably obvious, however, that sanctions alone cannot achieve results like this."
"For a country's human rights and political situation actually to change permanently, the coordination and comprehensive use of the instruments of human rights policy are required."
"Parliament has stressed before how important it is to have a more effective assembly for human rights policy."
"In order to avoid human catastrophes, we should look into the possibility of more focused sanctions, which target, in particular, a country's leaders and groups who violate human rights."
"We should be wary, in particular, of the sort of crippling measures that destroy chances for small and medium-sized enterprises to grow."
"My own question here is what criteria should be used to impose sanctions."
"It is regrettable that all too often, behind the evaluation of sanctions, one can discern a concern over how appropriate they might be, which is based on the Union's commercial interests."
"The Millennium Development - Goal 5: maternal health (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the Millennium Development Goal 5: maternal health."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like the European Parliament, the Council attaches great importance to achieving all the Millennium Development Goals throughout the world by 2015 and particularly the one that aims to reduce the maternal mortality rate by three quarters between 1990 and 2015."
"In this respect, the European Union recalls that lasting progress in this area requires respect for and promotion of the rights of women and girls by guaranteeing them access to health services, notably as regards sexual health and by protecting them from the AIDS virus."
"The three EU institutions have made clear their collective desire to improve maternal health in the developing countries, particularly through the signature on 20 December 2005 of the European Consensus on Development, which puts maternal health among the priorities for the EU's development policy."
"We now have the necessary financial instruments to implement this goal, particularly within the framework of the partnership between the European Union and Africa on the Millennium Goals."
"As you know, regarding health, there are still considerable challenges to be met."
"They were mentioned in the United Nations annual report."
"500 000 women still die each year from complications in pregnancy or childbirth that cannot be treated."
"These deaths cannot be avoided at this stage if we do not make any progress."
"The probability of a woman dying of these maternal causes is 1 in 16 in sub-Saharan Africa compared with 1 in 3 800 in developed countries."
"Therefore, in view of the scale of these challenges, in view of this totally unacceptable situation, the Council has taken the decision to accelerate and strengthen its action."
"In June, it adopted an Agenda for Action."
"The Agenda states that the EU will urgently support the attainment of the target set in 2005 regarding universal access to reproductive health and well as 2010 milestones to save - as you know - 4 million more children's lives each year, 2 million of which in Africa, and to have 35 million more births attended by skilled health personnel each year, 13 million of which in Africa."
"If we want to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters by 2015, it means that 21 million more births will have to be attended by skilled health personnel each year by 2010."
"The EU will provide support to reach the target of 50 million more women in Africa having modern contraceptives by 2010, and more generally to have access to family planning."
"The Agenda, which was implemented by the Council, also states that the EU will contribute to helping to bridge the financing gap to achieve these targets by 2010."
"I can tell you that the financing gap is today estimated at more than EUR 13 billion by the World Health Organisation."
"If - and the Commissioner will tell us if this is the case - the European Commission believes that, to bridge the financing gap, we need to increase EU support by EUR 8 billion by 2010, of which EUR 6 billion would be destined for Africa, it is essential that both partner countries and donors are stakeholders in dealing with the challenges facing us."
"In this context, the Presidency is therefore convinced that reinforcing the health systems of the developing countries remains a key priority of the Millennium Development Goals."
"Several concrete actions are planned, which I will list: the Presidency and the Commission are preparing a joint paper on covering health risks; development ministers are going to meet during the informal meeting, which will take place on 29 and 30 September, regarding the conclusions of the November Council meeting and the forthcoming presidencies for universal access to healthcare; and finally, the Council will examine the Commission report on the EU programme for action to tackle the critical shortage of health workers in developing countries - and I have made a note of how crucial this task is."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you can be sure that the Council will continue to act and do everything it can for the European Union to continue driving improvements in maternal health in developing countries, particularly Africa."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the right to health is probably the basic right with the most inequalities in the world today."
"Those in greatest need, at greatest risk of ill health and premature death, have the worst access to health care - often zero access."
"This poses enormous challenges to the European Union and to the world community as a whole."
"The European Union is very committed to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including MDG 5 on maternal health, which is the subject we are discussing today."
"We are aware of the fact that scaling up sexual and reproductive health and health funding in general requires a far more coherent and multi-sectoral approach, also involving other MDGs."
"Health results cannot be achieved without adequate investment in the systems that deliver better health."
"Health policy needs to be embedded in broader social and economic development planning."
"Countries need long-term predictable aid from external donors."
"Donors need to see a clear link between financing and results, and mechanisms to hold all partners accountable for their performance against international agreements are badly needed."
"Poor people - women, men and children - living in developing countries encounter a wide range of interrelated sexual and reproductive health problems."
"These include HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, complications encountered in pregnancy and childbirth, genital mutilation or cutting, infertility, sexual abuse, unsafe abortion and cancer of the cervix, among others."
"Together, these conditions are responsible for much suffering and many premature deaths."
"Exacerbated by poverty and the secondary position of women in society they are basically due to the lack of access to appropriate health services, lack of information and inadequate availability of skilled professionals and supplies of reproductive health commodities."
"Therefore, improving maternal health and reducing maternal mortality have been key concerns of the European Commission's work in health and development."
"However, despite our efforts and the MDG targets, MDG 5 is possibly the goal which is most off-track globally - especially, as has already been said, in Africa."
"This is very serious, all the more so because most maternal deaths occur at home, far removed from the health services, and often go unrecorded."
"So the actual maternal mortality figure might even be much higher than the half million a year that we are aware of according to the statistics."
"From a political point of view, there is another issue which causes concern."
"This is the increasing tendency not to prioritise sexual and reproductive health and rights policies in programmes because of sensitivities to abortion."
"By doing so, we are forgetting about the unequal position of women in many of our partner countries who have no say about the number of children they want or are forced to have sexual relations, sometimes even with a partner who is likely to be HIV-infected."
"Let us not forget about the many victims of rape, the young girls and women who, on top of their injuries and trauma, often get rejected by their relatives and communities."
"Under the 10th European Development Fund and the Commission budget, we are therefore programming direct support to health in 31 developing countries."
"Many of these countries have very high maternal mortality rates and very weak health systems."
"In this regard, budget support linked to health outcomes becomes another important instrument to address maternal mortality."
"To make this aid more predictable, the Commission is introducing in a number of partner countries a new financing modality called 'MDG contracting', under which budget support will be made over a longer term, linked with agreed outcomes which contribute towards the achievement of the MDGs."
"This will allow governments to support recurrent costs of health systems, such as the salaries of health workers."
"This is critical to increase access to basic healthcare, including safe deliveries and progress towards MDG 5."
"However, we know that what is being done in support of maternal health at the moment is not sufficient and that more efforts are needed to change the present situation."
"This is why on 24 June 2008 the Council of the European Union adopted the EU Agenda for Action on MDGs, whereby the Commission and the Member States commit themselves to increase their support to health by the additional EUR 8 billion which has been mentioned, and EUR 6 billion in Africa, by 2010."
"Regarding MDG 5, the Agenda for Action on MDGs mentioned two important targets by 2010: firstly, 21 million more births attended by skilled health workers and, secondly, 50 million more women to have access to modern contraceptives in Africa."
"We the Commission - but also the Member States - will now have to make it happen together."
"We have made the commitment and we are determined to improve the situation of women in poor countries giving birth, which I think is the most natural thing in the world."
"I am glad that, as the Commissioner for External Relations today, in place of Louis Michel, I can say that, because, as a woman, I feel very much in solidarity."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Millennium Development Goal 5 is a very important objective, touching as it does not only on the quality of life, but on life itself, its initiation and continuation."
"The importance of Millennium Development Goal 5 is all the greater in as much as its successful implementation does not cost very much in monetary terms."
"There are programmes and projects that are already being put into effect around the world that have significantly reduced perinatal mortality, and their cost has not been particularly high."
"Despite this, in some regions the achievement dynamics of Goal 5 have been poor or very poor."
"Moreover, in some regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, there has been no improvement since 2000."
"This is a very worrying phenomenon, as it means that implementation of Millennium Development Goal 5 on a global scale is seriously threatened."
"Unfortunately in some developed countries we still see a tendency to ideologise the problem and concentrate on one really quite controversial issue, namely that of reproductive rights."
"This has already been mentioned today."
"However, one of the most important causes of death among mothers is hazardously performed abortions."
"However you look at it, it is logical that limiting the number of abortions would bring about a fall in mortality among mothers."
"Surely, then, it would be easier to limit the number of abortions than to increase the number of what might be called 'safe' abortions."
"It is therefore difficult to agree with the assertion that reproductive health should be a priority in development policy."
"It is important, but surely the priority should continue to be the fight against poverty (I agree with the Commissioner), improving the position of women and keeping the promises made by developed countries."
"This choice of priorities is very important, because a poor choice of priorities could lead to actions that might be unfavourable."
"For example, we include the example of exchanging experience and best practice in resolutions as standard, but if the objective is inappropriate, an exchange of experience and best practice could be ineffective or downright undesirable."
"It is also worth remembering that imposing our norms and standards on other countries and societies is morally ambivalent."
"In matters of ethics, countries that benefit from our aid should take their own decisions on what is good and acceptable."
"We should not, for example, say that abortion is a good solution."
"That would be inconsistent and it would be unjustified interference: inconsistent, because we ourselves wish to increase the birth rate in Europe, while promoting its restriction in other countries; unjustified interference, because no-one has authorised us to influence decisions on ethical matters in other states."
"In my opinion, therefore, we should concentrate on what is not controversial, especially as there are very many things that are not controversial and on which we are all agreed: education, strengthening the position of women, protecting motherhood, good nutrition, access to skilled medical assistance and obstetric care."
"These are areas on which we can jointly concentrate, and thus facilitate the achievement of Millennium Goal 5."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner - to whom I would like to wish a happy birthday today - I am not going to refer to the text I was planning to read to you here on behalf of my group because I believe we are in the midst of a particularly important discussion."
"By noting the failure to meet this Millennium goal, the fifth goal, which is very important because it concerns women and their suffering during pregnancy, we have to abandon the extremely hypocritical attitude and analysis we make in Europe when we know, see and can testify to the situation in Africa, on the ground, in villages, in countryside and in the bush."
"I was rather annoyed by what our fellow Member Mr Kaczmarek has just said, and that is why I am not going to read my paper."
"We cannot claim that abortion is a miraculous remedy for all the problems of women who have to give birth."
"Absolutely not."
"We have to devote the necessary means to ensuring that these women can have everything they need: an education, proper family planning, contraception and, where necessary, voluntary termination of pregnancy under proper conditions - but we are not going all-out for that."
"It is extremely difficult to say things clearly in Parliament because there are some people who, in the name of morality and sometimes in the name of conservatism, keep stopping us from taking proper measures, effective measures, for the benefit of women in the countries concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have worked on the joint motion for a resolution on maternal mortality, taking account of the fact that Goal 5, 'Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio', is far from being achieved and requires a strong initiative, a strong and concrete initiative by the international community, which a Europe of rights and values can only interpret and guarantee."
"We acknowledge the reassurances given by Mr Jouyet and Mrs Ferrero, but we need to move swiftly from words to actions."
"After all, maternal mortality, together with infant mortality, is the most important indicator of the level of human development, and it is unacceptable, as we have already said, that today more than half a million women still die each year during childbirth."
"As we all know, the majority of these women live in sub-Saharan Africa, where there is one death every minute. As we have said, the same risk for women living in the developed world is one in 3 700."
"These figures appear even more dramatic if we look at the encouraging progress made during the same period by some middle-income countries in Eastern Asia, South East Asia, North America, Latin America and North Africa, which prove that this awful situation can be overcome."
"In our opinion, therefore, this resolution is well-timed, articulate and comprehensive, and identifies strategies that can address this outright global health emergency, in recognition of the fact that access to an adequate level of healthcare is a fundamental human right."
"To conclude, I hope that the valuable compromise reached between the groups on such an agonising issue can garner the widest consensus in Parliament and that the adoption of the joint resolution will bring forth concrete action from all of our institutions and nations, as well as adequate investment in infrastructure and transport, medical equipment, training for equipment operators, education, safety and policies for the emancipation of women, so that this crucial goal for civilisation can be reached by 2015."
"Mr President, mortality during the perinatal period continues to be a very disturbing phenomenon, and one that is not justified by the state of medical knowledge."
"Improving the state of health of pregnant women is an even more serious problem at a time of demographic collapse."
"It is worth remembering what a serious mutilation an abortion is for a woman."
"We cannot have the dilemma: if you agree to the killing of your child, you will have a chance of survival."
"A 75% reduction in perinatal mortality by 2015, relative to 1990, requires a general improvement in women's state of health and an increase in the money spent on health care and education aimed at prevention."
"The situation is at its worst in southern and sub-Saharan Africa, and also in Asia."
"Each year half a million women there pay for their desire to have offspring with their lives."
"In the case of women infected with HIV and malaria, besides the danger to the mother's health, there is also the danger that the children will be infected."
"It should be emphasised that one important negative factor here is poverty, and financial means should be addressed to solving this problem."
"This situation very specifically indicates the value of solidarity between people."
"Recognising women's health - the health of mothers-to-be - as a priority and the mobilisation of international forces in order to improve health care for pregnant women is a serious challenge."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I have now been a parliamentarian for nine years and, in that time, have had two children."
"They are now aged two and almost eight."
"Pregnancies are always full of suspense, of course - you always wonder whether the child will be born perfectly healthy - but I can honestly say that in neither of those pregnancies did I ever wonder whether I myself would survive."
"What a tremendous luxury that is!"
"The figures have already been cited."
"In Europe, fewer than 1 in 3 800 women die from pregnancy-related causes, but the figure is very much higher in some African countries: 1 in 16."
"The figure of 1 in 7 has been mentioned for Niger."
"One reason for this is unsafe abortions."
"I do wish these were not a reality, but this would require changes such as the provision of contraception or restraint on the part of men."
"Further reasons are a lack of medical assistance or delays in providing such assistance, and too many pregnancies one after another and at too young an age."
"The wide discrepancies between the situation in Europe and in a great many of these other countries show that investment pays off."
"It is self-evident: investment in health care reduces maternal mortality."
"Yet very little is happening in this regard."
"In 1987 approximately half a million women a year died in pregnancy or childbirth and this figure was unchanged in 2008 - this is most disappointing."
"I make no secret of my cynicism."
"My feeling is that much more attention is paid to combating AIDS because this claims the lives of men, too."
"However, I am encouraged by what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and also the President-in-Office had to say, and wish to thank the Commissioner most warmly for her speech."
"There is a clear link between maternal mortality and self-determination."
"According to recent research, approximately 200 million women in developing countries would very much like to bear fewer children, but half of these have no access to contraceptives and sexual information."
"This results in 52 million unwanted pregnancies a year, and this is something we must be concerned about."
"According to Kofi Annan, the fight against hunger and poverty is doomed to failure from the outset if the international community does not succeed in strengthening women's rights."
"We, the European Union, are in a unique position to strengthen the call for equal rights for women worldwide."
"We do want this, but are actually shirking our real responsibility."
"Therefore, I should like to put the case for a European Envoy for Women's Rights."
"The majority of this House has already welcomed this, and I would also ask for the Commissioner's support."
"This will be a top diplomat who can raise her voice on behalf of the EU or mediate in cases of violence towards women, who will submit proposals to the Council of Ministers and the European Commission and who will be accountable to the European Parliament."
"It is a driving force that we need, someone who ensures that all our proposals take account of women's rights, as this is so crucial."
"Mr President, I have already presented this proposal to a representative of the French Presidency."
"He said that he considered it interesting."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office what he is going to do about this."
"I have the proposal here, including in French and German. I shall hand it over to him, and I sincerely hope that this Envoy for Women's Rights will be introduced, as we really need this driving force to effect real change."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, the current statistics show that, overall, MDG 5 is way off track and maternal mortality is even on the increase in Africa and South Asia."
"Every year 536 000 women die as a result of pregnancy and childbirth."
"Of those deaths 99% occur in developing countries."
"In Africa one in 16 women dies during pregnancy or childbirth."
"In industrialised countries there is considerably less likelihood of this happening."
"The most frequent causes of death are haemorrhaging, infections and illegal abortions."
"Approximately 68 000 women die every year as a result of unsafe abortions and millions of women incur life-long injuries or other damage to their health."
"In fact, 97% of all unsafe abortions are carried out in developing countries."
"Every minute a woman dies somewhere in the world as a result of pregnancy or childbirth."
"We have a moral obligation and an opportunity to prevent this."
"In developing countries, particularly in rural areas, women urgently need universal access to general health care, medical assistance and advice on pregnancy and childbirth."
"I am also calling for family planning, including access to effective contraceptives and safe abortions."
"The improvement in reproductive health and the abolition of any kind of discrimination against women are key and extremely important preconditions for achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, the UN's statement on the Millennium Development Goals really deserves every support from us rich Europeans."
"It is both a tragedy and a scandal that so many people in this world live in extreme poverty, that so many women die in pregnancy and childbirth, that so many newborn babies die at birth, that so many people have no access to safe contraception and that so many people are infected with HIV/AIDS and do not have access to antiretroviral drugs."
"The reason for this horrific situation is not a lack of resources, technology or medical knowledge."
"We know how these issues can be solved."
"This is clearly shown by the fact that many countries solved them a long time ago."
"What this is about is getting poor countries to change their social institutions in order really to make development possible in these areas."
"Progress has been made in several poor countries, for example in Egypt and Bangladesh."
"The member states of the UN have undertaken to work towards these goals after careful analysis and in-depth political debates."
"But these are global issues and belong at UN level."
"So why are they turning up here in the EU?"
"Global issues should be addressed at global level, in the UN, where all the EU countries are members."
"The EU must deal with those issues which are common to its Member States, i.e. cross-border issues within Europe."
"The thing the EU can and should do to reduce poverty and thereby maternal mortality is to abolish its agricultural policy as soon as possible."
"(SK) I worked for three years as an obstetrician in Africa, so this problem means quite a lot to me."
"Also, during my time at the Council of Europe, I was a rapporteur for a report on maternity in which it was found that, in the developing countries and also in Europe, women were often not given basic protection during pregnancy."
"There are many conventions and declarations, whether from the UN or the ILO, relating to the legal protection of women and their health which are not observed and often not ratified."
"As regards basic care in developing countries, the entire health care system is very weak."
"Only 10% of the population of Africa has access to health care services."
"Maternal mortality is therefore very high."
"In Africa, there is a lack of qualified professionals and doctors, and AIDS is still a cause of maternal death."
"Despite the protests of the world's public, female circumcision is still practised."
"In Asia, the problem of maternity comes up against religious and caste obstacles."
"Comprehensive investment support is required here to boost health care and in particular mother and child care, but we know that child mortality too is very high."
"Instead of big targets, we propose caution and monitoring of the resources we provide."
"If European funding is to serve a purpose, the targets must be clear, understandable and concentrated on a small number of objectives, but they will only be successful if we monitor them well."
"Mr President, there has been no advancement on Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 on improving maternal health since 2000, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and before 2000 progress was practically non-existent."
"In September 2000, world leaders adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration, committing their countries to reducing extreme poverty by 2015 through the objectives of the MDGs."
"The figures for maternal health, which is one of the eight MDGs, are the same now as they were 20 years ago."
"More than half a million women die in pregnancy or childbirth every year, which is one death every minute."
"Of those deaths, 99% are in developing countries."
"In parts of Africa, the maternal mortality rate is as high as one in sixteen."
"In the least developed countries, only 28 in 100 women giving birth are attended by trained personnel."
"The objective of MDG 5 is to reduce the ratio of women dying in childbirth by three quarters between 1990 and 2015."
"I call on the Council and Commission, ahead of the United Nations High-Level meeting on the MDGs in New York this September, to prioritise action to meet the MDG targets and to fulfil MDG 5 in particular."
"I will be travelling to the UN in New York at the end of this month as part of the delegation from the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, and intend to underline the importance of EU Member States renewing their commitments to achieving the MDGs by 2015."
"Now that we are at the half-way mark regarding MDGs, it is critical that EU Member States continue to progress to 0.7% GNI by 2015."
"Given the fact that there has been a drop in EU aid figures from 0.41% of GNI in 2006 to 0.38% in 2007 - a decrease of EUR 1.5 million - I urge EU Member States to refrain from reneging on funding commitments."
"Those not currently on track must increase their efforts."
"I call on the presidency of the Council to take the lead and set an example by ensuring that adequate predictable funding is available, and also to scale up their efforts, so that lives can be saved."
"Mr President, may I at the outset thank the Commissioner very much indeed for her strong and audacious statement, which was very much appreciated."
"May I also say to Mr Kaczmarek that he should be aware that 19% of maternal deaths are caused by unsafe abortions."
"Surely this is something that has to be seriously addressed, and there should be no pretence that it can be dealt with in any other way."
"As we focus on sexual reproductive health rights, we hear from the other side that they have problems with the vocabulary used in this resolution."
"Apparently they do not even like the word 'rights' to be used; they do not like the word 'services' to be used."
"These semantics would not go down very well, I fear, with the thousands upon thousands of grieving motherless children in the developing world, or with those children whose mothers have died in agony because there was no anaesthetic, or with a mother bleeding to death because there is no thread for stitches, or a mother dying because there is not the three cents to buy the magnesium sulphate that would save her from death through haemorrhaging."
"Tell them that the vocabulary used in this resolution matters."
"Try telling them that it all costs too much."
"Those lives are precious and no woman should die giving life."
"We also have to take into account that some people say the reality is that women have low status and low value, and therefore that we cannot change things."
"That is absolute nonsense."
"We have to change things."
"We have to deal with the kind of misogyny that leads to this suffering and grief."
"We also demand change from the presidency."
"We demand action from the presidency on the commitments it has made on the MDGs."
"We liked the fine words from the presidency of the European Union, but we need to see more action."
"Meeting MDG 5 means building health systems and ensuring that we address financially the fact that 40% of women globally give birth without any skilled assistance."
"We look to the presidency to take the lead."
"For instance, in France between 2006 and 2007, aid to Africa actually declined."
"France is off track in its commitments, and we need to know that the presidency is going to reflect on the call to action and make the kind of commitments that are needed before 2010."
"Will the presidency state whether those budgetary commitments will be made?"
"Will it deliver on that promise?"
"We know that there is a need to fight maternal mortality."
"We know how much it costs."
"We know too, sadly, what it costs not to do it."
"Mr President, the condemnation of the use of contraceptives and the prevention of legal abortion has been one of the most malicious crimes committed against humanity, as some contraceptives also provide protection against sexually-transmitted diseases such as HIV."
"They also improve maternal health when combined with sufficient sex education."
"Legal abortion prevents unwanted children from being condemned to poverty, hunger and disease."
"By denying women the freedom of choice, we are receding from the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals."
"In order to improve maternal health in developing countries, the European Union must condemn the US global gag rule, as well as the ban on the use of contraceptives advocated by some churches."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are absolutely duty-bound to act so that women can realise their maternal function in optimum health conditions."
"This much is clear. Therefore, the hope expressed in this sense by the motion for a resolution that we have been discussing deserves our support."
"However, I cannot hide the discomfort I feel when I hear the inappropriate use in international circles of the expression 'reproductive health services': we want reproductive health services, but we cannot allow this to include elective abortion, turning the tragic suppression of human beings at the very beginning of their existence into a social service."
"Whatever views each of us has on the legalisation of abortion, I believe that in a document on maternal health, we must not forget that maternity concerns two people, and not just one."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the compromise resolution includes a reference to both the Declaration of and Convention on the Rights of the Child, which use the term 'child' even for unborn children and call for special services for both the mother and child."
"I believe that it is only right that in documents designed to ensure the safety of motherhood, there should be references not only to these instruments but to other pro-life instruments."
"It should be about welfare, economic, social and psychological support and education on respect for life."
"Conversely, where this is limited and where the emphasis is placed only on the use of contraception, including abortion, we will not achieve the desired results."
"There are countries in Europe, such as France and the UK, where there is no doubt that contraception is much more widespread than in other countries, and yet where according to official reports the number of abortions is steadily rising."
"I would just like to ask my fellow Members to give a moment's consideration to these points."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, I should like to thank the Commissioner most warmly for her very strong statement."
"It is true that maternal mortality illustrates the most distressing inequality between women in the north and south."
"It is clear that a number of our fellow Members in this Hemicycle still do not get it."
"Mr Casini, every year, 50 million women have unwanted pregnancies because they lack access to contraceptives; 42 million of these women have an unsafe abortion, 80 000 of whom die."
"These are the hard facts."
"The vast majority of these women live in sub-Saharan Africa; thus the West has absolutely no reason to lecture these women."
"This is a disgrace, as maternal mortality is entirely preventable if women are just given access to health care and sexual and reproductive health."
"According to the World Health Organization, the cost of providing basic health care is EUR 34 per person per year."
"This is achievable - if, on top of the pledges of the developing countries themselves, the European Union were to spend 15% of development aid on health care, including sexual and reproductive health."
"That is just where the shoe pinches, however."
"There has been a continuing decrease in Member States' investment in health care over recent years."
"The budgets for family planning have almost halved since 1994."
"Even in the European Development Fund scarcely 4% is spent on health care, compared to 30% on infrastructure and budget support."
"It is clearly time, therefore, that the Council's words and the Commission's promises were turned into clear projects, for example to link budget support to clear results with regard to Millennium Development Goal 5 and to saving women's lives in Africa."
"(NL) Mr President, I shall be frank: I find it hard to give a coherent speech here after hearing what was said by the gentlemen on that side of the House."
"This is something that particularly tugs at my heartstrings, including as a woman, as it also concerns me and the other women in this Chamber."
"After all, what we are talking about is not a medical problem, nor a financial one (although I am grateful for assurances concerning increased funding); it is a social problem."
"It is a problem concerning society's attitude towards women; a society that still regards women throughout the world as second-class citizens."
"To be frank, I find it incredible that these two Members can say what they said, knowing that this costs the lives of half a million women each year."
"It beggars belief."
"There is not one woman who wants an abortion - not one!"
"If faced with no other choice, however, she must at least be able to have it done safely and legally."
"This is a woman's right."
"Incidentally, I am delighted that this has the support of the Council of Europe."
"If we fail to recognise this right we are all just weeping crocodile tears here."
"I would therefore appeal to everyone in this House to vote in favour of the amendments condemning the United States' 'global gag rule' and also the Vatican's ban on condoms - I shall just come out and say it - as these two things are directly responsible for millions of deaths and must, I believe, be condemned by this House."
"Mr President, our policies on maternal health in the developing world are failing."
"We know that from today's debate because no progress has been made in reducing the horror of women who die during and at birth."
"In Ireland, if a woman dies in childbirth there is an outcry and a full medical investigation, because the situation is rare."
"I am grateful that is the case but it is still shocking."
"That one in sixteen die in childbirth in the developing world is a frightening statistic and, while we debate here in our comfort zones, there are pregnant women in Africa in villages who know that their lives are at risk and that they may not live to see their child born or indeed to nurture their other children."
"Maternal health is part of overall health, and that includes access to food, and the issue of food security is an important one."
"But can I address another issue which has not been raised here yet?"
"I thank the Commissioner for her comments on the need to train health-care workers."
"A huge number need to be trained but - let us be honest - the developed world is stealing trained workers from Africa to look after us here, both in the US and in the EU, and we need to be honest about this."
"We can afford to pay them and they want to come and work, but we are robbing those countries of their own people who have training."
"I would like you to perhaps address that in your closing remarks."
"There is pain, suffering and death involved in this issue we are debating here."
"I have mentioned the children who are left behind."
"In India, just before Christmas, as part of the India delegation, we witnessed a very useful project being funded by the EU, where women of the villages - because there are no trained doctors and nurses - are given some training to help with infant mortality."
"There has been great success in that very small-scale programme because it is working from the ground up."
"Perhaps we need to mirror that type of programme to address maternal deaths, while we know that we do need all of these very trained and skilled workers."
"Mr President, I am pleased that this Parliament is holding a debate on MDG 5 because, as I speak, at this very moment a woman is losing a life to give a life somewhere in the world."
"Shocking as this is, the progress on this MDG has been negligible, as we have heard, and it is the only MDG with no improvement - and in some regions it has worsened."
"Some would argue that this issue has had such little attention because it affects women, and because 99% of the deaths occur in the developing countries."
"This is one of the biggest social inequality issues in the world and I believe that the EU - whilst I recognise the Commissioner's personal commitment - has been very slow in addressing it."
"So I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what they are going to do to ensure there is increased funding to ensure that this budget line is not diminished."
"When you are looking at heading 4, where short-term crises and natural disasters tend to take precedence, we need to ensure that it is prioritised not only internally within the Union but also internationally."
"I would ask the Commission and the Member States to look at delivery of these programmes with renewed scrutiny to ensure that the eight programmes are not beset by poor quality of service, corruption and lack of accountability, which is why the programme has not progressed in some countries."
"Well-thought-out programmes are what is needed."
"As Ms McGuinness pointed out, we saw in India a project, with very little funding, for providing mobile phones and as little as two days' training for a link person who could recognise the danger signs in pregnancy and post-pregnancy, and this, combined with education, very basic-level personal hygiene and just the need to boil water, meant the difference between living or dying."
"So, in this year the UN has called the Year of Action for MDGs, we cannot be complacent for much longer and we must make sure that we take away the tragic divide between the rich and the poor world."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I enjoyed listening to you."
"Your diagnosis was correct and you put forward concrete measures."
"We need action plans, financial aid and assessment of the results."
"So more action and less speechifying!"
"We also need to make up for lost time, as thousands and thousands of women die in developing countries every year because of lack of information and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health."
"The statistics are not merely numbers, they are family tragedies, they are children who are left orphans, they are people who die who could have been saved."
"Does thinking about this, knowing that this is happening in the world, not keep us awake at night?"
"Sexual and reproductive health must be a priority."
"It is regrettable that some seek to bring sexual and reproductive health down to just abortion."
"However, it is important that abortion is legal and safe, as well as exceptional, as this is the only way to combat illegal abortion."
"All women on all continents have a right to access to sexual and reproductive health."
"Without the right to sexual and reproductive health, there is no gender equality."
"The Commission and the Council must take the appropriate measures."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the failure of the fifth MDG affects us all, in that it epitomises our failure to move forward with the emancipation of women all over the world."
"We agree that it should be made a major political objective because it also lies heavy on our consciences."
"However, we should also have the courage to say that thousands of women are also the victims of ignorance, neglect and misinformation."
"Neglect because the majority of the 500 000 cases of maternal mortality could be avoided through prevention and basic healthcare."
"Distributing impregnated mosquito nets, for example, could prevent fatal cases of malaria for thousands of women."
"Ignorance, in that all too often, girls and women are still prevented from gaining a basic education, which would simply enable them to read and understand simple health and hygiene recommendations."
"Lastly, misinformation: a certain conservative idea of religion and tradition, which still keeps women in a state of intolerable dependence, marriage when very young, pregnancies in close succession, and taboos over female contraception."
"Consequently we are taking action; networks of parliamentary representatives for the developing population, from Europe and Africa, are working together within the UNFPA."
"We are speaking out in favour of health, reproduction and women's control over their fertility and, in addition to the necessary financial support for this, we have to change attitudes and the position of women."
"This is a key political goal for the development of all these countries."
"(BG) I congratulate you on your opinion, Commissioner."
"There are many problems to which the problem of mothers' health belongs."
"On the one hand, this is the system of health care, on the other hand are the social systems, related to care for motherhood in general."
"The health, mental and physical condition of not only the mothers but the children as well depends on the manner in which these two systems are synchronized."
"In the third place, motherhood is indelibly related to the demographic problems of each country and it is generally known that this is a grave problem."
"Part of the problems of mothers' health are related to financing."
"The countries should be called upon to set aside sufficient funds, while those that cannot receive aid so that the death rate among new mothers and children could be reduced and the necessary prophylactics could be applied, for every life is a gift, and provisions should be made for a maximum number of health services and social services for women."
"The protection of motherhood also depends on the remuneration of the medical staff in maternity wards."
"This is a problem which exists in many countries, including in European Union countries, and one that has to be resolved."
"(LT) The European Parliament has begun discussions on the Commission's incentive to attract highly qualified specialists from third countries to the EU labour market - the so-called Blue Card."
"The Member States are asked not to drain skilled workers from the sensitive sectors of developing countries - education and healthcare - although some Member States, including the UK, are not prepared to do this."
"Talk about giving with one hand and taking away with the other!"
"If we drain specialists from the healthcare sector, short-staffed as it is, women's health, the health of all members of society in general, will be endangered and in an even worse state."
"I would like to suggest that we ensure that the legal acts we are adopting do not contradict each other and that our policies are consistent with our principles."
"Mr President, I intervene in this debate first of all to thank the Council for its June action plan, but more particularly to welcome the very forthright statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"It is shocking and scandalous that this Millennium Development Goal is failing and that we have made no progress since 2000 and no progress over the last 20 years."
"Millions of women have died and tens of millions of children have been orphaned needlessly."
"We know what is causing the deaths and we know how to prevent the deaths."
"We have the resources, and indeed the knowledge to prevent them, and yet it is not happening."
"Why?"
"Why are we failing?"
"It seems to me that we are allowing the conscientious objectors to block progress on these issues."
"We have to push past the conscientious objectors - those who reduce this issue constantly to the issue of abortion and the provision of condoms."
"Why anyone should see a condom as some kind of evil instrument boggles the mind and boggles reason!"
"I would urge those who are in a position to make decisions, and to pursue decisions, to ignore the conscientious objectors and get on with it."
"Mr President, just a little reflection on this issue that has political, psychological, physical and moral aspects and so is very complicated."
"When Mrs Kinnock says that this side does not like even the term 'service', I would object."
"There are so many 'services' but among them there is one which is very controversial: abortion."
"I think the side to my right wants to cover it with some very beautiful semantics, using terms like 'reproductive health'."
"I think you know the position of most of that side of the House, but there are so many other 'services' that you want to approve, use and support as much as is financially possible, and this will, I hope, diminish the ratio of deaths at those different moments that we discussed today."
"So this accusation is not very proper, although we know there are some moral problems related to just one 'service'."
"Mr President, I think the fact that a woman a minute dies giving birth - one of the most natural things in the world, as the Commissioner described - is shocking and scandalous."
"Equally, the fact that we are failing to meet this Millennium Development Goal, and failing the most vulnerable women and children in our world, is also shaming."
"I would like to ask both the French presidency and the Commission to report back to the House what is decided upon in New York at the end of this month, and that they will personally make it a priority over the next weeks to secure change, not just at Member State level, but at international level, to put this higher on the political agenda."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to go over again what the Commissioner said with so much emotion, though I fully share her convictions regarding the scandal facing us."
"For this reason, the Council has developed an action programme."
"It is late in the day for it to be getting involved, it is true, but this programme is ambitious."
"I am not going to go over it again."
"The Presidency, where it is concerned, will give priority to the promotion and defence of women's rights, to be very clear about this."
"Our programme includes, in particular, the preparation of guidelines for combating violence against women, which will be used as actions for the European Union in international settings and, at the end of this month, in high level meetings at the United Nations on Africa's development needs within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals."
"We also have the initiative on women and armed conflicts, aimed at taking better account of the specific situation of women in places where the European Union is implementing external security and defence policies, taking the initiative, as the Presidency, of a new resolution in the United Nations General Assembly with the Netherlands on violence against women."
"Since I have mentioned our national position, although I am here to represent the Council, I should say that all the Member States are welcome to be associated with this resolution within the United Nations framework."
"Finally, in December 2008 there will be a forum for non-governmental organisations on the situation of women."
"As regards maternal health and everything you have said, I can only share the commitment and indignation of those who have spoken, particularly as regards the links with the HIV virus, and say that the EU is going to finance the Global Fund to fight AIDS to the tune of EUR 91 million in 2007, as the leading donor to this fund for that year."
"As regards the comments made by Mrs Kinnock who, as a committed European, can surely not be confusing the Council Presidency with a nation state - or else she is not who I think she is - I would like to say that as regards the European Union's budgetary commitments, the amounts given by France are going to increase in 2008."
"To be precise, the amount allocated to health grew between 2006 and 2008, from EUR 820 million to EUR 930 million."
"I do not think this is the place for us to fight our usual battles."
"On a more personal note, having heard your debate, I must say that the Presidency will be looking very carefully at the proposal made by Mrs Buitenweg, which she has submitted to me."
"For the Presidency, I would very much like the fight against poverty to go hand in hand with improving the situation of women and respect for women's rights, everywhere."
"I would very much like there to be intervention when women's health is systematically under threat, and I would like us to have the necessary resources, all the necessary resources, under legal and safe conditions, to bring this scandal to an end; consequently, we cannot refuse to provide any of these resources, regardless of our convictions."
"We need to forge ahead if we are to bring to an end what is truly a scandal as regards the situation of women, particularly in the poorest countries."
"Consequently we need to reach agreement, I repeat, regardless of our convictions."
"For its part, the Presidency has decided to take action itself, particularly in Africa, using all the resources at its disposal."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we have heard some very important statements."
"This is an emotional question on which there are different points of views."
"I believe we should go back to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo, which clearly indicates respect for national legal frameworks."
"We in any case reject coercive abortion, forced sterilisation, infanticide and other human rights abuses, which are clearly not in line with that policy."
"At the same time, it is also very important to understand that childbirth is not without its complications."
"As Mrs Buitenweg said, it is a luxury in our countries, but the luxury is not there in other countries."
"The principle of voluntary choice should therefore guide this programme of action, which seeks to provide universal access to a full range of safe and reliable family-planning methods - which, of course, is the priority - and to reproductive health services which are not against the law."
"The aim should be to assist individuals and couples in making their own choices and achieving their reproductive goals, giving them the full opportunity to exercise the right to have children by their own choice."
"That is what we have to achieve."
"In no case will abortion be promoted as a method of family planning."
"Governments are committed to dealing with the health impact of unsafe abortions as a public health concern - because they happen and we have heard how many are women are dying from them - and to reducing the recourse to abortion through improved family planning services."
"When abortion is not against the law, it should be safe and part of a comprehensive reproductive health service."
"That is most important."
"On the other hand, it is true that health-care systems should be better, as they are weak, and we are now looking at strengthening those systems by training more health-care personnel and through a system of health insurance, which is an initiative of the French presidency."
"It is true that much money has gone, for instance, into combating HIV/AIDS in recent years, but unfortunately ever more women are becoming HIV/AIDS-infected in Africa: one out of four girls aged between 16 and 24 are now HIV positive."
"That is awful."
"The Commission is aware of this, and is encouraging initiatives through the Global Fund to be more geared to women and to be more gender sensitive."
"Finally, on the question of migration, this could go in the wrong direction."
"This so-called 'brain drain' is one of the issues that will have to be tackled when addressing migration as a whole."
"It has both positive and negative sides and we have to find the right balance."
"I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The EU has committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, such as reducing the maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015."
"Although, on the whole, the EU countries are on the right path, slow progress is recorded in the field of maternal health."
"The European Commission's initiatives to allocate funds for the health systems reform in order to improve the quality of prenatal and postnatal services, as well as of the access to such services, the support of research in the field of reproductive medicine and the training of medical personnel were opportune for achieving goal No. 5."
"The Charter on enhancing the performance of health systems, adopted in Tallinn, in June 2008, is also important progress."
"Nevertheless, there are developed countries, such as France, Great Britain or the Netherlands, with a very low mortality rate, for which the 75% reduction by 2015 seems difficult, since evolution is slower than in the countries with a higher maternal mortality rate."
"Also, there are still disparities as regards the progress made in the EU states and even in the regions of various countries."
"Therefore, in order to manage to achieve the goal set for 2015, the rapid modernisation of the European health systems is necessary, with a special emphasis on research for improving prenatal and postnatal services, as well as more efficient sanitary education and family planning."
"in writing. - (RO) The European Union is a firm supporter of the Millennium Development Goals adopted by the United Nations and which established the targets to be achieved by 2015 as regards peace, security, development, governance and human rights."
"Out of the 8 goals, special attention should be given to the improvement of maternal health, since over half a million women, mostly from Africa and Asia, die during pregnancy or childbirth."
"The main cause leading to the increase in mortality rate at world level is the absence of qualified personnel to provide maternal assistance both during pregnancy and delivery."
"This situation must be remedied by investing important funds in the underdeveloped countries, both in training specialized personnel and in medical equipment."
"The targets for Romania, as regards the improvement of maternal health, are the reduction of mortality rate to 10 maternal deaths/100,000 births by 2015 and ensuring universal access to health services."
"At present, Romania has negative natural growth, with a mortality rate of 12%."
"By social assistance and information programmes, mother and child services, as well as additional financial support from the EU, the birth rate needs to resume its ascending trend and Romania to remain in the European Union's demographic strategy."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0457/2008)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Commission."
"Part One"
"Subject: Food crises in the EU and protection of European consumers"
"Following the repeated food crises in Europe, has the Commission decided on specific measures to provide effective consumer protection?"
"Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Arnaoutakis for his question on the ever topical issue of food safety."
"The Commission has many ways of ensuring that consumers and European citizens are protected against a possible food crisis."
"Firstly, the Commission ensures that the competent authorities in all 27 Member States are promptly and simultaneously warned via the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF)."
"Secondly, the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out systematic inspections in the Member States and in third countries."
"Thirdly, the Commission carefully examines all information received from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the international media or other sources."
"Where necessary, and especially when food or feed might seriously threaten public health and that risk cannot be dealt with effectively at Member State level, the Commission takes the necessary measures at EU level."
"For example, in the case of the Ukrainian sunflower oil contaminated with mineral oil, the RASFF received notification from the competent French authorities on 23 April 2008, which was received by all the Member States."
"The Commission, through the RASFF, at once notified the other Member States of this incident, and on 10 June 2008 it issued Decision 2008/433/EC imposing special conditions governing the import of sunflower oil originating in or consigned from Ukraine due to contamination risks by mineral oil."
"Investigations were also launched to locate the source of the contamination."
"In addition, the traceability system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, better known as the General Food Law Regulation, makes it possible to carry out targeted, accurate product withdrawals or recalls, to supply adequate information to consumers and food business operators, and to evaluate the risks and avoid unnecessary disruption to trade."
"The Commission also systematically checks the ability of the Member States' competent inspection authorities to ensure compliance with food legislation, both within and outside the EU."
"In Malaysia, for example, the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office identified significant problems in relation to compliance with the requirements for the export of fish products."
"In the EU, the Commission reacted immediately, prohibiting the import of fish from Malaysia."
"This is just one of many examples of how the Commission effectively manages to protect the consumer and prevent a food crisis."
"The Commission therefore believes its existing legislation provides the necessary mechanisms for effective management of food crises and effective consumer protection."
"At the same time, however, we are taking care to ensure a steady improvement in the channels of communication and cooperation with the Member States for this purpose."
"For example, we are providing new guidelines on using the RASFF, which the Commission is to adopt shortly."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your report."
"Let me say that what European consumers are now experiencing is a loss of confidence."
"Their confidence has been shaken."
"We therefore need to see, from the Commission's side, what actions need to be taken to inform consumers."
"Indeed, you may very rightly be doing everything you said you would do, and deserve congratulations."
"However, in Greece, for example, we had the Ukrainian sunflower oil, some of which was consumed by half the Greek population."
"How can the consumer be protected, and what actions do you intend to take?"
"Let me point out that the increasing stir this issue is causing and the warnings given through the RASFF prove that the system is really working."
"In the case of Greece and the Ukrainian sunflower oil, a general warning was indeed issued 23 April 2008 that this contaminated sunflower oil was on the EU market."
"On 5 May 2008, when the Swiss authorities issued a specific warning to our centre here that this sunflower oil was on its way to Greece, Italy and Turkey, among other places, the Greek authorities made the necessary investigations and began to give us the information and withdraw the products."
"I wish to stress, however, that we should not confuse the measures the European Commission has the authority to take, and is taking, with the obligations of the Member States, as these are internal affairs."
"Of course, you will ask me whether any checks are carried out."
"Yes, they are."
"The FVO service, which makes periodic visits to various Member States, checks that the departments are operating, identifies any shortcomings and points them out to the Member States."
"Naturally, this happens both in Greece and in other countries."
"Commissioner, the EU has done a great job in its farm-to-fork system, and consumers should have confidence in it but, as an ancillary point, what about protecting EU producers?"
"I do not believe that we put the same rigour on imported food products as we do internally."
"For example, we allow substances to be used externally that we ban within the European Union, and with the new plant protection products legislation we are going to do that increasingly in cereal production."
"Could I ask you, Commissioner, to address that particular concern, because we might be consuming food in Europe that you could not actually produce in the European Union?"
"(LT) I would like to ask: what is a food crisis?"
"Could the appearance of an unsafe food product on the EU market be considered a food crisis?"
"In that case, we could be talking about a toy crisis, as toys not complying with safety requirements are known to be sold, as well as a whole range of other unsafe products."
"How can we define a food crisis?"
"Could it be defined as relentlessly increasing food prices that affect all consumers?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, because Mr Tajani has been held up by a Council of Ministers meeting, I am happy to respond to Mrs Raeva, particularly because the subject to which her question relates is a matter I have had very much to do with personally and which I hold very close to my heart."
"In 2001 the European Union set itself the target of halving the number of road accident victims by 2010."
"This target was recognised by the European Parliament and by the Council."
"In 2003 it was the subject of a European Road Safety Action Programme, which defined 60 measures aimed at encouraging road users to behave more sensibly, using technical advances to make vehicles safer, improving road infrastructure, making commercial transport safer, improving the treatment of victims and developing the analysis of accident data."
"To monitor changes in the road safety situation, a number of performance indicators were set up by the Commission: the number of victims per million inhabitants; the rate of seat belt and helmet use; the number and percentage of people under the influence of alcohol involved in road accidents; the number and percentage of people exceeding the speed limit."
"In the area of Community legislation, I should mention the new directive on the driving licence, adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 20 December 2006."
"This directive was to improve road safety for young road users and the free movement of citizens within the European Union."
"We also have a directive on the safety of road infrastructure, adopted after agreement at first reading in June 2008."
"Then we have the proposal for a directive on controlling traffic offences, submitted by the Commission in 2008 and currently under negotiation in the European Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission is also trying to encourage the exchange of road safety best practices as much as possible between Member States."
"As part of the call for proposals it is participating in funding road safety campaigns and innovative projects in this area, which include several Member States."
"Similarly, the Commission is giving financial support to the research plan for projects likely to improve knowledge in specific areas and to give rise to future legislative proposals on reliable scientific bases."
"The DRUID project (Driving under the influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines) is one example of this, while the fight against driving under the influence of psychoactive substances is becoming a priority in new Member States."
"Finally, Mrs Raeva, a new European action programme is currently in preparation for the period 2010-2020."
"This action programme will be the subject of a public consultation at the start of 2009 and will then go through the process of adoption by the Commission."
"This was the information that Mr Tajani wanted to provide in response to your question."
"author. - (BG) Commissioner, I am extremely happy to congratulate you for the efforts you have made to date in your recent capacity as Commissioner responsible for transport in the European Union, one that you have made in the last few years."
"Also, thank you very much for the presentation of the summary in respect to the Common European Policy for road safety."
"It is precisely in this direction that I would like to ask: "" At the existence of indicators, at the definite existence of a very serious initiative on the part of the European Commission concerning road safety in Europe, how is control of the execution of these indicators provided and in what way is it truly guaranteed that we in Europe will have a reduction of fatal cases by at least 50%?"""
"Because for a country like Bulgaria this indicator is too high."
"We in Europe definitely need sanctions in case of violation of these requirements."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, honourable Member, the supervision, controls and penalties for offences obviously lie within the competence of the Member States."
"However, I would just like to remind you that on 21 October 2003 the Commission adopted a recommendation on enforcement in the field of road safety, which defines best practices for controlling traffic offences, and I would particularly like to mention that we have an opportunity, with the European Road Safety Day, to assess each Member State."
"This assessment highlights the record of some Member States and the weaknesses of others."
"I believe European Road Safety Day is an excellent way of really shedding light on the performance of the different Member States."
"It is true, and you are right to point it out, we have not achieved the performances we had hoped for."
"We have many concerns about the target, which was to halve the number of victims by 2010."
"It may be that in the next multi-year programme, which will cover a 10-year period, we can further increase the constraints on Member States."
"I would also like to take the opportunity, Mr President, to remind you of how much importance we are attaching to the vote on the directive, which will enable offences committed by motorists in a Member State other than their own to be punished."
"Impunity for drivers who do not obey the rules when they are in a Member State other than their own is currently too great, and I think this will be a good way of making European citizens behave better on the road."
"Thank you for asking this question."
"I know my successor, Mr Tajani, is also very committed to the issue of road safety, and I can tell you that all your suggestions and action will help us to bring an end to this terrible scourge."
"As the author is not present, Question No 37 lapses."
"Part Two"
"Subject: Information and education for young consumers"
"It is a fact that young and adolescent consumers account for a significant part of the markets in goods and services."
"Young consumers are bombarded by, frequently misleading, publicity campaigns promoting school articles, games, clothes, food, drinks, audiovisual material, etc."
"Apart from the Europa Diary, which is already in operation, does the Commission intend to devise a pan-European campaign to inform and educate young people of consumer age about matters which concern them and what methods and means will it use to organise such an initiative?"
"With particular regard to the Consumer Scoreboard, what methods will the Commission use to process the data obtained concerning young people of consumer age and how will the relevant information reach them?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the concerns expressed by the honourable Member and would like to draw his attention to the fact that existing Community laws on consumer rights already offer considerable protection of young people."
"For example, the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices (UCP) aims at protecting consumers, including young people, from practices that harm their economic interests, such as misleading advertising or aggressive practices."
"Vulnerable consumers, among others younger citizens, are specifically taken into account when assessing unfair commercial practices."
"The Directive also includes a black list of commercial practices which are prohibited in all circumstances across the EU."
"For example, the inclusion in an advertisement of a direct exhortation to children to buy products is banned across the European Union."
"The Commission will launch a communication web campaign on the UCP Directive in September 2008."
"This is quite a new directive and will also target young people."
"The campaign will make use of a dedicated website, including animations, illustrations and quizzes, in order to explain UCP rules in a more interesting and interactive way."
"To attract consumers' attention, banners and fake advertisements will be disseminated in several key consumer websites."
"There will be portals for specific categories of consumer, such as young people, virtual communities, music websites and blogs."
"The information will be circulated on the internet over a period of one month and, although it is difficult to predict for how long this data will be hosted by the partner websites, we expect the information to be available on the web for at least a few months."
"The UCP dedicated website which is being created will be accessible to consumers for an indeterminate duration."
"For the time being, the Commission has no intention of launching a special pan-European campaign to inform and educate young consumers."
"However, besides the Europe Diary, it is also developing a web-based consumer education tool called Dolceta which contains a teaching module aimed at primary and secondary teachers."
"As regards the consumer scoreboard, at the current stage our data do not distinguish between different groups of consumers."
"It is not possible for the scoreboard to address in detail all markets or all different types of consumer."
"However, where we have specific data covering younger consumers, for example students, such as Eurobarometer surveys, we will publish the data for this group."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your full and detailed answer."
"How very reassuring and gratifying that this campaign is being launched online, now, in this month of September."
"Let me just ask a supplementary question: is the Commission thinking of prohibiting television commercials directed at children, as has happened in some Member States, where certain children's television advertisements are forbidden until after a certain time - 10 or 11 p.m., I think - before which children watch television?"
"Member of the Commission. - This information is well known in my DG as well, but actually this falls rather more within the scope of my fellow Commissioner, Viviane Reding, because it is also related to the freedom of information which comes very broadly within the scope of the activities of her DG."
"What I can tell you is that we have the TV Without Borders Directive, which tackles such issues, and we have our black list in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive."
"The reason why we have such a tool as a black list is that, if there is a need, and if we have enough evidence, we can add a practice to the black list when we agree that it is something which we need to target and ban all over Europe."
"Of course, such action needs to be evidence-based."
"So we are fully aware of the problem."
"It is not directly part of Unfair Commercial Practices (UCP) but we are ready to look at it if there is a practice which we could consider as meriting inclusion on a black or grey list, and Commissioner Reding is doing her best to be certain that the TV Without Borders Directive is tackling issues like these."
"(LT) 55% of food advertisements on TV market unhealthy food products."
"80% of kids ask their parents for exactly the same brands of food for breakfast that they have seen in TV advertisements."
"My question would be: should the European Union shift its focus from advertisements, which are commissioned by manufacturers?"
"Could we find a way of encouraging their manufacturers to produce and subsequently advertise healthier food products?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission does not have the power to set prices or define the quality of educational products."
"Otherwise, I really find the question quite relevant."
"However, consumers are protected under EU laws against misleading or aggressive practice when they purchase educational products."
"Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which I have just talked about, traders must not mislead consumers with false or deceptive information as regards, for example, the benefits of a product, the results to be expected from its use, or the results of tests or checks carried out."
"The Directive also includes a black list of practices prohibited in all circumstances: claiming that a product has been approved or endorsed by a public or private body (such as, for example, stating that an educational book has been approved by the ministry of education when this is not the case) is banned outright across the EU."
"Furthermore, traders must provide consumers with all the information they need in order to make an informed choice."
"The Commission has, for example, received a complaint relating to courses to be purchased on an English-speaking website, which were then delivered in another language."
"Omitting to inform the consumer of the language used for the courses can be considered a misleading practice."
"It is, however, up to the national authorities and courts in charge of enforcement of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive to determine, subject to the free movement principles enshrined in the EC Treaty, what information is material on a case-by-case basis, in line with European law."
"I thank the Commissioner for her answer."
"Price distortion in relation to product quality is a matter of concern to the consumer."
"I am not talking about setting the price, but about defining the relationship between price and product on the basis of competition, and also the transportation of educational products from one Member State to another, and cross-border consumer protection."
"Do you have any information on cross-border protection when educational products are transferred from one Member State to another?"
"Member of the Commission. - Concerning cross-border problems with teaching materials, we have European Consumer Centres whose work is based on consumer cooperation regulation and which are good ambassadors for consumer rights all over Europe."
"In the event of a cross-border disagreement between a consumer and the provider of an educational service, book or material, the consumer can approach a Consumer Centre."
"If the consumer cannot solve the issue directly, the Consumer Centre in his country can help him get a satisfactory solution in the country of origin of the educational services or material."
"I do not have with me a full record of all the different experiences and cases in the various Member States, but can tell you that these European Consumer Centres meet together several times per year."
"It is already a very enhanced and good network, and most of the Centres are very active and able to solve the issues raised by consumers."
"Since the question referred to the education sector, the Centres could be asked for information on how they have solved such issues."
"However, the basic principle is the same, and this regulation is functioning really well."
"(DE) I would be interested to know how things actually look with regard to online learning."
"With regard to complaints, would it be possible for the Commission to set up a homepage showing which institutions offering distance learning are associated with problems so that there is greater transparency here?"
"(DE) Time and again we have the problem where very many people in Europe are asking the question: where is European value added?"
"Now, the European Union is admittedly not responsible for educational issues, but we are responsible for quality assurance and consumer protection issues."
"On this we are also agreed."
"Would it not be possible for schools and perhaps even the low levels of education to be very consciously addressed here as recipients in the context of the Commission's general information activity?"
"With projects and competitions we can show how Europe provides European value added here."
"We could perhaps - and in connection with the previous question - thus bring this subject to the attention of the very young."
"Member of the Commission. - This is about the internet, which is a very important issue."
"The internet presents an enormous opportunity for consumers."
"It gives them access to better information and expands the size of the market they operate in, giving them access to more providers and more choice."
"Already, 150 million EU citizens - a third of our population - shop over the internet."
"The rapid growth in the number of EU citizens buying online is not matched by the growth in the number of those who do so cross-border, however."
"This shows that the Commission is right in addressing the issue, which is linked to consumer confidence with a range of information measures."
"The online digital user's guide, which is being prepared by the Commission, has to be mentioned."
"It will be published online by the end of 2008."
"As a follow-up to the guide, one could consider drawing up guidelines on how to implement the unfair commercial practices legislation with regard to unfair commercial practices emerging online."
"Another tool about which we have already talked is Dolceta, which is geared towards educating consumers, for example on distance selling and consumer redress."
"Educating young consumers who are particularly active online is crucial."
"The Consumer Diary, with a record distribution of 2.8 million copies (and this information might also be interesting for Mr Angelakas) in more than 18 000 schools this year, includes information on internet use and cross-border redress."
"The Consumer Policy Strategy 2007-2013 foresees actions related to consumer information as part of its priority - better informed and educated consumers."
"The main tools the European Commission uses to inform citizens and stakeholders about consumer policy in this framework are a website, the Consumer Voice newsletter and information campaigns."
"The letter contains e-commerce as a major campaign theme in several newer Member States."
"Concerning the second question, which concerns enforcement and redress, the Commission strongly believes that, in order to make the internal market work, European consumers must be confident that they can enforce their rights and obtain redress across the European Union."
"Complaints relating to e-commerce, including complaints regarding non-delivery of products or delivery of unsatisfactory products, may be addressed under the current EU redress framework that we have already set up for European consumers."
"This framework includes the ECC-net, the two Commission recommendations on alternative dispute resolution, the recently adopted Mediation Directive, and the regulation establishing a European small claims procedure."
"The Commission is also in the process of considering whether an EU initiative on consumer collective redress is necessary and, if so, what type of initiative that should be."
"I am fully convinced that the screen is a new marketplace."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, you have already partly answered the question I was going to ask, about the problems experienced when buying."
"The procedures are long, complicated and costly."
"The damage suffered is particularly great in that it often affects the most disadvantaged among us."
"Given that there is a legal void, do you think that European consumer centres have the means to engage in these procedures, collectively perhaps, but also individually, instead of the injured consumers?"
"(DE) It is simply a matter of our being concerned with future possibilities for publicising complaints transparently."
"If cross-border operations are repeated, the courts and prosecution services also gain access."
"Do you believe that it is possible to set up a database here?"
"(LT) Commissioner, in your speech you have very persuasively referred to the expansion of e-commerce and I am quite sure that this expansion is happening much quicker in the older EU states."
"I would like to ask what is being done to encourage e-commerce within the Member States that joined the European Union in the 21st century, how consumer rights are being protected and what measures are being developed to level off that proportion."
"One more thing, regarding abuse: are cases of abuse more frequent in the older Member States or the new ones?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank the honourable Member for his positive comments about the internal market scoreboard."
"I agree that the scoreboard results need to be widely communicated."
"All editions of the scoreboard are available on the Europa website."
"Paper versions were sent to the permanent representations of the Member States and to the Commission representation offices in the capitals of the 27 Member States."
"In addition, copies were circulated to other EU institutions as well as the national administrations."
"Following the publication of each scoreboard, a press release is issued in 21 languages and the results are communicated during a press conference to ensure that they are easily accessible to the national media."
"author. - Thank you, Commissioner, for dealing with this question."
"I welcome the work that has been done in this area, which relates to the whole issue of the perception of the European Union in Member States."
"In Ireland we had a particular problem during the debate on the Lisbon Treaty since, whenever something negative arises, we tend to blame the European Union."
"Can I just raise one typical example of an area in which we have no comeback: that of a Member State failing to act on a European Union directive."
"In Wicklow, in my own area of Cromane, there was a case about eight years ago where funding was made available, under a directive, from Europe to the Irish Government, but no action was taken, and as a result 50 families are now not able to carry out their normal work of mussel harvesting."
"The local papers blamed the European Union."
"We have no redress..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Member of the Commission. - Users of debit and credit cards in border areas can face three categories of charges associated with card payments."
"These are: usual charges related to the use of cards independently of the geographic location or Member State; charges for currency conversion if the payment is made between Member States using different currencies, for example the euro and sterling; and third, charges at the point of sale of a cash withdrawal at an ATM."
"Looking at the first category, i.e. the normal charges for card users, regulated at European level as far as payment in euros are concerned: according to Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 on cross-border payments in euro, when a cross-border payment in euro is made between two Member States, the charges levied for such payment should be the same as the charges for a corresponding payment in euro within the Member State in which the card was issued."
"At the same time, payments by cards linked to non-euro accounts, for example sterling accounts, are not subject to this regulation."
"When a euro payment is made between a euro-area Member State, such as Ireland, and a non-euro-area Member State, such as the United Kingdom, supplementary charges may be applied for the currency conversion for payments by cards."
"The Payment Services Directive regulates the conditions under which the currency conversion shall be offered."
"However, it is yet to be implemented by Member States."
"Finally, card payments can also be subject to a surcharge at the point of sale or to an additional withdrawal fee at privately-owned ATMs."
"The issue of surcharging or offering a discount on a given payment instrument is, according to European legislation, left to the discretion of the merchant."
"At the same time nothing impedes the Member States from banning or limiting such surcharges."
"This is explicitly confirmed in the already mentioned Directive on payment services in the internal market."
"The Commission has therefore no legal basis for intervention in the matter of supplementary charges on cross-border payment services in the UK and Ireland."
"However, the Commission believes that competition on both sides of the border will keep costs at a reasonable level."
"If market players would reduce or limit competition, the competent national authorities shall intervene in the best interests of the citizens."
"author. - Like myself, the Commissioner is totally au fait with the Irish situation, where 18 000 workers cross the border every day from one jurisdiction to another and where 5 200 students and 1.7 million people either take holidays or go shopping from one side of the border to the other."
"I know the Commissioner has said that it is up to national governments and that the banks are not subject to Regulation (EC) No 2560/01, but surely it should be possibly to introduce regulations to ban these surcharges."
"We had a very good example where your colleague, Commissioner Vivien Reding, Commissioner for Information and Media, took a very tough stand with the mobile phone companies - and we can see the result to the benefit of the consumer."
"It seems wrong that this should be allowed to continue, particularly when there are sister banks on both sides of the border."
"Member of the Commission. - I should firstly like to underline that the protection of the interests of minority shareholders in listed companies is one of the key objectives of the Community rules on takeover bids."
"In the event of a change of control in a listed company, all shareholders should be afforded equivalent treatment and minority shareholders should be protected."
"The Commission is very much attached to this fundamental principle."
"Minority shareholders in state-owned companies which are listed are entitled to exactly the same rights as minority shareholders in companies owned by private parties."
"This principle normally implies that persons acquiring control of a listed company should launch a mandatory bid over the capital held by minority shareholders."
"However, the Community rules allow Member States to derogate from the mandatory-bid rule in order to take account of circumstances determined at national level."
"Greece has made use of this discretion."
"Its national law foresees that the mandatory-bid rule should not be applicable in certain situations."
"This includes, in particular, the case where the privatisation process of a company is ongoing."
"This exemption is general in nature but, as usual, the devil is in the detail."
"The Commission does not challenge the fact that the Greek national telecommunications operator, OTE, about which the honourable Member is enquiring, was a state-owned company."
"Although the state held only 28% of the company, the company was fully controlled by the Government."
"The real question at issue here is: how long can a privatisation process be ongoing?"
"In the case of OTE, the privatisation procedure appears to be long."
"In fact, it seems to be very long indeed."
"The process, which is apparently still ongoing, started 12 years ago."
"How long can a company be kept out of the scope of application of the mandatory-bid rule of the Takeover Bid Directive?"
"The Greek supervisor, the Hellenic Capital Market Commission, has decided that OTE is still undergoing a privatisation process and that, in consequence, no mandatory bid was necessary."
"In conclusion, when Member States derogate from the mandatory-bid rule, they must nevertheless respect the general principle of protection of minority shareholders and ensure that they benefit from a treatment equivalent to that of majority shareholders."
"I have yet to see how the Greek authorities will ensure such protection in the present case."
"Therefore I have asked my services to enquire whether such protection has been achieved and to examine whether the rules of the Takeover Bid Directive have been respected by the Greek authorities in this case."
"Commissioner, this is precisely the problem."
"I cannot understand what you have been looking for all these months."
"The Greek authorities are contravening Articles 3 and 5 of Directive 25/2004/EC; they reject equal treatment and public tendering on the laughable grounds that a company, OTE (the Hellenic Telecommunication Organisation), in which the state has a 28% holding, is a state-owned enterprise."
"Will the Commission continue to break the law, contravening the directive on equal treatment and protection of small shareholders?"
"Perhaps, Commissioner McCreevy, you have not read Directive 25/2004/EC, just as you did not read the Lisbon Treaty."
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission adopted a report on the first year of implementation of the Black Sea Synergy on 19 June 2008."
"This describes the accomplishments in a wide variety of sectors and formulates proposals to develop the Synergy into a regional cooperation process."
"The latter include the setting of long-term measurable objectives, and also the selection of lead countries' or organisations to coordinate actions to meet those objectives, and the creation of sectoral partnerships to co-finance the necessary projects."
"As the Commission stated earlier, bilateral policies applied in the region - mainly the European neighbourhood polices - provide the strategic framework, and the Black Sea Synergy complements them at a regional level."
"Neighbourhood policy is at the bilateral level, and this is the first regional complement."
"The sectors mentioned in your question are high on the Commission's agenda."
"These are proposals to establish Black Sea partnerships in several fields, including transport and the environment, and Member States present in the region are particularly active in promoting those initiatives."
"The coordination between the Commission and the three Member States has been reinforced both in developing the Synergy and in working with the Organisation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)."
"Further progress of the Synergy requires the active involvement of a growing number of Member States and Black Sea partners, and the Black Sea Member States can and do play a crucial role in this."
"Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"Black Sea Synergy does indeed bear your personal stamp, but you are also aware that the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) is now a mature institutional structure for regional organisation; its cooperation is indeed intensifying and broadening."
"This is especially so because Europe and Asia meet here, and they do so at many levels."
"I should like to know one thing: beyond this Black Sea Synergy initiative, does the Commission intend to plan the structure of inter-regional relations between the EU and Black Sea countries within a stricter institutional framework, so that an institutionally safeguarded form of inter-regional cooperation emerges?"
"Member of the Commission. - I would agree that EU election observation missions (EOMs) everywhere in the world represent money well spent."
"Over the past eight years EU observers have been reporting on crucial elections, thereby contributing to reducing conflict over the electoral outcome or highlighting areas requiring urgent electoral and political reform."
"As such, these are achievements which have an impact in the longer run."
"The European Union is now widely seen as one of the most credible international election observers."
"I know Mr Evans himself has just come back very recently from the Sri Lanka elections."
"I think he will also have his own ideas on what worked well, and maybe on what has to be done for the future."
"The Commission will therefore continue to prioritise the EU EOMs, and as long as I am there I will try to do that."
"Having said that, however, election observations are not and cannot be actions standing on their own."
"Election observation is not an objective in itself but should also contribute to addressing deficiencies in the electoral framework, and also to triggering institutional and democratic reform in the longer run."
"The reports of the EOMs are a key entry point for addressing deficiencies in the electoral framework."
"They have a long-term perspective by definition."
"The recommendations of the EOMs usually identify possibilities for electoral change, for instance in the regulatory framework or in the management of the elections."
"They are increasingly embedded in a broader electoral support strategy, thereby enhancing the long-term impact."
"With reference to other recent EOMs, I can confirm that, for instance in Rwanda, in Cambodia or in Yemen, we have been giving support to the respective electoral commissions."
"These projects resulted, then, directly from previous EU EOMs, which had identified a number of deficiencies in the electoral framework."
"But, in the same context, over the past years the Commission has also substantially increased the financial contributions for electoral assistance, thus building on the recommendations of the EU EOMs."
"This is now EUR 400 million since 2000, so this is quite a good amount."
"A lot of valuable work setting the stage for electoral reform in follow-up to an EU EOM is also done by delegations of the European Commission in the country, and of course by the chief observers when they return to the country to present their final report."
"Finally, as electoral reform is often very political in nature, it does not always happen very easily, and requires different actors and continuous involvement."
"I believe that, in addition to the chief observer, Parliament can play and very often does play a relevant role addressing electoral reform in the follow-up to the EOM."
"I would therefore encourage the regular EP delegations to a country to get more involved in the matter as well, by then addressing deficiencies in the electoral framework in a context of broader institutional and democratic change."
"This has been the content of a first seminar between the Commission and Parliament and there will be another one later this year, I think it will be in December, between Commission and Parliament."
"author. - I thank the Commissioner, and agree with her that the election observations are some of the most useful work that the European Union does."
"It is high-profile work in those countries, and almost without exception it is money well spent."
"I have been very proud to go on a number of election observation missions over the years, most recently in Pakistan."
"I was actually in Sri Lanka for a delegation visit."
"But I wonder if I can push the Commissioner slightly on one point: during the four or perhaps five years between one election observation mission and the next, does the EU actually offer specific help and suggestions to address any deficiencies or areas where we think that there may be a need to improve and that we can offer ideas, support and perhaps finance to make sure that countries do not repeat in one election the errors they may have made before?"
"Mr President, I would also like to agree with Mr Evans on the value of election observation missions."
"I too was honoured to be appointed by the Commissioner as the chief observer in the recent elections in Cambodia."
"I thought that the missions - as do all of the election observation missions - proved a very useful aid to the Cambodian authorities in the conducting of their election missions."
"My request to the Commissioner is that she look to the resources that she has available to do even more of these missions in the future, if possible, because I also agree that they are an extremely valuable, attention-raising measure."
"They are highly valued by the countries where they take place and also by the heads of state in the various missions."
"Member of the Commission. - I believe the honourable Member is referring to the delay in the monthly transfer of customs revenues which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority."
"The last delay dates back to the month of June, and it followed almost immediately the sending of a letter by Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad in which he objected to the ongoing discussions on the further development of relations between the EU and Israel."
"At the time, the delay in transferring tax and customs revenues was raised at the highest levels, and I myself also raised this question with the Foreign Minister."
"I asked Israel to execute the payment which was due to the Palestinians and, finally, I must say - and I can say - the transfer was made a week later than normally."
"Since then, no further instances of delays in transferring tax funds have been reported to the Commission."
"author. - I thank the Commissioner for her reply and for the fact that she did take action, and the action came after I put down the question."
"She will understand that there is a long delay between putting questions down and getting answers."
"But I want to reinforce the point that this money is Palestinian money."
"It is not under any circumstances Israeli money for them to withhold."
"Holding on to it is tantamount to theft, if not of the money then of the interest."
"It is used regularly as blackmail against the Palestinians, and I hope the Commission will continue to press the Israelis to release this money as soon as it is due to the Palestinians, rather than using it as yet another political tool."
"(DE) It is good that this problem was apparently able to be resolved quickly and promptly."
"Just one query: on many occasions at that time we had the problem of the Palestinian Authority using money in a way that possibly conflicted with the intentions of the donors."
"Have these problems also been sorted out in the meantime?"
"Member of the Commission. - In response to the first comment, there have indeed been long delays in recent years regarding Palestinian money - and I agree with you that it is Palestinian money - but I have always tried when it was necessary - and very often the Palestinians asked me to do so - to intervene personally in order to get the money unblocked."
"This could take a long time and there were periods when it was really very difficult, but I always tried."
"I agree with you that this also has to be done in the future."
"Mr Rack, I can definitely assure you that the method by which we send our money to the Palestinians - previously through what is referred to as the TIM, the Temporary International Mechanism, and now through the PEGASE financial mechanism - is designed to give us full control."
"I believe this was also the substance."
"Incidentally, even the Israelis have now used this Single Treasury Account in order to transfer Israeli money."
"With Salam Fayyad as both Finance Minister and Prime Minister, we also have someone here who has the confidence of the international community."
"However, we have carried out our own inspections in the main and I am giving this matter a lot of attention, as far as I am personally able."
"My delegation has built up its own system and its own team here so that no irregularities occur."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Trade in services (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Syed Kamall, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade in services."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, firstly I would like to pay tribute to the shadow rapporteurs and their group advisers for their useful input on this report."
"I think we had some very interesting debates and we did not always agree."
"But at least we managed to conduct the discussions in a very civilised manner."
"I would also like to thank the International Trade Committee secretariat for their input and, while I am on my thank-yous, I would like to thank all the DG Trade officials for their useful advice and suggestions."
"Clearly the European Union, as the largest exporter of services, has a strong interest in opening new markets for services."
"However, my personal interest in this subject is more focused on how services can be used as a tool to help the poorest people out of poverty."
"But before we do that, let us remind ourselves of the importance of services."
"Services represent 75% or thereabouts (there is some debate/disputes over the exact numbers) of the EU's GDP compared to only about 2% for agriculture."
"In Africa, services represent 52% of GDP and rising compared to 16% for agriculture."
"So, given these figures, it is a real shame that so much emphasis was placed on agriculture in the DOHA development round when it is really the opening of trade and services that promises to take so many people out of poverty."
"That is why I was prepared to accept amendments stating that negotiations on trade and services would not only serve the interests of the EU, but the economic growth of the poorest countries."
"We should not forget what development actually means: it is taking people out of poverty, and we can achieve this by encouraging entrepreneurs to create wealth and jobs."
"In many of the poorest countries, entrepreneurs tell me that they are desperate to tackle poverty."
"But what they really need are banking services for getting that cheaper loan to be able to expand their business and employ more people and create more wealth locally; insurance services, making sure that when their life or their business is ruined and something goes wrong, they have something to fall back on; legal services, enforcing those contracts made with partners; and communications services, knowing the best prices at local markets, deciding when to go to local markets and actually get into local markets."
"However, we should all recognise that where governments through no fault of their own are unable to provide basic services such as health, education and water to the poorest citizens, then entrepreneurs must have a role to fill in the gaps in service provision."
"Unfortunately, trade in services only accounts for about 25% of world trade but has a potential to create so much more wealth and jobs."
"But let us turn to some of the contentious points in the report."
"One of the points of debate has been over the so-called 'services of general economic interest', but we should remember that different countries define these in different ways."
"Some countries believe that health, education and water should only be provided by the state."
"Others have turned to non-state players."
"In Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda, more than 40% of people in the lowest economic quintile receive their health care from private providers."
"Surely we should be encouraging more investment in these sectors."
"In education, I urge my colleagues to look at the work of Professor James Tooley of Newcastle University."
"He began his research at the London-based Institute of Education with the belief that private education was actually an abomination."
"However, he soon found out, perhaps counter-intuitively, that private schools could provide a better education to the poor."
"When a survey was conducted of state schools in India, some were simply shut."
"In some, teachers did not turn up and in one case a teacher made his students make tea for him all day long."
"So the working poor voted with their feet."
"They saved up to pay for private education, not in a steel and glass tower, but usually a simple room above a shop."
"These schools then subsidised free education for the non-working poor."
"What is wrong, I ask, with encouraging trade in these services when it helps the poorest?"
"Now I hear some Members of this House who believe that only the state can provide these services and it should be on a monopoly basis."
"And even where there is state failure or where the state collects insufficient revenue to provide these services, they do not believe that non-state players should be allowed to fill in the gap."
"Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to water?"
"Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to education?"
"Would they rather see the poorest people have no access to health care, rather than go to a private provider?"
"The next point of contention has been over sovereignty."
"Now, I agree with those who say that we should not force the opening of trade and services down the throat of our negotiating partners."
"But surely we should agree that where a country decides to liberalise what we may consider to be a service of general economic interest, we have no right to tell them not to liberalise their markets."
"I have to say, though, I have been disappointed by some of my colleagues: some Members of this House believe that we should actually tell developing countries to close their markets."
"It should not be about private versus state."
"It should not be about local versus foreign providers."
"It should be about what works. Instead I believe we should all work together to bring down trade barriers that condemn the poor."
"We should work together to end state monopolies that leave many of the poorest without essential services and we should be always be a friend to those entrepreneurs who want to tackle global poverty by creating wealth and jobs through increased investment in services."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am grateful to the European Parliament for this report."
"As it reflects, services account for the largest share of GDP in developed countries."
"The liberalisation of trade in services is therefore of key importance for our economic growth, as it is for developing countries, where services are not sufficiently advanced."
"I largely share the views that are expressed is this report."
"They are in line with our global Europe strategy."
"It is built on an ambitious multilateral agenda and on a carefully crafted set of bilateral agreements."
"We are fully committed to the development dimension of the multilateral trade round and, as the report affirms, we see a multilateral deal on services as positive, both for the interests of the EU as well as for those of poorer countries."
"I welcome the encouragement of the report for an ambitious level of commitments in the ongoing and upcoming negotiations for bilateral and regional agreements."
"We take careful note of the recommendations of the report for the different ongoing negotiations that generally touch upon the sectors that our services industry considers of importance."
"Allow me to make a general reflection on the negotiation of services agreements which is applicable to both bilateral and multilateral deals."
"There is no easy fix for negotiations in services, no simple formula that can apply across all service sectors and all countries."
"These negotiations involve addressing the complex and often detailed set of regulatory frameworks of countries in areas as diverse as those reflected in the last section of your report - from financial services to health care or education."
"We ought to do that in a non-intrusive way that preserves the right of third countries to regulate the different services sectors domestically as they wish, while opening them to external supply if competition is favoured."
"There should be no discrimination."
"We acknowledge that some services sectors account for a larger share of GDP than others and that, to this extent, the liberalisation of their trade may have a larger impact on our overall welfare."
"However, in prioritising any given sectors, we also have to take into consideration, amongst other factors, the relative specialisation of our EU countries and regions in different sectors."
"Finally, let me offer a reflection on the multilateral process."
"Your report welcomes the announcement of a signalling conference on services as part of the DDA ministerial negotiations."
"We actually pushed very hard for this event, which took place in July in Geneva. It was a relative success."
"We did not hear all the signals that we would have liked, but we heard enough to say that WTO members and several of our target countries understood the importance that we attach to a satisfactory market access outcome in the services sector."
"I have no crystal ball to see where the multilateral talks in the DDA will go from where we left them in July."
"We are in the situation where one issue - the special safeguard mechanism in agriculture for developing countries - has provided the proximate cause of breakdown, even if there are other issues that also need to be resolved."
"So support for the outline modalities deal as a whole is very fragile and not just a question of the US and India resolving their differences in agriculture."
"I feel as if we have a priceless, wafer-thin vase of great craftsmanship in our hands, but which now has to be carried from here over a very slippery floor."
"One false move and the whole thing could crash into many pieces."
"So we need to be careful of the moves we make."
"We cannot stand still but, equally, it is difficult to move forward."
"We stand ready to re-engage at whatever level is useful to make sure that we do not lose what we had achieved and which remains on the table."
"But there has to be genuine political commitment by others to participate in a negotiating process."
"In this context, the progress made at the Services Signalling Conference will not be lost."
"The signals made threw some light on the flexibilities that our key trading partners have in the services field, and this is precious information."
"The best contribution that we can all make in the current circumstances of the breakdown in negotiations in Geneva is to be realistically positive and explain how big an opportunity we may miss if we fail altogether."
"Your report, therefore, is timely, for it sends a clear and balanced message on the importance that the liberalisation of trade in one of the key areas of a DDA deal - services - would have, both for us and for our partners."
"I look forward to continuing my cooperation and dialogue with Parliament, both in this area and other areas of trade policy."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (SV) Mr President, trade in services has today become a necessity for all economies."
"It is impossible for any country to achieve economic success with an expensive and ineffective service infrastructure."
"Therefore I would like to express my great thanks to Mr Kamall for an excellent and important report."
"Producers and exporters of textiles, tomatoes and other goods will not be competitive if they do not have access to an efficient banking system, efficient insurance companies, accountancy firms, telecommunications and transport systems."
"The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs emphasises that access to financial services such as micro credits, access to basic banking services and international bank transfers are necessary for individuals in developing countries to engage in basic economic activities and start companies."
"The Committee also maintains that the particular nature of the financial sector demands considered solutions in a globalised world."
"This is also something which Commissioner Mandelson himself was talking about."
"If our partners in the negotiations, primarily the developing countries, say no to the opportunity of opening up the service markets, this will impair their chances of economic development."
"To those of you here in this assembly with doubts, I say: look at how your own countries have developed!"
"Development of trade in goods has gone hand in hand with the development of trade in services."
"To the advantage, Mr President, of all citizens!"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, behind the socialistic approach to non-liberalisation of this market is the fear that if the service is given into private hands the state will lose power over it, and something would be wrong."
"Fifty years of Communism has shown that this is not the case."
"Competitive services in tourism, finance and transport - to make things available - and in education and training are a big challenge, and a hope for helping poor countries to develop."
"How do I see that help for development if we compare the market for goods - tangible things - and services?"
"Services are people doing activities."
"They give the chance to transfer knowledge."
"It is not about giving a fish but a fishing rod, as we used to say in this House."
"What is more, it gives the chance to release personal initiative, innovation and more involvement in various activities."
"Also, the services market is more capable of adapting to cultural demands, it is more flexible and it can adapt more easily to the exigencies of local regulations, which would have to be observed in any country."
"Through this it can diminish unemployment."
"On the social level it can achieve greater involvement of people from different backgrounds and social classes."
"We are talking about water, education and health, and why not? The 50 years of Communism and recent changes in my country prove that liberalisation is a force for good rather than for bad, and I strongly support it."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of her report."
"It has given us the opportunity for a new in-depth debate on trade in services."
"We have been able to define convergences and identify some points for discussion."
"We will see whether these constitute serious divergences at the end of the debate and the vote."
"Whether we are talking about the internal market or external trade, we agree on the fact that the services market accounts for the largest share in the creation of wealth and a quarter of world trade."
"It is indeed possible that this economic sector still has growth potential for the European Union."
"It is therefore legitimate to include the services market in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations."
"However, we will have to define the principles and terms of the market for trade in services."
"The first point my group wishes to highlight is that a distinction must be made between the services market and the goods market."
"Services are not like goods, for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, services are not of the same nature; some are linked to fundamental needs and rights."
"We very much believe in the need to make a distinction between commercial and non-commercial services, whether in healthcare or education."
"Vital services such as water and energy must also be thought of as having a special status."
"Services are not like goods because trade in them often very directly involves human endeavour and not just the virtual trading of a technology."
"Although they potentially create jobs, they are also the sector in which we find the most informal employment and the greatest precarity."
"I am therefore delighted that the report states that the rules of trade must respect the employment standards drawn up by the ILO."
"In our development goals we must also fight against precarity and poverty."
"Finally, we have not lost sight of the Doha objectives and international trade as a vector of development."
"This notion commits us to taking account of the differing interests of the Member States and developing countries when negotiating commitment schedules and economic partnership agreements."
"The European Union must take account of the stages of development, pace and wishes of countries when opening up services markets, particularly when liberalising some of their services."
"I am thinking particularly of financial services."
"Exerting pressure on third countries over their way of conceiving of and regulating their services is out of the question."
"The sovereignty of these countries must be respected when it comes to issues as sensitive as public services and financial services."
"I do not know if we will reach a total consensus on this question."
"It is possible that this is a subject that divides right from left in this Parliament."
"Mr President, this report clearly highlights the importance of services in our economies, and the importance of gradually liberalising them."
"The truth is that it has been interesting for this shadow rapporteur to follow this debate, which has confirmed why some of us are sitting in the centre of this House and not at one end or the other, why some of us sit here, in the middle."
"What is it that really differentiates us, putting it kindly, from people who continue to hold to a strict idea of what services are, of what can and cannot be privatised, from people who are still allergic to the idea that some services can be provided very efficiently by the private sector, often more efficiently than by the public sector, often even irrespective of how developed the country is, from people who still want to force the State to carry a great deal of weight in less developed countries, as if the answer to all their problems were for the State to be in charge of it, without taking into account that the State carrying this great deal of weight is often what is behind the enormous power that corruption has in those countries?"
"A few notes, a few strains of mistrust towards free competition, free enterprise, and the possibility of citizens receiving services through society itself via the free economy."
"This is what we have heard in this debate."
"However I would also like to make it clear, and this is why we are in the centre, that we also do not entirely agree with the feeling that we sometimes get that the rapporteur - although subsequently he was generous in accepting amendments from other groups - does not really have, or at times may not have had sufficient sensitivity to assess what the general interest means, to understand that not everything is subject to the rules of the market, to understand that the Member States do of course have to have and retain the freedom to protect certain services outside of the pure market, in a regulated form or by providing them solely through the public sector."
"What are those services?"
"We cannot say."
"Even in Europe we are not unanimous about what the general interest is: there are different solutions to the weighting of the public and private sectors in waste collection, education, water, funeral services, cemeteries, public transport and the postal service even within Europe."
"However, it should be understood that education, health, etc. have a dimension that cannot be submitted purely and strictly to private enterprise."
"Let us therefore promote the liberalisation of services; let us understand that by doing so we are improving the services that citizens receive."
"It is important for the European Union to take the initiative on this in all of its trade agreements, especially when we are seeing the collapse - which we do not know whether it is temporary or permanent - of the Doha Round, and of the multilateral framework as a whole in this area."
"The European Union therefore has a considerable responsibility in demanding this increase, in practically forcing the liberalisation of services, even in less developed countries, but of course respecting their freedom and understanding that this needs to be accompanied - and I will conclude here Mr President - by very strong regulation."
"In many cases liberalisation needs to be accompanied by regulation, and clear rules, respecting the freedom and autonomy of each of the Member States to decide on what, for them, due to tradition, the reality of the population, or the reality of the circumstances, should continue to be part of the public sector."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to congratulate Mr Kamall on his excellent work."
"The services sector - as he himself acknowledged - is the most important sector almost all over the world."
"Even in Africa and Asia it is the most important component of GDP."
"However, this strategic sector must now be the driver for economic growth, particularly in countries where there is still a lack of development."
"The report does well to comment on the significant growth in trade in services as a vehicle for greater welfare and stability, particularly for countries that still need to develop."
"Trade in services also means a knowledge transfer between countries and citizens. The freedom to carry out such trade, provided that it is contained within a set of shared and respected rules, is therefore fundamental for any growth strategy."
"However, no one should try to export or import models for others: each developing country must adopt the proper timescales for its own growth capability."
"Therefore, the new road to liberalisation must take into account the fact that governments must satisfy the needs of citizens and not - as has sometimes happened in Africa, unfortunately - sell the opportunity to provide services to public companies linked to the governments of other countries when they are unable to provide their own people with basic services such as water or energy, because clearly there is the risk then of economic, political and security problems, even at international level."
"The failure of the Doha Round has unfortunately punished everyone: the European Union, industrialised countries, but above all - we believe - the poorest countries."
"Therefore, we hope that with this report we can send out another strong message that we are embarking once more on the harmonious development of the whole of society."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur for his openness and cooperation."
"However, having said that, our group will not be able to support this report in tomorrow's vote, partly indeed because of this presumption that trade in services is essentially exactly the same as trade in goods."
"As Mrs Castex has already said, that simply is not the case."
"We cannot agree with that, not least because trade in services almost always requires changes in national legislation or in implementing regulations, which often go to the very heart of the social fabric of a society, especially if it concerns basic services on which people depend."
"It also goes against the evidence that WTO members themselves increasingly distinguish between trade in goods and trade in services."
"At the last WTO ministerial meeting just a few months ago in July in Geneva, a group of Latin American countries even circulated a proposal to remove health care, education, water, telecommunications and energy entirely from the WTO, exactly on the basis that these are essentially public services and they are human rights which should not be treated as tradable commodities."
"Finally, the report does quote quite selectively some positive national examples of liberalisation and basic services, but it does not refer at all to the very many devastating examples which could equally well have been cited and which we ought to be mindful of as well."
"The issue that I want to focus on is the problem of the liberalisation of financial services."
"No issue has dominated the headlines more this year than the global financial crisis."
"It is widely agreed to have been facilitated by a lack of adequate regulation in financial markets."
"Yet, in the WTO negotiations on services, further deregulation and liberalisation of financial markets is being sought by richer countries, and indeed this report entirely supports that proposal."
"It does seem a bit ironic to me that the WTO Director, Pascal Lamy, has called for a conclusion to the WTO agenda as a solution to the global financial crisis when its actual policies would, by any objective estimation, probably be much more likely to contribute to further financial instability."
"I am disappointed that all our amendments that would have required at least a pause in further liberalisation of financial services until the financial stability forum has issued its recommendations about some basic new regulations such as capital requirements and cross-border liquidity - this was just a fairly mild request that we should wait for that - have actually been rejected."
"For that reason we have retabled those amendments and we would certainly ask you to support them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report's consensus is the common conviction that a multilateral system of standards and regulations is important and necessary, that trade and development must not show any contradictions and that the European Union has a particular responsibility, given its economic weight in shaping international economic relations."
"There are fundamental differences in approach, however."
"Admittedly, it is important essentially to improve worldwide access, quality and the choice of services, particularly in developing countries."
"This cannot be achieved, however, with a blanket concept of competition, liberalisation and privatisation, especially in the public sectors (water, health, education, energy and passenger transport)."
"Much less is the deregulation strategy, which the Commission is pursuing in multilateral and increasingly also in bilateral negotiations, the right way to boost global sustainable development, because this mainly targets worldwide access for European enterprises operating transnationally and concentrates far too little on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"One further point: the European Union would like to conclude free trade agreements, which also apply to foreign investments, with countries like China, Korea, India and the ASEAN and ACP countries."
"Germany, in contrast, is currently introducing a law by which the proportion of foreign voting shares in a German enterprise can be limited to a maximum of 25%."
"When Bolivia thought that the far higher proportion of foreign capital in its natural gas production had to be limited, Europe screamed blue murder."
"My group is convinced that every country has to decide for itself when, according to which rules and to what extent it wants to open itself up to global competition."
"President Arias said today: we need an asymmetrical approach."
"That is the bottom line."
"(EL) Mr President, as the rapporteur and Commissioner Mandelson have said, services are one of the most dynamic sectors in both the European and the global economy."
"However, we must acknowledge that there is considerable scope for strengthening the international services trade, with the benefits that this would bring, both for companies and, even more so, for the consumer."
"In terms of export trade, the service sector is also particularly important for the developing countries."
"The progressive opening up of their markets, based on the principle of differential treatment, may contribute to the transfer of technology and know-how and to an improvement in their infrastructures."
"The primary targets for the EU are the binding consolidation of at least the status quo as regards access to markets, and their further liberalisation."
"What is needed, in my opinion, is a reduction in the obstacles encountered by European companies, and the securing of greater transparency and predictability in foreign markets."
"The level of offers and the general course of WTO negotiations have so far been disappointing in the service sector."
"Bilateral or interregional negotiations on ambitious free-trade agreements are becoming a necessary addition to the multilateral framework, especially since the failure of the negotiations in July."
"In the negotiations on the further opening of the markets, it will be necessary to secure the regulatory right of the EU itself and of its trading partners, especially in the areas of public services and services of general interest."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Zaleski and Mr Guardans that, as they know, there is a famous painting by Goya entitled 'The dream of reason brings forth monsters', and sometimes the dream of liberalisation, with the strict rules of the market, can bring forth inefficiency and inequality."
"When we are talking about services, we need to keep this very much in mind."
"Let us imagine, for example, a poor country in which education is not functioning well, where it is decided that external actors will come in order to supposedly provide the children of that country with a quality education."
"How can we be sure that those private companies will not do this with the aim of becoming a monopoly, or an oligopoly, or fixing prices that are not accessible to the consumers, in this case the pupils, and also end up providing poor quality education?"
"Who can assure us of this?"
"Because it could happen."
"In that case we would not be in a situation of free competition, but in a situation of entirely regulated competition in private hands."
"We therefore have to say a very clear yes to the privatisation of trade in services, while distinguishing public services and services of general economic interest, ensuring that criteria and rules on accessibility and quality are fulfilled, and that, of course, the social criteria are clearly present."
"Strengthening economies means strengthening the Member States - those that are open to the rules of the market, but without putting citizens solely at the service of those who are more capable of applying them."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to acknowledge Mr Kamall on account of his very good report."
"Congratulations!"
"It should be stressed that market access and free trade in services are of fundamental importance for economic growth and reducing unemployment."
"Our states and regions are benefiting from this solution."
"This benefit also covers partners from outside the EU, especially poor countries."
"Negotiations under the Doha agenda should lead to the appearance of a harmonised services package, including financial services, in respect of which the EU is most open and transparent."
"This openness should, however, go hand in glove with mutuality and respect."
"In this context we should also take a look at what are known as 'tax havens'."
"Regulations that are adopted should bear in mind the need to encourage competition, thus lowering prices and raising the quality of services, while on the other hand combating corruption and market monopolisation."
"Here I would like to point out that trade in services more and more often includes high technologies, IT, cultural goods, etc. Services provided via the Internet need special care."
"Intellectual property rights and personal data protection must be guaranteed and there must be protection against fraud, trade in pornography and other criminal actions."
"An ageing society and the disabled require increasing volumes of health and care services."
"We must therefore envisage an increasing number of immigrants working in these fields."
"The current political situation should also draw our attention to energy and communications services."
"We have heard that everywhere in the world services play a very important part in GNP."
"The global trade in services reveals a growing trend and already accounts for a quarter of services."
"Let us hope, then, that we can manage to create a system of clear and fair rules that ensure that all parties are treated equally."
"This will not be easy, but then, who said we should only have easy tasks to deal with?"
"(SV) Mr Kamall calls for the far-reaching opening up of the service markets in developing countries."
"Unfortunately this is entirely in line with the EU's current trade policy."
"For example, Mr Kamall wants what is currently carried out by local companies or the public sector in developing countries to have competition from multinational European companies."
"This is a policy which has already been tested in Europe."
"My country, Sweden, was one of the first countries to deregulate its energy, electricity, rail and postal services markets."
"Today we see the result: higher prices, poorer maintenance, and also often poorer service."
"A few monopolies can now extract unprecedented profits from what was previously under common ownership."
"Is this a development model we should sell to the developing world?"
"No!"
"Fortunately there are countries which do things differently!"
"Norway, which is independent of the EU, has withdrawn all demands under GATS to liberalise the service sectors of poor countries."
"In general, Norway has raised its voice against the laissez-faire policy which the EU pursues within the WTO."
"This inspires hope."
"The EU should put the needs of poor countries first, instead of calling for deregulation and privatisation."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague Mr Kamall on his report, in which he highlights the need to develop an international services market that takes into account the different situations of developing countries, without forgetting that the conditions must be fair for all parties."
"On the one hand, there is the great potential for the European Union to open up its services sector to new markets, in which it has a major comparative and competitive advantage at global level: the development of new channels for the sector, one of the main tools with which Europe can face up to the challenge of globalisation."
"On the other hand, it has many advantages for developing countries."
"Firstly, benefiting from the European Union's knowledge and skills in this field, which they need in order to develop their own economies, especially in basic and cross-disciplinary sectors such as financial services."
"It would therefore facilitate the transfer of technology from European institutions and businesses."
"The existence of a more favourable economic framework would cause a 'call effect' of investment from other parts of the world; therefore the benefits for their economies would be multiplied."
"Secondly, the progression of the negotiations would improve conditions, both for those who want to provide services and for businesses who want to establish themselves in Europe."
"I would like to highlight in the report the need for the ILO's fundamental rules to be complied with, especially with regard to child and forced labour, because there should be openness with asymmetry, yes, but while respecting the rules of fair competition and fair play; never forgetting the interests of our businesses."
"We need to ask for more commitment, in particular from the big emerging economies, China, India and Brazil, always within the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"The report mentions specific situations with different trade blocks such as ASEAN, the Gulf States, India and Korea."
"There is one area missing from the report, whose level of development and economic situation are ideal for developing our services sector."
"I am talking about Mercosur, and within it, particularly about Brazil; I was rapporteur for a report on the status of the negotiations with that country in Parliament."
"Therefore, even though it does not expressly appear in the main points of the report, I did want to mention it so that it would also be included."
"Mr President, I would like to acknowledge the enormous amount of work my colleague, Syed Kamall, has put into this report on trade in services, but I am afraid I cannot unreservedly congratulate him on his work, as I have fundamental disagreements with some elements of his approach."
"The key issue is services of general economic interest."
"Here, normally in the European Parliament, between the Socialist and the Christian-Democrat groups we reach a point of compromise that reflects the political balance of forces in this institution."
"But I am afraid, here on this occasion, that compromise has not been reached: in fact, we have heard some comments from his colleagues that suggest that some of his own group members, those with a more developed social conscience, are squirming and feeling rather uncomfortable with the approach that has been taken by the rapporteur."
"This must be the most liberal report - and I say that, in case there is any confusion, in the pejorative sense of the term - that the International Trade Committee has ever passed to the plenary."
"It makes no effective distinction between commercial and non-commercial services, and I and a large majority of my group will only be able to vote in favour of Mr Kamall's report if Amendment 2, Amendment 11 and, in particular, Amendment 5 are adopted, which will protect universal, accessible and high-standard public services for all."
"(DE) Mr President, services are an essential part of our economic future."
"This is true not only for the highly developed economies here in Europe, but also and in particular for the so-called developing countries."
"Because this is true, we have to show that the deregulation we achieved in the past in the goods transport sector is also our aim in the service sector."
"It is perhaps even more important in many instances here."
"Both the rapporteur, Mr Kamall, whom we have to thank for the report, and Mr Zaleski have pointed out what is possible in the service sector: knowledge transfer, better qualifications, jobs and better infrastructure."
"These are things that we should all in fact jointly support."
"Looking at matters from this angle, we ought to be encompassing many of the ideologies over which we have been fighting here in Europe in recent years and centuries, without looking backwards quite so much."
"'Yes' to special needs in certain sectors, but 'no' to these surrogate battles that some Members of this House want to fight on the back of the developing countries."
"(DE) Mr President, we all want to have open borders for the provision of services."
"I would like to address two points in this regard."
"In 2006 the European Union made its position on the provision of public services clear and did not even subject the sensitive area of public services to open competition."
"Now, of course, the attempt is being made under GATS to liberalise this sensitive sector through the back door."
"We cannot use the same approach here as for commercial services."
"The reverse also applies for developing countries, of course."
"The EU should not be putting any pressure here on developing countries and forcing them to liberalise public services."
"They must be able to decide to do this themselves."
"A second delicate point concerns the financial services market."
"Since the 1980s, the financial services markets have featured enormous growth spurts on the most extensive globalised market sectors, even for financial transactions."
"The currency markets have an annual turnover of USD 360 trillion."
"Involvement in globally expanding markets is, of course, an economic freedom and developing countries therefore display a high degree of vulnerability towards external shocks."
"The liberalisation of financial services should therefore [take account of] the development status of the particular ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, there are two issues in this debate to which I would like to draw attention."
"Firstly, it is true that in 2007 the services sector in the European Union accounted for as much as 75% of GNP, and the export of services from the EU represented more than 28% of total world exports, but there are still numerous barriers to the free provision of services within the European Union itself by service providers from the new Member States."
"I would like to express the hope that the EU will take some major steps forward in this matter in the near future."
"Secondly, strong opposition should be mounted to the solutions proposed in the report whereby the EU, as part of the WTO negotiations, should unilaterally reduce agricultural payments and subsidies in order to obtain, as it is put, a reward in the form of additional profits from the trade in services."
"This approach, which has already been taken many times by the EU, has led to a restriction of production, and sometimes even to the elimination of many sectors of agricultural production within the European Union, which has significantly weakened food security for EU countries, and in recent months has also led to a marked rise in the cost of agricultural raw materials."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that there has been talk of liberalising the banking system, but we all know that after Basel II a monopoly emerged in this sector and we saw entire businesses, entire economic units wiped out precisely as a result of the monopolisation of the financial system."
"Therefore, I believe that we must in some ways resurrect the old system, the cooperative system, which in rural areas and in so many other parts of Europe has provided the lifeblood for small private initiatives and families to grow."
"Let us talk and act, then, truly in terms of liberalisation, instead of a monopoly, in this crucial banking sector, which affects the lives of families and businesses throughout Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe small and medium-sized enterprises are very specifically in demand even in the area of financial services."
"We have 25 million enterprises in Europe."
"I believe many of them would definitely be able to achieve equivalent success on the international market."
"Finally, one of the fundamental issues even in the least developed countries is also how income can be generated."
"Commissioner Mandelson therefore thinks it is particularly important not to back down in the WTO negotiations, but to create fresh impetus here."
"We need trade facilitation, we need the corresponding commitment and I hope we shall achieve this soon."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I certainly intend to press on with determination in the negotiations to complete the Doha world trade deal."
"It is very important indeed and I am grateful to the honourable Member for reinforcing that."
"I did not actually intend to comment on or respond to this debate."
"The reason I do so is because I feel that, in some of the contributions that have been made, there has been demonstrated not only a bit of a misunderstanding about the provision of services in the 21st century, particularly amongst developing countries, but, beyond that, a false ideological boundary is being put in place through the remarks of some of those who have contributed to this debate between what they call 'commercial' and 'non-commercial' services."
"I have to say that spending most of my time as I do in the world and amongst developing countries, this distinction and this ideological boundary that has been described in this debate is increasingly fading without trace."
"It is not the case, as Mrs Lucas has suggested, amongst WTO members that developing countries increasingly see trade in services as quite different and separate from trade in goods."
"Actually, the exact opposite trend is occurring in the WTO and in trade negotiations."
"Increasingly, developing countries are bringing trade in services into these negotiations."
"I think that it is wrong - and I speak as somebody who is a social democrat of many decades standing who, I think and I hope, has a developed social conscience - to put forward a proposition in the case of services that state provision is good and that private provision is bad."
"This is not only out-of-date thinking; it is contrary to the interests of developing countries and to the very needs of the poorest members of those countries and those communities who we should be seeking to stand up for with our values as Europeans and our principles as Europeans."
"So I hope that we will not follow and not reinforce, if I can respectfully suggest, this extraordinary equation that you can put the needs of poorest people first by denying to developing countries the opportunities to supply not only water and energy and telecoms more efficiently and more cheaply for consumers, but also supply health care and education using investment, technology, management skills and techniques from a variety of international sources on a competitive basis."
"This most certainly does not mean that these services therefore should go unregulated."
"I do not support monopolistic behaviour, price-fixing and cartels, but this goes to the very point that the honourable Member was making."
"Regulation by national governments in developing countries is, of course, essential in relation to these services, but please let us not create or give support to what I believe is, as I have described, a false ideological boundary between the commercial and the non-commercial."
"Both are equally valid if properly regulated and if properly serving the needs of the people who are desperately in need of more services of this kind, more efficiently provided and more cheaply in many cases."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I really do not know where to start, as everyone has been so kind."
"I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate, welcoming every single contribution."
"I would like to tackle some of the issues that were raised, in the couple of minutes I have been afforded."
"It is not often I get up to speak, so you will have to allow me some self-indulgence."
"Mr Markov talked about 'one size fits all'."
"It is made quite clear in this report that, at the same time as we should not be imposing liberalisation on other countries, we should also not be imposing protectionism on other countries, or state monopolies."
"That is the point I have tried to make, so it is far from 'one size fits all'."
"We recognise that there is a diversity of solutions for different countries, but let us allow them the option of liberalisation."
"Many people in poorer countries have said to me they are sick and tired of not having a choice, of having to go to a state monopoly that performs badly or to a private monopoly that they all know has links to the ruling elite."
"What they really want is access, in the first place, or a choice through which they actually have some sort of access."
"Regarding a pause in financial services liberalisation, there is a difference between the financial crisis, seen globally, and bad lending and bad debts."
"Poor African entrepreneurs have said to me they want access to capital markets in order to borrow money to buy a tractor so that they can plough the fields and create more wealth locally, so let us give them that ability and access to capital."
"Finally, I was condemned by my colleague, Glyn Ford, which I actually take as a compliment."
"I am very happy to hear that this is 'the most liberal report' and hope that will be on my tombstone one day - though not immediately."
"I want to point out that there is a difference between a social conscience and a socialist conscience."
"A social conscience means looking at what actually works and how we can really help the poor, rather than clinging to an outdated socialist ideology which, as Mr Zaleski said, lost its legitimacy after being imposed on Central and Eastern Europe for so many years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 September 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Again in July we saw the failure of another attempt to conclude the 'Doha Round', which aims to take trade liberalisation a step forward, and Parliament is already seeking to approve an own-initiative report which strives to such a sickening extent for the worldwide liberalisation of trade in services either within the WTO or through bilateral or multilateral agreements with third countries promoted by the EU."
"What we have here is an authentic primer laying out the road towards liberalisation of all services, including public services, which it dubs 'public and general interest needs'."
"Among other examples, it aims for greater liberalisation of health care, water distribution, education, cultural services, tourism or financial services."
"The report takes the trouble to explain that 'the principles of GATS do not prohibit either privatisation or deregulation' and stipulate that after the entry into force of the WTO Agreement, periodic negotiation rounds should be held 'with a view to achieving a progressively higher level of liberalisation'..."
"With the objective of breaking the current 'deadlock' in the WTO, it insists on and welcomes new initiatives - such as the 'signalling conference' - which aim to make an agreement possible in the near future."
"Big business in Europe could not write it any better themselves..."
"Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Timothy Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems - C6-0418/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the proposal the honourable Members are debating today seeks to modernise rules adopted in 1989 on the market for the distribution of airline services."
"Computerised reservation systems (CRS) act as intermediaries between airlines and travel agents in the sales chain for air tickets."
"In the early 1990s, computerised reservation systems were practically the only channel for the sale of airline tickets."
"In addition, all the CRS were controlled by airlines."
"The latter were therefore more tempted to abuse their position in the CRS, for example, by biasing displays in their favour."
"The code of conduct for the use of CRS establishes a number of safeguards to prevent abuse."
"It complements competition law since it adds measures to deal with sector-specific risks."
"It requires that all companies participating in the system are treated on a non-discriminatory basis."
"For example, the same fee is to be paid by all airlines."
"The Code also lays down special obligations for parent carriers - i.e. those which own or control the CRS."
"The code of conduct has been very effective in preventing all kinds of abuse."
"However, since the code of conduct was introduced, the market for the sale of air tickets has changed considerably as alternative sales channels have developed."
"Today, nearly half of all reservations no longer go through a CRS but are made on internet sites or through airline call centres."
"The competitive pressure of these alternative sales methods has significantly reduced the risk of abuse through a CRS."
"The new situation also requires an adjustment of the code of conduct."
"The rules laid down in the code of conduct significantly restrict the margin for negotiation between the CRS and airlines."
"The CRS are therefore not genuinely in competition with each other, and the fees paid to them by airlines and passengers are escalating."
"The Commission's proposal seeks to allow for more negotiation and, in particular, the possibility to set prices as regards the fee for the use of a CRS."
"This will enable airlines to negotiate the reduction of rates with the CRS."
"Boosting competition between the CRS will help to reduce costs and to improve the quality of the services they provide."
"At the same time, the proposal maintains and strengthens the safeguards for the prevention of abuse and protection of consumers, and in particular the neutrality of information provided and the protection of personal data."
"In addition, the proposal continues to impose special obligations on CRS parent carriers."
"The definition of 'parent carrier' has led to heated debates, since the obligations imposed on those companies are very burdensome."
"Modernisation of the code of conduct will make it possible to reduce the cost of distribution of their services while guaranteeing the protection of consumers' interests."
"This is urgently required from the viewpoint of the competitiveness of our industry, as our companies' competitors already benefit from a liberalised environment and lower sales costs."
"I am therefore pleased at the speed with which Parliament has taken up this issue."
"I wish to express my appreciation of the work performed by your rapporteur, Tim Kirkhope, and the TRAN Committee, as well as the committees which expressed their opinions."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am really glad we had the opportunity to debate this important matter tonight, and I am proud to present this new proposal to enhance the position of European consumers."
"The revision of the CRS code of conduct and the deal we have on the table represent a chance for an early and successful conclusion to an important piece of work."
"The new code is designed to re-energise the travel sector, so the sooner it is introduced, the sooner we see the benefits of that - lower air fares, more choice and greater transparency."
"CRSs should, of course, be able to negotiate freely the conditions of the distribution of air services but, under my revision, CRSs will have to compete more aggressively with each other for air-carrier participation, on the basis of lower booking fees and better quality of service."
"This will have great benefits for European consumers."
"Firstly, choice: consumers will get more choice and should get better service from their travel agents."
"Greater competition will also provide a boost to the quality of information available to travel agents and, thereby, the consumer."
"Secondly, price: this in turn should mean that the price of airline tickets, kept artificially high by the present system, could go down by as much as 10% as a result, according to the Commission's research."
"Thirdly, transparency: through tougher safeguards, travel agents and consumers will be better protected from market abuse and distortion."
"Two main safeguards are built in."
"One concerns audit provisions."
"I deemed it necessary to rethink those provisions and, as a result, they will prove more effective, and hence the regulation provides the Commission with an important tool to monitor the activities of CRSs."
"Fourthly, the definition of who is or is not a parent carrier."
"This issue has dominated the whole report and my work on it."
"It is important to get this right, because we do not want airlines investing in CRSs for the purpose of influencing the running of the business to the possible detriment of others."
"Let me say to my colleagues who have worked so hard on this report that I believe that, within the deal we have on the table, we have a robust but flexible test, one which deals with all the concerns you have expressed."
"Some have suggested tabling a split vote tomorrow but, frankly, this could leave us with too broad a scope of definition."
"I repeat what I have said in writing to those people."
"Deleting the reference to 'decisive influence' does not provide the useful clarification of the elements in Amendment 12 that it was designed to do."
"Indeed, following such a deletion, it might be interpreted that any investor would be deemed to be a parent carrier, as 'any other governing body of a system vendor' could mean literally anything."
"Should any air carrier participating in a CRS with rights to merely receive information, for example, of annual decisions or just the annual accounts, be defined as a parent carrier?"
"Surely not."
"On the suggestion made by the ALDE Group that the question should be referred back to the committee - that we should carry out a close examination of the ownership and governance structure of the concerned CRS - the Commission would need a new regulation to do that."
"When the Commission states that it needs to examine this on a case-by-case basis, I do not see this as proof that we have a weak definition."
"On the contrary, we discussed this at length in committee, and an independent study was commissioned by me to help the committee."
"I made sure the shadow rapporteurs were fully informed at all stages on the state of informal contacts with the Council."
"They specifically agreed to what is in the deal."
"I purposely held this matter back for a month while I made sure that all views were taken fully into account - environmental issues, Mrs Lichtenberger; full liberalisation, Mr Evans."
"So, tomorrow, I am asking for your support."
"We must vote for lower air fares, more choice and greater transparency."
"All of us have a duty to protect and inform the rights of consumers and get them the very best deal possible."
"That remains the priority."
"Gesture politics is not my priority, but it is my priority to get the best deal for all those consumers we represent here in Europe."
"Mr President, European consumers are groaning under the weight of high food prices and I think one of the causes of the exorbitant price increases is the concentration in the retail market on a few big players."
"I have grounds for concern that a similar development could also occur in future in the case of travel agencies."
"The liberalisation of the Code of Conduct for computerised reservation systems proposed by this report should ensure greater competition on the market."
"I fear, however, that only the large tour operators will be able to survive in future, by concluding several CRS provider contracts."
"This will be necessary, however, to offer customers a comprehensive choice."
"The small operators unable to afford several contracts with CRS providers will fall by the wayside."
"Whenever the United States is called upon as an example of consumer-friendly competition in this context, I have to remember that there are no airlines in the Member States that still participate in a computerised reservation system."
"I would therefore advocate a rigid definition of the term 'parent carrier'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, most sincerely."
"He has presented a very balanced report and has worked very closely with the shadow rapporteurs."
"His version, which he has negotiated with the French Presidency, affords consumers better protection against dubious flight and rail offers based on clear regulations on transparency and at the same time ensures fair competition between rail companies and airlines."
"Incidentally, the recast version documents the fact that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as the first group had rightly stopped the Commission's attempt in 2005 to abolish this regulation as obsolete."
"We need it - and we shall prove it by the way we vote - to protect consumers."
"Even if more and more travellers do in fact reserve their tickets directly with the airlines or on the Internet, the majority of consumers will continue to rely on their travel agencies, which for their part must be able to rely on non-discriminatory, genuine bargain offers in the computerised reservation system."
"The prices indicated must in future include all taxes and charges so that the travel agencies can pass genuinely transparent and comparable offers on to the consumer."
"The parent companies should also be subject to tighter regulations on transparency and competition in future in order that the systems are prevented from making preferential offers to the disadvantage of other airlines and to the disadvantage of consumers."
"I must come back here to the rapporteur and appeal to my fellow Members."
"I believe the version we have agreed with the French Presidency in relation to parent companies offers adequate protection against positive discrimination in favour of certain airlines."
"Any change made by the famous amendment to Amendment 48 is therefore totally superfluous and if this goes through tomorrow, it would delay the adoption of the whole thing or even call it into question."
"I appeal to you to take a clear, final decision tomorrow in order to protect consumers."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Kirkhope for his unfailing cooperation and support for all members on the committee."
"Two years ago I looked at an internet-based travel agency, a travel website, for a ticket from London to San Francisco."
"The website, or the computer, told me that there were no direct flights from London to San Francisco and recommended a connecting flight via New York with, I think, United."
"Of course there are direct flights, but it was not just in that particular website's domain to issue them."
"But it highlighted to me, in a simplified form, the problem that we are trying to address with this revision: as Commissioner Mandelson said, a revision that goes back some 20 years or more."
"We must recognise the real changes that have taken place in technology over that period."
"Now a large majority of people, and indeed all travel agents, have access to the internet, and I agree with the previous speakers who have said we have a duty to ensure fairness and equal access to the market and, as Commissioner Mandelson said, fair rules, effective rules, and protect the consumers and ensure competition."
"But, Mr Mandelson, you also said that you are pleased with the speed at which this has all gone through."
"Whilst I share your aims and always want to do things as quickly as we can - and Mr Kirkhope's aims of price transparency and consumer protection - I think that, in our speed to get this through, we have drifted away, certainly from the position that the Committee on Transport adopted at the end of May, and that the position that Council has come up with, the so-called compromise position, is different from the position that we went for in the Committee on Transport."
"In the Commission's clarification yesterday, he speaks about 'all past analyses will have to be done again under a new perspective, and the Commission will have to examine each case on a case-by-case basis'."
"That, I think, means it is not clear enough, and we have not got to a position where, certainly, a lot of Members on this side and in other groups would like to be, where we can say with absolute certainty that the position Mr Kirkhope hopes he has achieved has actually been such."
"That is why I will be recommending to my group to support a proposal that Mrs Lichtenberger, I believe, is going to make shortly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we had had to cope with the correspondence that this report has generated over recent weeks using a horseback messenger, we would have exhausted a few horses - without a doubt."
"Modern communication has allowed us to stay in constant touch and to keep up to date at all times."
"The greatest credit for this, however, is due to Mr Kirkhope, who in a truly exemplary manner has kept Members informed, has always corresponded with the shadow rapporteurs and has actually done everything he can to convey the Committee's requests to the Council."
"The Council, however, has not made his work easy."
"Quite the opposite."
"Wording was proposed - we were able to follow proceedings well - which actually would have done nothing other than cover up distortionary competitive practices more effectively - and I object to this!"
"I must honestly say that even the home countries of the distortionary competitive airlines would do well here to take consumer protection more seriously by providing fair information as well as following our suggestions to ensure this happens."
"The Code of Conduct is not the strongest instrument we have at our disposal."
"We must be clear about this."
"Even more important is clear wording, which assures us that another back door will not be opened."
"Together with my colleague Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, I should also like to guarantee this clarity by referring it back to committee."
"I consider this to be a major issue."
"We have to stand by the fact that we are protecting consumers and also have to accept the obvious consequences of this."
"I thank my fellow Members, however, particularly the rapporteur, that the concerns regarding environmental protection have found echoes in this report, as far as was possible in this sector."
"My sincere thanks once again to my fellow Members and the rapporteur."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, my colleague Mr Liberadzki and I submitted an amendment to this report."
"Its aim was that airlines should withdraw from the airline ticket central reservations system within three years."
"This amendment was seen as radical and did not gain the required majority."
"Note that this radicalism is, after all, nothing other than implementation of the principle, which appears to be generally recognised in the European Union, of equal opportunities in a competitive market."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism recently adopted a version that may be regarded as transitionally very good."
"Transitionally, on the way - yes, that is right - to a full withdrawal of involvement."
"At the same time the matter underwent a change in the Council: the amendments submitted, still more than in the version originally presented by the European Commission, strengthen the position of three carriers - that is to say, Lufthansa, Iberia and Air France."
"We hear that it is a success and that they are gaining customers because of this."
"It is probably a further success that the rapporteur stood up to enormous pressure from lobbyists."
"This I can imagine, as we had to too, we individual MEPs."
"Those lobbyists, though, are representatives of companies that are fighting for an even break."
"They have not got it, however, as the interests of a few national businesses have come out on top."
"On the other hand we do not call these businesses lobbyists, particularly when these interests are being represented by the country that currently happens to hold the Presidency of the European Union."
"Then everything is fine and what gets mentioned is the excellent cooperation with the Council."
"Is this not hypocrisy?"
"Is it not yet more hypocrisy to call this report a Code of Conduct?"
"To whom is this Code in its amended version supposed to apply, when the new definition of a parent carrier effectively eliminates this carrier?"
"(FR) Mr President, there is hypocrisy first of all in saying that consumers are injured."
"There is not a consumer on the streets of Europe who knows what an airline computerised reservation system is."
"Not one!"
"All consumers use private booking systems, the internet or the telephone."
"What this is about today is the relationship between the airlines and the information they give out about their flights, particularly to travel agents."
"This text moralises, and introduces very strong transparency and non-exclusivity principles."
"It is a text that takes the traditional view when it comes to competition law and controlling mergers."
"A number of lobbies are using it to try and force off the board of directors those who, in Europe, created the largest computerised reservation system."
"That would be a very serious matter because we have never done anything here but enact competition rules and methods for controlling them."
"We have never forced anyone to adopt a particular status, or a particular shareholder base."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I will vote for the compromise found, skilfully and through a lot of work, by Mr Kirkhope, between the Council, all the Member States of the Council - as I recall -, the European Parliament and the European Commission."
"It would be better to vote in favour of this compromise than to re-enter a war with the lobbies, in view of the many interests at stake, and to prevent this text from ultimately being substantially modified, which would do consumers a disservice."
"(DE) Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, has already been thanked several times today - quite rightly - for having now reached a clear consensus on a highly complex issue in committee and in cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs as well as with other fellow Members and I hope that this will also continue this morning."
"It was said just now that even the term 'CRS' was not clear to very many Members at the start of the discussion."
"Today we know what it means and today we know what important issues we have rightly been discussing."
"Sincere thanks once again for this fine work on a hopefully good European legal instrument."
"We have accommodated a range of content in this report, which now necessarily has an important function beyond the heavily technical nature of this report, even in another context."
"Consumers are protected while a final total price can actually be displayed by the price display method and this cannot be covered up with various special or supplementary prices."
"We have - because our group is always being reproached with this - achieved considerable progress."
"We have stated that we do not want to talk merely about preferential treatment for rail, but we do want to know for certain with regard to short- and medium-haul flights that rail transport has a fair chance of being included here."
"As has already been addressed, we have also proved the CO2 consumption or demanded that it be proved - as well - in order to establish by comparison what we want to achieve and what the consumer can contribute."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the controversial problem of the definition of parent companies."
"The purpose of the definition is indeed to prevent airlines with shares in a CRS abusing their position."
"At present this palpably concerns Air France, Iberia and Lufthansa, which have a minority holding in Amadeus."
"The current practice of the Commission examining this on a case-by-case basis when abuse is suspected has been proven."
"Cases of the abuse of influence have been resolved and prosecuted."
"To date this has occurred on two occasions."
"There are no reasonable grounds for changing anything in this essentially proven practice."
"The definition found of a parent enterprise based on the expression, with regard to competition law, of the determining influence complies with this proven practice."
"The term has been proving itself for 40 years now."
"Some Members, however, want every airline with a capital share to be automatically defined as a parent company."
"For the air transport market this means massive and unnecessary interference in the current competitive situation."
"Nor would consumers obtain any advantage from this."
"The four winners would be, for example, British Airways, American Airlines and others that would benefit from such a shift in the competitive situation."
"In addition, the only European computerised reservation system would have to accept a competitive disadvantage with regard to US competitors on the hotly contested European market."
"This I consider politically unreasonable, even negligent, and I therefore recommend that the compromise found be accepted."
"(RO) The compromise obtained by our colleague Kirkhope is based upon strengthening the principles of non-discrimination, efficiency and transparency, all of them clearly to the advantage of the final beneficiary, namely the European citizen."
"First of all, both potential abuses directed against air carriers and potential interferences of the latter with the good operation of the activity of agencies are prevented."
"Secondly, transparency is ensured and the misleading of consumer as regards the selection of flights, duration, operators and, last but not least, the price, is prevented, also ensuring the protection of personal data."
"Thirdly, beneficiaries are also provided with the possibility to choose the variant of railway transport for short routes, which may bring environmental benefits in time, by reducing the carbon dioxide emissions."
"Unfortunately, there are a few aspects that the code of conduct does not regulate and which are not included within its scope."
"These are the tariff policies of low cost companies, which are not subject to cooperation with the computerized reservations systems."
"I believe that the healthy principles behind this code of conduct should be adopted by all transport documents reservation and purchase systems, including in the case of low cost companies."
"From the consumer's point of view, it is regrettable that these companies are not integrated into CRS, in their turn."
"Besides the multiplication of options for passengers, this integration would also create positive pressure to ensure the quality of services and the transparency of prices."
"On this occasion, I request the European Commission and the Member States to reinforce controls and apply sanctions through the relevant bodies, where necessary, for real protection of consumers, for whom the companies not listed in CRS represent an affordable, yet deceiving means of mobility."
"I also support and recommend the suggestion that, in the future, CRS should consider the possibility to introduce regular coach services into the systems as well."
"Mr President, in thanking the rapporteur for his report, I recognise his efforts to try and get a first-reading agreement on this important dossier."
"A first-reading deal would indeed have been possible if the Council had accepted the Committee on Transport's position."
"The rapporteur is right."
"We did discuss it in great detail in the Committee on Transport, and we came to a view in the Committee on Transport. But what happened subsequently is that that Committee on Transport view has been altered."
"Alas, the Council's intervention and the subsequent Council amendments not only served to muddy the waters, but caused serious concern for consumer organisations, travel agents and passenger associations."
"Subsequently, what is now proposed by the rapporteur via the Council has serious implications, not only legislatively, but internationally also."
"Never in the field of EU legislation have two amendments caused so much mayhem and confusion to the detriment of the Committee on Transport's democratic position."
"Some people do not have a problem with that, but the reality is that the Council's intervention has caused great uncertainty, both morally and legally."
"There is a suspicion that the Council is creating loopholes to protect certain major air carriers, particularly as it applies to parent carriers."
"Also, the undue haste to get an agreement could lead to bad legislation."
"Therefore, I support the call for this report to be taken back to committee so that we can address all the concerns raised, get this legislation right, not for our major air carriers, but for our consumers, whose representations tell us they dislike the Council's additions."
"(SK) I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Timothy Kirkhope, for including provisions on display in the regulation on a code of conduct for computerised reservation systems (CRS)."
"Travel agents use displays, screens, to display CRS information and therefore it is vital that travel agents receive neutral and balanced information."
"I believe that the use of impartial displays increases the transparency of travel products and services offered by participating carriers and increases consumer confidence."
"Travel agents will be able to use fair assessment criteria to offer the most transparent range of options for consumers, for example the main display will make it possible to assess the most suitable travel option offered by a scheduled air or rail carrier."
"I appreciate the efforts of the rapporteur to ensure the transparency of prices by direct reference to the PRICE of a product, since the current definition of FARE does not include all the price elements, which is often misleading for consumers."
"I believe that this report will contribute to fair competition between CRSs, which will be of benefit mainly to consumers who will obtain travel products with high-quality services at a favourable price."
"(RO) The Regulation on the code of conduct for computerized reservations systems lays down the rules that the air and railway transport operators must comply with when making reservations."
"The existing situation indicates that reservations made through the computerized reservations systems used by tourist agencies lead to higher prices."
"I insist on the need to protect the passengers' personal data."
"I think passengers should have the possibility to choose the most convenient ticket and, for this purpose, the passenger should be adequately and completely informed."
"I insist that the requirement have no discrimination either between the distribution channels or according to the place of residence of passengers of tourist agencies."
"Certain distribution channels, such as the Internet, comply with the principle of non-discrimination, but the computerized reservations systems require certain conditions from tourism operators, which often lead to higher prices and discriminations based upon the passengers' place of residence."
"I consider this regulation to be important; we should always take into consideration the consumer and I insist again on compliance with the personal data protection."
"(RO) As a fictional Rapporteur for opinion on this file in the INFO Committee from PPE-DE, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Rapporteur on his work, as well as for the report drafted."
"I would like to emphasize the importance of this report with regard to ensuring real competition in the field of computerized reservations systems."
"We should also never disregard consumer rights and we should make sure that they benefit from the amendments to this code of conduct."
"Consumers should be provided with all the details regarding the trip they intend to make."
"It is also very important that they know the exact price of the tickets and are not misled by potential hidden costs."
"I would also like to emphasize the fact that what matters the most is that the companies in charge of these websites be no longer part of the boards of directors, because they always have hidden costs."
"In conclusion, I would like to assure the Rapporteur of my full support tomorrow, at the vote."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to give every support to the position taken by Mr Simpson."
"He has shown that the new definition of a parent carrier is very unclear."
"The additional phrase 'exercising a decisive influence' prompts the question: does Lufthansa, with its 22% shareholding in Amadeus, exercise a decisive influence?"
"How about Lufthansa, Air France and Iberia, with 44% between them: is that a decisive influence?"
"This needs looking at from every angle: either we adopt Amendment 48, or we send this draft back to the Committee to be re-worked."
"Otherwise the idea of competition will certainly be harmed."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to welcome this agreement, which is based on consensus and therefore which not everyone is one hundred percent happy with."
"I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Commission, the Council, and also, of course, Parliament, represented by the Committee on Transport, its rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs."
"I think that the concerns of consumers have been answered regarding the problem of Marketing Information Data Tapes (MIDTs), including the new developments relating to trains and emissions, which are ingenious and respond to this new problem."
"I think that the controls system, into which competition has been introduced, has been strengthened."
"Therefore, seeking to now expel three companies from the system would only lead to a reduction in that competition, which, as we are all aware, benefits consumers."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to commend honourable Members for the high standard of this debate."
"I welcome most of the amendments proposed."
"They clarify several points in a useful way, in particular as regards the neutral display of travel options on the travel agent's screen and the protection of personal data."
"I would like to thank Parliament for having had the courage to raise the thorny issue of parent carriers."
"I would like to set out the Commission's position in this regard."
"We all know that this is an extremely sensitive issue which has given rise to very intensive lobbying."
"At this juncture, the Commission supports the compromise reached between the presidency and the rapporteur, which was supported unanimously by the Member States."
"The new definition, as proposed in Amendment 13, removes any ambiguity or legal uncertainty."
"The Commission would thus be able to carry out an analysis and determine whether a company controls the CRS and whether a company which has rights and participates in the management of the CRS influences the latter in a decisive manner."
"This concept relies on the Commission's long experience in the field of competition, which enables it to ascertain what a shareholder's real power and influence are, for example by analysing the rights attaching to the shareholding and the agreements made between shareholders."
"In view of this, I believe that the text before us will enable the Commission, when acting on a complaint it has received, or on its own initiative, to exercise its prerogatives fully, strengthening significantly its powers, and to determine in each individual case, and at any time, which companies are parent carriers and must shoulder the major obligations arising from that status."
"With regard to the identification of the travel agent in the statistical data provided by CRS MIDT, I also support the compromise text which strikes a balance between the need to protect travel agents against improper use of the data and the usefulness of the data when it comes to airlines' strategic planning."
"I believe that with this text we are establishing a regulatory framework which takes account of market developments and enables travellers to benefit from an injection of competition into the distribution of air and rail tickets, while keeping safeguards in place to prevent any abuse."
"On this basis, I really think that it is important to go ahead with an agreement in first reading during this legislature."
"The new legislation is expected by all actors and will reduce the administrative costs for the operators."
"In order to meet the concerns expressed with regard to the definition of parent carrier, I can take the commitment that, in the framework of the current compromise, the Commission would issue a formal notice explaining how it intends to interpret that definition when applying the regulation."
"Such notice would be similar to those issued from time to time by the Commission with respect to competition matters."
"This notice would be published in the Official Journal before the entry into force of the regulation so as to provide the necessary legal certainty to all interested parties."
"I very much hope that you will consider this proposal favourably."
"I think I have covered the main points raised during this debate."
"As usual, I shall send a full list of the amendments and the Commission's position on each of them to the Parliament's Secretariat."
"Commission's position on amendments by Parliament"
"Kirkhope report"
"The Commission can accept Amendments 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 43, 44, 45 and 48."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 10, 19, 26 and 28 in principle."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 18, 25 and 47 with redrafting."
"The Commission can accept Amendment 33 in part."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 12, 13, 15, 24, 29, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 46."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for that extremely clear exposition of his position and the confirmation that, once we have concluded our proceedings in Parliament (in a positive manner tomorrow, I hope), there is more work than can and will be done by himself and others in the Commission to ensure that what Parliament wants is put into effect."
"I wish to thank my colleagues for their contributions, despite the fact that I do not agree with their every interpretation."
"That is probably understandable because this is undoubtedly a very complex matter."
"Despite the very open way in which I have proceeded with the work, it is inevitable that some of the interpretations of its outcome will be politicised or maybe even misunderstood."
"However, I believe it is in the interests of the consumer and in the wider interests of clarification that we proceed in the way we have agreed."
"I am proud of the work I have done."
"I am proud also of the work that others have done to help me."
"The smiles and acceptances of the shadow rapporteurs during the proceedings gave me confidence that they would support me, not only this evening, but also with their groups tomorrow."
"Therefore, I hope that on consideration, and having heard the very sensible and positive contribution by the Commissioner tonight, they will come back tomorrow and allow us to go forward in total unanimity to make sure that Europe is a better place for travellers, a better place for consumers and a better place for enforcing competition policy in future years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 September at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) Ladies and gentlemen, the text we are debating this evening was the subject of lively discussions within the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and not without reason, since it is important legislation for the tourism and air transport industry, and also for citizens."
"It was not easy to find a balance between maintaining competition between the airlines and guaranteeing the independence of travel agents, while enabling passengers to receive useful, unbiased information."
"The text on which the rapporteur and the French Presidency have agreed respects these requirements, and I am pleased about this."
"A balanced definition of the concept of 'parent carrier' has been agreed and that is essential for ensuring healthy competition between the various computerised reservation systems."
"I hope that tomorrow's vote will approve the text at the first reading so it can be rapidly applied."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Computerised reservation systems (CRSs) are mainly intended to serve the customer."
"That is why it is so important to ensure transparency in the air ticket reservations market, especially in the event that airlines, by having a holding in computerised reservation systems, can limit competition in the market."
"Obviously the situation in the airline market has changed significantly over the last few years, and most airlines have disposed of their shares in CRSs, which does not mean that all airlines have done so."
"The most important thing, though, is that, apart from shares in reservation systems, airlines do not have the opportunity to exert such an influence on the functioning of systems as might give preferential treatment to the routes they operate, and this must be properly reflected in the definition of 'parent carrier'."
"A simplification of the Code of Conduct will increase the potential for negotiation between market participants (airlines and CRSs will freely be able to negotiate the level of payment for a reservation taken by the CRS)."
"Currently the provisions increase the CRS cost and restrict the flexibility of the CRS in tailoring its services to the specific needs of airlines and travel agents, through the lack of potential for differentiation of the tariff range for individual CRSs."
"I hope that the amendments introduced will bring about greater competition in the air ticket sales market, to the benefit of the customer, especially where expansion of the current range and a lower end price for air tickets are concerned."
"in writing. - I support this report which recommends that the rules regarding the Computerised Reservation Systems used by high street travel agents to book airline tickets are simplified and modernised."
"The current rules regarding CRS only serve to stifle competition and maintain high fares."
"These proposals will promote competition between the companies which are in charge of providing these systems and will hopefully result in lower fares and more choice for travellers."
"At present, usually the most attractive option for consumers is to book directly with an airline."
"The new code of conduct will result in a greater degree of price transparency, giving the travel sector a boost and ensuring a fair deal for the consumer."
"European ports policy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Josu Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on a European ports policy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, along around one hundred thousand kilometres of coast in the united Europe, we have more than one thousand two hundred merchant ports, as well as several hundred more dotted along the thirty-six thousand kilometres of internal waterways."
"90% of our international trade passes through them, as well as 40% of the tonnes per kilometre of intra-Community trade."
"Ports generate half a million jobs and guarantee the development of entire regions."
"They are also key for the regular passenger and ferry services, which provide social cohesion for the islands and other territories that are more easily and more sustainably reached by sea."
"There is therefore no doubt that we are talking about a sector that is of great importance for our well-being."
"Nevertheless, our ports are facing major challenges, including the increase in international demand for transport, which is increasing even faster than the rate of global economic growth."
"In this context it is worth mentioning the advances in navigation technologies, logistical telecommunications and exploitation, the commitment to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases, securing new investment and the need to bring training up to date for the staff that manage and deal with these aspects."
"However, ports also have the challenge of maintaining dialogue and coordinated action with their respective surrounding areas, neighbours, cities and regions, and to develop the best possible connections and convenience in relation to other modes of transport, for their mutual benefit and in order to seek the most harmonious and sustainable planning solutions."
"The ports are also part of our internal market, and they therefore have to comply with the relevant Community parameters."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism, which appointed me as rapporteur for this matter, wished to produce an own-initiative report, which, having been debated and agreed by the various groups is now being put before the plenary sitting of the European Parliament."
"In our analysis we considered that the European ports policy should aim to promote competitiveness in maritime transport and the provision of high-quality, modern services, promoting safety, fast services, low costs and respect for the environment, creating a European maritime transport space without barriers."
"We believe that technological and economic progress and the widening of the Panama Canal will accentuate the current trend towards larger vessels, and will bring about changes in the international routes. We also believe that at the same time, in Europe, where there are not many ports that are deep enough to allow large vessels to operate there, there will be development of intermediate ports and also small and medium-sized ports, thus boosting cabotage and river transport."
"For this future we need an integrated European policy to boost regional competitiveness and territorial cohesion, and efforts need to be redoubled to reduce water pollution and CO2 emissions, therefore we are asking for the current fuel to be replaced by diesel by 2020."
"We need the port authorities to cooperate with each other and with the local and regional authorities and transport sector associations, not only maritime and river transport, but also rail, air and road transport."
"We consider that the legal certainty of the Community legal framework in the maritime field, flowing from the international legal framework, depends on the speedy approval of the Erika III maritime package, and we ask for this to be done with the greatest of urgency and the greatest possible consensus."
"European ports are sometimes in competition with ports in third countries that have discriminatory policies; we therefore need a list of bottlenecks."
"We understand that technological changes will have major financial implications, and that therefore the regions should also be able to use the structural funds in order to finance the acquisition of advanced technological installations, create jobs in innovative fields and rehabilitate urban areas freed up by the transfer of port facilities."
"We are in communication with the Commission in order for it to publish guidelines for State aid to ports in 2008, distinguishing between access and defence infrastructures, which should be exempt, and project-related infrastructure and superstructure, and so that aid for environmental improvements or decongestions and reducing the use of roads should not be considered as State aid, or when it is essential, as in the case of islands, in order to ensure cohesion."
"We approve the extension of the transparency requirements in this respect, but instead of an absolute obligation we ask for ports that do not reach a reduced minimum threshold for annual revenue to be exempted."
"Finally, we support port workers being provided with a recognisable qualification and we ask the European social dialogue committee to address these issues."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Committee on Transport and Tourism for setting out its vision of ports policy, and Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the rapporteur, for his report."
"The report acknowledges the efforts made by the Commission in developing a genuine European ports policy, and that is what unites us."
"The communication on a European ports policy is a response to the sector's needs and concerns as identified by the Commission following a broad consultation of the port sector from November 2006 to June 2007."
"The consultation results showed that there was agreement on the challenges faced by European ports: an increased demand for international transport, technological change, commitments to reduce greenhouse gases and other emissions, the need for dialogue, the need to ensure a level playing field."
"To face these challenges, we need an effective and efficient European port system."
"The communication is intended as an inventory of the state of play in the port sector, which is characterised by great diversity in terms of the size, role, traffic and management methods."
"Parliament's report rightly notes this diversity."
"As the communication clearly states, the Commission has no intention of interfering with this diversity."
"I agree with Parliament that the importance of our ports is linked not only to economic factors but also to the role of ports in society."
"Indeed, Parliament highlights the importance of ports, not only for maritime river and intermodal transport in Europe and internationally, but also as a source of employment and a factor in the integration of the population."
"It logically follows that the sector lends itself to a Europe-wide approach."
"The measures announced in the communication, which the industry agrees with and even clearly calls for, need to be implemented: guidelines on state aid, guidance on the application of environmental legislation, the European Maritime Transport space without barriers, and social dialogue."
"We have already started, and we are striving to achieve tangible results in the near future."
"The Commission has adopted a communication proposing a clear framework and an action plan enabling European ports to face the challenges of today and tomorrow, to attract investment, and to contribute fully to co-modal transport chain development."
"I am firmly convinced that the communication and the practical measures it will generate will produce positive and beneficial results, ensuring that European ports continue to play a pivotal role in the logistics chain and as centres of growth and employment."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, I would sincerely like to congratulate Mr Ortuondo on his main recommendations for the necessary development of European ports."
"I would also like to congratulate him for taking on board all of our proposals and I thank him on behalf of all my colleagues."
"Within the EU, the free movement of goods and people is essential for our growth and also demonstrates our solidarity."
"The goods transport chain - 90% of international trade and transport - requires that each link, each node, is optimised in view of this rate of flow."
"The 21st century port is not escaping the impact of this new mobility."
"As a part of the city, it has to be integrated into the sustainable planning of cities, in accordance with the main stated, proactive, objectives of the fight against climate change."
"As a part of regional development too, it must be optimised in view of the integrated approach in the Leipzig Charter."
"The European Ports Policy, which we are pinning our hopes on, must therefore respond to this important need as well as to the objectives set in this report, and must thus be integrated into our general approach."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ports in Europe are a driving force for the economy."
"No less than 90% of Europe's international trade takes place via the ports."
"This must hold appeal for Mr Mandelson, as Commissioner for External Trade."
"Every year sees the transhipment of more than 3 million tonnes of goods from all over the world."
"The ports employ more than half a million Europeans."
"The growth figures are still substantial."
"Growth brings opportunities, but also problems: available infrastructure, good hinterland connections, environmental capacity."
"This is the very reason why it is so important that Europe does not hinder ports but help them and solve their problems."
"This does not require a Directive on port services, or legislation, but it does require clear guidelines."
"It is important that the European Commission speed up the process of adopting guidelines on unclear and sometimes even inconsistent environmental legislation."
"Vague terminology and inconsistent wording make for judicial appeals procedures and bring important projects to a standstill."
"The Commission has yet to name a date for presentation of these guidelines."
"Can it provide any clarity on this point this evening?"
"It is also important to introduce guidelines for state aid."
"A level playing field between European ports is an essential precondition."
"Transparency requirements are also important with regard to ports."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the European Commission and opposes the enforcement of thresholds advocated by our rapporteur."
"We shall therefore be voting against these parts of the report."
"We shall also be voting against the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, as they are contrary to sound proposals by the Greek Government, and it is wrong for the European Parliament to put paid to these."
"My Greek colleague will discuss this in a minute."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his report and thank the various members for their openness and their contributions, particularly that of Willi Piecyk, who recently passed away."
"In 2006 Parliament rejected the proposal on market access to port services for the second time."
"At the time it opted for measures favouring greater transparency, healthier competition, less precarious work, better employee qualifications and improved safety, and emphasised that unregulated liberalisation of the European port system is counterproductive."
"This report reinforces this position."
"As the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I have always upheld the following points that are raised in the final report: the need to use existing opportunities in terms of European funding or State aid to develop and purchase advanced and environmentally-responsible facilities and to better integrate them into the European port network; the need for local and regional authorities to make use of the possibilities their ports offer to develop their regions, creating more transport intermodality and competitiveness between ports; the need to improve current social conditions in the maritime sector, in particular through better training, lifelong learning and better safety conditions in the workplace; the need to enhance the European Union's competitive position as a global maritime power, in particular by strengthening regulatory frameworks in the area of maritime safety and financial incentives, rules to aid public or private investors from various backgrounds; improving the adaptation of existing ports to strict environmental requirements, in particular in terms of reducing greenhouse gases; strengthening the current regulatory framework for ports, as variables determining the global equilibrium; adapting the European port system to extremely rapid technological development without disregarding the environmental impact; accepting that some investments by public authorities may not be seen as State aids, for outermost regions and islands, when they are essential to ensure economic, social and territorial cohesion, as long as they do not benefit a single user or operator, and recognising the specific situation of outermost regions as recognised in the Treaty on European Union."
"Madam President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the Commission's new European ports policy strategy."
"Now that two proposals for the Ports Directive have failed, this must be rethought."
"In addition, the series of consultations arranged by the Commission, in which all port stakeholders have taken part, has demonstrated the need for clarification of both the government support rules, in order to ensure equal competition between the ports, and the environmental rules."
"Therefore, it is the correct strategy at present for the Commission to prepare guidelines for state support."
"Decisions need to be made concerning many details."
"There may be questions about how far into a port a road is considered a public project and the point at which this becomes the port's responsibility."
"The guidelines must give clear answers to this type of question."
"It is important that there is openness and transparency in questions concerning state support and I would like to give my wholehearted support to the rapporteur's recommendations in this connection."
"The Commission will also provide clarification on how EU environmental legislation is to be interpreted in relation to port expansion and development."
"In terms of the overall picture, port expansions improve the environment by promoting maritime transport, which is more environmentally sound."
"Naturally, the development of ports should not be at the expense of the environment."
"Greater clarity will also ensure that environmental matters do not arise that in reality are merely aimed at delaying and complicating port expansion - matters that have not been raised out of genuine concern for the environment."
"The Commission will promote the development of a port network and ensure the development of good supporting investments."
"How we get goods to and from ports is a major problem and good traffic links on land should be better reflected in the EU's support programmes in future, not only in regional support but perhaps also in a programme such as Marco Polo."
"We will increase the efficiency of the ports through increased use of new technology and by reducing bureaucracy."
"In addition, I think that it would be a good result for the consultation process if the dialogue between the social partners could be more constructive in future."
"To be a port worker is to be a part of a culture, but at a modern port it is also a highly specialised job that is performed in a dangerous workplace."
"This requires a focus on qualifications and training."
"I also think that it is good that training has become a part of the toolbox launched by the Commission."
"I would like to wish Mr Ortuondo luck with an excellent report and look forward to the Commission implementing the action plan."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Madam President, we cannot go along with the assessment of this European Commission initiative, as we consider it is attempting, as a last resort, to promote the liberalisation of port services at European Union level."
"In its communication, the Commission states how it faced the challenge of the need to reconcile ports' and development management with transparency, competition and the body of EU law in general, as well as the establishment of a real internal market for maritime transport in Europe, for which it will put forward a legislative proposal, that is to say, the objective is to extend the inclusion of port management in the competition rules of the European Union's internal market."
"Obviously the Commission does not have the power to privatise."
"However, it seeks to create the conditions so that when privatisations do occur, they do so within the framework of the European Union through the liberalisation of port services, for example, as regards service concessions in the ports sector, and I quote, 'so that it does not limit open competition beyond what is required' or as regards public financing for all merchant ports, and I quote, 'irrespective of their ... turnover'."
"For this reason, we believe that explicit mention should be made in the European Parliament report of the rejection of any new attempt to liberalise port services at European Union level as regards public financing, port concessions, technical-nautical services or cargo handling services."
"The ports sector is a public service of strategic importance for economic and social development, the environment, the defence and sovereignty of each Member State, which is why it should not be liberalised at EU level."
"Madam President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Ortuondo Larrea for his report on a European ports policy."
"I wish to note with regard to the report that the unfair competition between European ports must be stopped."
"It is unacceptable that one European port should have to support itself commercially whilst another lives on state aid."
"My first request to the European Commission is connected with this."
"Can Commissioner Mandelson promise that he will publish the guidelines for state aid to ports before the end of 2008?"
"I should also like to urge the European Commission to publish guidelines on the application of Community environmental legislation by 2008."
"At the moment, the complexity and lack of clarity of this legislation is standing in the way of the development of Europe's ports."
"(PL) Madam President, I am an MEP who comes into contact with the maritime economy on a daily basis."
"Ports are of major importance not only for transport in Europe, but also as an important element in the economy and a source of employment."
"Sea transport and sea ports contribute to and bind together the single EU market and the world economy."
"Their effective functioning and continuing development are of fundamental importance for the competitiveness of the European Union, and for Europe, in a world where globalisation is proceeding."
"Although the cross-border scope of the sector requires the coordination of a ports policy at European level, the foundations of this policy cannot be laid without reference to local and national needs."
"In view of this, it is with moderate optimism that I accept the, after all, limited means of influence of the European Union on individual Member States in the form of soft law - in other words, guidelines and the removal of administrative hurdles for an integrated or sustainable maritime policy."
"(GA) Mr President, I welcome the Commission's initial recommendation."
"It is a very useful document and I would like to congratulate the Rapporteur on his hard work in preparing this report."
"The report emphasizes that ports are an essential infrastructure."
"There are more than 1,200 mercantile ports in the European Union employing half a million people directly or indirectly."
"I would like to welcome the section of the report that emphasizes the importance of good inland connections with the ports."
"In Ireland, for example, there are hardly any rail connections with the ports and there is no connection with the national airports or with the international airports."
"The Minister for Transport in Ireland, who is a member of the Green Party, admitted that the situation in Ireland as regards carbon emission is very bad and getting worse and will no doubt worsen considerably because of the transport situation."
"This is caused, no doubt, by the absence of rail links between the ports and the airports."
"Exporters and importers in Ireland have no choice but to use motor vehicles and this is scandalous."
"I am always very pleased when the Transport Committee publishes reports like this which endorse the European Union's environment legislation."
"(PL) Mr President, may I take the liberty of thanking Mr Ortuondo Larrea for his report."
"I do this as one of the instigators, two years since, of the rejection of the draft directive on access to port services."
"I am in favour of treating ports as an element of the infrastructure, and thus also of the public sector taking strategic responsibility for port development."
"Ports do not have to be state-run, but the public sector must take responsibility for them."
"It also suits me that we are talking about public aid."
"That may perhaps be something we need, and the rules of the game will undoubtedly serve us well."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of stabilising the conditions for port employees."
"This is a group of people who, along with the port as an infrastructure element, create a source of economic potential."
"The final element to which I wished to draw attention is the need to modernise access to ports - in other words, roads, railway lines and inland waterways - to establish a multi-modal transport hub."
"(ET) I would like to thank the rapporteur and I hope that this report is successful this time."
"My home country, Estonia, is also a maritime country and I am pleased that this report focuses on debottlenecking in the port sector in several Member States."
"Ports are of great importance to economic and social development and to the competitiveness of the whole European Union, but we will only be able to cope in a world of global competition if we are above average in terms of innovation and best in terms of quality."
"In a maritime country, maritime matters are an inseparable part of a complex logistical system and are an integral part of the country's overall economic system."
"Maritime transport is an important means of transport within the European Union as well, and on that basis I welcome the initiative to establish a single maritime transport space without barriers."
"I am of the view that the European Union should not place short-sea shipping at a disadvantage compared to other forms of transport and that Community-cleared goods should not be subject to further customs inspection in Europe."
"It is necessary to establish common rules governing the activity of European Union ports."
"However, by the same token, it is important for the European Union to give greater support to its own ports to counter unfair competition from third-country ports."
"One of the important terms in a debate on ports is 'maritime safety'; improvements to this are required and cooperation between maritime rescue coordination centres must unquestionably be improved."
"I hope that all the steps highlighted in the report - my allotted time of two minutes does not allow me to address them all of course - help to increase the competitiveness of European Union maritime transport and contribute to the development of a European ports policy."
"(SV) Madam President, when the Ports Directive was up for debate in 2006, the June List clearly and emphatically voted against it."
"The reason for our opposition to the directive is that the ports of Europe already work well and are competitive even from an international perspective."
"The report we are now debating contains several elements which were included in the Ports Directive that we voted against."
"Furthermore, the report contains many proposals which are as worrying as they are undesirable."
"For example, it is proposed that Community-cleared goods are to be exempt from customs controls."
"This is a major problem, particularly regarding the smuggling of drugs, for example."
"It should be up to each Member State to decide whether a container is to be opened or not."
"This is a report which stinks of unnecessary regulation, hidden protectionism and major costs for the taxpayer."
"Therefore I urge you all to vote against it tomorrow."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, towns and cities have developed around our ports, and these ports are linked with the development of our people."
"It is vital therefore that our ports should be exemplary and legitimate and operate in strict accordance with the law."
"Unfortunately, I must point out that there are two ports in Italy, Naples and Gioia Tauro, that have been found to be in serious breach of the law."
"Organised illegal imports of products take place, from China, for example, and this then undermines the economic fabric of the country."
"Then there are the Mafia organisations that organise clearly illegal imports of drugs and weapons and continue to undermine the economy and law and order of our country and Europe as a whole."
"Therefore, the authorities and the European Parliament should keep a close watch on these situations, where disorder still reigns, unfortunately, the Mafia rules and there is no control or proper regulation."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the proposal on the table is better than the document presented last time."
"It contains much more scope for decentralisation of responsibilities."
"This also increases the role of Member States - and, as a member of the Committee on Regional Development, it is this that I should like to discuss once more."
"What strikes me is that the position of ports is very clearly defined on the one hand, but that on the other the necessary hinterland connection lags behind in a number of cases."
"One example is Antwerp here in Belgium and the Ruhr area."
"The activation of the Iron Rhine - the railway link that would finally put an end to the constant stream of containers that cars find in front of them on the motorway - has been under discussion for years."
"The situation is ridiculous: things could be different, but the main responsibility lies with the nation-states."
"This also goes for the Netherlands, where the Betuwe Line - in which billions of euros were invested - has been laid from Antwerp to the Ruhr area."
"Imagine my amazement: the optimum interconnection is lacking at the German border."
"Surely this is something we need to discuss."
"In view of the growth in international transport via the ports, those arteries, we must adopt a stricter integrated approach."
"I know that the European Commission is working on a document regarding the territorial cohesion that must be realised not only in Western Europe, the old Member States, but also in the new Member States and beyond."
"There is easily scope for a little more direction in this."
"I am not talking about hard law and regulations, but a way to review each other's responsibilities."
"Nor am I talking about spending money from the Structural Funds."
"Billions of euros are being channelled into port development and clusters without coordinating this properly with the hinterland."
"This is the message I wish to convey."
"May I ask the Commissioner whether this priority area features in the Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion to be presented in October?"
"(RO) I would like to congratulate the Rapporteur for the work and effort submitted in drafting this document."
"Maritime transport and ports represent two key components of the chain linking the European single market with the world economy and they are essential for handling 90% of Europe's international trade."
"From the perspective of regional development, ports represent one of the essential elements of cohesion in Europe, both due to the development of tourism capacity and the creation of over half a million jobs, which both dynamize and develop ultraperipheral regions."
"In this context, aspects such as improving the image of ports and their better integration into urban life, their modernization by taking advantage of the possibilities provided by FEDER and the cohesion funds, as well as the involvement of local and harbour authorities in water and air quality management, contribute essentially to regional development."
"For a competitive European policy, an integrated perspective is necessary, by correlating economic, environmental, social and security aspects."
"We should also not neglect the stimulation of cooperation programmes within the Union's neighbourhood and enlargement policy, as well as connecting the port areas to the Trans-European transport networks."
"In the end, I would like to call attention to the Black Sea ports which, although they successfully meet all requirements for terminals, still need to be doubled by inland ports and waterways to facilitate the multimode transport and trade with Member States not bordering the sea."
"Thus, I consider that the Danube represents a potential to be turned to good account with a view to building a logistic corridor linking the Black Sea region, Europe's Eastern gate, with Western Europe."
"Consequently, the Union should give special attention to the Black Sea region, which could become a pole of growth and development for Europe, thus contributing to the reduction of disparities between the ultraperipheral and the central regions."
"Madam President, as the report rightly points out, ports are not only important for transport but also provide our citizens with jobs, have a significant impact on our economies, and are strategic for the security and defence of our Member States."
"In terms of policy, we should primarily focus on their modernisation and development of the sector which includes all of the other logistic operations that are interconnected with ports."
"With the expansion of any industry, we should always keep the environment in mind, especially when our maritime and waterways are involved."
"While our policy may protect the environment and the social impact, we should address the problems associated with the non-EU countries which impede on our success in this sector by not applying the same rules and safeguards."
"Madam President, paragraph 44 of this report calls on Member States to employ a trans-border approach to the use of existing capacities when co-financing port infrastructure."
"In simple terms, that means that one state should not duplicate and prejudice existing neighbouring facilities."
"Yet that is precisely what is set to happen in my constituency of Northern Ireland - which is an area that the Commissioner knows well."
"Warrenpoint on Carlingford Lough has been built up, particularly through recent high investment, into a very successful roll-on, roll-off ferry port."
"Just six miles away at Greenore in the Republic of Ireland, on the same lough, it is proposed to duplicate those facilities with public money, through a company that is part-owned by the Dublin Government."
"I hear a lot from Ireland's politicians about wanting to help and cooperate with Northern Ireland, so have to ask why it is they are trying to supplant and destroy our port at Warrenpoint."
"I hope the Commission will take an interest in this matter and look out for the state aid issues, and that it will realise that such action is totally incompatible with any sensible ports policy."
"(EL) Madam President, without competing ports, the EU will not be able to meet the challenge of globalised trade - 90% of our imports are imported by sea - neither will it be able to decongest its major roads in favour of sea routes."
"However, the ports will finally have to emerge from the Stone Age."
"They must stop being hostage to trade unions and must operate transparently, cut red tape and open up to more commercial horizons."
"The Greek Government has set in motion a very ambitious programme to transfer parts of port operations to independent, private operators, who will bring a new dynamism not only to the Greek economy, but also to the wider area of South-East Europe."
"I would therefore like to urge my fellow Members to support this option and reject the amendments of many left-wing Members aimed at undermining and diminishing the importance of the Greek programme for sea ports."
"Madam President, I warmly welcome this report."
"An integrated ports policy is necessary to boost trade and investment, while taking advantage of the environmental benefits of maritime transport."
"There are also massive gains to be made by greater cooperation between ports and different Member States."
"In my own city of Cork and ports there, there is a proposal for a new service between that port and a port in Spain."
"Currently there is no roll-on roll-off link between these Member States."
"The benefits will accrue not only to Ireland and Spain, but also to the UK and France."
"Road freight between Ireland and Spain must now pass through the UK and France, adding to the congestion on their roads."
"Road freight will be taken off already congested motorways and transported over a shorter route by sea, saving time, money and carbon emissions."
"However, a word of warning must be added."
"The port I referred to has recently attempted to relocate to a location outside the city, to deeper water."
"Unfortunately, planning was refused by the planning board, who are not accountable to the Government."
"They refused on the grounds that there was no rail link to the new proposed facility."
"The Government does not have any policy on freight transport by rail."
"This displays a lack of integrated thinking, where policymaking is uncoordinated across government agencies."
"Therefore I welcome this report."
"(BG) Commissioner, this report is satisfactory for the people who live by the sea."
"In the context of the new policy of the European Union, the new maritime policy, it is very important to implement an effective ports policy."
"And since ports are each country's open doors to the world, and since out of twenty-seven countries twenty-four are considered maritime ones, the ports policy proves very important for the economic development of many regions."
"It is necessary for local communities to be involved in what happens on their territory and to be included in determining the ports policy."
"Protection of the environment in maritime territories and coastal zones is necessary because this is exceptionally important."
"This year the Bulgarian Black Sea coast was polluted by oil slicks on three occasions."
"We should again turn to the discussion of the matter of drafting a directive on the application of minimum requirements in accordance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil."
"(PL) Madam President, our discussion on European ports policy coincides with a time of very dynamic changes in the shipbuilding industry."
"On the one hand, we may see prospects for development in the industry."
"The number of orders is rising, and the demand for large container ships is increasing."
"On the other hand, we must bear in mind that our competitors are in a very strong position."
"Nearly 75% of container ship building is now carried out by Asian countries - South Korea, Japan and China."
"Our shipyards are being forced back onto the defensive, with world competition ever harder for them to match."
"A further problem faced by the industry is the low dollar exchange rate."
"This situation is threatening many shipyard undertakings with bankruptcy in the longer term."
"(RO) Approximately 30% of the movement of goods in Europe takes place in the ports of Rotterdam, Anvers and Hamburg and 20% in the biggest nine ports at the Mediterranean Sea."
"Romania's and Bulgaria's accession provides the European Union with an exit to the Black Sea and, implicitly, direct access to important sea ports such as ConstanÅ£a, Mangalia, Varna and Burgas, as well as to ports situated on the maritime Danube: GalaÅ£i, BrÄila, Tulcea and Sulina."
"Many European ports deal with differences between the storage and loading-unloading capacities, deficient organization of terminals, insufficient routes and maritime or land access, long waiting time, insufficient security for trucks, trains and barges, low productivity and excessive, slow and expensive formalities."
"I consider investments in creating new installations and improving the existent ones, creating waste treatment installations, reducing emissions, simplifying procedures, the transparency of public financing, ensuring health and safety at work a priority."
"Structural funds, the State aid, the Naiades and Marco Polo programmes are only some of the available Community instruments."
"(EL) Madam President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, for his excellent work, the attention he has given to Members' proposals and his cooperation with the political groups."
"I also thank the European Commission for presenting a mature, comprehensive proposal that takes account of all the challenges and aspects of a modern policy on sea ports."
"In particular, I should like to underline the issue that was finally included, after proposals made by me and other Members: the attention that should be given to island regions."
"The ports in these regions must be strengthened."
"It should be stressed that state funding may be allowed so that regional and island ports can be strengthened to meet the challenge of economic and territorial cohesion."
"I believe this is a real contribution towards the EU's aims of solidarity, competitiveness and cohesion."
"Mr President, I would like to add to my earlier comments by urging the Commission to promote the exchange and dissemination of good practice in the port sector in general and with regard to innovation and the training of workers in particular in order to improve the quality of services, competitiveness of the ports and the attraction of investment."
"We welcome the fact there is to be a European Maritime Day on 20 May each year, with an open day to help the public gain a better understanding of the work and importance of the port sector for our lives and our well-being."
"We urge the operators to reduce the number of empty containers transported and the Commission to promote a single harmonised transport document for all European Union containers, also simplifying customs procedures for goods that have come from or are going to destinations within the Community to the same level as for road, rail or air transport."
"We also urge the Commission to continue its efforts to ensure that the United States regulation which plans to scan all of the containers that we send there is changed, and replaced by cooperation based on the mutual recognition of authorised economic operators and of security standards agreed by the World Customs Organisation."
"To conclude, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, all of my colleagues who have spoken and the secretariats of the Committees on Transport and Regional Development for their help and significant contribution to the final result of this report, as well as staff in the Commission and Directorate B of the Directorate General for Internal Policies of the Union, who produced an excellent report for us on this subject."
"Thank you to everyone, and I hope that tomorrow we will have support to move forward with this important report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 September."
"Freight transport in Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Michael Cramer, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on freight transport in Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs most sincerely in connection with the report on freight transport in Europe as well as the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, particularly Mr Catot."
"Cooperation was fruitful, not least because it showed that the report had been unanimously accepted in committee without any negative votes or abstentions."
"Europe's citizens are increasingly suffering under the burden of rising freight traffic, particularly on the roads."
"My report strives to bring the scourge of the lorry under control."
"The European Commission has clear objectives for its action plan on freight transport, which it wants to introduce soon."
"The independent rail freight network in Europe is unequivocally rejected."
"Even if it is a pleasant dream, mixed traffic is in most countries comfortable on tracks, i.e. freight and passenger trains travel on the same tracks."
"The utilisation of existing infrastructure must therefore be improved at every technical and logistical opportunity and - of course - must also be extended when necessary."
"The report on the Commission's idea of 'green corridors' has provided greater substance."
"Transport should be shifted on to environmentally friendly modes of transport in order to reduce not only accidents, congestion and noise, but also air pollution and encroachment on the countryside."
"Renewable energies ought to have an important role in this, whereupon wind and solar power are expressly mentioned in the report."
"With the acceptance of the user and polluter pays principles for all modes of transport, the report also delivers a clear message in the debate on the Eurovignette: transport by heavily polluting lorries should no longer be subsidised, and external costs must be completely internalised."
"(Heckling)"
"... and particularly for aircraft."
"Shifting freight traffic from road to rail remains a central aim."
"For this reason the report is demanding a minimum investment of 40% of EU transport funds in the railways."
"Only around 17% of freight is transported by rail in Europe."
"In the highway country of the United States, however, the proportion is 40%."
"The EU will only be able to deal with the increase in freight traffic if it improves its rail infrastructure."
"The Member States' transport ministers are being asked as a matter of urgency to look beyond their national perspectives and make the investments necessary for Europe in their own countries."
"Interconnection of transport modes is also important."
"A standard carriage document is also required for shipment by sea, rail, lorry and aircraft, a European maritime transport space without barriers, a not only European, but also worldwide standard for intermodal loading units and, in particular, a better connection between maritime and river ports and the hinterland's road and rail network."
"Despite the unanimous vote, my group put forward amendments because some votes in committee were extremely close."
"The most important amendment concerns the challenge to the Commission to specify the areas of major congestion and problems in the European rail freight transport system."
"This kind of analysis is necessary in order to quickly eliminate the weak spots in the rail network and thus create greater capacity."
"The Commission itself, incidentally, has very much welcomed this idea and I hope that tomorrow - during the vote in plenary - a majority will be obtained on this."
"Many thanks once again to all my fellow Members and for their attentiveness."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, in a set of four communications adopted in 2007 and 2008, the Commission has developed its strategy for improving the performance of the systems of freight transport in Europe."
"These communications are: firstly, the EU's freight transport agenda, boosting the efficiency, integration and sustainability of freight transport in Europe; secondly, the action plan for freight transport logistics; thirdly, towards a rail network giving priority to freight; and fourthly, the multiannual contract for rail infrastructure quality."
"I am particularly pleased to see that all of these communications have now become the subject of a motion for a resolution in your assembly, which indicates the importance Parliament attaches to this matter."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Michael Cramer, for the work that he has done, and all the Members who have contributed to it."
"In terms of tonnes per kilometre, the White Paper of 2001 foresaw a 50% growth in goods transport in Europe between 2000 and 2020."
"The Commission will update that estimate next year, but it is already clear that it was pretty accurate."
"The major challenges presented by this growth, the fight against congestion and climate change, reductions in pollutant emissions and guaranteed security of the energy supply are more topical now than ever they have been."
"The choice of means of transport should, therefore, be directed towards the least pollutant ones, although each means of transport, including road transport, should be used where it is most efficient and most suitable."
"There is also a need to improve the efficiency of the European transport system by implementing measures aimed at introducing information technology on a large scale, in administrative simplification as well as enhanced service quality."
"I welcome the fact that the draft report is encouraging the Commission to pursue a goods transport policy that places a greater emphasis on sustainability."
"Our wish is to create a transport system that is reliable, effective and viable, both financially and environmentally."
"To this end I am convinced that co-modality - that is, the rational and optimum use of all modes of transport on their own and in combination - must become one of the guiding rules behind our thinking and action."
"In addition, the various modes of transport must meet a number of performance criteria that are essential to competitiveness."
"In particular, punctuality, regularity, reliability, high quality, sufficient capacity, interoperability and transnational coordination on international corridors are some of the watchwords for an array of services that has the customer absolutely in mind."
"It is through specific, immediate action at a controlled cost such as those contained in the text of your resolution, together with other European initiatives such as the Green Paper on the future of the TEN-T, that we will be able to increase the efficiency of the European transport system."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group supports the own-initiative report by the Committee on Transport and Tourism with its multifaceted proposals for freight transport in Europe."
"The framework conditions for environmentally friendly freight transport tailored to suit market needs are crucial for growth and employment in the European Union."
"I must also say, however, that the European Union and the Member States are being called upon to increase their efforts considerably in developing and upgrading efficient transport structures."
"We shall be reminding the Commission of this when we carry out the mid-term review of finances."
"Making grand speeches does not help if the money is not made available to upgrade the trans-European networks."
"Upgrading the transport infrastructures applies in particular to rail transport."
"The priority here is to upgrade the most heavily used rail corridors and equip them with the ERTMS cross-border European rail traffic control system so that we quickly shift freight transport from road to rail."
"However, to tell you the truth, Commissioner, when you compiled the list of proposals for freight services - I still remember that Neil Kinnock had already had the idea of separate rail networks for freight transport - you were once again acting on the Commission's proposal 'Towards a rail network giving priority to freight'."
"Since that time nobody at the Commission has been talking about this because you and we know that there is not enough money to provide a second rail network alongside a normal, sensibly developed system tailored to suit market needs."
"As the Commission you should therefore be telling the truth: the idea of separate freight networks is dead."
"Let us develop sensible, dual-use networks: primarily passenger trains by day and primarily freight trains by night."
"We then have to resolve the problem of noise because in cities in Germany and elsewhere, and along the Rhine, the noise at night really gets on citizens' nerves and stops them sleeping."
"Therefore, let us talk about practical sound-proofing measures on the railways, on the trans-European networks and on the dual use of the rail network."
"It is even more important, however, that we take sensible action on the logistics."
"That, Mr Cramer, is mentioned all too little in the report."
"It is important that the Member States and the EU work more effectively together with industry and the service enterprises in order to make better use of the freight logistics."
"The use of logistics is, of course, a primary task of the enterprises."
"They know best how logistics are used."
"However, the European Union and the Member States can help by lifting unnecessary national restrictions and - this I fully concede to Mr Cramer - by providing standard customs documents, for example, in order that better use can be made of the logistics."
"Let us therefore upgrade the infrastructure nationally and let us cooperate with the industry in determining the best use of transport logistics."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the Commission for the Logistics Action Plan, which has taken into account the majority of the European Parliament's previous proposals."
"I would also like to thank Mr Cramer, the rapporteur, for being open to constructive dialogue. This has achieved a more integrative text in which logistics should not only contribute to the sustainability of transport in general, and of freight transport in particular, but also to improving mobility by including logistical solutions for all modes of transport and support for green corridors as models of mobility and convenience."
"I also welcome the fact that emphasis is placed on using the existing rail traffic networks which are being freed up as a result of the progress made with high-speed passenger trains, and can be specifically dedicated to freight transport."
"I also think that the inclusion of the prominent role of internal logistical platforms and dry docks is important, as well as the promotion of urban logistics through determinedly enhancing the logistics aspect of the very interesting CIVITAS programme, which we welcome."
"We would also like to thank Mr Cramer for the emphasis placed on the logistics factor in priority cross-border rail freight corridors, among which I must mention the line that includes the central Pyrenees crossing that will be a future link between the Spanish logistical platforms such as Plaza and those in the South of France."
"To conclude I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the proposal to arrive at a programme for strengthening cooperation between the national logistics plans of the Member States by the end of this year, which would help to prepare more effective formulas for mitigating the current shortage of resources and dealing with the needs of what is a key sector at this time, in this economic climate, in which fuel prices, the demands of combating climate change, the peripherality caused by enlargement and the dangerous working conditions in the sector mean that it is more urgent that intelligent, innovative and attractive solutions are applied, which only an ambitious European logistics action plan can offer us."
"My group therefore supports Mr Cramer's report and his Amendment 4 on multi-annual contracts."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, at various stages of the production process goods are hauled to a faraway place, subsequently ending up in a completely different place as finished products."
"They are often transported in the most environmentally unfriendly way: by lorry on the increasingly congested motorways."
"The enormous growth in freight transport, which is still continuing, has been caused by a steady decrease in the costs involved."
"This is bad news for the environment, for safety, for working conditions and also for animal welfare."
"My group therefore opts for restricting the growth in transport, and for transferring the necessary remaining transport to the railways and inland waterways as far as possible."
"This desire is reflected in toned-down form in the European Commission proposals and in the supplementary proposals by the rapporteur, Mr Cramer."
"We object to the possibility of precedence being given to freight transport at the expense of passenger trains, however."
"The growth in freight transport may necessitate a supplementary infrastructure to prevent the two interfering with each other."
"In addition, I would draw attention to the problems with the launch of the uniform European safety system ERTMS."
"Investment in this will be beneficial for the future, but will cause problems in the short term."
"Madam President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Cramer for his work as rapporteur."
"The report is a good one, and I should like to highlight the following aspects of it."
"Freight traffic must be unrestricted, honest and clean, and we are working hard in this House to make this happen."
"Earlier this year, the end of cabotage restrictions came into view."
"That was a good start."
"This report continues in that vein, and that is excellent."
"The rapporteur rightly points out that urban freight logistics require a specific approach."
"It is of the utmost importance that European towns and cities be cleaned up."
"I think that computerised speed adjustment in towns and cities is an excellent instrument, therefore, and I hope that the European Commission will support measures and make proposals to ensure that freight transport in towns and cities is not constantly having to brake and accelerate."
"This is the way to make freight transport faster and cleaner."
"(RO) The Union's economic development and competitiveness depend on efficient transport of goods."
"We have to develop the railway infrastructure, the maritime corridors, the ports infrastructure and co-modality."
"Improving the connections between seaports and river ports and the inland railway and road network is an important component of the logistic infrastructure."
"Romania's and Bulgaria's accession provides the European Union with an exit to the Black Sea."
"The Danube is now almost entirely a waterway inside the Union."
"This means new opportunities for the European transport of goods."
"Nevertheless, I emphasize that the efficient transport of goods needs: balanced use of all types of transport, decongesting traffic, simplifying procedures, legislative stability, investments in logistics systems and intelligent transport systems, such as Galileo, but especially ensuring transportation safety."
"Programmes such as Naiades and Marco Polo are not sufficiently used by Member States in order to improve the transport of goods."
"Nevertheless, I call the Commission's attention to the barriers met by some road carriers, and I refer to the Romanian ones, when transiting the territory of certain Member States."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we also have to think of our own failings, of course."
"We cannot always be talking about sustainable transport on Sundays and doing the opposite from Monday to Friday."
"It does seem to be the case that in the Commission 60% of the money flowing into transport flows into roads as co-financing and only 20% of it into environmentally friendly railways."
"It can be said that transport in Europe is too cheap and environmentally friendly transport too expensive."
"This is also to do with the framework conditions."
"We do, for example, have a compulsory rail toll system for each Member State."
"This applies to every engine, every kilometre of track, whereas the toll in environmentally damaging road transport is voluntary, its amount is limited and it applies only to motorways, and usually only to lorries of 12 tonnes or more. You need to change these unfair framework conditions, otherwise you will resolve neither problems to do with climate policy nor transport problems."
"The forecast is that traffic is on the increase."
"But why is it on the increase?"
"Because it does not cost anything."
"There are several examples that could be mentioned."
"I should like to mention one example from your home country."
"The United Kingdom exports 1.5 million tonnes of pork every year."
"If you look at the balance of imports, this shows that the United Kingdom also imports a further 1.5 million tonnes of pork."
"We could eliminate this."
"We could eliminate this transportation and use the capacity, which we definitely need, to do so."
"In Europe we therefore have to eliminate a lot of the nonsense over transport capacity and then we have to shift transport over to environmentally friendly modes and design it to be efficient so that we can guarantee mobility, while providing people with the goods, but also protecting the environment, because this is the order of the day."
"Without a healthy environment, neither we nor our children and children's children have the future we all want."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 September."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Sustainable and efficient freight transport must indeed seriously be improved as the transport sector is responsible for a large share of CO2 emissions in the Union."
"As the sector is expected to grow substantially, increasing its efficiency and sustainability should be seen as an opportunity to develop its economic competitiveness and to create numerous jobs."
"The Union should therefore allocate resources sufficient to achieve the ambitious objectives of improved mobility, intermodality in transport modes, energy efficiency, reduced consumption of oil and reduced pollution."
"We welcome therefore the strategic approach of the proposed Freight Transport Action Plan and its objectives: to focus on freight corridors using a combination of the various modes of transport; to promote innovative technologies and infrastructures; more efficient freight transport management and to enhance the attractiveness of modes of transport other than road."
"To ensure the success of a sustainable European transport policy, we - of course - have to bear in mind the importance of fostering synergies and complementarities with other European policies such as energy and environment policies."
"Cross-border harmonisation of national rules and synergy with the other related policies are necessary conditions for the achievement of the objectives of sustainable and efficient freight transport."

"(DE) Madam President, just very briefly: some of our colleagues may not be aware of this yet, but it was mentioned to me that yesterday, it was decided that the next part-session will be held in Brussels."
"I have heard that there are tremendous problems getting beds here in Brussels as the hotel rooms are booked out due to a trade fair."
"This part-session should simply have been postponed or transformed into a mini-part-session."
"That would have been the best solution."
"With a measure of good will, that could have been done."
"The second point which I would briefly like to make is directly related to this: has the safety situation actually been checked here in this building?"
"I hear that there are major structural defects here."
"Has this building been checked using the same criteria as have now been applied in the Strasbourg building?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us not start a debate on this topic now."
"Announcements will be made this afternoon at voting time."
"All the appropriate steps are being taken to check the buildings on a preventive basis and to make the appropriate repairs at Strasbourg so that we can return there as soon as possible for our work."
"We shall not return until we are sure that it is safe."
"Madam President, I shall be brief, as I accept you do not want a debate."
"If there is to be an announcement at 12 o'clock, could that announcement also state whether the Bureau is considering - and I am not trying to be provocative - having a longer period of being in Brussels, so that we can have decisions in due time in order to get hotels and meeting rooms?"
"Because these constant one-by-one decisions are not making life easy for any of us."
"Practically, could that be considered, and could we have a comment back in the announcement at 12 o'clock, please?"
"Mr Bushill-Matthews, it is not Parliament's practice to change the sitting from Brussels to Strasbourg for no reason."
"There was a serious, unexpected reason and Parliament is attempting to deal with the matter with composure, determination and consistency."
"We must all show the same composure, seriousness of purpose and maturity."
"Information will be provided when the facts are available and will be given in sufficient time to enable Members to book their rooms on site as necessary."
"I think that what is needed to deal with this problem is maturity, the right attitude and composure."
"I do not consider this to be a serious crisis, as we have averted one that might have occurred."

"Mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by FrÃ©dÃ©rique Ries, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Secretary of State - and may I express our appreciation of the fact that you clearly took trouble to be here in time for the debate -, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, health and the environment are not always compatible subjects, especially now at the beginning of the 21st century."
"Our citizens are exposed to pollution in various forms, more often than not as a combination of different factors, and this applies whether you live in town or in the countryside, by the sea or in the mountains."
"It is therefore anything but a coincidence that, according to the latest statistics put out by Eurostat, six out of every ten Europeans believe it highly or relatively likely that environmental pollution is affecting their health and also, and this is important, that the European Union is not sufficiently active in this area, which is the whole object of our debate this morning."
"First and foremost, I would like to thank my colleagues and most particularly the shadow rapporteurs of this report, Mrs Ferreira, Professor Trakatellis, Mrs Breyer, Mrs BelohorskÃ¡ and Mrs de BrÃºn, for the excellent collaboration that we have maintained since the start of this particular project, which dates back to 2003."
"Indeed it was in 2003 that the European Commission set the ball rolling with what was then the SCALE initiative, which focused on children's health, followed the year after with the launching of an Action Plan that is due to run until 2010."
"This is an initiative that we consider to be inadequate in scope in that at its February 2005 sitting Parliament adopted a resolution that was fairly critical, it has to be said, based on the simple assessment that an action plan, in essence, cannot set itself the sole objective of producing more data and conducting more research, even if these are of an essential nature."
"We were therefore disappointed, and all the more since one Member State after another, notably France with its national health and environment plan along with many of the German LÃ¤nder, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and others, went on to set up ambitious national plans of their own,"
"Three years later how far have we got in reducing illnesses that can be attributed to the impact of pollution?"
"At Community level not very far, it seems to me, and I therefore now want to present a proper mid-term review of the situation as it stands."
"Certainly the European Union, as we have said over and over again, can pride itself on having achieved many successes in combating various forms of pollution."
"While it is impossible to list them all, they include the recent legislation on ambient air quality - which owes much to your vigorous efforts, Commissioner - the pesticides package, which is about to be completed, and of course the REACH initiative, which places controls on more than 10 000 chemical substances and proposes to replace those that are causing the most problems."
"I would also like to mention another important aspect, namely the funding provided by the Commission over the last three years for more than 38 projects devoted to health and the environment as part of the Sixth Research Framework Programme, which comes to an estimated total of more than EUR 200 million."
"In other respects, and given the difficulty of assessing the impact of this plan, which has so far failed to live up to its name, I would say that our overall impression is somewhat mixed."
"Our draft resolution today therefore centres on the need to restore the precautionary principle, which I know is also held dear by the Secretary of State."
"Like her, I sincerely believe that we need to redeem and revive this principle, which as I have said before is that of action rather than abstention, and ensure that it is applied as part of Community policy, as provided for in Article 174(2) of our Treaty and now established as an ongoing precedent by the Court of Justice."
"Still on this subject I believe that it is important that we should seek to shift the burden of proof for all product legislation - and this is what we are providing for in point 13 of our resolution - because it is only right, and indeed it is obvious, that the producers and importers should be responsible for demonstrating that a product is harmless."
"I would add that, wrongly perhaps, this is what most consumers already believe."
"The second subject of concern, and of no less importance, is that which is covered in points 23 to 25, namely the issue of climate change."
"We have examined this crucial question in close collaboration with experts from the WHO."
"The phenomenon that is most frequently depicted by these experts is that of an increased intensity and frequency of heat waves."
"How can we forget that after the summer 2003 heat wave more than 70 000 additional deaths were recorded in some ten European countries?"
"It appears to us that a system of preventive measures - reduced exposure to heat, an early warning system and of course aid for the elderly - needs to be put in place here."
"I would also point out that the increase in temperature levels brings with it the appearance of certain viruses, such as the chikungunya virus that struck Italy in 2007, and that while this was anything but an epiphenomenon, at least according to the experts, it was perhaps an early warning sign of numerous pandemics in Europe."
"Obviously this also calls for a response that is appropriate to the potential scale of the problem, and at the very least a proper system of coordination between the Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm and the various European capitals."
"I would like to round up my presentation by referring to what has, for the health sector, been the soap opera, the saga of summer 2008, one that has been running everywhere in many countries - in France, Belgium and others besides - and here I am talking about the flood of information, articles and studies, most of them contradictory, on the health risks, proven or otherwise, of mobile telephone devices, and particularly of the threat they pose to the most vulnerable groups, especially children."
"Here the highly, if not to say excessively, media-conscious David Servan-Schreiber was not the first to set the alarm bells ringing."
"What we are stating in paragraphs 21 and 22 of our resolution is simple: all these various studies tend to show that electromagnetic fields have an impact on human health; moreover, exposure limits, it has to be recalled, have not been amended since 1999 and therefore remain the official European Union standard, while at the same time we have a complete lack of consensus among researchers as to whether or not GSM waves pose health risks."
"This scientific uncertainty is likely to run and run."
"The time will come when the policy-makers have to take a decision and that is what we are doing in the resolution that is being presented today."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Ries, ladies and gentlemen, European citizens in every country are quite legitimately worried about the quality of the environment and are increasingly concerned about the link between the environment and health."
"The Environment Ministers had an opportunity to deal with this issue last December and the Council is now attaching increasing importance to this matter."
"Different pathologies are involved here, and while these are numerous, the facts and the links between pollution and health have still not been properly established."
"What we are referring to here are respiratory diseases, asthma, allergies, cancer and endocrine disruptors, especially those that affect the most vulnerable sections of the population, as Mrs Ries has already pointed out, including children, pregnant women, the elderly and the disadvantaged."
"The European Union's new strategy to promote sustainable development, as adopted by our heads of state or government in June 2006, quite rightly includes public health as one of the key challenges we face, the aim being to promote health without discrimination and to improve protection against the health risks that are now being posed, and all this has to be achieved - and I will come back to this - by means of robust preventive measures."
"There are several ways of improving the current situation, and all have been mentioned."
"There is better cooperation between the health sector and the environment sector, which unfortunately sometimes tend to develop in separate directions."
"There is the need to improve the quality of the environment, and that is what we are doing, especially with our work on the IPPC Directive and the proposal for a directive on soil quality, which we shall speak about presently, as well as the need currently facing us to improve Community expertise in this area."
"There is the work that we are all doing together at international level, and especially within the World Health Organisation."
"Finally, there is the objective that we are pursuing in a very hands-on way, which is to improve the manner in which environment is incorporated into every relevant policy, plan and programme, and especially in the course of the health and environment programme that is to run from 2004 to 2010."
"In short, it is important to bring this mid-term review to a successful conclusion so as to ensure that the actions taken are as effective as possible."
"Like Mrs Ries, I in turn would like to stress the need for preventive measures in all the different fields of action, and in all the points that have been mentioned in your work."
"The Council in its conclusions of last December, just like Parliament today, takes the view that action is needed as soon as possible."
"We have to act quickly and we have to act ahead of events."
"We need to act according to the principles of prevention and according to the principles of precaution, which certainly means developing new tools capable of anticipating and analysing potential threats as soon as they appear or as soon as any suspicion arises, and then being able to view these various problems against a different background, such as that of climate change or biosecurity, for example, which are both areas that are connected with human health."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, about a year ago now the Commission adopted the mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010."
"This review is a report on the implementation of the Action Plan to date."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament's response to this mid-term review has been positive and that, in common with the Commission, it considers the mutual interaction between the environment and health to be very important."
"I am particularly happy that the French Presidency, both today and via the Minister on previous occasions, has shown its full support for this subject, which is so important to European citizens."
"As you know, the aim of the European Action Plan for the relationship between the environment and health is to improve the provision of information, and to encourage research on the environment and human health, in order to better understand the threats and risk factors posed to human health by the environment. Political leaders at European and national level will thus be able to create more effective legislation and measures to protect the health of European citizens."
"The Plan covers 13 specific courses of action for the 2004-2010 period."
"It was drawn up after extensive consultation with experts and bodies working in the European environmental, health and research sectors."
"In the Action Plan, emphasis is laid on the vital importance of close cooperation between environmental, health and research departments, at both national and European level."
"This cooperation is key in dealing in the best possible way with the mutual impact that the environment and health have on each other."
"Four years after the adoption of the Action Plan I am happy to report that this close cooperation between the various services has now been consolidated."
"This is clearly a very positive development, according to last year's mid-term review."
"Let me give you a specific example."
"The Member States are now working together to coordinate a European approach to the issue of human biomonitoring."
"This involves the ministries of research, health and the environment."
"I think it is important to add that, after the approval of last year's progress report, the Commission also undertook other important activities, especially regarding human biomonitoring, the relationship between climate change and health, air quality in indoor areas, research on the environment, and health and electromagnetic fields."
"I am therefore glad that these issues are included in the European Parliament's report."
"Let me briefly elaborate on the new developments."
"The Commission is now adopting a broader approach to the issue of air quality in indoor areas."
"This approach also corresponds to the European Parliament's 2005 resolution."
"Many activities have been undertaken that go beyond the specific targets in the Action Plan."
"For instance, new research projects have been funded by the Commission, a working group of experts has been set up and a Green Paper on tobacco smoke and scientific opinions have been approved."
"What still remains to be decided is the legal means to deal with the issue of air in indoor areas in the best possible way."
"With regard to human biomonitoring, the Commission regrets that the proposal submitted by the consortium of 24 Member States was not judged suitable for funding on the basis of the 7th Framework Programme."
"In any case, a new call will be published this month to submit proposals on human biomonitoring."
"Meanwhile, the Commission will continue preparatory work on the pilot project within the framework of an ERA-NET network and within the framework of an administrative arrangement with the Joint Research Centre in Ispra in close collaboration with the Member States."
"As for electromagnetic fields, the Commission is carrying out continuous monitoring of scientific developments, through the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks and through the ÎÎÎ¤ network for electromagnetic fields, a project in the 6th Framework Programme."
"The Commission is promoting research in the most important subject areas in order to determine whether the exposure limit values laid down in the Council's recommendation should be revised."
"The Commission recently asked each Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to reconsider its opinion on the basis of the most recent data and reports."
"The relationship between climate change and health is clearly an issue of growing importance, according to the mid-term review."
"The relationship will be dealt with in the White Paper on adaptation to climate change, due to be adopted very soon."
"These developments show that the Commission places great importance on an even higher level of incorporation of the health dimension into European environmental policy."
"Recent legislation, such as that on chemicals, REACH, and the new directive on ambient air quality, reinforce environmental and health protection and are examples of a mutually beneficial way of dealing with the environment and health in the interests of European citizens."
"Finally, let me thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, for her report, her excellent work and the enormous interest she has shown in the issue of the relationship between the environment and health."
"I should also like to reiterate the firm intention of the Commission to continue its efforts on the Environment and Health Action Plan."
"The Commission is determined to shape effective environmental legislation and ensure the correct implementation of existing legislation in order to protect both the environment and the health of European citizens."
"With this in mind, the Commission will play an active role in preparations for the Fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health, scheduled to be held in July 2009."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, allow me first to welcome Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, whose convictions and determination in this area are well known, along with the Commissioner."
"I would of course also like to congratulate Mrs Ries for the excellent work that she has carried out in dealing with an issue that is of special importance and sensitivity for our citizens."
"Hippocrates once said that to study medicine you have to study the climate."
"While we can certainly recognise the efforts that the European Commission has made since the launch of the Environment and Health Action Plan in 2004, it is a matter of some regret that this initiative is not based on a genuine prevention policy that is aimed at reducing diseases linked to environmental factors and one that pursues a clear and properly costed objective."
"Ten years ago, when climate change was being debated, the health risks as such were never mentioned."
"Today the frequent occurrence of heat waves, floods, wildfires and natural disasters of all kinds within the European Union is altering the appearance of those illnesses that are caused by bacteria and viruses and transmitted by some insects."
"We therefore have to acquire a better understanding of the consequences that all this may have for human health, and especially that of the most vulnerable members of society, so that we become better able to manage the risks involved."
"Where the main objective of the 2008-2013 health programme is to act upon the factors that traditionally determine health, namely diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and the use of drugs, the present 2004-2010 Action Plan is to focus on certain new health challenges and address the determining environmental factors that affect human health."
"I am also thinking about air quality, electromagnetic waves - a subject that has already been touched on - worrying nanoparticles, as we have seen in the REACH programme, substances that are classed as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, endocrine disruptors and all the health risks posed by climate change, and I have already spoken about these."
"I also wish to point out that while respiratory illnesses rank second as a cause of death and in terms of incidence, prevalence and cost, within the EU they constitute the main cause of death among children under the age of five and are continuing to progress on account of indoor and outdoor air pollution in particular."
"With reference to the subject of urban environmental health, and particularly the quality of indoor air, the Commission should do more to combat domestic pollution, given that Europeans spend on average 90% of their time inside buildings."
"We know that this subject, this link between environment and health, is a particularly important and sensitive issue and we need to find a proper response to it as soon as possible for our citizens' sake."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to salute the work done by our colleague and the determination she has shown in dealing with this dossier."
"This is a determination that I share, because the link between environment and health, which is now widely recognised, warrants a response in the shape of our political actions."
"It is therefore essential to move forward so as to update our knowledge in this area and, more especially, to implement actions designed to limit the negative impact of our environment on human health."
"The different subject areas have been clearly identified and are covered in the Action Plan."
"It has been necessary not only to take account of the effects of climate change and to devise methods of risk assessment but also to discuss other factors such as electromagnetic fields."
"I am also gratified to see that the report contains a reference to the 2007 document produced by the European Environment Agency showing that atmospheric pollutants, and particularly those associated with fine particles and ground-level ozone, represent a considerable threat to the proper development of children and are reducing life expectancy in the EU."
"However, I regret that the problems associated with health in the work environment have not been included in the text."
"It should be remembered that millions of people now suffer from illnesses that are linked to their working environment and whose origins are many and varied: stress, work intensity, various pollutants, musculoskeletal disorders associated with poor workplace ergonomics and so on."
"I hope that this issue will be considered seriously by other committees."
"As Mrs Ries has said, the biggest problem is also that we are falling behind."
"The Commission, it seems to me, has not been sufficiently active in honouring the commitments that it set itself."
"Here I would refer, for example, to the issue of nanoparticles, a subject that is currently the focus of numerous reports and one that is raising many questions."
"For example, I read in the Commission's 2007 communication on the objectives for 2004-2006 that the intention is to examine the possible effects of nanoparticles on health and the environment."
"Following that, for the 2007-2010 period there is provision for research into the potential risk that nanoparticles pose for human health."
"This means three years to look into a subject and another three years to carry out studies. It seems to me that we could be more efficient than this."
"Doubtless there are reasons for this inadequate approach: lack of human resources and lack of financial means."
"However, what kind of credibility can the EU expect if it fails to keep to its own commitments?"
"We know that on these issues Europeans can recognise the valued added of the European dimension. Let us therefore not disappoint them."
"I will finish with a question that is directed at the Council and at the Commission: you referred, Commissioner, to cooperation between the different services and between the research teams, which is a good thing."
"Is there also coordination between the different national environmental-health plans drawn up at government level and the European Action Plan?"
"Finally, Madam Minister, when you take the floor again, perhaps you can tell us whether France, for example, has linked its efforts to those that it has been making under the environmental Grenelle?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Madam President, I usually say that the EU must become narrower but sharper, in other words that we should focus our actions while also respecting subsidiarity."
"This action plan is exactly this kind of area."
"I would like to raise a few things which our rapporteur Mrs Ries addresses in her report."
"Her criticism of the lack of quantified objectives and indicators is very serious."
"We must add to the action plan."
"The criticism from Mrs Ries and several other Members of the fact that there are insufficient precautionary measures is serious."
"It is directed at this material and we must take it into account in our ongoing work."
"I would particularly like to highlight three areas: weak groups, endemic disease and the link between climate and health."
"We must become much better at seeing the differences in treatment and medication of adults and children, and women and men."
"It is a scandal that this is still not self-evident and has not already been implemented in medical research and treatment."
"The work which has started on patient mobility in the internal market is incredibly important to different patient groups, e.g. those with neck injuries, where different standards of treatment are found in different Member States."
"I welcome the focus of the French Presidency on Alzheimer's disease, one of our major endemic diseases, but we also need a coordinated approach for diabetes, asthma and rheumatism, to name but a few examples."
"This is also the case for working environment-related injuries."
"We are now witnessing a trend in Europe and worldwide of more pandemics and the greater spreading of viruses, bacteria and parasites in a manner which has not been seen in a very long time."
"Much of this is naturally related to climate change."
"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria mean medicines and treatments are not working and this is one of our most urgent health problems."
"It is a shame that the development of new antibiotics has largely ground to a halt in the major pharmaceutical companies."
"I hope that the Presidency and the Commission will tackle this very serious and major problem as soon as possible!"
"We also need an analysis of different climate change scenarios."
"What effect would a global increase in temperature of two degrees, four degrees or even more have on health in Europe?"
"No such material is available today."
"If we are to be able to make concrete and good decisions on the climate change package, we also need reliable material on the various climate scenarios we will have to cope with in the future."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, as I take the floor on behalf of the UEN Group in the debate on the mid-term review of the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010, I should like to draw attention to the following issues."
"Firstly, the very appropriate measures to improve the natural environment and combat climate change require additional financial resources. This puts public authorities and economic entities in the new Member States in a particularly difficult situation."
"The new Member States are obviously focusing mainly on catching up with the more developed countries of the European Union in terms of development."
"Secondly, the European Union is endeavouring to take the lead, for example as regards limiting carbon dioxide emissions, but the Commission allocated the limits without taking account of how much individual Member States had to make up in terms of development."
"As a result, my country, Poland, was awarded a lower limit of carbon dioxide emissions. This led to electricity prices rising immediately by between 10 and 20 per cent."
"I dread to think how far electricity prices will rise after 2013, when power stations will have to purchase all their emissions limits on the open market."
"In this way, a sensible measure to limit carbon dioxide emissions and thus combat climate change has become a burden for consumers and resulted in increasingly widespread social discontent."
"Thirdly, the appropriate measures contained in the report on health care also require additional financial resources."
"It is particularly hard for the less developed Member States to find these resources, as they are already experiencing serious difficulties in financing very basic health care for their citizens."
"As I conclude, I should like to thank Mrs Ries for a very comprehensive and detailed report on the impact of the natural environment on human health."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we are at the half-way point in this Action Plan, and it is time for a review."
"We are taking stock of what has been done up to now, and the question we must ask ourselves is this: have there been any visible results?"
"The Commission is sitting back and saying that it is satisfied."
"However, if the air we breathe and the water we drink are making us ill, it is high time for Europe to take action and become the driving force for a new overall approach to such health risks."
"That is why the Action Plan cannot be regarded as simply an add-on to existing EU policy; it must set new benchmarks."
"I welcome the fact that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has adopted a highly critical position towards the Action Plan and has demanded major improvements."
"We are firmly convinced that the Action Plan is doomed to failure unless it is based on a pro-active policy of prevention, and one thing must be clear: without clear-cut quantitative goals, it will remain a paper tiger."
"We are pleased that the environmental report bears a green handprint, especially when it comes to nanotechnology."
"It is clear that the potential new risks have not been taken into adequate account in the Action Plan."
"Indeed, it is scandalous that when it comes to the risks associated with nanotechnology, the European Commission is still burying its head in the sand and is claiming that the current legislation in place is quite adequate."
"We know that the very opposite is true."
"Nanotechnology is being allowed to develop in what is in effect a legal vacuum."
"Then there is the issue of electrosmog: we know that electromagnetic radiation poses a major and increasing problem, so it is quite unacceptable for us, as the European Parliament, to water down limit values which are already set much too high."
"Yet another issue is indoor air quality: the EU has set milestones when it comes to protection against fine particles, but what about indoor air quality, given that we spend most of our time in closed rooms?"
"The Commission cannot continue to ignore this issue."
"We call on the Commission to bring forward clear legislative proposals to improve air quality in all the relevant areas: construction projects, glues used in furniture, etc."
"Achieving better protection for particularly vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women is also a matter which is very close to our hearts, and the precautionary principle should be the guiding principle for our legislation in all these areas."
"Naturally, we would have liked to achieve more, but we hope that the Commission will not stop at that. This area of work must not be allowed to come to a standstill, and we believe that we can take this issue forward."
"I want to welcome this report from Ms. Ries."
"I call upon the Commission and Member States to recommit fully to the goals of the European Environment and Health Action Plan and furthermore to step up the plan by making it more ambitious and more in tune with our needs."
"I welcome, in particular, that which Commissioner Dimas had to say."
"The rise in the incidents of certain types of cancer shows us that we cannot afford to rest on our laurels."
"In particular, I want to single out action in the field of mental health as being of the utmost importance."
"Mental ill-health is a major risk factor for suicide in Ireland and suicide itself is the biggest killer of our young people."
"The EU should give more support to developing adequate prevention strategies, any actions at an EU or international level to help us promote mental health would be welcomed warmly."
"I also support the calls for action on the issue of indoor air quality and on the safety of chemical compounds used in equipment and furnishings."
"The Commission has taken some important action but we need a comprehensive policy on indoor air quality given the extent of respitory illness in the EU."
"We must also provide support for our SME's to ensure that they can comply with environmental health regulations and to take steps to improve the impact they have on the environment."
"In my constituency a wonderful project in relation to this subject was supported by Interreg."
"Our climate is changing and this brings with it new challenges in both the fields of health and environment."
"The new threats to our environment and our health caused by climate change must be met head-on and in an effective way."
"A lot has been done, but more ambition and sensible concrete actions is the message I want to send to the European Commission today.!"
"(SK) Thank you, Commissioner, and you, Minister, for coming to listen to our views."
"Thank you to FrÃ©dÃ©rique Ries, the rapporteur, for producing this report."
"This is a very ambitious programme, which is very difficult, even impossible, to assess."
"Furthermore, we are assessing the implementation of ambitious objectives in the highly diverse environment of the 27 Member States with differing health care systems and differing natural environments."
"One of the most serious worries going forward is cancer."
"We have often been faced with future predictions which are very threatening."
"There are statistics showing that this disease results in a huge loss of population mainly of working and retirement age."
"In many cases, the effect of the environment on the state of health of the population has been clearly demonstrated."
"No less important - and the report supports my emphasis on this - is the provision of information to the population concerning both the effects of the environment on health and the incidence of serious diseases and concerning the ability of various non-governmental organisations to support these activities."
"There are two sides to every coin: on one side, an important role is played by the provision of information by the European Union or local institutions, but on the other side, it is very important for the population to have access, to know how to obtain such information and facts and how to deal with them."
"Prevention is only effective if its properly understood and interpreted and, if these conditions are met, it is also possible to monitor the response in real figures."
"It is possible to assess the plan with a short-term view, but the main consequences of implementation of these tools are best observed and quantified with a long-term view."
"Madam President, while this review is very welcome, I think we also need more frankness in the debate, and we must accept that we cannot protect people - our citizens - from themselves, nor should we try to legislate for all life's risks."
"Popular support for the EU project is actually at risk if we give the impression that we are on a mission to regulate every aspect of our lives - and that is the interpretation on the ground at the moment."
"We must be very careful to communicate exactly what the EU project is all about."
"I would also like reassurance that the majority of this plan is not just repackaging and rebranding of projects already planned."
"We need better implementation of existing EU legislation at Member State level, and better monitoring and enforcement by the Commission."
"Greater assessment and, indeed, debate on the roll-out and effectiveness of the existing legislation is a priority as far as I am concerned."
"The priority concern in terms of new legislation in this House has to be the climate and energy package."
"Climate change will impact on health in many ways, including malnutrition resulting from food scarcity in parts of the world; deaths and injuries as a result of extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, storms, and fires and the consequent social problems therefrom; the increased burden of a range of diarrhoeal diseases; increased frequency of cardio-respiratory diseases; serious problems with water scarcity - over 40% of the world will, in part, actually have water scarcity problems within 10 years - and drinking water."
"It is very welcome that this resolution on the mid-term review recognises the health impacts of climate change, and I applaud it for that."
"On another point, a very serious issue - which really is still a Cinderella issue in terms of how we treat it at European and Member State level - is the whole area around European mental health."
"One in four Europeans suffers from mental health problems at least once during their life."
"In Ireland alone, the cost of mental ill health is estimated at up to 4% of our GDP and, tragically, there were over 460 suicides last year alone - recorded suicides."
"That was an increase of 12% on the previous year, in 2006 - in Ireland, a country which, on the best-place-to-live barometers, comes way up there, I think after Luxembourg."
"(I do not know who draws up the criteria for these barometers.) But we have to question this."
"This problem with mental health in Europe, and the projected problems, deserves attention and adequate prevention strategies in this most important area."
"The rapporteur's prognosis that the action plan is bound to fail, in all or part, is worrying, and I would like to hear reassurances from the Commission - but also from the presidency - that this will not be the case."
"(EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on her comprehensive and cohesive report, which objectively assesses the progress made in implementing the European Action Plan 2004-2010 while at the same time taking note of shortcomings and new data."
"Let me point out some issues relating to indoor air quality and its impact on human health, especially for the most vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly."
"Bearing in mind that we spend 90% of our time indoors, the European Commission must proceed immediately to the drafting of a strategy for this, focusing on both establishing guidelines and protecting citizens who are exposed to multiple sources of biological and chemical pollution."
"It is essential that a suitable framework is established to reduce exposure to chemicals."
"Particular emphasis must be placed on the condition of public buildings, offices and schools, so that we can protect the most vulnerable."
"(PL) Madam President, the link between health and the environment is obvious, as is the link between the environment and agriculture, because sensible and rational farming helps to protect the environment."
"We are unfortunately faced with certain developments in agriculture that are detrimental to the environment."
"Small family farms are disappearing, and European agriculture is becoming more and more industrialised, which is damaging to the environment."
"Agricultural policy should do more to protect smaller family farms, because they are run in a more environmentally-friendly manner."
"GMO technology represents a further threat. It continues to spread despite the many serious concerns about the negative effects of GMO crops on the environment and on human and animal health."
"The European Union should act with caution regarding GMOs."
"I support the report by Mrs Ries who deserves to be congratulated on her excellent work."
"(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincerest thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, for her excellent work."
"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the criticism which many here have made about the programme itself."
"It relies on existing measures and not on showing the way forward."
"Time and again the precautionary principle is ignored when people get excited about new discoveries."
"This is also apparent now with regard to nanomaterials and electromagnetic fields."
"Nanomaterials are becoming a more common phenomenon, even in consumer products, but the legislation is lagging behind, although researchers warn that nanomaterials could become a health problem on the scale of asbestos unless we take the risks seriously."
"The same goes for electromagnetic fields, to which hundreds of millions of people are exposed, even though we know very little about their effects."
"In some countries, such as Italy, there is a 500 metre safety zone between base stations and schools, while in Finland there are base stations even on the roofs of schools."
"New European norms which take account of scientific findings are urgently needed for this."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with Mrs Ries's assessment of the environment and health action plan."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that the plan is impossible to interpret and is doomed to failure."
"Some of its objectives such as the prevention of suicide or a communication strategy on the impact of climate change on human health are astonishing."
"The plan is ill-founded, both financially and in particular from an organisational perspective."
"The actions to be implemented are vague and give rise to doubts and questions rather than providing answers."
"The document also duplicates the World Health Organisation's similar plan."
"The European Environment and Health Action Plan is unfortunately just another subject for justified criticism as a waste of taxpayers' money and pointless bureaucracy in Brussels."
"I believe that the Commission should immediately terminate the implementation of this plan, cooperate more closely with the World Health Organisation and definitely not announce a further phase of the health plan at European level."
"(PT) I want to start by congratulating Mrs Ries on her work."
"The relationship between a poor environment and health risks is now clear."
"There are now more diseases associated with environmental factors and climate change, such as respiratory diseases, allergies and cancers."
"Global warming is at the root of new pandemics."
"Studies show that droughts and floods kill more people than any other natural disaster."
"Poor air quality in schools and health establishments also causes serious problems."
"Increasing numbers of people are falling ill due to air pollution in the big cities and inside buildings, due to the pollution of water and even groundwater, due to contamination of agricultural land with plant protection products and due to a lack of treatment of wastewater and urban waste."
"Measures need to be taken to prevent future problems."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Ries is absolutely beyond reproach, especially since the rapporteur monitors the implementation of the Commission's planned actions with close, unstinting attention, as well as by asking questions, and demands further efforts in the hoped-for preventive strategy which must characterise European policy action."
"I likewise applaud the request for the Commission to publish a Green Paper on indoor air quality, and I would draw attention to the sensitivity shown by the rapporteur as concerns the effect that electromagnetic fields have on human health."
"All in all, I can endorse everything said by Mrs Ries, and I hope this report will garner the widest possible support from Parliament."
"(RO) Climate change influences human health considerably, by the proliferation of certain infectious and parasitic diseases, mainly caused by the increase in temperature."
"The frequency of heat waves, floods and fires on uncultivated land may lead to the occurrence of other diseases, to inadequate hygiene conditions and deaths."
"In summers, Romania has increasingly dealt with periods of hot weather, floods and storms."
"This summer's floods have left thousands of Romanian citizens without a shelter and hygiene conditions."
"I request the Commission to provide Romania with adequate financial support in order to reduce the effects of these natural disasters."
"The reduction of emissions generated by transport, which is responsible for 70% of the urban pollution, shall contribute to the air quality improvement."
"Directives such as on fuel quality, reduction of road vehicle emissions, and promotion of ecological vehicles for urban transport, shall contribute to the reduction of environmental pollution."
"Nevertheless, it is important to monitor their implementation and the results achieved."
"(RO) The international ""BioInitiativeâ report on electromagnetic fields and their effects on human health raises concerns and finds that the existing limit values as regards the protection against non-ionizing radiations are out-of-date and immediate actions are required in order to reduce people's exposure to the radiations generated by the equipment used by the mobile telephone operators."
"Scientific studies have shown that these radiations generate health problems, such as sleep disorder, child leukaemia, significant increase in stress and the use of a mobile phone for ten years doubles the risk of brain cancer."
"The new action and health plan has to take into consideration these threats that are increasing due to the occurrence of new technologies and are gaining ground in rural areas and developing countries."
"We need to continue the research in this field and the fields related to mental health, such as stress and depression, in order to determine if they can be truly associated with non-ionising radiations."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report on this subject, which is of such importance for all of us Europeans."
"I wish to focus on one particular issue and highlight the importance of bio monitoring. This is the procedure whereby the relationship between environmental pollution and the health of Europeans is measured."
"We should not skimp on resources for this strategy."
"We should invest in research, and then implement its findings."
"In addition, we should not merely pay lip service to the precautionary principle. We should apply this principle if we are ever uncertain as to the possible negative impact of a specific environmental issue on our health."
"The precautionary principle also prevents the spread of illnesses."
"It will prevent the spread of allergies and improve the way Europeans live and operate."
"I believe that the European Union must do more in the area of environmental diseases and take more effective action in the interests of the citizen."
"I expect the Commission to do so too."
"(SK) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, on her report, which describes the extent of implementation of the Action Plan and puts forward many recommendations for the next stage."
"I welcome the measures introduced by the European Commission with the aim of improving the environment in indoor spaces."
"As a doctor, I consider this step to be very important."
"In offices, schools and homes we all spend the overwhelming majority of our time in enclosed spaces."
"High levels of pollution may result in asthmatic diseases, allergies and even cancer."
"I therefore support the proposal to publish a Green Paper and to adopt a proper European strategy on this topic."
"I also consider it important to draw our attention to electromagnetic radiation."
"Technical progress may, when used incorrectly or excessively, represent a definite health risk, whether in the form of irregular sleep patterns, Alzheimer's disease, leukaemia or other disorders."
"The European Community must therefore become more actively engaged and adopt a position with respect to this modern threat as well as taking practical steps."
"(RO) I would like to add the fact that the Union's population is ageing and I consider that the European Environment and Health Plan should deal with the problems that old people have."
"Nevertheless, the perspective of the year 2010 is not very near."
"I think a long-term perspective and an adequate strategy are required."
"We should also not forget that the birth rate has decreased in recent years."
"In some Member States, the rate of child mortality is high."
"The Union's economic sustainability is based upon a young and healthy European population and, consequently, the Union needs to come up with a concrete action plan in order to ensure the natural growth the community needs."
"I end by reminding you of the need to conduct epidemiological studies, under the Commission's care, in order to determine the effect of electromagnetic radiation on human health."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to highlight the fact that many of the Members who have spoken in this debate have chosen to tie in other environmental problems and it seems to me that they are right to do so, and that this being the case you are in fact calling on us to apply greater coordination and greater integration between the different environmental policies."
"I have taken note, for example, of the reference to climate change made by Mrs Ek, by Mrs Å¢icÇu and even by Mr KuÅºmiuk, even though his intervention was focused in a different direction, and of the reference to agricultural problems made by Mr Wojciechowski, along with the reference to the Urban Waste Water Directive made by Mrs Estrela."
"All these subjects are interlinked and this apparent complexity must provide us with the additional motivation needed to improve our knowledge of environmental health issues."
"Yes, Mrs Doyle, the presidency is totally motivated in this direction."
"This will be achieved by way of the directives that we are working on at the present time, namely the IPPC Directive, the proposal for a soils directive and the energy-climate package, as I am reminded of the link with climate change."
"Through these directives we are in a way addressing subjects and establishing links with various recognised pathologies such as cancer, which has already been referred to by Mrs BelohorskÃ¡."
"However many new problems are also arising and these have been touched on by a number of today's speakers."
"The problem of electromagnetic waves has already been researched in some detail, and here I am thinking especially of the Interphone study, but there are also new technologies coming on to the market all the time and these will in any case compel us to take an extremely long-term approach."
"I am also thinking of indoor air quality, a subject mentioned by many of you, which is something that should not be regarded as an emergent issue since it has always existed. However, it is much less researched than that of outdoor air quality, even though we spend 90% of our time indoors."
"Mrs Ferreira wanted to know if there was a link, for example, at national level in France between the environmental Grenelle and the European Action Plan."
"Within the context of the environmental Grenelle we have done a lot of work on environmental health issues and have come up against the same problems as those that you have been commenting on in one way or another."
"First of all we have the recognised pathologies, those areas that are well documented and where further progress needs to be made, including the question of cancers linked to environmental causes."
"Then we have all the new concerns where our actions can go much further."
"In the environmental Grenelle, for example, we have made provision for classifying all nanoparticles, for setting up a compulsory declaration process for those nanoparticles that are being put on the market, for providing a better regulation and monitoring system for indoor air and for introducing better controls for all interior equipment and furnishings, some of which present problems for indoor air quality."
"Mrs Ferreira, you asked about coordination and whether there was in fact any degree of coordination between the national environmental-health schemes and the European Action Plan."
"Clearly any link of this kind will present problems."
"We are currently in a phase in which each Member State is drawing up its own plan based on its own particular problem areas."
"Having said this, it seems to me that a measure of coordination could be introduced once this initial phase has been completed and this would provide the basis for the next stage of the process."
"Finally, if you would permit me, Madam President, I would like to allude to the fact that - while not wishing to offend those male Members who are also present and indeed I would thank them for their contributions - it has mainly been the female Members of this House who have spoken this morning and I see in this situation not a problem but rather an opportunity and perhaps also a sign of hope."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for the constructive discussion we have had on the important issue of the relationship between the environment and health."
"I think this discussion has been a very useful opportunity to exchange views on the progress that has been made and the research carried out in key areas, with the aim of determining whether the exposure limit values set out in the Council recommendation need to be revised."
"The Commission recently asked its scientific committee for the emerging and most recently identified health risks, with a view to revising its opinion to take account of the most recent information in the report."
"The latest developments and the initiatives taken by the Commission on the specific issues of the environment-health relationship are very significant; they show that alongside the cooperation developing on a mid- to long-term basis between the environment, health and research sectors, it is possible to take immediate measures to further incorporate the health dimension into environment policy, with benefits to both the environment and health."
"Now to the coordination that one of the speakers mentioned."
"Coordination between the various national environment and health action plans is achieved firstly through the Forum on Environment and Health under the auspices of the European Commission, and secondly through the WHO, in whose relevant activities the Commission actively participates."
"As regards nanomaterials, six weeks ago, on 17 June 2008, the Commission adopted a communication on the scope of application of EU legislation to nanomaterials, which underlines the importance of applying the prevention principle in this area."
"EU legislation may not refer directly to the term 'nanomaterials', but it should be accepted that EU legislation does to a large extent cover the risks associated with nanomaterials."
"The Commission has of course concluded that enforcement of the existing legislation must be stepped up and that the relevant texts, such as specifications and technical instructions, must be revised so that they can be better applied in the case of nanomaterials."
"The Commission will also continue, of course, to support the relevant research to fill the existing gaps in knowledge."
"The relationship between climate change and health is clearly one of the increasingly important issues, according to the interim assessment, and I am glad it has been highlighted by many speakers today."
"This topic is to be covered in the White Paper on adaptation to climate change, which is to be approved soon."
"As for the comment by our Polish fellow Member, which is not directly relevant to the topic under discussion but is very significant in the context of the energy and climate change package, I must make it absolutely clear that any increase in electricity prices in Poland and other countries where electricity prices are regulated will not be due to the introduction of auctioning into the European system of greenhouse gas emission rights."
"The increase will be due to the need for further investment in the energy sector, as there will be no investors if there is no corresponding prospect of profit from their investments in the energy sector."
"The increases will also come about because of liberalisation in the energy sector and the unification of the EU energy market."
"Participating in the CO2 trading scheme to combat climate change will account for about 15%, and it should be noted - and I must underline this, because I have recently read statements by Polish officials in many newspapers to the effect that it will create an economic problem in Poland etc. - indeed, I must make it absolutely clear that whatever money is needed for the purchase of CO2 emission rights, that money will stay in the country concerned, such as Poland, for example."
"Not only that, but Poland will have the additional advantage of about EUR 1 billion coming from the redistribution which will result from the auctioning of rights in the EU countries whose income per head is above the EU average."
"These worries are therefore unfounded."
"Poland can only gain from the system and the package to be discussed in the European Parliament and in the Commission."
"The Action Plan is an effective means of marshalling all the agents involved in the sectors of the environment, health and research at Member State and Community level, with a view to taking the environment-health relationship into account even more effectively when formulating environmental policy."
"This objective must be pursued even more intensively, with the cooperation of all interested parties and the support of the European Parliament."
"Once again, let me stress that I am happy with the cooperation we have and with the support of the French Presidency."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to congratulate every single one of the Members here present for the high quality of today's debate."
"I find that this area is central to the concerns of Europeans and is one that lies at the heart of the 'People's Europe'."
"This is essential."
"I want to thank every one of my colleagues and fellow Members for their views and assessments and also for the proposals they have put forward, most of which have been very ambitious indeed."
"I am not going to summarise them all here, for that has already been done by the Secretary of State and Commissioner Dimas."
"I would just like to return specifically to the question of electromagnetic fields."
"Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet mentioned the Interphone study, but we are very focused on this problem: the findings from this study have not been published in full precisely because some consider them to be contradictory, whereas a number of experts who have been involved in it and are working in Israel have now highlighted the link between exposure to GSM waves and the emergence of cancer of the parotid gland."
"We are therefore essentially awaiting proof before acting."
"As I said before, when scientific uncertainty persists it is up to the politicians to make a decision."
"I would conclude by mentioning our Amendment 1, as presented in plenary, and would call on you to support it, as it has been put forward by most of the parliamentary groups."
"It effectively confirms that when technologies evolve and change, as is the case in this particular area, the exposure thresholds should also be amended; otherwise we are doing nothing to help those consumers who might be at risk."
"I fervently hope that the French Presidency will support this proposal for an amendment of the 1999 recommendation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) The Ries report relates to important questions about the mid-term review of the European environment and health action plan."
"Within this brief scope, I would like to address the freshwater question."
"In Hungary and many other Union countries, global climate change basically means extreme distribution of rainfall."
"Floods alternate with dry months, and this calls for a new water management strategy."
"We must manage every drop of freshwater responsibly."
"This can only be achieved through collaboration at Union level, and considerable Community resources must be made available for water management during the budget period starting in 2013, at the latest."
"Ensuring healthy drinking water throughout the territory of the Union, and using medicinal waters and geothermal energy as sources of heat, are related to this."
"Several tens of thousands of European citizens have died in urban heatwaves, and alleviating these also requires water."
"By using the water projects of the developing world, our outstanding experts can also provide help within the framework of Union projects."
"Let us not forget that freshwater is perhaps the most important treasure of the twenty-first century!"
"in writing. - (RO) I consider opportune the inclusion in the report of a reference to the Commission's and Member States' obligation to support the Children's Environment and Health Action Plan in Europe."
"The issue of the European child health needs to receive all the attention due, taking into consideration the serious problems that all Member States are dealing with."
"I would like to inform you about worrying statistics recorded this year in the Romanian schools: one pupil out of four suffers from chronic diseases."
"According to an official report, the main causes are inadequate nutrition, absence of physical activity and school bags that are too heavy."
"The most frequent health conditions are sight problems, growth delays, spinal deformations, speech disorders and anemia."
"Many pupils and children under school age are overweight and obesity has been caused by fast-food nutrition."
"Besides the fact that they live in a natural environment that is increasingly dangerous for their health, it seems that the social environment in which children are developing is not the most suited either."
"For this reason, I believe all of Europe should consider very seriously the children's health problems before we arrive in the situation of wondering what Europe will look like tomorrow."
"in writing. - (PL) Respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law is one of the European Union's priorities."
"When necessary, the Union imposes restrictive measures known as sanctions if these are called for in order to attain the aforementioned objectives."
"Sanctions should only be resorted to in cases of serious threats to security or violations of human rights, or when conciliation or diplomatic measures have proved ineffective."
"Recourse to sanctions may also be justified in cases of irreversible environmental damage to the natural environment when this becomes a threat to security and thus a serious infringement of human rights."
"So-called double standards are not allowed, however. By this I mean lack of consistency or equality when imposing or implementing sanctions."
"The sanctions most commonly resorted to by the European Union are denial of visas and arms embargoes."
"In addition, sanctions are one of the weapons used in the war on terror."
"The procedure for drawing up a black list of the names of institutions and entities linked to terrorist activity is an important element of the EU's anti-terrorist policy."
"Coordinated international action is required in order to improve the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed."
"The Union should continue to impose appropriately targeted smart sanctions to deal with specific problems whilst minimising the humanitarian consequences or negative effects on individuals against whom they were not aimed."
"Soil protection (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council by Miroslav OuzkÃ½, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on progress in Council on the Framework Directive on Soil Protection - B6-0455/2008)."
"author. - Mr President, let me just stress that in September 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal for a framework directive on soil protection with the aim of protecting soil across the European Union."
"This proposal resulted in a very lively and interesting discussion in my committee - the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Christina GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines, worked hard to find a compromise."
"A first-reading position was adopted by the European Parliament on 14 November 2007."
"Since then it has been unclear when the Council will be able to adopt a common position and when this will be communicated to the European Parliament."
"At the beginning of June my committee, therefore, put an oral question to the Council to learn more about the progress achieved in the Council since the adoption of Parliament's position."
"On behalf of my committee, I would like to ask the Council to elaborate on the progress achieved."
"Furthermore, my committee would like to know when the Council, according to current planning, will be able to communicate its common position on the framework directive on soil protection to the European Parliament."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr OuzkÃ½, the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community recognises that soil is a limited resource and is a medium that is subjected to environmental constraints."
"The Programme seeks to define in absolute and unambiguous terms a specific strategy for soil protection that takes into account the principles of subsidiarity and regional diversity, which everyone understands very well."
"In February 2007 - and here I too am retracing history - the Council held an advisory debate on the Commission's communication on a thematic strategy and on the proposal for a directive."
"In December 2007 it examined suggestions for a compromise on the directives that had been drawn up by the Portuguese Presidency, which had undertaken an enormous amount of work on this proposal, and these proposals took into account the opinion expressed by the European Parliament at first reading."
"Unfortunately, and in spite of the considerable efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, it was not possible to reach a political agreement at that particular time."
"The disagreement took various forms: some Member States questioned the very validity of the initiative, in other words the need to introduce Community regulations for soil protection; others thought that a framework directive would offer greater flexibility and would in particular help take into consideration those national policies that had already been implemented, policies that were not adequately recognised by the proposal for a directive as put forward."
"Since then various Member States have had time to reflect and France wishes to reopen this debate within the Council."
"The views of the European Parliament will naturally be a key component in our discussions and in the revival of the debate that we now want to see through to completion."
"We are aware of the fact that you have had to find a balance between those who did not want to infringe the legitimate powers of the Member States in the area of soil protection and those who were calling for an ambitious harmonised system of Community rules."
"We believe that Parliament's opinion represents a good basis for putting together a balanced package that we can all work on."
"This initiative has therefore been re-launched today, though it is too early to say whether or not it will be possible to reach an agreement within the Council, and if so when this will happen and on what basis."
"It would not be fair on my part to give any indications in this regard."
"All that I can promise you is that the French Presidency will do its best - and here I repeat myself - while at the same time taking account of the opinion expressed by Parliament, which has managed to adopt a balanced position of its own, and one that is therefore extremely valuable in this difficult discussion."
"At the same time we are realistic, for this is a very sensitive dossier - as everyone has seen in the course of previous discussions - and even in the best-case scenario a second reading cannot in any case take place until after the EP elections next year."
"We are therefore in no hurry and will take the time that is needed to reach the most consensual result possible on a subject that has in the past shown itself to be extremely complex."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to direct my comments at the Minister in particular because I believe that her intellectual capacity will allow her to understand that this is a completely new issue."
"The Commission, in line with its usual practices, presented a binding and, to a certain extent, reductionist directive. However, here in Parliament we realised that such a complex system as the soil could only be tackled on a comprehensive and theoretical basis."
"This is because soil affects the capture of CO2, it is the setting for human life, and it affects the productive system, agriculture, natural disasters and the creation of infrastructures. In short it affects everything and we understood that, in the case of 27 countries with very long legislative experience, many of these could not apply a directive based on simplistic criteria and extensive comitology."
"As a result, for the first time in the history of this Parliament, we developed a directive that was open, flexible, based on systematic criteria of self-organisation and aimed at a new development of Article 249 of the Treaty, which establishes that the Member States must have the same objectives and must meet these objectives, but allows them freedom in their application."
"In this directive, existing legislation, existing catalogues and the bureaucracies of each country are respected. There is no obligation for the countries to do anything new if they can prove that the objectives of the directive have been met."
"Many of these countries have already fully met all these objectives."
"However, many Members have not understood this interaction between freedom and complexity, that order is possible within an open system and that open and flexible systems can exist within self-organisation. They have preferred to turn their backs on this legislation which affects life and the earth."
"I do not understand how governments concerned about climate change can allow themselves to oppose a directive that tackles the problems of the soil, the earth and climate change and that encourages disaster prevention, supports reforestation, agriculture and productivity, and respects all previous agreements."
"I repeat that we must understand what freedom is, as many do not know how to live with this."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all the important natural resources and environments, such as water, air and species and habitats of flora and fauna, are covered by specific Community legislation, whereas the soil, which is non-renewable and a scarce resource, as the Minister has just said, does not have this protection."
"This omission must therefore be urgently rectified as we all suffer as a result of it, particularly at times of food scares or debates on fundamental economic and energy alternatives which are essentially based on the soil."
"Filling this gap in Community legislation would serve to highlight the measures that we advocate in the fight against climate change, including aspects such as combating increasing erosion and desertification, and not forgetting the serious problem of soil contamination or the sealing of this soil as a result of rapid and unsustainable development which is not only at the root of the current economic crisis, but also devours such a fundamental resource as the soil."
"In addition, including this issue within the European institutional legislative system would act as a stimulus to improve what is happening in the legislative process, by placing it within a coherent framework based on regulation and possibly on European funding which we could also link with the resources committed to the fight against climate change."
"We should not forget that the risks threatening this finite and non-renewable resource affect, to a greater or lesser extent, the whole territory of all the Member States of the European Union, including significant cross-border effects."
"There are various Member States - as my fellow Member has just said - which are not particularly inclined to standardise soil protection at European level."
"They should remember that what this Parliament previously adopted is not only a flexible, adaptable and ambitious legal instrument but also one which is not excessively prescriptive."
"It is an instrument that could help in making the fight against climate change more rigorous and effective."
"Soil also has a very important function as a reserve of raw materials and as a carbon reserve, not to mention the CO2 storage proposals that are currently being debated or the effects that may be indicated in the legislation on the scarcity of water."
"This proposal for a directive has been blocked in the Council since November 2007. This is unacceptable."
"Nearly a year has passed since this Chamber gave its opinion and I therefore consider that everything must be done to reverse this situation."
"In this way, the Member States would have a specific regulation to protect the soil, not only with the aim of protecting the environment, but also to fight against climate change and the deforestation and desertification that are occurring."
"It would also create new areas for research, innovation and the application of technologies, lead to the creation of jobs and social opportunities and, in particular, improve the quality of life of European citizens."
"I want to end by encouraging the Council Presidency to pursue its efforts to get this vital directive adopted."
"Do not be disheartened, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet."
"We all know that there have been encouraging changes in the positions within the Council but you should be aware that we will not allow this directive to be stripped of its content."
"Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, your President often demonstrates great courage and great ambition on certain issues and challenges that are important: soil protection must be one of them."
"Mr President, one of the points mentioned in the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council on this subject was that it is a highly sensitive issue."
"I agree with that completely."
"I will go further than that: I am, I believe, the first speaker up to now who can say in no uncertain terms that he does not see the need for a directive like this."
"I do not see why Europe has to have another directive."
"Why do I think that?"
"In the first place, we already have many directives relating to the soil that affect the health of the soil and the soil environment."
"Just think of the Water Directive, the Groundwater Directive, the Nitrates Directive, the 18 Directives relating to cross-compliance."
"All of these have an influence on the health of the soil."
"In Europe - and this is true in France and everywhere else - we are weighed down by too many administrative rules."
"The average farmer needs more time to fill in forms about all manner of things than he has to do his normal work on the farm."
"If there were to be yet another directive on top of all that, then that would be too much of a good thing."
"We should first of all wait to see the results of the directives we already have: whether they are not enough and whether they do not make an adequate contribution to restoring the soil to a healthy condition."
"The Groundwater Directive will only come into operation in 2009, and so it is completely unnecessary to introduce a new directive before then."
"The Commission has produced a proposal and has calculated what the benefits will be."
"What I did not see anywhere in the calculation is what the administrative burden of implementing all this will be for those concerned."
"I will say it again: too much time is being wasted on administrative tasks, on filling in forms, on meetings and I do not know what else."
"What could be done at this point in time?"
"The Commission could play a very important role in the exchange of experience."
"There are certain countries that have already gone a very long way in restoring the soil to a healthy condition and there are other countries that have not."
"The countries that have already done this have done it without any help from Europe."
"Why not use those good examples for the countries that still have a problem?"
"Once again, I think that we have too much red tape at the moment and that Europe and the European Union in general will certainly not make itself more popular with the citizens by piling one regulation on top of another and then saying to them 'just get on with it'."
"No, let us reduce it as much as possible and follow the example of the Member States that could serve as examples for the other countries."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr OuzkÃ½ for the question he posed, as I too am concerned about how long it is taking to complete our legislative work on soil protection."
"The food crisis is increasingly making itself felt and the world population is growing whilst less and less land is being used for agriculture and the options for intensifying agricultural production are running out."
"In view of this state of affairs, sensible soil protection is especially necessary."
"The very best way of protecting the soil is through sound agriculture and farming."
"Soil that is not used for agricultural purposes soon becomes degraded."
"We are all aware that a substantial amount of agricultural land is not being cultivated and is becoming degraded."
"This ought to change."
"The European Union's agricultural policy should ensure that it is profitable to cultivate agricultural land and legislation should encourage cultivation of the land."
"Those are the thoughts I would like to share with you in the course of this debate."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the Council representative said that there is considerable controversy in the Council on this issue, and that exists in the European Parliament as well."
"The background to this controversy is as follows. It all depends on our definition of soil: is it a treasure hoard of fertility, whose purpose is to provide a source of nutrition for our crops and which forms the basis of life in an ecologically sound farming system, with a high level of CO2 capture?"
"Or is it simply a substance which supports plants in a system of agro-industrial production which involves the use of oil, chemical and genetic technology and has extremely hazardous climate impacts?"
"These are the two trends which exist, including in the European Union."
"We also have soils which have been taken out of agricultural production."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an opinion which triggered a certain amount of controversy because the rapporteur who was appointed wanted to reject a directive."
"The majority in committee then delivered an opinion which accorded with a sensible approach to soil management, and this has been taken on board in the report."
"From an agricultural perspective, it would be extremely beneficial if this directive were adopted."
"I cannot understand, let alone support, the opposition from the traditional farmers' associations."
"In my view, they are shooting themselves in the foot, because farming created our cultural landscapes during the course of history and is in a position to maintain them now."
"I cannot endorse the view that it would create too much red tape."
"Mr Mulder, you said that this is already happening in some countries, one of them being Germany."
"We do not want excessive red tape."
"Why should these examples which you have cited not be incorporated into a framework directive with a clear principle of subsidiarity, taking account of regional, cultural, social and climatic conditions, so that decisions can be made at grassroots level as to what is necessary and what is not?"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, we know that this is a very sensitive area because protection of the soil, which is a scarce and non-renewable resource, is vital given that agriculture and the protection of biodiversity depend on this and because it forms a platform for human activities, not just for cities and infrastructures, but also for nature and the countryside."
"As a result, its protection is crucial to preserve our heritage, natural resources, surface water and groundwater quality, health and human life."
"As a very dynamic system which performs many functions and delivers services vital to human activities and to the survival of ecosystems, soil protection is a collective imperative in our common lives and in the defence of future generations."
"This means that it must not be subject to competition rules."
"However, soil is also subject to a great deal of abuse, to property speculation, and to degradation and contamination, including in border areas, which means that there must be better cooperation between Member States and the definition of common objectives in line with the subsidiarity principle and the social function of the earth."
"There are various Community policies which have implications for the soil and which may endanger its protection."
"That is why we need to further study the risks and various perspectives of soil in order to identify appropriate measures which can protect the soil."
"One very important contribution would be a change in the common agricultural policy to provide greater support for family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers."
"It is in this context that we need to know the Council's position and also monitor its development."
"(FR) Mr President, my first reaction to the discussion that has taken place on this proposal for a framework directive was to ask myself whether we really needed such a text and whether such a solution was really appropriate."
"We already have a raft of regulations on soil protection, waste, pesticides, the protection of the natural environment, groundwater and so on. Moreover, in the context of 'better regulation', which is something we in Parliament have been working on for some time, I realise that it is important not to give the impression that we are once again just putting things through the Commission mill and accumulating one regulation after another."
"I was also thinking about our local representatives and about our municipal mayors who will have even more on their plate with this framework directive."
"There is another reality, however."
"The fact is that human practices have failed completely to treat our soil with respect and that efforts have been systematically made to engage in intensive production methods and in so doing to impoverish the soil and to adopt urban practices that have led to its degradation."
"I believe that Mrs GutiÃ©rrez, whose work I would describe as remarkable, has presented us with very acceptable proposals in an effort to bring the different sides closer together - because indeed we see that there really is quite marked opposition within Parliament, just as there is within the Council - and that by listening to Parliament she has finally succeeded in putting forward proposals that appear to be as consensual as possible."
"She has produced a set of balanced positions that respect the subsidiarity principle, particularly in the choice of methods that the Member States are required to adopt in order to put the soil regulations into practice."
"She has avoided any increase in the administrative burden by urging us to make up for the errors of the past by way of our agricultural, industrial and urban practices, which until now have failed to respect the soil."
"I now address the Council: when the Council Presidency tells us that we need not hurry, this means that they are going to put the dossier on hold."
"They are going to put it on hold when there is in fact a real need, given the disparity that exists between the Member States, to take up positions that while respecting the subsidiarity principle are clearly aimed at preserving and protecting our soil."
"(PT) Mr President, as the Minister said, this is a sensitive and highly complex issue on which it is not easy to achieve consensus among 27 Member States or even in this Parliament, as has been seen."
"As my colleague InÃ©s Ayala said, soil is a non-renewable resource that is connected with natural disasters and agricultural production and that encompasses such delicate and demanding issues as soil use, development and nature conservation."
"Many interests are at stake and many fellow Members question whether this directive is necessary."
"Others question its flexibility."
"A very rigid legal framework is not always the best way to achieve the objectives sought, bearing in mind the different situations."
"In my opinion, this directive is important and necessary to maintain the balance of the ecosystems."
"Mr President, can I say to the President-in-Office that it is very nice of her to put the ball rolling onto the playing field, but can I suggest that she take it back and put it in the box?"
"Because, in my view, we really do not need this directive."
"I think the previous Council had it absolutely right when they said they did not want it."
"I echo very much the words of Jan Mulder that we do already have the Nitrates Directive and the Groundwater Directive."
"All these things are beginning to take action on the soil and making sure we are cleaning up our soils throughout the European Union."
"I agree with Graefe zu Baringdorf that the farmers are indeed the custodians of the soil and that soil is so important for everything we grow, but do we actually need a soil directive?"
"The problem with this soil directive is that it has been far too all-encompassing."
"We are trying to deal with industrial land and industrial pollution; we are talking about urban development and then about agricultural land and agricultural soils."
"It is just nonsense to actually bring in legislation like this at this stage."
"I think one of the problems we have here in the European Union - and I think we do it out of the very best of intentions - is that if we need to do something, we immediately legislate."
"I do not think so."
"I think we have to pause for a moment and reflect."
"I think the Council got it right."
"I suggest that it is not time to bring this back."
"I would suggest that it goes back to a new Commission and the new Council in the next parliamentary session."
"They can look again to see what is happening."
"I would encourage Member States that do not have controls over the use of industrial land and over pollution from industry to actually put those in place at the national level."
"Let us not interfere from the European level because I do not believe we need it."
"I think we want to make sure that we do not have the level of bureaucracy that we are getting."
"People are absolutely fed up to their back teeth with further bureaucracy."
"So I would say to the President-in-Office: please do not set the ball rolling; take it back again."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to remind colleagues and the French presidency that, at Parliament's first reading on 14 November 2007, a considerable number of MEPs - 295 in fact - voted against this directive."
"There is no doubt that there are significant concerns about the cost of the proposed directive, especially those sections on contaminated land and national inventories."
"Subsidiarity is a key question here, given that soil has limited cross-border effects, unlike air and water which, of course, are mobile."
"The proposed directive would force too many Member States with already-effective domestic measures to dismantle them, as they would be incompatible with the directive."
"The point is not that we do not need any EU action on soil protection - indeed, the thematic strategy contains many good suggestions - but that any new EU strategy on soil protection should add value to and complement, not replace, Member States' existing domestic policies."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, soil protection is an extremely important task for ensuring a healthy farming environment for future generations."
"I would underscore everything that has been said in that connection so far."
"However, none of these arguments means that soil protection should be a European task."
"Not every problem in Europe is necessarily a problem for Europe."
"Soil is a local, a localised medium."
"As a rule, soil contamination has no cross-border impacts, so there is no reason for soil protection to be a task for the European Union; nor, indeed, does it have any European added value."
"Many of the European countries already have soil protection regulations which work very well, and there is not the slightest reason to impose a European regulation on those that do not."
"Or do you believe, Commissioner - quite seriously - that wherever Member States are not taking action within their own sphere of competence, the Commission should fill the gap?"
"That would be absurd."
"For reasons of subsidiarity, soil protection is a task for the Member States, and they are quite capable of dealing with it."
"That being the case, the Council - including your own country, Madam Secretary of State - provisionally halted this initiative."
"I very much hope that the French Republic will stick to this position."
"I have no doubt that it could be useful to draft a European soil protection strategy, and I would also have no problem with Europe making a financial contribution wherever optimum soil protection has not yet been achieved."
"However, I am firmly opposed to having harmonised soil protection legislation imposed upon all of us, funded by the Community, simply because there is no soil protection legislation in some countries."
"That is not what Europe is supposed to be about."
"It would be a piece of completely superfluous bureaucracy of the type which sends citizens running for cover, before expressing their opinions in elections and referenda."
"It has to be stopped."
"(HU) However right Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is in saying that farmers protect the soil, there has indeed been a very considerable loss of soil cleanliness in recent decades as a consequence of intensive farming and the great use of fertilisers and chemicals."
"This previously applied to both the old and the new Member States."
"In the last twenty years, the new Member States have not really had the money for fertilisers or chemicals and so, for example, four times less fertiliser per hectare is used in Hungary than in The Netherlands."
"The real solution to the question is therefore a farming matter, namely that in future we will have to use methods that protect the biosphere and the soil and that reduce this burden on the soil, so brand new methods and new approaches are needed in order to protect the soil, since this is in the interests of all European farmers."
"There are a huge number of irrational things in this system, for example crops are not planted after the harvest and energy is lost."
"Compostable crops could be planted and, for example, the fertiliser burden could thus be reduced. Thank you for your attention."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we all agree on this, and we all want to see the land protected."
"It is the land that feeds the population, and we want it to continue giving us food, above all healthy food."
"The land, we all agree, is the environment, and we want to protect it, but I am seriously afraid we are destroying it."
"The Soil Protection Directive makes a clear distinction between pollution caused by agriculture and pollution from industry."
"As regards pollution caused by agriculture, we see many efforts being made under the common agricultural policy, and many efforts within the scope of the Health Check; and recently we had the report on a significant reduction in the use of agricultural chemicals."
"All these efforts are being made in terms of agriculture."
"However, the major concern is what is being done about industrial pollution."
"We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned by the impact intensifying soil contamination is having on our agricultural produce and on the environment."
"This pollution is reflected in the soil and water, and it is therefore advisable to adopt indicators and assessment thresholds before we reach the point of no return."
"Therefore, I urgently request that we monitor air pollution very frequently - we happen to do this thoroughly - and also monitor soil pollution."
"We should do this particularly in highly industrialised areas."
"I am optimistic that the French Presidency will take account of the Member States' positions and will find a mutually acceptable solution on this issue."
"(PL) Mr President, a year has gone by since we adopted our stance at first reading concerning the directive on soil protection."
"Nonetheless, the Council has so far been unable to secure agreement."
"A few Member States still persist in acting as a blocking minority. There is now hope of achieving a compromise under the French Presidency."
"The presentation by the representative of France indicated that such hope did exist."
"We have heard much criticism of the project, alleging that it will increase bureaucracy or duplicate existing national and Community legislation."
"I believe the opposite is the case."
"Such a directive is needed, because it will result in unification of legislation in this area and will bring together at Union level all the efforts being made to protect the soil."
"In addition to local and regional efforts, action at Union level is required if we are to halt soil degradation."
"The soil is an asset common to us all."
"Common principles and objectives must therefore be established, and the relevant action taken."
"It is important for all Union citizens to become aware of the important part the soil plays in the ecosystem and also in our daily lives and in the economy."
"Unfortunately, dangerous substances are still to be found on the territory of many Member States. I refer to landfill sites and chemical weapons left behind by the Soviet army present there in the past."
"Certain countries are not in a position to deal with these issues on their own."
"Appropriate encouragement and aid for Member States to assist such countries with the removal of such material is therefore needed."
"There is an urgent need for relevant provisions that will allow degraded land to be put back into use and will also limit soil degradation and ensure that the soil is exploited in a sustainable manner."
"All this would certainly be a step in the right direction in terms of protection of the natural environment and in terms of preserving the soil which is such a valuable natural resource."
"In this respect, the directive should prove very helpful to us."
"The legislative work ought therefore to continue. In addition, independent experts must be consulted and we should take their opinions into account."
"Mr President, I spoke to a farmer this morning, unfortunately a farmer who is sitting looking at sodden fields because certainly in Ireland and in other parts of northern Europe we are having a really bad harvest."
"I think we should bear them in mind this morning."
"This young farmer - and she is trained - has read the soils directive and has a real concern that for someone like her who is using minimum cultivation, doing the right think for the soil, this directive will penalise her, particularly in unseasonable weather conditions."
"She knows what she is talking about."
"I believe we do not need a directive to have good soils: we need Member States to take responsibility and most of all we need good farm advice backed up with good national research on what is best for soils."
"I think one of the big problems we face, and we face it certainly in Ireland, is very bad planning, which has created huge problems of flooding and the ancillary difficulties that leads to."
"Let us leave this to the Member States."
"Let us give them direction, but not another directive to add to the 18 that farmers already have to comply with."
"Mr President, I would say to the Commission and the Council to take all the time they need for this directive."
"In fact, as far as I am concerned, they can take it away forever."
"From my point of view, I believe we neither need nor require this directive."
"Farmers suffer enough red tape and bureaucracy at present and they see this all emanating from Brussels."
"This could well be the straw that breaks the camel's back."
"It is true that soil is very important and must be protected, but I have never yet met a farmer who will not protect the soil on his land - their future depends on it."
"The needs from the different parts of Europe are very different."
"Soils require different support from the north to the south, from the east to the west."
"This is a sensitive issue."
"Please take it away and bury this directive."
"As Mr Mulder said, we already have sufficient directives."
"The intention may be good, but we do not need this good intention."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union should act within the scope of its competences in those areas where it can genuinely create European added value with its own rules."
"In this particular case, I do not see any added value being created."
"What I do see are certain countries which are not taking their responsibilities in the domestic arena seriously, or at least have not done so to date, or simply believe that they can access European money in this way."
"I cannot identify any added value at all; what I do see, however, are additional costs and more red tape, especially for those countries which have fulfilled their commitments at home and have taken reasonable soil protection measures."
"Mr President, soil protection is of course necessary, but what is not necessary is another EU directive."
"As Mr Mulder said, we already have a plethora of directives and legions of rules on cross-compliance."
"This is a Member State issue."
"What nation is going to let its soil erode away and degrade?"
"Indeed, what farmer needs Brussels to tell him not to allow his assets to degrade?"
"It is ludicrous."
"More Brussels nannying will only add to the already intolerable administrative burden on farmers, whose time looking after their land is being constantly diminished by the time taken to fill in foolish forms."
"The Parliament and Commission should break the habit of a lifetime and forget about it."
"Mr President, I totally endorse what my colleagues in the 'catch-the-eye' process have been talking about."
"If the Commission would like to come and look at my farm, it has been farmed for 3 000 years before Christ was born, and continues to be farmed."
"The soil is in some of the best hearts."
"In fact this year we are producing four and a half tonnes of wheat to the acre, which is over 10 tonnes of wheat per hectare - if we can combine it, of course."
"We look after and manage the soil."
"Leave it to those people who know about it."
"Do not bring in any more bureaucracy from Brussels because all you do is give everybody here a bad name, and we do some good work."
"Keep up and do the good work, but leave it to the Member State."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly let me say that I want no more uncertainty on this point."
"The Presidency is very much motivated by this directive and is convinced of the need for having such a directive on this issue."
"I would also repeat that this position has been steadily held, that it does not just date from the current presidency, and I cannot accept some of the insinuations that have been made in this regard."
"In December 2007, when the first debate was held in the Council, certain Member States - and there is an echo of this in today's discussion - were formally opposed to the principle of a directive."
"Other Member States were already involved in drawing up national policies in this area and were of the view that while a directive was a good idea the proposal being put forward did not adequately respect the subsidiarity principle and did not take sufficient account of the efforts that had already been made, including points of a highly technical nature."
"At that time France was one of this group of states."
"Today, as we hold the presidency and once again remain faithful to this position, we are very much motivated and keen to find agreement on a directive for soil protection."
"For all that, we have all seen today that there are sharp disagreements and that these are a fairly true reflection of what has been happening within the European Council."
"We are striving to reach an agreement that may perhaps, as we hope, yield success during the current French Presidency."
"However, as we can all see, this is going to be far from simple."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this debate arising from the oral question from Parliament to the Council."
"Let me state that the Commission reaffirms its commitment to reaching an agreement on the soil protection directive, and will do its utmost to achieve that aim."
"The Commission made its proposal on the basis of Parliament and Council resolutions calling for a comprehensive European Union approach to soil protection."
"I remember very clearly, Mr Nassauer, that in late spring 2006 I received a letter from the German Government with the majority - if not all - the LÃ¤nder in Germany calling for a soil directive."
"We welcome Parliament's strong support for a soil directive, albeit introducing modifications to the Commission proposal."
"I hope we can achieve the sufficient level of complexity indicated by Mrs GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines"
"We regret that the Council was not able to reach a political agreement in December, in spite of the enormous work done by the Portuguese presidency, the support of 22 Member States and the flexibility shown by the Commission."
"I stress that, while this political impasse remains, soil degradation is continuing, as has been made very clear by the scientific community, for instance at a high-level conference on soil and climate change recently organised by the Commission."
"I therefore welcome France's commitment to restarting the work, and look forward to working constructively with France and the other Member States to make sure that we reach a political agreement in the Council securing a high level of soil protection as early as possible."
"However, the Commission has to ensure that the final text can be implemented and that it represents added value compared to current levels of soil protection."
"I assure you that I remain committed to that task."
"The debate is closed."
"Corrigendum (Rule 204a): see Minutes"
"Mr President, on a point of order, yesterday, before the vote on the motion for a resolution on Georgia, our colleague Mr Schulz - officially, before the whole of Europe - accused President Saakashvili of triggering the whole conflict."
"This is Russian propaganda, similar to the one according to which Polish soldiers were murdered by Germans in Katyn, which prevailed for 50 years."
"I think that Mr Schulz and the whole group have much to learn about Russian methods, Russian intrigues and Russian propaganda."
"(Sustained applause from the right)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lengthy vote ahead of us today."
"Since Mr Schulz is affected by what Mr Zaleski said, he will be given the floor, but after that, we want to move on to the vote."
"We held the debate about Georgia yesterday and we have drawn up a resolution, so we do not need to reiterate everything today."
"We want to get on with the vote, but as Mr Schulz was the subject of the remark, he has the floor."
"(DE) Mr President, perhaps Mr Zaleski did not listen properly to what I said yesterday."
"I did not accuse any nation."
"It is not my intention to lay the blame on any particular nation."
"As to the crimes against humanity committed by Germans in the Second World War, I have on more than one occasion voiced my shame about my nation in whose name these crimes were committed."
"I would like to reiterate that here and now."
"I am one of those Germans who want to ensure that it never happens again."
"Nonetheless, one thing is true: every responsible politician, every man or woman who is leading a government and wants to solve problems on his or her own country's territory through force of arms places themselves outside international law, and that applies to Mr Saakashvili."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is an issue which greatly concerns us all."
"I do not want to describe the speech I gave to the European Council as a successful attempt to combine all the different positions but I would recommend that you read that speech and I think that most people here in the House will find their position reflected in it."
"(DE) Mr President, perhaps it has escaped my notice as well, but I would be pleased to hear officially at last - in other words, from you - whether the many rumours circulating in the House are true and what is happening about Strasbourg in the coming weeks."
"I was going to make a statement about that at the end of the sitting, because I would like to avoid having a debate about it now."
"(Applause)"
"Can we agree that I will make a statement at the end on what has been decided, so that we really can get on with the vote just now?"
"There is also a communication about this matter which you will be receiving."
"I would ask you to check your emails."
"However, I will be making a statement at the end, when you will all still be here."

"- Before the vote:"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I speak on behalf of the ALDE Group, with regard to the Kirkhope report."
"Pursuant to Rule 168, the ALDE Group would like to make a request for referral back to committee."
"To be clear, there is no intention of breaking up the compromise package with the Council as such, but my group does believe that a more extensive debate on the definition of a parent carrier should take place."
"The Commission is working on a formal notice, which is most welcome."
"However, that does not give us the 100% clarity we need at this very moment."
"A proper debate should be allowed for, as well as decent consultation of our legal services."
"There is no rush to put this matter to the vote at this very moment."
"Mr President, I am happy to speak in favour of the ALDE Group motion to refer this back to committee."
"In my long years in this Parliament I cannot recall, within the transport area, a report that has caused so much confusion and uncertainty as this one."
"We are making law here, and with that comes a responsibility to act with full knowledge and understanding of the text that honourable Members will be asked to vote on."
"Yet many Members are unsure."
"Many Members are struggling to comprehend and understand this complex piece of legislation, made even more complex by the intervention of the Council."
"There is great uncertainty, great unease across a wide spectrum of this Chamber, which is why I believe we need to reassess, re-evaluate and examine more carefully the implications of these proposals back in the Committee on Transport."
"It is about getting it right, not about doing it quickly."
"By doing this, we will not be creating problems; we will be acting responsibly as legislators, defending Parliament's right to work at its pace, not at a pace dictated to it by industry lobbyists and the Council of Ministers."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Mr Simpson has just said is really quite abstruse; indeed, he turns the whole matter on its head."
"There are certain industries which attempt to block legislation in the interests of their companies."
"May I say this: with this code of conduct, our intention is to improve consumers' rights."
"We need to strengthen consumer rights so that we get fair offers from the computerised systems."
"We vigorously reject these delaying tactics on the part of the Socialists, who are attempting to wreck the compromise with the French Government and bring about its collapse during this legislative term."
"I would urge you to reject the referral back to committee."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I urge us not to refer this back to the committee."
"I think this is an unnecessary, and a potentially damaging, delaying tactic in the interests of the consumers of Europe, whom we represent."
"The first-reading agreement was struck in June with Council and Commission, after comprehensive debate and support in my - Transport - Committee."
"My shadow rapporteurs were fully involved with the process throughout and, as far as I am concerned, agreed the outcome."
"Two presidencies - the Slovenian and French - have both cooperated fully with me in this matter, and I do not understand why more time is now needed to debate or scrutinise this vital measure."
"The fairest and most democratic way to proceed is to vote now on the agreement."
"Many of the people who are now protesting did not bother to come to the debate last night when Commissioner Mandelson, at my request, clarified to Parliament the assurances that a formal notice will be published in the Official Journal before the entry into force of this regulation, giving a clear interpretation of the regulation from the Commission's point of view and very concrete and strict criteria (which happens on competition issues) to enforce these measures, in the interests of the consumers of Europe."
"I do not think that the consumers will understand these protests if we do not proceed to bring this measure forward."
"I therefore ask you, sincerely - all of you - to support me and the hard work that all of us have done across political groups to bring this matter through as quickly as possible."

"Coup in Mauritania"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the coup in Mauritania."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, we can regard the coup d'Ã©tat that has taken place in Mauritania as a real tragedy."
"Just as it has invested in many other countries, the European Union has invested enormously in the democratisation of Mauritania; more than this, and even more importantly I would say, the Mauritanian people have contributed significantly and those responsible for the relatively recent overthrow of the dictator Taya succeeded in arousing huge hopes among the population of that country, while at the same time honouring each of their commitments from the organisation of the constitutional referendum in June 2006 to the presidential elections in March 2007, including the holding of local and general elections in 2006."
"This long process gave everyone an opportunity to have their say: trade unions, civil society and, of course, politicians."
"After just one year this coup has shattered everything and there is huge disappointment among the ranks of the democrats."
"This catastrophe for democracy and for the people of Mauritania clearly reminds us of the extreme fragility of all young democracies and also of the special attention that has to be paid to them."
"It is now vital for us to condemn the new Mauritanian regime without equivocation."
"If the elected President had committed mistakes or blunders it was up to the Mauritanian people, to its parliament and to the country's elected representatives to react, to criticise and to impose sanctions."
"It was not in any way whatsoever the right of the army, the gendarmerie or any other police force to involve itself in what is exclusively a political matter."
"We are therefore calling on the new 'strong men' of Mauritania to restore to the people of Mauritania the powers that they have stolen from them."
"We demand that they allow the elected President to resume his political functions as soon as possible, even if this means suffering all the criticisms, provided that these are expressed in a democratic manner and with respect for the aspirations of the Mauritanian people who have once more been taken hostage by the wishes of a minority."
"Moreover, I would add, Mr President, that I had the honour of leading Parliament's observation mission to Mauritania and I am naturally deeply affected by what has happened."
"I will finish there and allow Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, who led the European Union's election observation mission, to take the floor."
"We very much regret these events because what we witnessed in Mauritania was a real desire on the part of the entire population, a desire that has been expressed throughout the past year, and what has happened now is a tragedy."
"author. - Mr President, this poor African nation has been suffering from political instability and turmoil for a number of years now."
"A reflection of this is the fact that two military coups occurred in the country in the last three years."
"The second of these took place on 6 August 2008."
"A general seized power in violation of constitutional legality and placed the President, the Prime Minister, other members of the Government and many civilians under arrest."
"Oddly enough, two thirds of Mauritania's parliamentarians have signed a declaration of support for the coup leadership."
"Notwithstanding the possible involvement of fear of persecution, it is an affront to democracy and a sorry state of affairs when elected parliamentary representatives resort to admitting to the failure of the democratic process and declare approval of a military dictatorship."
"We call upon all political forces in Mauritania to put their people's interests first, and with common-sense maturity to work jointly on restoring the constitutional order in their country."
"To this end, we urge and expect the EU, the UN and the African Union to offer all necessary support."
"author. - (FI) Mr President, the coup by the military junta in Mauritania has been widely condemned, with good reason."
"According to international observers in the country, the elections in 2006 and 2007 were conducted in accordance with the rules and there is no doubt as to the legitimacy of Mauritania's ousted government."
"Mauritania has had more than 10 coups or attempted coups since it gained independence from French colonial rule."
"The previous one was only three years ago."
"At the time the upper ranks of the army visibly took part, as they have now again."
"The development could hardly be described as stable or democratic."
"The disputes between the democratically elected President and the generals in Mauritania in their attitude to extremist Islamism contributed to the coup. This is a huge challenge for others who are trying to bring peace and stability to the region."
"The draft resolution quite rightly observes that the restoration of the legal and democratically elected government is a precondition for Mauritania's stable, democratic development."
"It is therefore not an acceptable solution to hold new elections, as that would entitle the military junta to use force."
"What is precarious about the situation is that, if the country remains isolated, this will nourish extremist opinions and activity, which will sidetrack democratic development."
"For this reason, we have to support a UN-led solution that is as prompt and peaceful as possible."
"Our group supports the draft resolution on the situation in Mauritania."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, it was thanks to you that I was able to head the election observation mission to Mauritania."
"We were very proud of the results, because the great success was that after 24 years the military was handing over power to the people."
"I was in Mauritania for eight days last week and what did I hear there?"
"I heard a people who, having previously been so happy to have a civilian government, were once again pleased that the military had come back to 'readjust democracy', as they put it."
"Of course we call that a coup d'Ã©tat."
"It is a coup d'Ã©tat."
"We denounce it and we have denounced it."
"However, I think that we really need to go and see what is happening there and I would advise you, my fellow Members, to send a delegation to find out."
"The representative from the African Union, Mr Ping, is calling it 'an atypical situation'."
"Mr Djinnit of the United Nations calls it 'a reversal situation' and both are saying that today we have to be creative."
"Indeed, when they say that there is deadlock it is quite true that there is institutional deadlock, but this institutional deadlock does not come from the coup; it is the result of a process of degradation that dates back to April and that culminated in June or July with a motion of censure that could not be voted on, with extraordinary sittings of the parliament that were not adopted, that were not granted and, indeed, with a resounding majority of two thirds, if not three quarters in favour of the President, which found itself overturned, with the call for him to resign."
"This truly was a reversal and for those who are not following things it is difficult to comprehend."
"I would ask you, fellow Members, to go and see the situation as it really is and would call on you to support the democratic legacy that the country managed to acquire at the last elections."
"It should also be remembered that institutions such as the Senate, the parliament and the municipal councils are still functioning and I really believe that these bodies are acting as custodians of the people's power."
"I therefore think that it is up to them to find a solution."
"I believe that we have to trust in our parliamentary colleagues to propose a roadmap to this military junta, which we have rejected, and that it is really up to the representatives of the people, just as we are the representatives of our citizens, to decide what to do now."
"I think that we can give them this credibility and show some trust in them: if they fail to come up with solutions that are lawful and institutionally legitimate then we can intervene forcefully, but I believe that today these representatives of the people, who have legitimacy on their side, should put forward proposals and we should give them our support as colleagues."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, anyone with an interest in Mauritania is aware of the current situation in that country."
"So too are the Members who had the honour of representing the European Parliament in that country. I was part of that group."
"Mrs Isler BÃ©guin has a great deal of relevant experience. I believe that she is right to advocate that for our part, we should increase resources so that the European Parliament can make an effective contribution to the situation, as it has already done in the case of other countries."
"This should not involve stating what is right, what ought to happen, or referring to certain standards."
"It should instead involve providing genuine assistance to people who are fighting for citizens' rights and democratic values in areas where these are far more difficult to attain than in the European Union."
"That is why it is proposed to distribute the resources in such a way that really effective use can be made of them."
"author. - I intend to propose an oral amendment before the vote."
"The recent coup in Mauritania is disappointing."
"For a country which has made much progress towards democracy in recent years, this coup is a setback to such advancements."
"The importance of a democratic Mauritania cannot be underestimated in this fragile subregion of Africa, so a return to democracy and civil rule is paramount."
"To overthrow a democratically elected government is simple unacceptable, as is the continued house arrest of the President and the Prime Minister of this country."
"However, it must also be noted that two thirds of the members of Mauritania's Parliament signed a declaration of support for the coup leader and his fellow generals."
"Last Sunday, the generals constituted their own government which, in my view, must be regarded as illegitimate."
"While not recognising this self-appointed interim administration, I would nevertheless encourage the military junta to set a timetable for dates for new presidential elections as soon as possible so that civilian ministers can once again be appointed instead of military personalities."
"The junta must commit to electoral neutrality as they did after the last coup in 2005."
"If such moves cannot be achieved in the very near future, the European Union must consider harsher measures, such as the suspension of aid of a non-humanitarian nature."
"The Commission must give serious consideration to the reactivation of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, which could lead to the freezing of assets of members of the junta as well as the suspension of aid."
"Finally, I urge the European Union to collaborate closely with the African Union on a resolution of this political crisis."
"It is deplorable, but Mauritania's generals have committed yet another coup d'Ã©tat which, regretfully, will affect the people of that country very badly."
"The fact that in the wake of a military coup, in a deteriorating economic and social situation, the World Bank has reached the decision to suspend payments to this country has made the situation even worse and the people will soon feel the effects of this."
"The only possible opinion on this situation is that we condemn the perpetrators of the coup and demand that constitutional and civil order be restored in this country as soon as possible."
"We demand the immediate release of President Sidi Mohamed Cheikh Abdallahi and the establishment of normal working conditions for government officials."
"A military coup is not a way out of a crisis."
"Only political discussions and free and fair elections can lead any country out of a constitutional crisis."
"The European Union's duty is to help overcome the crisis in the most efficient way, rendering aid to people made vulnerable in the throes of an economic and food crisis."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Mauritania is a poor country."
"It is also an untypical Islamic country and the victim of many bloodless coups d'Ã©tat."
"It is a country that recognises Israel and one that supports the United States in its war against Al-Qaeda."
"Mauritania has a democratic constitution."
"It is afflicted by many natural disasters. Slavery is still the custom there, which means people are deprived of their cultural and religious identity and their personality."
"However, this is a long-standing custom in the country."
"It is believed that Mauritania is making relatively good use of the assistance provided to it for the development of infrastructure and education."
"The latest coup has been accompanied by a declaration of holy war on the part of Al-Qaeda. This may well destabilise the country, increase starvation and negate the progress made."
"It may also result in the death of many people and in the introduction of the inhuman methods of radical Islam into the country."
"In view of these dangers, it is essential for the European Union and for the organisations of African countries to act swiftly in order to prevent such a tragedy."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, just yesterday we were talking about the inconsistency and ineffectiveness that sometimes characterises the European Union's sanctions policy."
"It is clear that Mauritania is an obvious example of this. The coup that occurred in that country this summer must be condemned, which is what we are doing in this resolution."
"However, we also call for the political tensions to be eased within the relevant institutions, which are the ones that still have the capacity to do so at the moment."
"Aside from that, the international response should not castigate those who do not merit this, particularly the Mauritanian people, who are already suffering enough from the economic and food crises."
"We therefore call on the European Commission not to cancel the funding of support projects for civil society provided for under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) and also to reconsider the freezing of the Fisheries Agreement."
"We also call on the Commission to engage in a political dialogue, pursuant to Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, with a view to restoring constitutional legality. If that dialogue should not succeed, it should then reactivate Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, which could lead to the freezing of aid, excluding food and humanitarian assistance."
"- (NL) Mr President, fragile democratic regimes in Africa which are overthrown by a military coup: it is a never-ending story, a saga that goes on and on."
"I am not exaggerating when I say that this House has probably expressed its condemnation of all kinds of coups in Africa dozens of times in the past."
"In the majority of African countries unjust rule remains and the same rulers have often been in power for decades."
"Billions of development aid has not changed that."
"The despots often remain in power and we roll out the red carpet for them far too often."
"This is cause for pessimism."
"The elections that this Parliament helped to monitor were conducted fairly: that has already been established here."
"However, the events this summer in Mauritania provide further evidence that elections alone will not be enough to get democratic values accepted on a permanent basis in Africa."
"The lesson that we have to learn today is that Europe needs to have the courage to make economic support and development aid dependent on good governance and democracy, since at the end of the day it will be the Africans themselves who will benefit from that."
"However, the EU has not had the courage to adopt this position up to now."
"A verbal condemnation of the coup in Mauritania is not enough if the European Union does not take concrete sanctions at the same time to isolate the junta."
"(PL) Mr President, it is most regrettable that we find ourselves debating Mauritania today."
"Last year, the first free elections were held in Mauritania. They were recognised as fair and transparent by the international community, including the European Parliament's Observation Mission."
"Mauritania had made significant progress in relation to issues of vital importance to its democratisation, stability and future development."
"I have in mind penalising slavery, liberalising the media and the return of refugees."
"Mauritania has now taken a step backwards, cancelling the results of the democratic elections and demonstrating a lack of respect for the rule of law."
"There may well be varying interpretations and assessments of President Abdallah's conduct, but one thing is certain. A president elected in universal, democratic and free elections can never be replaced through a coup d'Ã©tat."
"Such a move is unacceptable in a country that is developing its democracy, which is what Mauritania was doing until recently."
"The European Union should cooperate with the government of Mauritania and with the African Union in order to resolve the situation."
"(FI) Mr President, as we heard at the beginning of August, the first democratically elected President in Mauritania has been deposed and imprisoned along with the country's Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs as a result of a military coup."
"Mauritania is one of the world's poorest countries and one of its newest oil producers."
"If its democratic development is under threat, cooperation on a broad scale with the country must be called into question."
"As the World Bank froze USD 175 million in financial assistance and as the EU is considering freezing EUR 156 million, there are several development projects in danger of being ditched."
"A softly-softly approach will not, however, pay off in a situation like this in the long term."
"Taking a hard line obviously does not mean depriving the Mauritanians of food and humanitarian aid."
"The ruling military junta, however, needs to be reminded of the Cotonou Agreement and that, if no dialogue on restoring democratic order is achieved, EU cash will once again be cut off."
"Mr President, I would echo what has been said by a large number of colleagues here this afternoon: a democratic Mauritania represents a pole of stability in the subregion."
"Barely 12 months after the European Union's election observation mission declared that the elections had integrity, there was a second coup in two years by the generals in Mauritania."
"We call for the immediate release of the President and Prime Minister and believe that the solution to this is through dialogue."
"We welcome the involvement of the African Union in the process, but we urge the Commission to engage in this dialogue to try to find a peaceful and democratic solution to the current crisis and to use, if necessary, the threat that we will cut off all aid - apart from food and humanitarian aid - to Mauritania if we do not find a satisfactory solution in the coming months."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to endorse the comments made by Mr Kaczmarek."
"A coup d'Ã©tat in Africa and more precisely in Mauritania can come as no surprise."
"If we consider the situation on that continent we are bound to come to the conclusion that although thankfully the process of democratisation has begun in many areas and is still continuing, it remains very weak."
"That is a fact."
"Our role is to do all we can to assist democratisation."
"That involves our activities in the course of our missions to monitor parliamentary or presidential elections."
"It also involves financial assistance."
"Our presence on the ground, raising awareness amongst the people as to what democracy is all about and explaining how they can now play their part in it after a difficult period of preparation is surely a venture worth investing in, as we are indeed doing."
"I do not think we should skimp on this."
"On the contrary, we need to be generous."
"Africa's future is at stake."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, for several months Mauritania has been experiencing a tense political situation, opposing a large section of the Parliament to the President of Mauritania."
"On 6 August 2008, following the dismissal by President Adallahi of several army chiefs, the military reacted by carrying out a swift and bloodless coup d'Ã©tat."
"At present, the elected President remains imprisoned in a guest villa."
"It should be noted that the Prime Minister has also been arrested, while other institutions, such as the elected Parliament, have not been affected."
"Three years ago, on 3 August 2005, these same generals - at the time colonels - had carried out a similar take-over against the 20-year-old regime of Colonel Ould Taya, himself in power following a coup."
"The recent take-over, nevertheless, is radically different from the one in 2005 that brought to an end a dictatorial regime and resulted in an exemplary transition to democracy strongly supported, politically and financially, by the European Union."
"This transition, through a series of free and fair elections, had brought into power the first democratically elected institutions in Mauritania, whose functioning must still be improved."
"From the first day of the coup, our position has been clear."
"Commissioner Michel firmly condemned the coup and requested the release and reinstatement of President Abdallahi, as well as a quick return to constitutional rule."
"The whole international community followed with a very similar stance."
"The latest decisions taken by the military junta - the self-proclaimed 'High Council of State' - to formalise the take-over and nominate a new prime minister and government are now a series of steps in the wrong direction, going against the demands of the international community."
"This coup, I think, represents a serious and evident breach of the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement regarding democratic principles and the rule of law."
"Therefore, on 2 September 2008, the Commission adopted a Communication to the Council on the opening of consultations with Mauritania under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"On the basis of the results of the consultations, appropriate measures will be proposed."
"However, considering the potential negative impact that measures could have on the population, we still hope that an acceptable solution will be found without the necessity to isolate such a strategically important country, as many of you have said."
"Meanwhile, we will continue to follow developments in Mauritania, while fully supporting the efforts of the African Union to re-establish constitutional rule in the country."
"Now, let me comment briefly on two questions."
"It is too early at this stage to go into any details of appropriate actions to be taken on particular projects or areas of cooperation."
"I think we should wait for the results of the Cotonou Article 96 consultations, and it would also be good, Ms Isler BÃ©guin, to wait for a delegation to go there."
"The Cotonou Article 96 consultations have to be started first."
"Finally, there are two important projects: one is a European Development Fund project that is ongoing (value: EUR 4.5 million) for civil society support, and the other is planned support for democracy and human rights investment (value: EUR 300 000)."
"These would probably be continued in the case of a partial freeze of cooperation."
"So, at the moment, we are at the stage where we think that the Cotonou Agreement must be invoked and '96' consultations have to be taken, and then we will see."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) Unfortunately, the subject of the respect for human rights in African countries has been eternally present."
"For many Europeans, the respect for human rights is a gift they were born with. I come from a country that experienced the hardest communism in Europe, where human rights were not very high on its leaders' agenda."
"I could not say that the 18 years of democracy have led to the complete disappearance of the cases of infringement of human rights but the situation is much better than during the years of communism."
"The fragile African continent, whose centuries-old history has seriously marked the mentality of its inhabitants, is now also facing the threat of destabilization of an entire region following the coup d'Ã©tat of the military leaders of Mauritania."
"They actually annulled the 2007 democratic decision of the Mauritanian people, which had elected its first president in a democratic manner."
"Compliance with the rule of law is the first, fundamental requirement for democracy."
"The new regime in Mauritania does not have the people's support and represents the exclusive wish of a limited group of people."
"The international community has the duty to make sure that things do not degenerate in this country, both for the safety of its inhabitants and for the stability of the entire region, where terrorism is a real threat."

"Hangings in Iran"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on hangings in Iran."
"author. - (PT) This year is the 20th anniversary of the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in Tehran jails."
"This was one of the greatest crimes against humanity committed since the Second World War."
"The number of executions in Iran is currently totally out of control: according to official communications from the Iranian authorities, 29 hangings took place in one day at Evin prison in Tehran."
"The regime does not respect minors or anyone's rights and we are now facing the possibility, announced by the US authorities, of the handover of Camp Ashraf, where almost 4 000 Iranians are being protected under the Fourth Geneva Convention, in accordance with the status that was granted by the US authorities themselves."
"Despite having been officially recognised as protected by the US authorities, we are witnessing negotiations for their handover to the Iranian authorities at this time and under these conditions."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is absolutely impossible for us to allow such a thing; otherwise we will be collaborating with the worst crime against humanity."
"This would make us accomplices."
"We cannot under any circumstances allow this."
"I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that this is much worse than Guantanamo and we have to make the US authorities clearly understand this."
"We cannot allow such a thing as it would signify the total breakdown of our civilising values."
"author. - Mr President, the brutal theocratic regime in Tehran seems to take a perverse pleasure in shocking the world and defying the civilised standards that characterise most other countries."
"Iran is notorious not only for the sheer volume of executions, but the regular and merciless executions of juveniles and young adults who committed crimes as children."
"Whereas most countries that still impose the death penalty against adults do so exclusively for aggravated murder, Iran's interpretation of capital crimes is extremely wide and includes homosexuality and adultery."
"The courts often impose such a sentence for what to us in Europe are misdemeanours or not an offence at all."
"In the past, teenage girls found to be sexually active outside marriage have been executed for so-called 'crimes of sexual chastity'."
"As a Union, we should be unwavering in our condemnation of Iran's appalling human rights record, just as we are of its efforts to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons."
"We appeal here in this House for the Iranian President to show clemency, but I have to say I am not very hopeful."
"author. - Mr President, despite past resolutions of this Parliament and of the United Nations General Assembly, and contrary to basic moral and ethical considerations, the theocratic, totalitarian regime in charge of Iran continues to subject its citizens to - amongst other evils - the death penalty."
"However, it must be said that executions by the dreaded and most barbaric method of stoning appear, thankfully, to be coming to an end."
"That is without doubt a step in the right direction."
"Nevertheless, the fairness of many trials taking place in Iran leaves much to be desired."
"In many cases, the standards of administration of justice are far from those expected in the 21st century."
"In addition, persecutions on political and/or theological grounds continue to occur frequently."
"Such practices are a further stigma of shame on the governing authorities in Tehran."
"Furthermore, the execution of juvenile offenders continues, despite the international outcry."
"With this new resolution today, it is very much to be hoped that the leaders of the regime in Iran will at last listen to reason and common sense, and will proceed speedily to bringing their country into line with internationally-accepted norms of rational behaviour."
"The Iranian people deserve much better than to suffer the barbarism of blinkered political or religious fanaticism imposed by severely short-sighted and grossly cruel leaders."
"The time for liberal change in Iran is long overdue."
"Let us hope that it happens soon."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, once again, it is necessary for us to talk about human rights violations in Iran, and it is no time at all since we last spoke about it."
"Just three months ago, we drafted a resolution in this House on the executions in Iran."
"Unfortunately, there has been no change for the better since then."
"On the contrary: in the shadow of the nuclear crisis, the murdering by the Mullah regime continues unabated."
"Only a week ago, an 18-year-old man, Behnam Saree, was executed in public."
"The week before, a 20-year-old man was hanged for a crime he had committed at the age of 15."
"The procedure is always the same: the young man has to climb onto a stool, the noose is placed around his neck, and when the executioner kicks away the stool, the noose pulls tight."
"Faced with this type of barbaric act, even greater barbarism is hard to imagine."
"I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, could it get any worse?"
"Yet I have to say to you: yes, it can!"
"The death sentences imposed and carried out on young people who have not yet attained their majority is a severe breach of the Islamic Republic's international obligations and commitments."
"Iran is party to a number of international conventions which commit it to refrain from executing under-age offenders."
"It is macabre - indeed, it is verging on the tasteless - when Iranian Government representatives respond to criticism of this practice by claiming that the execution is suspended until the person has attained their majority."
"Iran is the country which carries out the most executions of minors and thus occupies a deeply shameful position at the top of the league."
"Since 1990, according to Amnesty International, no other country anywhere in the world has executed so many minors."
"In 2007 and 2008 alone, 15 young people were executed, and the situation of under-age offenders who face execution has reached an unacceptable, indeed a critical level in Iran."
"At least 132 under-age offenders are currently being held in death cells, and the real figure may well be much higher."
"The situation in Iran's prisons is critical as well: since 25 August, several hundred Kurdish political prisoners have been on hunger strike in Iranian prisons."
"They are protesting against the inhumane conditions, against torture and abuse, and against the death penalty."
"The international community must take urgent action here."
"We must continue to campaign tirelessly and insist on Iran's obligation to respect human rights."
"The situation is far too precarious to brook any delay in tackling this issue."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, at the beginning of August we received magnificent news from Iran."
"The Iranian judiciary had decided to suspend the use of stoning as a means of execution."
"The immediate consequence was that at least 10 women would not be executed by this brutal method."
"However, the satisfaction was short-lived because, in the penal code reform proposal currently under consideration by the Iranian Parliament, death by stoning for certain forms of adultery is retained."
"However, our issue with Iran is not just about stoning, but about the very existence of the death penalty because the number of people executed in Iran is still one of the highest in the world."
"It has already been said, and I will repeat it, that 191 people have been executed this year and 317 people were executed in 2007. Only China can beat this record."
"In general terms, we openly condemn the persecution, imprisonment and frequent execution of those people who engage in the defence and promotion of human rights, those who defend sexual freedom and those who are campaigning against the death penalty. All these people are frequently charged in Iran with carrying out activities against national security."
"There are many cases that we should mention here, but please allow me to talk about at least one: that of the activist and defender of minority rights, Yaghoub Mehrnehad, an ethnic Baluchi and executive director of the 'Voice of Justice' Youth Association, who was executed on 4 August after having publicly confronted local officials about their attitude."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, we are today debating crimes perpetrated by Iran against its own citizens."
"This issue differs somewhat from others we are often called upon to debate, because Iran is not at war with anyone."
"It is not therefore subject to intense pressures that might provoke various kinds of criminal action."
"The Iranian regime was elected in a fairly democratic manner."
"That is another reason why there should not be any political pressure."
"In addition, there are no tensions between the different national groups within Iran."
"Nonetheless, at least one person is executed every day in Iran."
"Older people are executed for offences committed when they were 13 or 14 years old, and minors are executed too."
"The international community should draw the appropriate conclusions."
"It should exclude Iran from all the international organisations it can."
"Action of this nature can bring results. The best example of this is the fact that stoning has been suspended."
"I also appeal for the inmates of Camp Ashraf not to be handed over to Iran, because they would be in danger of being handed over to the executioner."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, it is really urgent to demonstrate to the Iranian regime our strong condemnation of the increased number of executions there and also our support for democratic change in that country."
"But we are also concerned about the fate of almost 4 000 members of the Iranian opposition who are residing in Camp Ashraf in Iraq."
"We strongly call, therefore, on the Iraqi and also the US authorities not to forcibly return to Iran any Iranian refugees, but instead to find a long-term satisfactory solution for those located in Camp Ashraf who have the status of protected persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, it seems to me that, whenever a religion of any kind gains absolute power anywhere in the world, it is just as brutal and intolerant as any secular dictatorship."
"In Iran, homosexuality is a capital offence, adultery is a capital offence, espionage, armed robbery, drug trafficking and, of course, apostasy are all capital offences: you will be hung if you do not toe the line."
"According to opposition sources, political activists have been charged with criminal offences and executed."
"An Iranian man has been hanged for rape, despite his alleged victim withdrawing her accusations and a judicial review being ordered into the sentence."
"Mobile cranes and truck jibs are used for public hangings and, as there is no drop, this subjects the person being executed to a slow, painful death by asphyxiation."
"It is essential that we press the Iranian authorities to systematically commute all death penalties for juvenile offenders at the very least, and to halt the execution of the four young boys who are awaiting execution at this moment."
"I would welcome the ending of the stoning of women - hopefully it will be followed through."
"However, as the resolution points out, it is worrying that there is new legislation seeking to retain it for adultery."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when looking at Iran as a global and nuclear threat, strong political and diplomatic action would require that we involve Russia, for example."
"Furthermore, Iran provides the clearest evidence ever that the issue of human rights ought to be an integral part of our international and common security policy, because lying at the root of Iran as a nuclear threat there is the day-to-day violence being carried out against Iranian citizens by that regime, to which we must turn our attention."
"I hope the Commissioner can tell us more about the use being made of the funds for the promotion of democracy and the rule of law."
"We know how very difficult it is to contact the democratic opposition in Iran."
"There is in addition the general question of the death penalty, on which the UN has voted."
"This House pushed hard for a moratorium, a global suspension."
"Now is the time to reinforce that attitude and propose that the UN appoint a special envoy of the Secretary General on the death penalty."
"I am proposing this in an oral amendment, and I hope the political groups will see fit to endorse it."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I believe that everyone in this Chamber will agree with me that, when reading about the individual cases of violation of human rights reported in this resolution, you feel that it cannot be referring to events taking place in this century."
"But this is the deplorable truth about the situation in a country that has fallen back to medieval, primitive brutality in the attempt to suppress its own people - a people that longs for democracy, liberty and reform."
"We, the western democracies, cannot negotiate for ever with the criminal regime in Tehran in the naive hope that our weak negotiators could ever obtain anything from a regime that does not understand and respect the modern world and its values and that apparently hates its own people as much as it hates us."
"Let this resolution be a last call for justice and human rights."
"I would also mention - and with deep regret - that the EU is still holding the democratic Iranian opposition movement, the PMOI, on its list of terrorists, despite decisions by both the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the highest British court that this is unjustified."
"Finally, I support the oral amendments by Mr Kelam concerning the Ashraf camp and the oral amendment by Mr Hutchinson."
"These amendments will improve the resolution."
"- (NL) Mr President, we must be under no illusions."
"The theocracy in Teheran clearly has nothing but contempt for democracy in Europe."
"All the same, it is good that Parliament has again condemned the executions in Iran in no uncertain terms."
"The execution of minors is not only contrary to international law, it is absolutely barbaric and it says everything about the merciless nature of the regime that has held sway in Teheran for decades."
"It should also be a warning to the naive people who think Iran can be handled with kid gloves."
"Yet there is something that this resolution fails to say."
"It notes rightly that more people are executed in Iran than in any other country apart from China."
"However, what should have been added is that since January 2005, the only countries to sentence minors to death and execute them have been Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen and Pakistan."
"It is no coincidence that these are Islamic countries where sharia is applied to the spirit and the letter."
"It may be politically incorrect to say so but the facts speak for themselves."
"These practices provide further evidence that this Islam, which has not yet had an enlightenment, is incompatible with our Western values."
"(DE) Mr President, a fellow Member on the left of the House has just used the tragic issue of the death penalty in Iran and the dreadful crimes being committed there as a pretext to launch an assault on religion per se."
"He has attributed these actions to the religious nature of the regime."
"In my view, that is absurd."
"This is a perfectly ordinary totalitarian regime which simply exploits Islam for its own ends."
"That is the problem, and we must vigorously condemn the regime itself, not Islam or religion per se."
"Incidentally, the most heinous regimes in the world's history were those which invoked National or International Socialism, as China continues to do today."
"We should therefore be clear on one point: this House is not the place for ideological disputes, even on the issue of Iran."
"It is not about ideology; it is about the universality of human rights."
"This universality of human rights transcends ideological differences."
"There are no Asian human rights, and there are no Islamic human rights which give people less security and might condone the death penalty in one form or another."
"We are radically opposed to the death penalty, whether it is practised in the US, China, or Iran, but we do not view these countries as the same."
"We must be very clear about one thing: the Iranian regime is a totalitarian regime, and we would like to see it come to an end."
"(PL) Mr President, international law is crystal clear."
"The death penalty may not be imposed on individuals who were under the age of 18 when they committed an offence."
"Iran is violating that international legislation."
"I should like to emphasise that as a state, Iran is party to international conventions."
"It has signed undertakings of such a nature."
"In July of this year, 24 organisations for the protection of human rights from all over the world called on Iran to suspend use of the death penalty for minors and also to suspend all use of the death penalty on its territory."
"Six minors have been executed in Iran so far this year: that brings the total since 2005 to 26."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the House has already held several debates on the cruel way in which the law is implemented in Iran."
"We cannot allow the people currently in Camp Ashraf to be handed over to Iran, as the rule of law does not apply in that country."
"(PL) Mr President, the situation regarding human rights in Iran is not improving."
"Two people were hung yesterday, in Arak and in Boujerd, and many more are waiting for their sentences to be carried out."
"Several thousand opponents of the Ayatollahs' regime are currently held in Camp Ashraf."
"They are members of the People's Mujahadeen, and they are threatened with expulsion from Iraq."
"For many of them, this would mean certain death."
"The US forces have been providing security for the camp's inmates, pursuant to the IVth Geneva Convention."
"The planned change in the status of these forces means that as stated in the motion for a resolution, a long-term solution for the Iranian refugees resident in that camp must be found as soon as possible."
"While I have the floor I should like to remind the House once again of the need for court rulings to be properly implemented and the Mujahideen removed from the list of terrorist organisations."
"(PL) Mr President, the number of public executions in Iran is increasing."
"According to Amnesty International data, every year some 200 individuals are put to death in this way before audiences of thousands."
"In Iran the death penalty applies in cases of blasphemy, apostasy, adultery and prostitution, amongst others."
"The very severe penalties for immorality and apostasy have led to justified protests by defenders of human rights outside Iran and by reformist politicians inside the country."
"The West cannot simply be a passive observer of such macabre acts."
"The European Parliament should unequivocally condemn the actions of the Iranian regime."
"At the same time, Parliament should support the peaceful and reformist aspirations of the opposition, represented by the People's Mujahadeen."
"The logical outcome of the democratic transformation of the aforementioned organisation, led by Mrs Maryam Radjavi, would be for it to be removed from the European Union's list of terrorist organisations."
"(RO) Regarding things from the psychological point of view, it has been proved that tough punishments have never had a corrective role, but they generate hatred, violence, and a wish for revenge against fellow people and authorities."
"I do not militate in favour of not punishing guilty people, but not by using the death penalty."
"Let's not forget that people can be recovered by re-education and social reintegration programmes."
"Let's not forget that, in Iran, young people under the age of 18 years are subject to the death penalty, although the international rights, acknowledged under signature by Iranians, do not allow such atrocities."
"At a given moment, we found out about a terrible situation, when a group of young people from Isfahan were punished for dancing forbiddenly close, a few centimetres from each other."
"As a teacher, I would like to remind that positive results in education cannot be obtained by fear, constraint and physical punishment."
"Mr President, I would like to draw colleagues' attention to the fact that in Iran hundreds of people are being executed every year."
"That is the result of the failed policy our Union has been conducting with Iran in recent years."
"We ought to know that only strong internal opposition in Iran is capable of changing that situation."
"My question today is why does the EU continue to keep the Iranian opposition movement on a black list, despite the fact that the British courts ordered it to be removed from that list?"
"Is it not time for the Council, under the current presidency, to live up to its obligation of respect for the rule of law and to remove opposition movements from the black list once and for all?"
"I believe that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner could take the necessary steps."
"(PL) Mr President, condemning a ten-year-old child to death is simply inhuman."
"Using cranes as gallows is a crime, and a misuse of technology."
"In addition, public executions encourage aggressive behaviour amongst the population."
"We have already debated the situation in Iran on many occasions. Iran is cynically violating the international commitments to which it signed up."
"Our resolutions are proving ineffective."
"I trust the European Commission will consider the possibility of imposing sanctions in view of the crimes committed by Iran's rulers against their own nation."
"(PL) Mr President, the current totalitarian regime in Iran can best be described as having undertaken a reductio ad absurdum of the law, and resorted to the psychology of terror."
"The law works when people know what can be penalised, but things need to be kept in proportion."
"There is a relevant historical example."
"There was no law at all in Soviet Russia, simply the will of a single all-knowing individual and of his department, namely the KGB."
"The situation in Iran is absurd because the death penalty can be imposed for anything and everything."
"In Iran there are no courts, no logic and no proper trials."
"That is why I support the call for no political refugees such as the ones in Iraq mentioned earlier to be returned to Iran, especially no minors, because they would simply be slaughtered without trial."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think this is certainly one of the saddest questions of human rights violations, namely the death sentence - and particularly the death sentence carried out on young people."
"I think we all share the same profound, serious and urgent need to do something."
"There was a debate in June on the same issue, and yet between June and now the situation has unfortunately not improved but deteriorated."
"The extent and the severity of our concern is reflected in the growing number of statements published also by the European Union since the June debate - eight more to date."
"You mentioned many cases and I also would like to mention a few."
"Last week, for instance, the day after the EU deplored the hanging of Mr Hejazi, a minor, yet another juvenile execution took place."
"On 26 August Mr Zaree was put to death at the prison in Shiraz."
"This was despite specific calls for mercy emanating not only from the European Union, but also from all over the world, notably from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"Mr Zaree's execution has brought the number of juvenile executions - as you have said - since the beginning of this year to the very high number of six."
"Information suggests that there are over a hundred minors on death row in Iran."
"Unfortunately the death toll keeps rising."
"As we speak, yet another minor, Mr Soleimanian, faces imminent execution."
"The moratorium on youth executions, decreed by Iran's Chief Judiciary, is blatantly and repeatedly violated by his own judges."
"Regarding the question of Camp Ashraf, the Geneva Conventions should of course apply as for anyone else."
"In the case of forceful deportation to Iran of Camp Ashraf residents, necessary representations towards the Government of Iran will have to be made."
"We have tried on many occasions either to speak up openly or to try discreet diplomacy."
"I, myself, on every occasion when either the Foreign Minister or the President of the Parliament came to see me on other issues - on nuclear issues - always made the case very strongly."
"We were only successful in one case and that was the stoning of women."
"I have always spoken out against that but, as you can imagine, I am also totally against what is happening to young people and of course, to the death sentence in general."
"However the Iranian authorities' ears are largely deaf to our calls. We sometimes, therefore, have no choice but to resort to the so-called 'megaphone diplomacy' that Tehran claims to abhor and reject."
"Iran must face up to its own responsibilities."
"Its behaviour can only cast a shadow over its already tainted international reputation."
"Without a concrete improvement in the human rights situation, our common objective of developing the relationship between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot proceed properly, even if the nuclear issue were to be solved."
"I trust that the European Parliament and all EU partners will agree to this line and act accordingly."
"Today I call once more on the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to fully abide by the international conventions to which it is party. I call on Iran to spare the lives of all minors still languishing on death row."
"The whole human rights situation is indeed very difficult."
"As you know, we had a human rights dialogue, but unfortunately this did not work."
"We tried to work on public diplomacy and we are working closely with EU Member States to pursue a well-coordinated public diplomacy."
"We have allocated EUR 3 million for a TV news service in Farsi."
"We are also trying to work with civil society in Iran, but many obstacles are being put in our way."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - This Parliament supports the total abolition of the death penalty around the world."
"Unfortunately there is a long way to go."
"Therefore we have to try to make what progress we can."
"We welcome the suspension of the use of stoning as a means of execution for women in Iran."
"We urge the Majlis to urgently amend legislation in order to ensure that no one is executed for crimes committed when less than 18 years of age."
"We should also condemn the imprisonment and persecution of Iranian citizens who campaign for human rights and the abolition of the death penalty."
"In the present circumstances we call on Iraqi and US authorities not to forcibly return to Iran refugees and asylum-seekers and to work to find a long-term solution to the situation facing those people currently in limbo in Camp Ashraf."

"Albino killings in Tanzania"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on albino killings in Tanzania."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, in the 21st century people are being murdered simply because they are albinos."
"This is happening in Tanzania, a country where over a third of the population is living below the poverty threshold."
"In recent times, 173 individuals have been arrested on suspicion of killing or injuring albinos. This indicates the scale of the problem."
"Twenty-five people have been killed or injured because they were albinos during the last six months."
"There is a sizeable population of albinos in the world."
"In fact, 50 out of every million persons are albinos."
"It is only in Tanzania, however, that they are treated so cruelly."
"In that country, the blood and body parts of albinos are traded. The responsibility for this lies with animist witch doctors and the gangs they employ."
"It should be noted that the police also bear a share of the blame as they tend to turn a blind eye."
"As I conclude, I should like to point out that we will only be able to consider that our protest here today has been effective if and when medical care, education and the opportunity to integrate into society are made available to albinos in Tanzania."
"Today we are discussing a case of discrimination against a minority."
"The minority in question are albinos, who are being killed and mutilated in Tanzania, including small children."
"This is a serious problem throughout sub-Saharan Africa."
"I would like to remind you that albinism affects one in 20 000 people worldwide."
"As mentioned in the previous speech, witch-doctors in Tanzania sell severed body parts and blood from albinos to miners and fishermen, who naively believe that they can bring them luck, health and fortune."
"Our position is very clear - the killing of albinos and discrimination against them is totally unacceptable and should not be tolerated."
"The Tanzanian Government must take consistent measures to end this dreadful situation."
"The Government and President of Tanzania have already started to implement measures, which we appreciate, but it is not enough."
"The court case in which 173 people suspected of albino killings are to be tried will be a litmus test that will reveal the disposition of those in power in Tanzania, and the guilty must be punished."
"However, the best way to solve the problem would be through better education and adequate health care that is accessible to all the citizens of this country, including albinos."
"The international community as well as the European Union should render assistance in overcoming these problems."
"Most people with albinism die of skin cancer before they reach age 30."
"author. - Mr President, people with the genetic defect of albinism, apart from serious health-care problems, suffer various degrees of discrimination internationally."
"But recently in sub-Saharan Africa, and especially in Tanzania, albinos have, in addition, suffered unprecedented barbaric attacks of mutilation, with their body parts being used by witchcraft doctors as ingredients in the production of potions that are promised to make people rich."
"Such a state of affairs, apart from its obvious criminality, points towards a seriously backward society in which sickeningly brutal witchcraft practices are still operating."
"The government of Tanzania has an obligation to act swiftly and decisively in the following aspects: firstly, to protect all albinos from further attacks; secondly, to investigate fully all crimes against albinos and bring those responsible to justice; thirdly, to educate their citizens sufficiently, so as to rid them from the curse of witchcraft and superstition and, fourthly, to make sure that people with albinism are offered the best possible medical and social assistance they need in order to lead near-normal, safe and peaceful lives."
"Mr President, what is going on in Tanzania is not violence perpetrated by the State."
"The discrimination and violence are practices which have survived from the time before the Judeo-Christian-Islamic civilisations, a time when there was no assumption of the equality of all persons."
"Tanzania has 150 000 inhabitants who, due to a shortage of the colour pigment melanin, have red eyes, pale skin and fair hair."
"They are seen as products of witchcraft."
"Many of these people are murdered, after which their skin is stripped off and their skin and other body parts are used in magic rituals."
"Because of its large number of albinos, Tanzania is the largest supplier of human body parts for the whole of Africa."
"It will not be possible to put an end to these horrific practices without actively educating ordinary people in Tanzania and throughout Africa, providing better medical care and ensuring better access for albinos to prominent jobs."
"The Tanzanian Government is taking measures, including a register of all albinos, with a view to being able to protect them."
"Without changing attitudes on the position of albinos, this register could be misused in future to track down these people and exterminate them."
"We had bad experiences in Europe in the 1940s with the registration of threatened population groups."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the plight of albino people in Tanzania seems barely credible in today's age."
"When I first heard about this issue, it seemed like something straight out of Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness."
"I would like to believe in the renaissance and potential of Africa, as so many other colleagues in this House seem to, but the murder of albino people for their body parts does nothing to improve the image of the continent internationally."
"Sadly, the suffering of albino people is not limited to Tanzania but occurs all over Africa."
"Quite apart from the medical consequences of albinism in the tropics, including a high risk of terrible skin cancers, the long-suffering albino people are at best traditionally considered as freaks or curiosities, and at worst they are murdered to satisfy demand for traditional medicine that is more akin to medieval sorcery."
"The EU should not hesitate to campaign on the issue and bring pressure to bear on countries like Tanzania, where, apparently, such scant regard for human rights and dignity is common."
"However, I am heartened that the Tanzanian President has appealed to his people to change their traditional ways."
"Let us hope that other leaders throughout Africa repeat this important message."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, in March of this year over 25 albinos living in the vicinity of Lake Victoria, were brutally murdered or maimed."
"The victims included children."
"People alleged to have supernatural characteristics had been the subject of attacks in that area in the past."
"It should be recalled that 36% of Tanzania's population lives below the poverty threshold. To all intents and purposes these people have no access to health care."
"Normal practice is to turn to local witch doctors for help."
"The low level of education of the local population contributes to its belief in supernatural characteristics."
"A large number of albinos live in the territory of sub-Saharan Africa and they have become the victims of open discrimination because they are different."
"Not only are albinos denied the right to health care, but they are also denied the right to social and legal assistance."
"It is standard practice to discriminate against albinos in daily life, in schools, in public institutions and on the labour market."
"Albinos feel that they are being constantly humiliated and treated like second-class citizens."
"The current intolerance could be countered and the number of attacks against albinos reduced in future by penalising those guilty of murder whilst at the same time undertaking fundamental awareness-raising work within Tanzanian society."
"It is essential to support the initiatives taken by the Tanzanian Government in this regard."
"Such initiatives include special protection for albino children along with cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organisations."
"Actions should be focused first and foremost on rural areas, where social awareness is at its lowest."
"In addition, the Commission and the Member States should give strong support to the emergency actions undertaken by the Tanzania Albino Society."
"Longer-term measures should aim at ensuring that the albino population enjoys full rights in terms of access to education, the labour market and also to social and health protection."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, since March of this year 25 albinos have been murdered in Tanzania."
"These murders are connected with the superstitious practices current in the area and are based on the belief that albino body parts such as the feet, hands, hair and blood will make a person healthy, wealthy and rich."
"The latest victim was a seven-year-old child."
"Last year too, 25 albinos lost their lives."
"These occult practices take place along the shores of Lake Victoria, in farming areas and also amongst fishermen and miners."
"Albinos are often the victims of discrimination and persecution."
"President Kikwete has been using the police to try and locate albinos in hiding."
"The President has promised to provide albinos with protection, but the albinos remain mistrustful, because some police officers are also involved in occult practices."
"Witch doctors' gangs are responsible for organising the murder of albinos."
"One hundred and seventy-eight local people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murders."
"The President of Tanzania has been instrumental in the appointment of Mrs Kway-Geer as the country's first albino Member of Parliament in recognition of her fight against discrimination."
"We welcome this appointment as a step in the right direction."
"We support the activities of the Tanzania Albino Society and trust that the Commission will offer it genuine support."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are today discussing breaches of human rights in Tanzania."
"The latter is a subtropical country where albinos are discriminated against, as is the case in many other African countries."
"Albinos are murdered in a particularly brutal fashion in Tanzania, however. Last year more than 25 individuals lost their lives in this way."
"There are 39 million Tanzanians, 270 thousand of which suffer from a genetic defect caused by the presence of a recessive gene which means their skin lacks pigment."
"Consequently, albinos can suffer from sight problems, sunburn, cancer and premature death."
"Both parents have to be carriers of the gene for the condition to become apparent in their children."
"Women who give birth to albino babies are forced into divorce. The children are considered to be a curse on their family."
"They are thought to be possessed by unclean spirits and are treated as animals. On the other hand, however, witch doctors spread tales of the magical properties of albinos' white skin, which allegedly helps to bring luck and wealth."
"This leads to the killing of albinos who are then brutally quartered and their body parts used in the production of potions."
"It is hard to understand what the reason for such cruelty might be and what purpose it could serve. Perhaps it is an attempt to eliminate sick people who have a genetic defect."
"In recent times, the government has condemned the use of force against white-skinned Africans and run educational campaigns. An albino member of parliament has even been appointed."
"Nonetheless, the tragedy affecting these people still continues. In addition, there is a lack of funding for protective clothing and other assistance for this marginalised sector of the population which is discriminated against and denied work and education."
"Protests and appeals by the international community, together with educational and financial help would help to counter extreme discrimination of this type. Bringing legal proceedings against the 173 would-be witch doctors arrested and accused of murderous activity, incitement to murder and trade in human organs would also help."
"Mr President, I would just like to add my voice of support to that of colleagues on all sides of this House about the appalling story of the treatment of albinos in Tanzania."
"I know it happens in other parts of Africa but there is a concentration in Tanzania - we have heard the number of 270 000 albinos - who are discriminated against, who are marginalised, brutalised and murdered for their body parts due to superstition, witchcraft and various occult practices."
"By raising this issue here (and I commend all my colleagues who have raised it and those who put this item on the agenda), we add our voice in the European Parliament to the international voice of protest, and hopefully the Tanzanian Government - and indeed others - will listen."
"It is a question mainly of education but, above all, we need protection for albinos within their own communities; we need full investigation."
"The fact that some of the police force are part of the problem and cannot be trusted to be part of the solution is extremely worrying."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we share Parliament's outrage at the increasing number of attacks in Tanzania against the albino population and at the abhorrent and illegal trade in albino body parts linked to traditional medicine, to superstition and to the practices of witch doctors."
"In particular, we share the concerns recently reported by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women that, for instance, albino women and girls have been targeted very specifically in ritual killings."
"We condemn all forms of discrimination and victimisation, and we are committed to supporting policies and actions aimed at eradicating them."
"The Government of Tanzania, too, it must be said, is committed to stamping out these practices and raising awareness of the plight of the albino population."
"Therefore, we welcome the nomination of an albino Member of Parliament, the recent arrests of some witch doctors, and the President's commitment, as has been mentioned, to bringing those responsible to justice."
"We also closely monitor the human rights situation in general in Tanzania, together with Member States and other development partners."
"Several Member States and other partners are supporting organisations, such as the Legal and Human Rights Centre, which regularly monitor possible human rights violations."
"As a member of the Donor Group on Governance, the Commission will continue to coordinate donor responses to addressing the problem, including the Albino Association."
"The Commission will also, with Member States in Tanzania, raise the problem in its political dialogue with the Tanzanian authorities."
"The EUR 3 million EDF-funded Civil Society Programme will help to create awareness: workshops are being organised to highlight the albino situation and a new sensitisation campaign is shortly to be implemented in the Mwanza region of Northern Tanzania."
"So, in general, we use our regular dialogues to refer to this issue."
"These questions are, of course, also being raised in our ongoing exercise concerning public funds and the health, education and employment sectors."
"We believe that an independent and functioning judicial system is vital."
"Therefore, we, the Commission, in our contacts with the authorities, will underline the importance of appropriate legal action being taken against the perpetrators of these horrible acts."
"We will also contact the honourable Kway-Geer, the first Albino Member of Parliament in Tanzania (she has already been mentioned), and discuss possible actions with her, because she can tell us even better what can be done."
"Finally, together with the presidency in Tanzania, we will discuss this issue at the 60th anniversary of the signature of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights planned in Tanzania on 10 December 2008."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately after the debates."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law(debate)"
"1."
"Coup in Mauritania (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, my apologies for being late for the debate earlier on."
"This was due to the fact that we were trying to agree the terms of an oral amendment relating to paragraph 8."
"This is the oral amendment as agreed: 'Notes the announcement of new presidential elections by the junta, but deplores the failure - contrary to the position of the 2005-2007 junta - of a commitment to neutrality; calls on the military in power to commit themselves forthwith to a timetable for the restoration of the democratic institutions, in cooperation with the political forces'."
"In relation to paragraph 10, there is a typographical correction to be made which was agreed in the discussions."
"The last line of paragraph 10 should read 'which could lead to the freezing of aid, excluding food and humanitarian assistance'."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"2."
"Hangings in Iran (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose putting these amendments at the end of the resolution."
"I apologise for doing so at the last moment, but it has to do with the UN moratorium on the death penalty, on which Parliament has already expressed a view on three occasions."
"That is why I believe a purely oral amendment to be acceptable."
"The two paragraphs I am proposing are as follows. I shall read them out very slowly in English:"
"'Calls for the presentation of a resolution, at the next UN General Assembly, with a request to all countries who retain the death penalty to make available to the UN Secretary-General and to public opinion all information on capital punishment and executions, so as to overcome the state secret on the death penalty, which is also a direct cause of a greater number of executions'."
"The second paragraph is as follows:"
"'Calls for the new resolution to foresee the figure of a Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, with the task of monitoring the situation, ensuring maximum transparency in the capital punishment system and favouring an internal process directed at the implementation of the United Nations resolution on the moratorium on executions'."
"(IT) I realise that this is, let us say, an additional subject on the issue of Iran, but it is also an issue on which rapid action is needed."
"I therefore ask you to accept this addition to our resolution."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"author. - Mr President, the two amendments relate firstly to Article 9."
"We have a specific request from the UNHCR that it not be mentioned in the resolution."
"I think that this is absolutely acceptable and, according to this amendment, I ask for the words 'starting to notably work together with the UNHCR and others' to be deleted."
"Please note that in this amendment we also include Mr Hutchinson's oral amendment, in which he also asked for the opposition members to be included."
"Concerning recital K, we also had the same request in connection with the same principle that I have already mentioned."
"Here the words that we ask to be deleted from the resolution are 'under Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention'."
"It should also be noted here that we are also including Mr Kelam's oral amendment."
"Given the fact that this is a specific request from the UNHCR, I insist that we should take them into consideration."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I believe that what has just been said should be corrected."
"I can guarantee to this House that the United Nations High Commissioner has not at any time suggested this nor is he in agreement with what has just been said by our fellow Member."
"I therefore call on the House not to vote for what is being proposed."
"This would call into question the most important point, as underlined by the Commissioner, which is the protection offered by the Geneva Convention to prisoners in Camp Ashraf."
"We should therefore not accept this amendment as tabled."
"I must also point out that this would be in total contradiction to what was proposed by my colleague, Mr Hutchinson, and also our fellow Member from the Group of the European People's Party."
"I therefore vehemently reject this oral amendment."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would just like to say that our Group is also opposed to this oral amendment and is of the opinion that the Convention should continue to be mentioned, which is what was negotiated at the beginning of the week."
"Mr President, I am really against joining, in recital K, my oral amendment, which is to replace 'ex-members' with 'associates', with deletion of the mention of the Geneva Convention."
"The Commissioner has just confirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies as well to the inhabitants of Ashraf, so I would like to ask you to support the first part of this amendment, which is the same as Mr Hutchinson's, but to oppose deletion of the mention of the Geneva Convention."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I want to join with the last two speakers, as the UEN Group is also against any changes to the existing oral amendments printed in the files."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, I simply wish to confirm that we shall not be supporting the amendment that has been tabled here by our fellow Member, but that we have tabled an oral amendment to Article 9 that takes the same line as that put forward by the Member in question and that we shall of course be standing by this."
"(The oral amendments tabled by Mr Romeva i Rueda were not accepted."
"The oral amendments tabled by Mr Kelam and Mr Hutchinson were accepted.)"

"Yesterday another murder was committed by the terrorist organisation ETA."
"A 46-year-old army sergeant-major, Luis Conde de la Cruz, was killed by a car bomb in northern Spain."
"This was the third car bomb to explode in Spain within 24 hours."
"Several people were injured in the three blasts, one of them seriously."
"The European Parliament strongly condemns this act of terrorism and wishes to express its deep concern."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, may I express my sincere condolences to the family and relatives of Sergeant-Major Conde and our solidarity with Spain, its authorities and especially the Spanish security forces."
"I would also like to express our support and deep sympathy to those who were injured in the bomb blasts and to their families."
"We must reiterate time and again in no uncertain terms that terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy."
"We cannot repeat often enough that there is no justification whatsoever for terrorism."
"For this reason we must act together in our fight against terrorism, always respecting the rule of law and applying the full force of the law."
"The European Union is a community based on solidarity."
"An act of terrorism in a member country of the European Union is an attack on the entire European Union, on every single one of us."
"I now ask you all to rise for a minute's silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence.)"
"Order of business"
"The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 18 September 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Monday, Tuesday and Thursday:"
"No amendments"
"Wednesday:"
"The Liberal Group has requested an extension of the deadline for the tabling of joint motions for resolutions and amendments on the priorities of the European Parliament for the legislative and work programme of the Commission until 10 a.m. tomorrow - Tuesday, 23 September 2008."
"The vote is scheduled for Wednesday, 24 September 2008."
"(DE) Mr President, last weekend the Irish press revealed that there may be a link between those who funded the 'no' campaign in Ireland and the Washington Pentagon and the CIA."
"That was a very interesting story, the reason given being a desire to stop Europe becoming too strong."
"I wish to ask the President to investigate the matter."
"We should also ask the Council - the Council and the Commission - to provide us with information about this at the next opportunity, for it would certainly be interesting to find out the truth behind this whole shady 'no' campaign in Ireland that received EUR 1.2 million in funding."
"I therefore ask the President to pursue this matter so that we obtain information and uncover the background to this story."
"Mr President, on a point of order, this concerns the agenda on Thursday where we made a late request - I am sorry it was late - it is a proposal to change slightly the agenda for Thursday where currently there is a vote proposed for the social package resolution."
"At the moment, individual groups have tabled their own separate resolutions."
"With the best will in the world and good faith on all parts we tried to negotiate collectively a compromise resolution."
"We have not managed to do that, so at the moment what is likely is individual resolutions will be voted and each resolution would be voted down, which would not give a very good message."
"Therefore, collectively the majority of political groups thought it was a good idea if I just stood up and made the case that perhaps it would be tactful not to have a vote at all on the resolution."
"This is not because it is not important: it is because it is important."
"We did not want to give the wrong message and it was better to give no message following the debate that we had, very fully covering the various points, last time."
"So the proposal, supported by a majority of groups, is that we do not have a vote this Thursday."
"We shall give some more thought to this matter."
"May I ask the groups to get together again and see whether a solution can be found."
"In the meantime, we shall take note of what Philip Bushill-Matthews has said."
"(The order of business was thus established..)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(RO) The first European Summit on Roma integration took place last week right here in Brussels."
"The inclusion of this complex issue, that of the Roma, on the EU agenda is an idea which Romania has constantly supported, and I believe it should be welcomed."
"The Council of Europe, which has been concerned with this issue since 1990, remarked that the Roma constitute a genuine European minority."
"Therefore, the Roma issue is a European, not a national one, and I believe that the European Commission should have the Parliament's full support for its initiative."
"I believe that the European Parliament should speak in favour of placing education at the very core of the European policy concerning the Roma, because the experience of recent years has proven education to be the surest way towards integration and towards the successful overcoming of obstacles both by the Roma and by their neighbours."
"(HU) Mr President, today we are witness to a gross infringement of the ban on market discrimination on the part of German and Austrian supermarket chains that are boycotting the Hungarian poultry farming and processing industry."
"This involves the REWE, SPAR, METRO and Kaufland supermarkets, which are not taking delivery of Hungarian products in the wake of a boycott by an Austrian animal rights organisation."
"Consequently, this has caused a loss of 2 billion forints to the Hungarian poultry sector."
"They are using racial discrimination against Hungarian products, and thus violating the European Union's competition laws."
"Those affected will therefore turn to the European Court of Justice, since two of the Union's fundamental principles are being violated: the ban on racial discrimination, and equality and freedom of competition."
"(BG) Mr President, esteemed colleagues, a National Emergency Call 112 System will go into operation in Bulgaria as from 30 September 2008 in implementation of Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council."
"The system will be dialable from any point of the national territory and will guarantee fast and free access to this service."
"The technical solution of the Bulgarian 112 system uses state-of-the-art technologies and allows calling line identification."
"Detailed information on the setting up and functioning of the system has been provided by the Bulgarian Ministry of Emergency Situations to all Members of the European Parliament."
"I would like to express gratitude for the postponement of the infringement procedure and for the assessment given to the Bulgarian Government by the European Commission for the setting up of the emergency call system."
"I view this assessment as an expression of the care that the Community takes of the safety and health of European citizens."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, events over the last week have made it a particularly sad and difficult week for those for whom liberty and racism are important issues: six migrants from various African countries were killed by the Camorra in Italy, last Thursday; originally they were accused of being pushers and criminals, but that was then discovered to be completely untrue."
"A black youth was also beaten to death in Milan."
"At the same time, there was an incredible response in the city of Cologne to the same issues, to the issues of racism and discrimination."
"I feel that Europe currently has two very different faces."
"I also feel that this Parliament should start to take a much more active stance on the issue of racism than it has in recent times, since in many countries - including mine - racism is making an extremely tragic comeback!"
"Thank you."
"Every human being has equal dignity."
"Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of the 4.6 million people in Ethiopia who are facing starvation because of acute food shortages."
"This has come about because of drought."
"The Ethiopian Government is saying that it is not a famine, but UNICEF is saying that there is famine in certain parts of the country and people are at acute risk of famine."
"It is only happening in certain areas, and I believe that the international community and the EU must act quickly and try to supply about half a million tonnes of food if we are to avoid a complete famine."
"I think this is a priority and, as the European Union is one of the biggest contributors to overseas development aid, I think it is absolutely essential that we do this immediately."
"Mr President, let me just say that, as an Irish Member, I agree with the comments you have made about Libertas and the Irish referendum."
"We fought for a 'yes' campaign; we were open and transparent about our funding."
"Libertas told us one thing, and now we have discovered it is very different."
"I want to encourage you and everybody to ensure that Libertas is far more open and transparent in terms of where exactly the money came from, because people want to know."
"Mr President, while European Central Bank President, Jean Claude Trichet, has repeatedly expressed concern about inflation indexation of wages, he has failed to take into account the plight of workers, particularly the low-paid, struggling as the cost of living escalates."
"And, while ensuring that interventions have a minimal inflationary impact, wage increases are needed for low-paid workers, who are now under severe pressure."
"Curbing inflation across Europe cannot be boiled down to curbing legitimate wage demands."
"While, of course, those on higher wages can afford to exercise wage moderation, the lower-paid are a different matter."
"Domestic government and national central banks are best placed to respond to changing economic circumstances, and that is why I have always opposed measures that have undermined economic sovereignty."
"Indeed, as a small state, Ireland is well aware that our economic situation is peripheral to the policy-making concerns of the ECB and that, therefore, the positions often adopted by the Bank are not always in the bests needs or interests of the Irish economy."
"I too favour transparency in funding."
"I also favour respect for democratic outcomes, and this body should note that all of the campaigns that fought and won the argument for a 'no' vote, with the exception of one, have published full and frank accounts, and there is no question as regards the mechanisms of spending or the funds that those groups, including my own party, received."
"Mr President, we vote tomorrow on a report that appears to limit the immunity of Europol officials, but is a smokescreen for future legislation that will actually extend this until after 2010."
"There is no debate."
"The vote is merely a consultative exercise."
"The decision will be made by the European Council."
"Europol officials will be able to operate in Member States in a wide variety of capacities that will give them immunity for anything that they do and anything that they say in the course of their duties - a privilege not even enjoyed by the NKVD under Stalin's 'Great Terror'."
"This will be an innovation in England, where no public official has immunity from prosecution."
"Under the Lisbon Treaty, Member States' parliaments will not be able to block the further extension of Europol's powers, amended by Council decisions."
"These are the first steps in the creation of a European Union police state."
"(NL) Mr President, I urge you to enter a formal protest to the Mayor of Cologne about his refusal last weekend to allow MEPs and other elected persons to express their views peacefully and attend a congress on an important social and political issue, namely the islamisation of Europe."
"Leftist extremists physically attacked people, set fire to items of street furniture and brought the entire city centre to a standstill in their determination to prevent people from attending a peaceful congress."
"Mayor Schramme not only declined to condemn this violence and intimidation, he applauded it and went as far as to imply that it was the people of Cologne who had spontaneously opposed the holding of a congress."
"There were plenty of witnesses to this, and it is disgraceful that such things can still happen today in a country that calls itself a democracy, that people are forcibly prevented from speaking out."
"Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of the travel ban imposed by Belarus, which prevents children affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster from travelling abroad."
"Over 1 000 Irish families host these Belarusian children in their homes every summer and Christmas for rest and recuperation, which often includes medical assessment and, in some cases, treatment."
"There is a bilateral agreement between Italy and Belarus, which means that Italy is not affected by the ban."
"I know that the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs is seeking an agreement with Belarus and I welcome the discussions that are taking place."
"I would also underline the need for an EU-Belarus agreement."
"Under the European neighbourhood policy, the EU will provide Belarus with financial aid to the tune of EUR 20 million for the period 2007-2010."
"The EU should make a reversal of the travel ban a condition for receipt of that funding."
"An EU-Belarus agreement should also be created to allow Belarusian children to continue to travel to EU countries for rest and recuperation."
"This would secure the rights of children to travel in the long term."
"(ES) Mr President, the United Nations regards trafficking in persons as incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human being; nonetheless, every year over half a million people are victims of trafficking, of whom 80% are women and girls, half are minors and the majority are prisoners of sexual exploitation."
"Furthermore, a significant number of women who are victims of trafficking enter the European Union every year, according to the International Organization for Migration."
"Tomorrow, 23 September, is the International Day Against the Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking of Women."
"I believe it is a good opportunity for us in this Chamber to commit to enhancing all measures to combat this scourge which infringes the rights of so many people and in particular to combat the traffickers, and poverty, by providing improvements to increase educational and employment opportunities and by implementing awareness-raising strategies in the countries of destination with the aim of making the issue the topic of public debate."
"(DE) Mr President, as a trade unionist, I want to speak today about the tragic events at the shipyards in the Tuzla district of Istanbul."
"In the last three years alone, more than 90 workers have lost their lives in Tuzla, victims of lethally harsh working conditions."
"The most recent occurrence was a tragic accident on 11 August that I would describe as criminal."
"Three temporary workers died while testing a lifeboat, and 16 workers were injured."
"As the dinghy was being lowered from its ship, the lines snapped, and the workers were sent plummeting into the water."
"The particularly tragic thing about this accident is that these tests are normally conducted with sandbags."
"The workers were used as human sandbags, so to speak."
"Workers who wanted to strike in protest at the calamitous safety arrangements were threatened by subcontracting companies with instant dismissal."
"The Commission has already pointed out, in its progress report in 2006, that the rights of workers and trade unions are inadequate in Turkey."
"I therefore ask you to urge the Turkish authorities to treat trade unions as equal partners of industry and to act at long last to create humane working conditions and stricter safety guidelines for the Tuzla workforce in order to put an end to this appalling state of affairs."
"Mr President, the foundation of the EU rests on the principle of representative democracy."
"We as members of the European Parliament have a duty to make sure that Europe's policies reflect the will of citizens."
"Therefore I wish to express the wariness caused by the ever-increasing number of GMO authorisations, and when I do this I speak on behalf of the majority of the citizens of the European Union."
"A Eurobarometer published in March of this year indicates that 58% of Europeans are against GMOs."
"Over a third of them consider that they are not being properly informed of the benefits and risk of GMO usage in agriculture."
"These figures should worry us."
"Instead, the Commission continues authorising an ever-increasing number of GMOs to enter the EU agricultural market."
"The 8 September authorisation of another genetically-modified soya bean is but the latest example."
"Esteemed colleagues, in consideration of these facts I suggest we ask the Commission to start an EU-wide information campaign on the risks and benefits that GMO represent to people and the environment."
"A new assessment should follow."
"Until the citizens of Europe are properly informed and express their position on this very sensitive subject, I am asking the Commission to stop authorising any new GMOs."
"(DE) Mr President, the main pillars of the EU - democracy, human rights, freedom and the rule of law - must be the basis of the new partnership agreement with Russia."
"Russia's conduct in Georgia has shown us again that it is not prepared to respect the rule of law and international agreements under Dmitry Medvedev either."
"The six-point plan for Georgia calls for the restoration of the situation that obtained on 7 August."
"This entails the withdrawal of the Russian forces to the lines they held prior to the outbreak of hostilities in South Ossetia, and not the deployment of an additional contingent of 3 800 troops."
"Moreover, human rights are being trodden underfoot."
"The situation of political prisoners is intolerable, as the case of Mikhail Khodorkovski demonstrates."
"The same applies to non-compliance with the Energy Charter, by which Russia, as one of the signatories, should be bound."
"(PL) Mr President, pogroms of Christians, incited by Hindu fundamentalists, are taking place in India."
"This is connected with the murder of a Hindu leader, a crime that the police blame on Maoists."
"Christian settlements and schools are being set on fire."
"The fundamentalist Hindus are blaming Christians for this murder, without just cause."
"In Orissa over 40 000 Christians have taken refuge in the jungle."
"About 15 000 are living in refugee camps under police protection."
"More than 20 people have been murdered."
"In the villages of Tangia and Rupagaon Christians were burnt to death in their houses."
"At least 8 people were killed in the Kandhamal area."
"At least 10 churches have been burnt down."
"Archbishop Vincent Concessao of the Delhi diocese believes that more effective measures need to be taken to quell the violence."
"The local authorities are not taking the steps required."
"Hatred of Christianity should be countered in the same way as other extreme forms of intolerance."
"(PT) Mr President, AntÃ³nio Guerreiro, Fernando GonzÃ¡lez, Gerardo HernÃ¡ndez, RamÃ³n LabaÃ±ino and RenÃ© GonzÃ¡lez, five Cuban nationals who merely defended their homeland and their fellow countrymen to ensure that they ceased to be victims of terrorist acts promoted and organised by Miami-based groups, have been unjustly imprisoned in the United States since 12 September 1998, almost 10 years ago."
"During those ten years these five Cuban nationals have been subjected to countless unlawful situations, unacceptable and inhuman punishments, pressure, blackmail and violations of the most basic human rights, such as the US administration's imposition of cruel obstacles and restrictions on visits by their families."
"Elizabeth Palmeiros, RamÃ³n LabaÃ±ino's wife, has been waiting over two years for a visa."
"AntÃ³nio Guerreiro has had no visits from his family for over a year and a half, and Fernando GonzÃ¡lez has been in the same position for over a year."
"The US authorities have prevented Adriana Perez from visiting her husband, Gerardo HernÃ¡ndez, since 12 September 1998, while Olga Salanueva has been unable to visit her husband, RenÃ© GonzÃ¡lez, since August 2000."
"We demand justice, we demand the release of these five Cuban patriots."
"Mr President, despite our wet Irish climate, major flooding was a relatively uncommon occurrence in the past."
"Recently, destructive flooding has become a yearly, seasonal phenomenon."
"A number of factors are implicated: building on flood plains, poor maintenance of drains etc."
"These spruce tree plantations, especially when planted on upland areas, have significantly changed the drainage pattern of Irish river systems."
"At the same time, the planting of native Irish trees and forests was largely neglected, because of the way the funds were organised in the past."
"It is unfortunate that in the new Rural Development Programme, Ireland has chosen to exclude forestry from the scheme."
"To starve native Irish forestry of funds at this critical time, when it needs to make a comeback, is a recipe for disaster, with increased flooding, water contamination, CO2 build-up and a continued loss of soil fertility."
"There are token projects in the programme involving native species."
"However, it cannot be denied that an opportunity to use the funds for native trees to mitigate against future flooding has been lost."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should not only advertise intercultural dialogue, but also protect it if it is attacked, especially if ethnic co-existence is corroded day by day within one of our neighbouring countries, a Member State of the Union."
"There have already been and unfortunately may yet be sad consequences of the inflammatory, coarse statements by JÃ¡n Slota, president of one of the governing parties in Slovakia, and his games on the YouTube video website, calling on people to kill politicians in the Hungarian minority party in Slovakia, as well as, most recently, the statement by the Slovak education minister that he would ban the public use of Hungarian in Slovakia, and that the reason he supports the minority Hungarian Members of Parliament is that they participated in a forum in Budapest that upset members of the Hungarian Parliament."
"The consequences of tolerating extreme statements and of incitement are already very much felt."
"According to recent opinion polls, more than 60% of 15-year-olds hate Hungarians most of all and agree with the astounding, inflammatory accusations coming from leading Slovak politicians over the years."
"Hungarians, however, are starting to feel scared."
"This is all happening now, while we open our arms wide, and think that the consequences will not happen, Parliament, the Commission and the Council are busy, and we celebrate the year of intercultural dialogue. Thank you for your attention."
"(RO) An approximate 60 million European citizens, amounting to 15% of the EU's population, are at risk of poverty."
"The following priorities have been identified for elimining poverty: a higher rate of employment, preventing school drop-out, eliminating child poverty, modernising social security, and eliminating discrimination."
"Investment in education should be a priority."
"Ensuring modern infrastructure for education and improving the professional training, payment and status of teaching staff are prerequisites for quality education."
"Today, the average rate of school drop-out in the EU is over 16%."
"Many of the young people dropping out of school come from rural areas and are forced to stop attending school by their precarious financial state."
"I urge the Member States to treat as a priority the development of educational infrastructure and the creation of employment, particularly in rural areas."
"Better education guarantees a decent standard of living for the younger generation, thus improving the social and economic cohesion of the European Union ."
"The future of the EU depends on the strength, value and quality of present and future generations."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"On 15 September the founding meeting of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology was held in Budapest."
"Hungary and Budapest, the city selected as the centre of the institution, have a great tradition in the field of scientific research."
"Just think of the fact that 12 Nobel Prize winners were Hungarian scientists who participated actively in crucial inventions of the 20th century."
"The most important tasks of the new institution are to promote and coordinate cooperation between European science centres and to create a network of universities, research institutions and private-sector players in innovation."
"These goals coincide with the fundamental principle of the Lisbon Strategy, the concept of creating a knowledge-based society with the improvement of competitiveness, economic growth and the creation of jobs at the centre."
"Mr President, please allow me to thank the decision makers for selecting Budapest in Hungary as the location for this important institution."
"I am convinced that we will be good hosts to this institution."
"I would like to draw your attention to the unprecedented political consensus reached on this matter in Hungary."
"I honestly hope that the institution will promote success next year, which the European Union has declared as the year of creativity and innovation. Thank you for the floor."
"Mr President, less than two weeks ago the European Court of Justice found that Ireland was in contravention of the Water Framework Directive in regard to some of its waste water treatment systems."
"I must say that, personally, I am very pleased that the Commission is actively involved in trying to ensure clean drinking water in Ireland."
"However, the EU Commission now has an opportunity to build on that good work."
"It can do this by granting an extension to the Farm Waste Management Scheme."
"The deadline for completion of works is December 2008, but, because of exceptional circumstances, work will not be completed."
"If the deadline is not extended, as I said, work will be incomplete and nobody will benefit."
"Extending the scheme would be a win-win situation for water quality in Ireland, for the environment, for farmers and for Commission policy."
"It would be a reasonable and sensible move by the Commission to extend the deadline in order to ensure compliance with the Nitrates Directive, and it would show joined-up thinking with regard to the implementation of EU policy."
"(SK) Slovakia, a Member State of the Union, has adopted the European Union's value system, which means that it should also respect the principles of the cultural and linguistic diversity of the Community."
"However, the recent survey by the Open Society Fund points to a dangerous increase in Slovak pupils' hatred of the Hungarian minority and shows that more than 63% are of the opinion that, in public, Hungarians should speak only Slovak, with use of the Hungarian language being limited to their homes."
"The outrageous thing is that even the Minister for Education gave his full support to this view in parliament."
"This is a startling situation."
"The Minister's position is unconstitutional and contradictory to Slovak legislation and the principles on which democratic Europe is based."
"Since the coalition government of Mr RÃ³bert Fico came to power, something has been wrong in Slovakia."
"Anti-Hungarian, racist and xenophobic displays have been getting more numerous, chiefly due to Mr JÃ¡n Slota, the chairman of the ruling party."
"The perplexing thing is that neither the prime minister nor the representatives of the coalition parties are protesting about this, nor are they condemning this damaging and dangerous trend."
"(BG) Mr President, esteemed colleagues, I would like to turn your attention to the latest in a series of scandals that have erupted in Bulgaria in connection with the EUR 49 million spent by the Ministry of Interior on the use of special surveillance means."
"The expenditure would be justified if there was even a single criminal detected and convicted thanks to the use of listening and watching devices."
"At the same time, Interior Ministry officials have always argued that they lack even rudimentary equipment to successfully prosecute criminals in Bulgaria."
"It turns out that after enough money to pay for 15 reconnaissance planes has been spent, the only thing that Bulgarian policemen can say is to report that they were unable to see who planted a bomb in a clandestine brothel in the centre of the capital city."
"The facts invite just one possible conclusion."
"The Ministry of Interior, together with certain private companies, are ripping off Bulgarian taxpayers, they are robbing them systematically, and then on a huge scale."
"The services that are supposed to prevent crime are used only for political and economic racketeering, and for squaring accounts with the opposition."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"In the years to come, the sustainable development of the European Union's economies can only be realised if we strengthen the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises in the Union, since they safeguard roughly 4 out of 5 jobs that have been created in the Union recently."
"The European package of measures for small businesses, the 'Small Business Act', published by the Commission in June, acknowledges the central role played by small businesses in European economies and provides a general framework for the policy of the Union and the Member States."
"This document proposes the adoption of new regulations in key areas such as simplified regulation of state aid and an increase in financial discipline."
"However, European small businesses need more than merely the political will of the Commission, Parliament or even the Member States."
"Small businesses need the new regulations to be drawn up quickly and applied effectively."
"The European Parliament must assume a key role in accelerating this process. Thank you."
"(HU) Mr President, we are finding that extreme ideas and violent manifestations are spreading among people, social groups, ethnicities and not infrequently among peoples and nations."
"There are political instruments for stopping them, and administrative and police instruments may be put into action."
"However, politicians who think in the long term prefer to call for dialogue, not only political dialogue, which often leads to conflict, but also cultural dialogue."
"In order for us to sustain dialogue with someone about culture, we must first know our own culture."
"The essence of the year of intercultural dialogue is that we should get to know the different layers of society and the life and past of minorities, ethnic groups and nationalities, which may seem strange at first glance, not only among countries but also within a country."
"The unity of a nation and good relations between peoples, ethnic groups and nations are assisted by this kind of familiarity, but a lack of it prevents this."
"In the year of intercultural dialogue, I feel it is especially important for all European societies to maintain truly valuable dialogue between the majority and the minority, because it is only in this way that true relations can develop between the cultures of European countries."
"It's a European phenomenon that we have to handle at European level. Thank you very much."
"(RO) Together we decided that the European energy policy would aim at decreasing the EU's energy dependence, guaranteeing the security of supply and the transparency of prices."
"What we notice today is that the European gas market is characterised by considerable dynamism in all regards: energy policy, technical equipment, the gas business itself, and the transparency of prices, as pricing is a key component in the protection of European consumers."
"In this context, the metering and billing of gas in relation to end consumers requires the development of appropriate standards allowing for a uniform calculation method, recognised throughout the EU, so that measuring will be transparent, i.e. fair, unbiased and accurate."
"I call on the European Parliament today to take all the necessary measures to promote verification of the way in which gas is metered and billed, because we have found that in Romania gas transporters and distributors fail to meet these requirements: gas is metered in cubic meters and billed in kw/h, and citizens are unable to check their actual consumption, which is the result of a mathematical formula that are based on debatable parameters."
"Mr President, there is widespread anger and fear amongst our citizens concerning the collapsing financial institutions globally and their potential impact on pensions, savings and jobs."
"I am pleased that Commissioner McCreevy is here for the debate that is about to take place."
"However, I believe that he must act swiftly with regard to what this Parliament is proposing - to rein in 'casino capitalism', which has driven us to the edge of the economic abyss."
"Commissioner, if your commitment to neo-liberal ideology will not allow you to do so, then you should resign and allow someone else to be appointed who is prepared to face down the market buccaneers."
"Strict, new regulation of the financial and banking sector is urgently needed and your championing so far of so-called 'light regulation', which is some cases has meant zero regulation, must be brought rapidly to an end."
"Before I sit down, I would like to refer to the comments made by Miss McDonald of Sinn FÃ©in, where she sought to justify their campaign against Lisbon and is now proclaiming that she wants economic sovereignty for Ireland in the midst of a global financial crisis."
"I think it demonstrates the light-headed attitude of the 'no' campaigners."
"(PL) The financial crisis means that the transparency of funds involved in alternative investments should also be an important issue for the European Parliament."
"Increasing the transparency of companies with the use of legal instruments, especially as regards the relationship between hedge funds and private equity funds on the one hand and the companies in which these funds hold shares on the other, has become a priority."
"The so-called codes of good practice could possibly serve as a model, but they cannot replace legislative measures in instances of bad behaviour."
"It is essential to create a code of best practice as regards methods for re-establishing balance in the present management structure of companies."
"The new legislation should also oblige hedge funds and private equity funds to declare and explain their investment policy and the related risks to both individual and institutional investors, as well as to insurance brokers and supervisory bodies."
"(SK) Allow me to express my grief and say a few words in remembrance of the recent tragic crash involving a Slovak bus that took place near the Croatian town of GospiÄ."
"Fourteen human lives were extinguished and other persons were injured on their way to their holidays."
"I should like to express my sympathy to the bereaved and, at the same time, to thank the Croatian side for its exemplary behaviour that softened the impact of the accident, and for looking after our citizens so well."
"Croatia is repeatedly showing, by its ability to respond to problems and to solve them, that its future lies in the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, on 26 September the EU celebrates its linguistic diversity."
"The events focus on the idea that languages are bridges for culture, and that the learning of foreign languages and the ability to communicate across the language barrier should be encouraged."
"These events and the Commission's communications entirely neglect the need to maintain the teaching of Ancient Greek and Latin throughout Europe."
"These classical languages are the source of many words and expressions in all the languages of Europe and beyond."
"At the same time, the Green Paper on 'Migration and Mobility: challenges and opportunities for EU education systems' is open for consultation."
"The Green Paper refers to the role of Council Directive 77/486/EEC on the education of the children of migrant workers, and takes a critical view of the piecemeal actions that have been taken over the past 30 years on the basis of that directive."
"This is an opportunity to strengthen the teaching of the languages of European migrant workers."
"(SK) The third consecutive political crisis in Ukraine was probably the reason why the historic second EU-Ukraine Summit that took place in Paris at the beginning of September did not reach more ambitious conclusions concerning the Russia-Georgia conflict."
"I appreciate that the European Union again declared its support for building civil society and for pro-democratic changes in Ukraine."
"I also have a positive opinion on the agreement to begin a 'visa dialogue' that should, in the long run, result in a visa-free regime between both sides, as well as on the fact that, in spite of the new political crisis, Ukraine's road towards EU membership stays open."
"Today no one has any doubt that the Orange Revolution changed the historical direction in which Ukraine was going."
"Now Ukraine must show that it is stable and united."
"This is its only chance to achieve a European perspective."
"I am convinced that we can strengthen freedom at home only if we protect it outside the EU borders as well."
"This is the reason why I will take part in the 11th session of the European Parliament's delegation to Ukraine on 2/3 October 2008 in Kiev and Jalta."
"I believe that the presence of representatives of the European Parliament in Ukraine will contribute towards calming the situation and towards political stability in Ukraine."
"(ES) Mr President, I wished only to add my voice to the condemnation of the terrorist attack or attacks, including a murder, that we have experienced in our country."
"The Basque people have the misfortune of being the only country in the European Union which continues to experience terrorism, and that terrorism has been on-going for decades."
"I personally come from a family which endured 40 years of exile - the same as the duration of Francoism - and if we learned anything at all it was that no political objective was worth the life of a single human being."
"Finally I would like to say that all of us who believe in the Basque people's right to decide are clear in our minds that the right to life is the most basic right of all."
"Mr President, we are all very well aware that rising oil prices and gas prices are having a hugely negative effect on many sectors of our economy and on consumers."
"I would like to draw attention to the impact this crisis is having on the farming sector, the fishing sector and small businesses."
"High fuel costs have been passed on to the farmer at the present time: costs are escalating and farmers are not receiving an increase to cover that cost of high energy and gas prices."
"The fuel crisis is undermining the growth of competitiveness in our small and medium-sized enterprises; reducing the consumer purchasing power aggravates the situation and, Mr President, I dread to think what is going to happen this winter - many millions of people will be unable to afford to keep themselves warm."
"We all saw what happened at the petrol stations when the price of oil was going up; every day you went past a petrol station the price went up."
"But, now that the price has come down, they have not been bringing it down nearly as far as it went up."
"I think that they need to respond to that: they have made all their profits and it is time to pass on and bring in decent prices to the consumer."
"(HU) Mr President, Hungary has borders with itself, and lost 2/3 of her territory after the First World War."
"The political representation of the Hungarians living in these areas, totalling more than 3 million in seven countries, has allowed their rights to be fought for over the last century using only peaceful means."
"For six years, nearly 20 political organisations, within the framework of the forum for representatives from the Carpathian Basin, have debated peaceful opportunities for the enforcement of interests, and they continue to do so: identity, mother tongue, economic relations and autonomy."
"I am also a member of this forum."
"This year, we decided that we would open a joint lobbying office in Brussels in the interests of using the opportunities provided by the EU."
"It is incomprehensible and unacceptable that the peaceful endeavours of the Hungarian communities are insulted with extreme epithets by politicians from some Member States of the EU, while they accuse the Hungarian minority living in their country of collective criminality and want to restrict the use of their mother tongue."
"I would like to draw the attention of the European Parliament to these attacks, and to remind it again that community rights must be ensured for national minorities, and not for them to be accused of collective criminality."
"The EU must assume a proactive, preventive role in this. Thank you."
"(EL) Mr President, the Commission wishes to help combat the problem of rising food prices in developing countries and intends to fund those countries to the tune of EUR 1 billion."
"This will finance the purchase of seeds and other supplies to increase agricultural production, feed the population, cut inflation and reduce food prices."
"It is politically and morally right that we should help developing countries, but we should be well advised to take a corresponding initiative to assist European farmers."
"They have been hit just as hard by the increase in food prices and much else, because this money should be seen as savings from the reduction in costs under the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"I therefore propose that a large part of the EUR 1 billion should be used to assist European farmers who are facing a great many problems."
"To conclude, let me express my serious concern over the proper use of money to be given to these countries; the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries have no model for rural development, and no inspection system."
"I fear that the money will be lost in the bureaucracy of international organisations without ultimately bringing any benefit."
"That concludes the item."
"Hedge funds and private equity - Transparency of institutional investors (debate)"
"Now we move to a debate that was organised last month by the European Parliament with extraordinary prescience, anticipating the events of last week, perhaps - unlike others."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, including recommendations to the Commission on hedge funds and private equity, and"
"the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, including recommendations to the Commission on transparency of institutional investors."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, long before this crisis, the European Socialist Group and the European Socialist Party raised concerns over the tendencies on the financial markets for excessive debt, lack of transparency, taking high risks and paying too low prices, and making packages on leveraging which nobody could really understand or act on."
"We therefore raised our concerns as if looking into a new financial bubble."
"Nobody could tell when this would be, but we are now at the centre of the storm - the 'perfect storm', as somebody called it."
"I feel very strongly that the debate this evening and tomorrow will be the most relevant debate in any parliament on financial markets anywhere in Europe or in the United States - debate and decisions in the sense that we are looking forward, trying to make better regulation than we have now and trying to take on a broad responsibility for doing the job as well as we can."
"Now is the time to act."
"We have seen what happened in the US, and, while someone said that it is not as bad in Europe as in the US, I can only say that HBOS, Northern Rock and many other such cases is enough to convince me to act."
"We have seen the new prognoses for our economies, for our jobs, for our competition and for our investment capability: that is enough for me to act."
"That is why I am proud to be telling Parliament today and tomorrow that the PSE Group has made a compromise, following tough negotiations - which is as it should be on such an important matter - with the ALDE and PPE-DE Groups."
"We now have in front of us a balanced report which demands that the Commission present proposals on legislation and regulation for all financial actors, including hedge funds and private equity."
"It is high time we did this, and I would remind Parliament that we are now asking for mandatory capital requirements for all financial institutions."
"We are asking for an aligning of reward packages with longer-term outcomes in order to reflect losses as well as profits."
"We are asking for full transparency for high-level executives' and senior managers' remuneration systems."
"We are asking for disclosure of leverage/debt exposure, the source and amount of funds raised and identification of shareholders for all investment projects."
"We are asking for an extension of the directive requiring that employees be informed and consulted during take-overs to include leveraged buy-outs by private equity, and we are asking for measures to 'avoid unreasonable asset stripping in target companies'."
"We are asking for actions to avoid excessive debt caused by leveraged buy-out, so that level of leverage is sustainable both for the private equity fund/firm and for the target company."
"I would like to ask Mr McCreevy, the Commissioner responsible for this area, to respond very concretely to these proposals."
"I know that they are new to him, but I insist on a timetable."
"We have asked for a response before the end of the year, which is three months from now."
"There may be details to discuss but, Commissioner, you also owe this Parliament a response, because we are not talking about a small minority, but a very broad majority within this Parliament."
"I shall end by informing you that, as of four to five days ago, close to 90 000 people had signed a petition addressed to the European Parliament, the United States and world leaders, organised by the global internet movement Avaaz."
"I am delivering that petition on its behalf to those recipients."
"It reads: 'We urge you to take a lead in fixing the fundamental flaws and loopholes which made this global financial crisis possible, including basic problems of debt and risk, incentives and transparency."
"We need you to work together to protect the public good by framing stronger rules for all parts of the global financial system."
"Be bold, and we will support you.'"
"Commissioner, will you be bold, together with us, support us and deliver preliminary answers before the end of the year?"
"I must insist, on behalf of all of us, on a positive response."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate is indeed taking place, if somewhat by chance, at exactly the right time."
"My report to all intents and purposes addresses the other side of the coin."
"Mr Rasmussen has had to deal in particular with the effects on the financial markets and the Committee on Legal Affairs with its expertise naturally concerned itself in particular with the aspects of company law and, where necessary, with the need to change European company law."
"We are all shaken by the events of recent days."
"The public, politicians and - I say this very clearly - the honest economy as well."
"The problem we see in practice at the moment is that profits are being privatised, but losses are being nationalised."
"It has almost become a joke in this saga that Mr Paulson, the US Finance Minister, who was himself once head of Goldman Sachs, now finds himself in the situation of having to take USD 700 billion in taxpayers' money in order to eliminate and smooth out the havoc his own sector of industry has wreaked."
"It is really sad."
"There are more and more examples of the fact that in the public perception, the image of the conventional family enterprise taking care of its employees with its own liability, which it itself guarantees, is on the decline, while on the other hand, the impression continues to grow of us being partly governed at least in the economic sector by ineffectual top managers, by employees who are highly paid but who no longer bear any responsibility."
"I think that the emerging impression of our system of market economy is appalling and that it is politically necessary for us to take the appropriate steps to restore order and thus actually remove this appalling impression."
"The fact is that it affects not only the major investors, but now also small investors."
"It affects every taxpayer and all those who are dependent on government funds because more and more billions in public money have to be used to repair the damage."
"I admit - and the debate has clearly shown this, and it is also indisputable - that one aspect we initially had to address in particular - namely the hedge funds and private equity sector - is not a cause of the problems we are currently having to tackle."
"Here too, however - and the debate in the House has clearly shown this, as have the hearings on both committees - there are obviously definite shortcomings in the areas of harmonisation and regulation."
"It has rightly been stated that these sectors are also regulated by national regulations, some stronger, some weaker, according to the nations' different traditions and according to which financial market regulations prevail there."
"At the same time, however, it has also become clear that we need further harmonisation and adjustment at European level in order to ensure that these sectors, which have now reached absolutely critical dimensions, also do not represent any risk for the financial markets."
"I would like to respond to just a few key words, which have already been addressed in the draft report - which incidentally had already been resolved in the Committee on Legal Affairs in June when nobody was talking about this crisis in which we currently find ourselves."
"I am thinking of the terms 'stock lending' and 'short selling'."
"We now hear that a range of important financial market regulators have banned this, and for good reason."
"We did ask at the time, and are asking now, as well, that this at least be examined."
"Consequences have to be drawn from this and legislative proposals must also be made if need be."
"One of these is the issue of better identification of shareholders, issues of transparency, of the tightening of the regulations on transparency in view of the fact that enterprises as well as the managers of these enterprises ought to know to whom they actually belong in order that they, too, are able to act responsibly towards those who own them."
"It also entails reasonable checks being made on certain risks when credit is granted to ensure that sensible, necessary consequences can also be drawn in order that giant levers cannot be moved by relatively small means, which ultimately create an impact that gets completely out of control and brings adversity in its wake for the general public and for others."
"Incidentally, one piece of advice: in the meantime numerous proposals have been developed in the industry for practical codes, for voluntary regulation on how one should behave."
"The mere fact that these regulations have been developed, even if they are still only voluntary at present, thus accounts for the fact that the industry itself evidently accepts the need for some regulation."
"Hence it is entirely reasonable to take a look at, and think about, whether we are able to take action here as well."
"Asset flipping is another matter to which we must attend."
"Company law must tackle this issue because I am convinced that enterprises should not be able to be plundered."
"We are expecting a concrete proposal from the Commission."
"This is a report in accordance with Article 192, to which the Commission must respond. We hope it will do so soon."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and in particular their rapporteurs, Mr Rasmussen and Mr Lehne, for the work done in the preparation of these two reports."
"Few would have predicted one year ago that the situation in financial markets would be as serious as it is today."
"And the effects of the crisis will continue to be felt for some time."
"It started with reckless selling of mortgages in the United States, promoted by banks and others who did not care about lending standards because they could offload the loans to others through securitisation."
"Credit-rating agencies then gave respectability to these high-risk products by assigning low credit-default risk to them."
"Financial institutions around the world bought up these products without, it seems, doing any serious risk assessment of their own."
"In the light of events over the past year, it has been incredible to see how little understanding senior managers of financial institutions had of the risk they were taking on board."
"No doubt the size of the profits that were rolling in blunted serious risk analysis."
"Supervisors seemed to have no better idea of the risk in these hugely complex products."
"Things were so sliced up, diced up and repackaged that no one knew where the real risk was."
"One observer referred some months ago to this unfolding crisis as like watching a train crash in slow motion."
"Last week the crisis went into hyper speed."
"The concerted actions of the world's major central banks and the announcement of the support measures by the United States authorities have restored some calm to the markets."
"We must welcome this given the extreme situation faced by regulators."
"I also welcome that the United States authorities have shown recognition of the need to address in their proposals similar assets held by some non-US financial institutions."
"One thing we can be thankful for in Europe is that we have not seen the same scale of destruction as has happened in the United States."
"Although banks in the EU have been suffering from a similar lack of confidence in lending to each other, there has not been anything on the same scale as experienced in the United States."
"But no one is out of the woods yet."
"There are difficult trading conditions ahead."
"The downturn in economies will have its effects."
"Vigilance and transparency are key if confidence is to be restored in markets."
"At EU level we must continue to improve our supervisory arrangements for cross-border supervisory financial institutions."
"There is a window of opportunity that must not be missed."
"All of this leads me to believe we are going to have a different financial services sector when this is all over and we will have a different regulatory framework as well."
"If moral hazard cannot be shown to work then the taxpayer cannot be expected to pick up the bill for the excess and irresponsible risk-taking of private institutions."
"The ultimate shape of whatever new regulatory approach will be adopted will be designed over the coming period as the lessons from this crisis and the appropriate responses become clearer."
"We need to continue to work closely with other regulatory authorities and to the extent possible dovetail our responses."
"As many of you will be aware, we have already been taking action."
"For a year now the Commission has been working on a detailed road map agreed by the Council of Finance Ministers and endorsed by the European Council."
"We have been refining our response as the turmoil unfolds."
"We have already taken measures to improve convergence and cooperation between supervisors."
"A new memorandum of understanding was agreed by EU supervisory authorities, finance ministers and central banks setting out common principles including the establishment of cross-border stability groups."
"This is now being implemented."
"We have been reviewing enhancements of deposit guarantee schemes."
"A special group which will report by the end of this year has been set up to look at the pro-cyclicality effects of current instruments including Basel 2 and IFRS."
"In close cooperation with the Financial Stability Forum, the IASB has set up an advisory panel on fair valuation."
"Work on off-balance-sheet items is also under way in the IASB."
"Industry has come forward with valuable data which improves transparency for regulators of the securitisation market."
"The Commission is pressing industry to refine this information so that transparency for regulators is improved."
"In the light of these activities, and others I will refer to, it should come as no surprise to Members when I say that I can welcome many of the points set out in Mr Rasmussen's report."
"What is important is that we are able to identify the key measures we should take now and get them implemented."
"As I said earlier, the market turmoil exposed failings in the risk management of large financial institutions."
"It also highlighted a number of areas of regulatory weakness."
"It is on these areas that regulatory attention must now be focused."
"Mr Rasmussen has flagged in his report many of the most pressing areas: conflicts of interest in credit-rating agencies, the need for improvement in the valuation of illiquid assets and the misalignment of incentives in the 'originate and distribute' model."
"Over the past year I have kept Members informed, both in plenary and particularly the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of the work we have been doing on improving capital requirements in banks, as well as my ideas for regulating credit-rating agencies."
"We all agree, I believe, on the need for a strengthening of capital requirements and an obligation for transparency and due diligence in regards to structured products."
"We have been working on changes to the Capital Requirements Directive, which will improve the management of large exposures, improve quality of capital through harmonising treatment of hybrid capital."
"We have also been looking at strengthening the supervision of cross-banking groups."
"In the next few weeks I will be proposing to the Commission two separate regulatory measures to deal with these and other issues: firstly, an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive and, secondly, a regulation on credit-rating agencies."
"I look forward to the support of the European Parliament for these proposals which are very much in line with what you call for in this report."
"Hedge funds and private equity feature in both reports."
"We have had some interesting exchanges over the years about the roles of hedge funds and private equity."
"One thing I believe we can agree on is that they were not the cause of the current turmoil."
"It has turned out that it was the regulated sector that had been allowed to run amok with little understood securitisation vehicles."
"I do not believe it is necessary at this stage to tar hedge funds and private equity with the same brush as we use for the regulated sector."
"The issues relating to the current turmoil are different."
"Let us not forget that these funds are regulated in Member States."
"Hedge funds and private equity managers are authorised and supervised entities throughout Europe."
"They are subject to the same market-abuse disciplines as other participants in financial markets."
"They are bound by similar transparency and consultation obligations when investing in public companies."
"Exposure of the banking sector to hedge funds and private equity is subject to the Capital Requirements Directive."
"But this does not mean that we are turning a blind eye to hedge funds and private equity."
"As these business models evolve and their role in financial markets changes, regulators around the world need to remain vigilant."
"The industries themselves must assume all the responsibilities that accompany a prominent role in European and global financial markets."
"Several recent market initiatives indicate that this message is understood."
"Our role should be to monitor closely these and other developments in the market and be ready to respond if and when necessary."
"I welcome the constructive suggestions for supporting the functioning of the single market."
"I would just like to mention at this stage that there is considerable work under way in the Commission on private placement and venture capital."
"I agree with Mr Lehne that a sufficient degree of transparency is an essential condition for investor confidence."
"It is, therefore, indispensable if we want financial markets to function effectively."
"The report sets out a list of transparency rules that apply today to the different players in the financial markets in the EU."
"To my mind, what is important is that the market is provided with a sufficient degree of clear information that is useful."
"We need to find the balance between the need for confidentiality of the proprietary information of investment vehicles against the legitimate needs of investors, counterparties, regulators and investee firms."
"I am, therefore, pleased that the report puts an emphasis on the need to analyse the impact of the existing EU provisions and of additional Member States' rules in this field before one embarks on introducing any new legislation."
"The Commission has already been very active in this field."
"We have held extensive consultations in the context of our shareholders' rights initiative, where we looked at a number of issues that are touched upon in the report - stock lending, for example, and the question of the identification of shareholders."
"Furthermore, we have recently published a call for tender for an outside study that will look at the implementation, in Member States, of the Transparency Directive."
"This study should be available next year and will form the basis for a general evaluation of the Directive, including the notification thresholds."
"As Members will recall, the Commission adopted, in spring of this year, a communication setting out its policy approach to sovereign wealth funds."
"We had come to the conclusion that these measures were appropriate but also sufficient to address the issues that currently are being discussed."
"This approach was endorsed by the European Council; I see, though, that the Committee on Legal Affairs does not entirely share this assessment."
"I shall make some brief remarks in this area."
"Firstly, we should acknowledge that hedge funds and private equity in many senses are not unique - other institutional investors have similar objectives and nowadays use similar techniques."
"If in that situation we imposed special obligations on hedge funds and private equity, this would result in discrimination of these categories of investors."
"Secondly, we should not make the mistake to perceive all activities of hedge funds as a threat to the market but we should also be aware of the positive effects that their activities have."
"Let me be clear, the EU economy is going to need massive investment in the time ahead: without sovereign wealth funds, private equity and the like, Europe's recovery from today's turmoil will be all the slower."
"Thirdly, I agree that certain techniques, such as stock lending and the use of derivatives, do pose challenges to established models of governance."
"This is an area we, in conjunction with national supervisors, will be giving close attention to in the time ahead."
"In conclusion, these two reports will be significant contributions to our ongoing reflection."
"I commend Members for these reports."
"The Commission will examine your recommendations and report back to you as envisaged in the framework agreement."
"We remain fully committed to responding to this crisis with the measures necessary to restore confidence and stability."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that, in the current turmoil, the interconnection between all institutions is plain to see."
"It is equally plain and logical that regulation has to be targeted at function and not at entities."
"It would be wrong if one private company had to abide by different rules from others just because it was owned by private equity."
"There are two sides to everything."
"Amid the frequent criticism again this week of short selling, let us not forget the stock lenders."
"Attention by investors - even supervisors - to the lending policies of pension funds and others is relevant, and not just the activities of share borrowers."
"We have visited this matter before in the context of voting borrowed shares."
"'Two sides' also means that enhancing transparency will only be effective if it is accompanied by due diligence, and not undone again by excessive disclaimers."
"Finally, voluntary codes do have a role, and reach parts which we cannot regulate."
"However, they are not just a private matter for the industries concerned, and need exposure, easy access and active review and monitoring."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, 2007 has continued to be brandished as a possible continuation of the mortgagee crisis."
"We have been trying to lay this to rest."
"In June 2007 we should have been hearing even more alarm bells ringing, at least when two hedge funds managed by the New York investment bank Bear Stearns went astray because they were involved on a grand scale in bonds secured by real estate."
"This was only the beginning of the whole affair!"
"It has become clearer and clearer how these kinds of financial service businesses have been developing with such a low level of transparency."
"On the one hand a few have been making large profits - in high-risk sectors, of course - while on the other hand we are dealing today with a classic nationalisation of losses."
"It is not just US economic journalists and economists who are describing this situation in precisely this way."
"We in the EU as well, in the European Parliament, are changing our perspective willy-nilly, but rather late in the day."
"It would also be preferable for the Commission to stand out on this."
"Both reports - the Rasmussen report and the Lehne report - demonstrate the urgent need for action."
"By now at least it must be clear to all the political players that the market is not able to regulate itself entirely."
"The Commission should now also be aware of this."
"Hedge funds and private equities are already some of the largest employers, but according to many judicial systems, they no longer appear so and are therefore, of course, relieved of their obligations as employers."
"This is not acceptable; the lack of transparency is too great!"
"In the meantime, thousands of jobs have been put at risk by the financial crisis."
"Regulation, supervision, transparency, employee participation and information in the pension funds sector, which are heavily involved in hedge funds and private equities, are vital."
"It is important to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that employees are not asked to pay out twice, Commissioner: once due to the financial crisis per se and once due to risk-sharing by pension funds."
"In order for this not to happen, Directive 2003/41/EC should at least ensure that employees must be kept informed directly or indirectly by trustees about the type and risk of the investment of their pensions and they must be given a voice in decisions."
"This is just one of many facets that we have highlighted in our reports and opinions."
"Commissioner, you are now being asked to do something."
"I know we can talk about a lot of things, but you are duty-bound to assist."
"The legislative period is not yet over."
"I should like to draw your attention to this."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report was originally aimed at hedge funds and private equity, but now covers the entire financial system, which has completely collapsed."
"The present crisis is the hideous aftermath of a credit mania, specifically of the excessive expansion of debt."
"The Federal Reserve kept interest rates too low for too long and thereby essentially provided a credit subsidy."
"We have drawn up the report on the basis of the current situation and together with our fellow Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we have reached an agreement with Mr Rasmussen, which encompasses the entire financial system."
"We are grateful that this has gone through virtually unanimously in the Committee on Economic Affairs."
"We can no longer rely on US standards and the setting of standards in the international financial system."
"We must create our own new, European options and we have proposed adopting a whole range of items and ending discussions on them."
"As a start we must include all the financial institutions working with leverage in the particular risk assessment."
"We then say that in the global financial system, risk-adjusted capital requirement must have the same status for all players."
"We should also be stipulating requirements for promoters of packages and syndicating packages, whereby they retain a chunk beyond these packages."
"The rating agencies - Mr Rasmussen and Mr Lehne have already pointed this out - must close the gaps in information and disclose conflicts of interest."
"We should consider whether or not we get the rating agencies to assume liability for their rating along the lines of the financial auditors."
"We must then also consider whether or not derivatives should be traded compulsorily on the Stock Exchange - possibly with the exception of interest rate swaps."
"We are also asking that the banks' governing boards ensure that bankers' bonuses take account not only of good performances, but also of any losses that may eventually occur."
"This therefore means that incentives for bankers apply in the good and the bad times and not just in the good times."
"Greed was and is a bad advisor on financial strategies."
"In recent years we in the ECB have had a reliable partner, who all in all has reacted grosso modo in a rather more reasonable and balanced manner than the Federal Reserve."
"This we can say with hindsight."
"In the euro area we are also in urgent need of European banking supervision for the euro area because we cannot carry on living with national supervision alone."
"This means that all in all we are assuming that institutions, or even voluntary associations, are being set up in Europe so that the subjects we are addressing can be better understood in order to prevent the next crisis of this magnitude."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would say to Mr Lauk that he may support the report that Mr DÄianu and I drafted on European supervision, but there was a lack of support for it from the EPP."
"Allow me also to say something in response to the Commissioner, which is that I find it unbelievable that he has not reacted to the core issues of the report."
"He merely told us that the Commission is closely monitoring and closely following developments, and then said that hedge funds and private equity also have much positive influence, and that we should reflect on that."
"It is like hearing that a hurricane or tsunami is coming and being told that we should reflect on the positive aspects of water and wind!"
"It is ridiculous."
"(NL) I shall continue in Dutch, as I wish to focus on two issues with particular relevance to Mr Lehne's report."
"One of these - which Mr Lehne himself has already mentioned - is stock lending and short selling."
"This is of course a classic example of the Commission's recent failure to keep abreast of things."
"We raised the issue of the need to take action regarding stock lending, the lending and borrowing of shares, long ago, as this was being misused in hedge fund campaigns against companies."
"Now, at long last, financial market supervisors - a number of individual supervisors in individual countries - have done so."
"This is not a coordinated European action; initiatives such as this have once more had to come from the national level."
"We could have been one step ahead of this and perhaps also have prevented some defaults, some bank or insurance company collapses, had we had adequate measures in place for this."
"This is also a further illustration of the fact that such things transcend sectors and that sectoral supervision of banks, insurance companies or securities alone is insufficient."
"We really do need to combine such supervision and ensure that these securities are anticipated on both sides and that such occurrences are prevented."
"The other issue is remuneration systems."
"We have stated in the report that it is very important that these be curbed and that voting on remuneration policy be possible at shareholders' meetings."
"I was pleased to note that, during this week's discussion on the forthcoming emergency fund in the United States, my Democrat counterparts in Congress expressed their desire to make borrowing from this fund conditional on, among other things, the curbing of exorbitant managerial salaries and bonuses."
"After all, it would beggar belief if Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who are now submitting themselves to that supervision and also wish to make use of those public funds, were to continue handing out bonuses running into millions."
"It is also appropriate that we in Europe go beyond the recommendation from a couple of years ago."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner what he intends to do about this, as it is high time we took action."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, sorry, this is part two."
"As Mr Rasmussen said, these reports are balanced, though some may be more inclined to quote from the press from one side of the scales than the other."
"We have had rumblings about hedge funds and private equity for years but, caught up in the present financial turmoil, it is no longer a rarity to be concerned about debt and leverage."
"However, this does present us with an opportunity to clear the air and establish a comprehensive review that addresses the exposure issues underlying the present turmoil as well as other risk and debt issues, including those within hedge funds and private equity."
"The reports do accept that this must be done on a non-discriminatory and principled basis, paying due regard to proportionality."
"It also needs to be done in the context of international developments and, above all, it must be smart."
"Now, whilst debt and its proper management is one issue that appears everywhere at the moment, another is that of compensation packages and conflict of interest."
"Clearly, for market stability, steps have to be taken to ensure that rewards match longer-term horizons."
"I agree that that principle should extend to all areas."
"This is not to endorse the notion that all private equity and venture capital has asset stripping as its motivation: that is certainly not the best way to turn around a failing company into a profitable, saleable one."
"Indeed, national laws to prevent asset stripping already exist, but they have rarely been used."
"So I am not convinced that a European measure would in fact be any progress."
"Coming again to the matter of regulation versus voluntary codes, many of the voluntary codes are only just getting under way, and for the main part these should be given time to operate."
"They are also easier to update, but as I said earlier, they are not a private matter, and public confidence does come into the equation."
"So I am pleased that my suggestion of a one-stop website as a register of voluntary codes with relevant links to compliance postings has been accepted by colleagues as a potentially useful tool, and I hope the Commissioner will follow that up."
"When it comes to transparency, it is also important to recognise that the public investors and supervisors need different levels of information, and that information has to be fit for purpose."
"Even within the context of professional investors, burying information in what I would call 'legal spam' is unacceptable."
"Supervisors should have all the information that they need, but care has to be taken in those areas where the information should not get into the public domain."
"Finally, we have gone into those sensitive areas of securitisation and credit rating agencies."
"On securitisation, I know the Commissioner likes the retention idea, but that is clearly just one available tool, and I would urge that he be prepared to swap tools and that he should not close the tool box too soon."
"On rating agencies, there is a need to get a better handle on many matters, but I do warn against fragmentation from a system of internationally accepted ratings."
"Again, both these areas are an example of where, as I said, we must be smart: we must be smart ahead of trying to be vindictive."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, certainly this report has come at a very interesting time, as we are experiencing a time of unprecedented economic upheavals, and recent events have made us sadly aware of some of the shortcomings, weaknesses and abuses in many sectors of the financial market."
"There is no sector or grouping that has emerged unscathed or unblemished."
"There can be no case of 'let's go back to the same old rules'."
"Indeed, in the United States we are witnessing radical alterations in the landscape of high finance."
"Changes must also be made here in Europe, but also globally."
"In such a tense financial climate, it can be tempting to make scapegoats of certain financial actors or bodies."
"The lack of understanding that can surround hedge funds and their operation often makes them good targets for this kind of scapegoating."
"However, we must remember that neither hedge funds nor private equity led to the current financial crisis and, instead, at times provided much needed injections of liquidity into the market."
"We should also remember that the crisis which started in America resulted from bad banking practices, and the European banking sector, while badly affected, seems to be in a better position to deal with this problem than those banks in the United States."
"Nonetheless, we must not deny that there are problems and faults in the structure and operation of many investment vehicles, alternative investments included."
"It is not good enough to tinker with a small rule here or there."
"Real reform is needed, and it is needed on a global level."
"I believe that the report that has emerged from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, under the stewardship of Mr Rasmussen, reflects these concerns."
"For longer-term financial health and competitiveness, we must not and cannot regulate away constructive risk."
"Despite its name, this text does not seek to vilify hedge funds and private equity but instead notes the need for general market reform, greater transparency and calls for principle-based regulation."
"I welcome the comments made by the Commissioner here this evening, and I have absolutely no doubt that he will respond to the situation that we now find ourselves in."
"The financial system is international by nature, and we need international supervision of these markets in a global context."
"To secure global economic stability we must work together to find the best way forward, to put credibility and confidence back into the financial institutions and market for citizens globally, but also for the citizens of Europe, for their pension funds and also for their savings."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, rapporteurs, I believe that this report as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is a good one, and we should be grateful to Mr Rasmussen, in particular, for having insisted over so many months on the need for wider-ranging EU intervention in the areas that are the subject of tonight's debate."
"Nevertheless, my group has re-tabled a number of amendments which - strange as it may seem - were drafted not by us but by Mr Rasmussen himself."
"In other words, these are important proposals - notably on the establishment of an EU-level supervisory body and a European system of registration and approval for asset management and fund management companies (Amendments 6 and 7) and the introduction of a debt limit for capital investment funds (Amendment 9) - which Mr Rasmussen put forward but which he felt compelled to withdraw, understandably in certain respects, in order to secure a majority in the House: that is to say, a majority with the PPE Group and the Liberals."
"As I see it, these amendments - which cover issues raised in the working documents and which we consider to be constructive and worth arguing for - were withdrawn because here in Parliament, as in the Council and most certainly in the Commission, there are two schools of thought: the first is that we have enough rules already, at both national and European level, and that any outstanding problems can be addressed through self-regulation by the finance industry; the second, to which Mr Rasmussen subscribes (and he is by no means alone), has been saying for years that the current supervisory system for the financial markets generally is inadequate."
"The reason why no action was taken, Mr McCreevy, was not, in my view, because we could not predict, or were unaware, of developments."
"I believe that, over the years, quite a few authoritative voices have been raised, particularly in the Forum for Financial Stability, to alert the public authorities to the nature of the risks we faced."
"You and the Barroso Commission have generally tended to argue for a more laissez-faire approach, deeming the current arrangements to be adequate."
"What Parliament is asking of you now is nothing less than a change of heart."
"Whether you can manage that I do not know, but I believe it is necessary."
"Personally I should like to emphasise three points which other speakers have already touched on but which are of particular concern to environmentalists."
"We know that the climate and energy package that needs to be adopted will depend on a sustained level of investment, at a relatively modest rate of return with relatively modest gains, to provide the financing we need."
"Financial instruments such as equity funds and hedge funds are not appropriate and we are waiting for the European banking and monetary authorities to come forward with ideas for putting some old proposals back on the table: I am thinking here of Jacques Delors' proposals in the early 1990s and of a reinvigorated role for the European Investment Bank so that we can secure long-term investment at a moderate rate of return."
"It will be hard to stabilise the financial system - and the Rasmussen report mentions this point - without a determined assault on offshore financial centres and tax havens, and this is another area where the Barroso Commission is failing to take a lead."
"Lastly, in relation to corporate governance - which other speakers have also mentioned - we ought to take a much harder look at investment funds' managerial pay and reward policies."
"They are not acceptable and indeed they pose a threat to the economy generally."
"Mr President, in our opinion, whether to tackle the credit crisis through steadfast compliance with existing Community legislation or through some new, stricter regulations is a false dichotomy."
"Neither choice can thwart the cyclical course of the capitalist economy towards the crisis, which has its basis in the over-accumulation of capital in production."
"The credit crisis is also a reflection of this course."
"Bourgeois management sought to tackle the problem of over-accumulation by encouraging over-lending and stimulation of popular consumption in hedge funds and private equity as ways of financing businesses."
"The specific management choices not only could not stave off the course towards deceleration and recession but, on the contrary, constituted a bomb ready to explode, with incalculable consequences for people's income."
"At the same time, EU policy accelerated the full liberalisation of capital in the credit system, in line with the principles of the capitalist market."
"Hedge funds and private equity are the progeny of this course towards liberalisation."
"No proposed effort towards greater transparency and stricter legislative regulation in relation to the movement of capital in the credit sector, that is to say, in the sphere of circulation, can tackle all the inconsistencies and contradictions created by capitalist relations of production."
"Correspondingly, the imposition of stricter lending terms will lead to a contraction of popular consumption and the very rapid manifestation of crisis."
"No-one can provide a clear definition or common characteristics, other than rapid profit, for these schemes, which have ever-increasing control within the global economy, schemes created by the plutocracy and exploitable by it alone, with the help of specialist market organisations."
"The victims of this policy are the workers, who watch the wealth they produce accumulate in the hands of a small number of plutocrats and see their savings at risk of vanishing and their pensions also at risk."
"It is typical that hedge funds and private equity are exempt even from those obligations that employers have towards workers."
"The same also happens with pension systems - public and private - which transform workers' pension rights into prey for capital, participating ever more widely in these schemes, termed investment schemes, multiplying the risks and dissipating the rights of workers."
"There are many recent examples in the United States and the United Kingdom of secure credit institutions collapsing in a single day like a pack of cards and hundreds of thousands of workers losing their savings and pensions."
"The economic crisis that currently plagues the markets did not come as a bolt from the blue."
"It was widely anticipated, in terms of both timing and scale."
"Perhaps the measures being taken today were also planned."
"The workers, who, in the capitalist system of exploitation, financed the superprofits of the plutocracy through their labour and their savings, are today being called on in the name of stability - as taxpayers - to fund their losses as well."
"Workers and the popular classes are unconvinced by the announced transparency measures, with the possibility of implementation and effectiveness, moreover, being doubtful."
"They are unconvinced by the measures, which call on them to pay yet again for the rescue of capital profits and the maintenance of the system of exploitation."
"They are expressing their disobedience and their insubordination towards this system and the centre-right and centre-left alliances that support and preserve it."
"They are fighting against injustice, inequality and the exploitation of peoples, and for radical changes towards a system of popular power that will serve the interests of the workers."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, doesn't this all go to show that this vast exercise of EU financial regulation has singularly missed the mark?"
"In its obsession about money laundering and pursuit of the elusive single market in financial services, the EU has been pursuing the wrong objectives."
"Let us accept that, despite earlier assurances from Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia and others, there will be further financial failures in the European Union, and real economies in the EU will be affected by the credit crisis."
"So there is not much point now in discussing capital requirements and what we will do in the future to stop this sort of thing happening again; we have a problem, and the problem is now."
"We can blame the Americans, we can blame hedge funds, we can blame investment bankers, we can blame who we like, but what Mr McCreevy's Commission might rather spend its time now doing is discussing with the finance ministers of the different countries how the burden will be shared across countries when we find that we have to bail out financial institutions to the tune of hundreds of millions, as is now happening in the USA."
"How are we going to come to the aid of Italy, Spain, Greece and Ireland - Mr McCreevy's own country - when bad situations there are made worse by the crisis, and, stuck in the euro, there is nothing that those countries themselves can do to help themselves?"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if European banks are withstanding the current crisis relatively well, it is simply because banking supervision in Europe - while far from perfect - is at least serious."
"The ongoing work on the Capital Requirements Directive and on Solvency II affords an opportunity for introducing useful measures to improve financial security."
"It goes without saying that the job of a banker entails taking risks but those risks must be controlled."
"The important thing for bankers is to know at all times what security they have on a given risk."
"Certain unregulated financial operators lost sight of that simple principle, and in their case self-regulation will no longer suffice."
"Derivatives markets have grown increasingly murky, and traders have bought and sold at levels of risk that could not be contained by the management of those institutions that are now most exposed."
"Recovery from this crisis depends on creating a supervisory system capable of inspiring and re-establishing confidence."
"There are currently whole swathes of the finance industry that lie beyond the reach of supervisory authorities."
"Who was supervising the mortgage brokers as they lent so generously to households that would never be capable of repaying?"
"Who was supervising the investment banks that took the crisis up a notch by transforming the bad debt into financial products for sale all over the world?"
"There is a regulatory void out there that is also inhabited by credit enhancers, ratings agencies and hedge funds."
"It is not acceptable that Europe should periodically have to suffer the consequences of America's faulty financial system."
"With regard to hedge funds, the financial 'police' in the UK and the USA have just temporarily prohibited speculation on falling asset values, and quite rightly so!"
"The failure of some of these murky operators would accelerate the crisis in the deregulated sector."
"Not all investment funds are pernicious and some of them are actually necessary, but we cannot permit the continued existence of financial black holes."
"Reviews are worthwhile and indeed essential but what we need right now is action!"
"That is the thrust of the two reports we are debating."
"(ES) Madam President, despite the fact that the speaker who preceded me is from a different political group, I am in total agreement with him: we cannot leave the financial markets in the hands of financial managers."
"It is like leaving cheese to be looked after by mice."
"Self-regulation and voluntary codes of conduct are no use."
"As Commissioner Matridis said earlier, the thing that is saving the European financial markets is the existence of regulations, national regulations because each of our countries has regulations which work and are preventing the financial catastrophe in the US markets from spreading to Europe."
"What lesson can we draw from this?"
"That Europe cannot copy the United States in financial deregulation."
"If our goal is to protect our economy and our economic and social system we have to have European-wide regulation but we must not replace national regulation with supranational deregulation as in the United States, where the system allows managers of companies to get rich on the back of poor investors, pensioners and people who depend on that capital."
"I believe, therefore, that the lesson we must learn is not to deregulate but the reverse: it is that we need to adopt European regulations on all these aspects."
"That, to my mind, is the core of both the Rasmussen and the Lehne reports: the need to establish European financial regulation."
"There is much talk of the European passport, of giving a passport to undertakings to allow them to move throughout Europe in complete freedom but how can we grant the passport if we cannot be sure that those undertakings are subject to detailed regulation in their country of origin?"
"To do so would be to invite another supranational financial catastrophe."
"The regulations in the Lehne report contain a number of indications or recommendations on, for example, the actions of fund managers."
"We should know how those funds are being managed; and especially, we should know about the profits they earn through, for example, the purchase and sale of shares."
"I believe this is essential."
"Transparency must be combined with very strict regulation with the option for intervention at the appropriate time without waiting until the market has collapsed, as is the case in the United States at the moment, only for tax-payers' money to be used to right all the wrongs committed by people who have abused their position."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I urge you to use your position to try and establish a genuine Community system for regulation of these sectors so that we do not follow the path of self-regulation or deregulation."
"(SV) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to say a big thank you to Mr Rasmussen and Mr Lehne for their important reports."
"As many have pointed out, they could not have come at a better time."
"Developments on the US mortgage market have had major consequences for the entire global market over the last year."
"Bad loans have been bundled and passed on."
"Short-sightedness and the difficulty and complexity of many of the new market instruments have made the market more obscure and fast-moving."
"Besides, exorbitant remuneration for company directors has seriously shaken confidence - I think we can agree on that."
"Nor have the world's financial supervisory authorities been able to strengthen their cooperation and competence sufficiently."
"New instruments have been introduced; openness and transparency have been lacking."
"The starting point now should be the equal treatment of all financial market players; that is to say, the introduction of stricter capital requirements and regulation, including for hedge funds and private equity."
"On the matter of supervision, there has been discussion of the need for new authorities, in which regard many - I saw Gordon Brown only today - have been pressing for a common European, indeed even a global, system of financial supervision."
"In my opinion, the continuing differences between markets - as illustrated by developments in the United States - give cause for reflection."
"On the other hand, markets are connected globally."
"As our committee also said, the existing committees in Europe for cooperation in the financial, banking and insurance fields should be strengthened considerably."
"A great deal can be done in this regard - including at global level."
"Transparency and clearer supervision need to be achieved if we are to rebuild confidence in the financial market."
"I believe that there is a complete consensus on this, too."
"The market economy needs clear rules, including clear rules of play."
"As a Liberal, I have no difficulty at all in arguing in favour of clearer rules and more effective legislation."
"On the other hand, we must take care not to introduce laws and rules that do not solve current problems and do not take account of the importance of a global financial market."
"Global access to capital increases growth potential and creates new jobs - we should not forget this."
"Europe needs an open, effective financial market that also leaves scope for self-regulation and internal remedial measures."
"The challenge, therefore, is to avoid paralysing our systems by over-regulating, leaving us unable to handle either growth or new crises."
"This week there was panic among the financial community."
"We must not let such panic dictate our legislation - at least in this House."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place against a backdrop of widespread financial market crisis caused by the increasing 'financialisation' of the economy, unregulated speculation and the proliferation of financial instruments and products, the aim always being ever higher speculative gains."
"This is one more facet of the crisis of capitalism."
"It has been clear for some time that there was another financial bubble, and that one day it would burst, not only in the United States but in the European Union too."
"It is also a result of the neo-liberal policies that prompted investors to seek increasingly higher gains, that encouraged lack of transparency, and that created tax havens and allowed them to shelter and launder capital from the underground economy, from the profits of war, from people trafficking and from drugs."
"Now, the public funds that were not available for social policy, for combating poverty and social exclusion, and for preventing millions of people, including children, from dying of hunger and lack of basic health care, now, I repeat, public funds are being used to avoid bankruptcies and greater losses among financial groups."
"The profits and gains were in the private hands of just a small group of investors and obscenely well-paid administrators, but those who will suffer the consequences are always the same: workers who lose their jobs, the rank and file who have to pay more interest, including here in the European Union, particularly in countries with weaker economies."
"Take Portugal for example, where low wages and pitiful old-age and retirement pensions are the rule, and where poverty and unemployment rates are amongst the highest in the EU."
"Since households have one of the highest debt ratios, amounting to around 120% of GDP, and micro and small and medium-sized companies depend a great deal on credit, they are now experiencing ever greater difficulties due to the resulting increased interest rates, a particularly serious problem in Portugal and other countries with weaker economies."
"Some measures are therefore required in the immediate term, beginning with the abolition of tax havens and confidentiality, without which there can be no transparency."
"From what has been said here, however, by Commissioner McCreevy in particular, it seems that that will not be the way forward, and that is unacceptable."
"In this critical situation the European Central Bank's false independence must also be abandoned in order to ensure a change in monetary and financial policy objectives, and far-reaching measures must be taken to combat stock market speculation."
"The priority in public policy must be to support the creation of jobs with rights, production and poverty reduction, thereby raising the purchasing power of workers and pensioners and supporting quality public services."
"(SV) Madam President, at present the financial crisis is casting hedge funds and private equity in a frightening light - and other financial innovations such as structure investment vehicles, conduits and money market funds are being similarly affected."
"All of these have been conceived precisely for the purpose of sidestepping the capital adequacy and transparency requirements we impose on banks."
"There is much profit to be made from borrowing liquid assets short, investing in illiquid assets long and staking minimum own capital, but this is a dangerous activity."
"As we can see, both liquidity and solvency can soon vanish."
"That is the reason for the strict international banking rules."
"We are now seeing the collapse of the international non-banking system."
"Hedge funds and private equity are next."
"These have very little own capital; they are highly leveraged."
"Private equity involves enormous numbers of leveraged buyouts, LBOs, which have been carried out with virtually no own capital."
"This being the case, should we really be presenting feeble reform proposals such as these in this field at this historic juncture?"
"I for one do not think so."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now heard everything from the experts who produced the report - Mr Rasmussen, Mr Lehne, Mr Lauk, thank you very much."
"It was an excellent piece of work and met with great approval in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"In the past three years, Commissioner, we have constantly been asking for rules to be established, for questions to be raised, such as: how can we obtain greater transparency for hedge funds, who is advising the rating agencies, and so on."
"When the fences are high, the horses may well shy."
"Put simply, shying away from an obstacle that is no longer there!"
"We must now - and this you have indeed promised - lay down rules and make proposals."
"We have to show that we have learned something from all these crises and are striking new paths."
"You put forward this proposal ."
"I hope that in October we shall be receiving the guidelines from you."
"A few days ago I was at a large conference near Rome."
"The first item discussed there, of course, was that of the banks."
"On the Thursday the newspaper headlines read: Morgan Stanley offers hope."
"On Friday, they read: Morgan Stanley seeks protection."
"How can this happen in a single day?"
"There are deficiencies here in transparency and the like."
"If, after Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merril Lynch, this investment bank is also now sinking in the chaos of the financial markets, corrective action should be taken as a matter of urgency."
"A short time ago I was in China."
"The Chinese were saying: our role model, the United States, has collapsed."
"Together we - Europe, China and others - must seek out new paths."
"My hope is that together we shall have the strength to strike these new paths, then not only those who have won, but also those who have lost will be rescued with us."
"(FR) Madam President, I know that the Commissioner enjoys betting on horses so he will forgive me for using a sporting metaphor when I say that he is not exactly a favourite in today's event."
"Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, on the other hand, looks like a very good bet, so I think you might do well to consider changing colours, Commissioner."
"What Mr Rasmussen has just outlined and proposed to us is precisely what the European Union needs."
"It is right not only for the Union but for the rest of the world too - and the trans-Atlantic relationship that is so dear to your own heart would be enhanced by a European initiative on the basis of the Rasmussen proposals."
"You seem to have come to the wrong debate, Commissioner."
"You gave us a review of how the crisis started last year, but the issues we are discussing now are issues that had engaged our attention long before the crisis surfaced last August, for the rot had clearly set in at that stage and the financial world was ripe for a collapse."
"We are not fuddy-duddies seeking to condemn or to prohibit alternative funds or investment funds."
"We simply recognise that when certain financial vehicles or instruments are performing such strategic functions in the international markets and have acquired such a key position, then they must be subject to the general principle of regulation."
"The operators in question are, in fact, telling us this themselves."
"They are saying: 'Yes, OK, we can agree to regulation; we just do not want to be stigmatised and we do not want a special system of regulation.'"
"Well, fair enough!"
"We want them to be registered, we want them to be supervised, we want them to be paid in accordance with normal principles, and we want them to be subject to transparency rules and to the rules on capital adequacy."
"That is the reality."
"These structures now occupy such an important place on the financial markets that they cannot continue to be exempt from the general rules."
"Yet, this is the very point that you, Commissioner - a former Irish Minister for Finance - are refusing to concede."
"That is the reality!"
"You tell us that hedge funds and private equities 'are not the cause of the current turmoil' and that the blame lies with the regulated sector."
"I have no wish to deliver an economics lesson, but we know full well that the banks felt able to take the risks they took precisely because of the parallel existence of hedge funds and private equities, processing financial products that accelerated the rot in the banking sector."
"In relation to Mr Rasmussen's report, I should like to invite you to respond to it in practical terms, point by point, for it contains a number of legislative proposals that might improve your own end-of-term report when the current Commission steps down."
"I listened to what you told us and you spoke of a 'window of opportunity' for improving transparency."
"Well, we agree with you and we expect the Commission to use that opportunity."
"The key to confidence among ordinary people and among financial-market operators is transparency."
"It is obvious today that, in the areas of alternative funds and investment funds, there is no transparency. But transparency is what we need."
"It goes without saying that I support many of the proposals in Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's report but I should also like to take the argument a little further."
"If we really want to strike at the heart of the problem, we shall have to examine the concept that you have described as the 'shareholding democracy'."
"What is meant by a shareholding democracy if it is possible, in a matter of minutes or a matter of days, to put so many people's jobs in jeopardy?"
"There is a very real problem here, which you need to address and on which we expect effective proposals."
"Securities lending and borrowing jeopardises jobs in Europe and is at odds with the Lisbon Strategy."
"My final point is one that previous speakers have also raised, namely the problem posed by offshore centres."
"You, Commissioner, are an ardent defender of the trans-Atlantic alliance, so allow me to inform you that over on the other side of the Atlantic there are democrats who, like us, are ready to lobby for a full-scale assault on tax havens."
"What is the use of fighting heroically in Afghanistan or Iraq without attacking evil where it exists on the financial markets - and offshore centres are a source of evil for the finance industry."
"This is another subject on which we await your proposals, Commissioner."
"Madam President, such failure of financial markets has never happened until now."
"The main cause was the enormous increase in turnover, and the development of a new system of financial gain beyond the existing banking system without transparency, any effective evaluation or supervision."
"New investments and vehicles brought big profits, but also caused an increasing threat, even to the IMF."
"Although the proposal from Mr Rasmussen and his committee concerning transparency and supervision - particularly of the excessive debt leverage - are right and indispensable, we should also acknowledge as very dangerous the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs which demands simply that it be left solely to participants in the market to assess the appropriate level of risk to take."
"The committee overlooked the fact that last year the average securities firm was leveraged 27 to 1, with no regulation or supervision."
"What is more, they regulated themselves completely on their own, and even the big lenders ignored the extent of the risk they were taking."
"The cost of this failure will be extremely high."
"The cost to Americans, for example, has been terrible, at around USD 1 000 billion."
"It will have yet another additional effect: the actors on financial markets may not learn to be more cautious, because they will be accustomed to relying on help from taxpayers."
"We then have the choice of either protecting the almost full freedom of choice for financial actors in taking risks, or to impose distinct obligations and limitations insuring effectively against excessive shocks and guaranteeing a stabilising development of financial markets."
"The opinion of the Commissioner gives some hope for the future, but I am afraid that the tasks facing the Commission are extremely difficult and demand much more courage in finding new methods and new measures."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to say that both reports - the Rasmussen report and the Lehne report - as well as the social agenda with its 19 items that we debated last time, and the Council and Parliament resolutions on Georgia show what we are capable of when we are all pulling together, despite our different opinions."
"I am saying this, therefore, because I am glad that the socialist election campaign machine, the superficial populism and the mutual recriminations have been dispensed with and the business of democratic parliamentarianism, responsibility for taking the necessary action and a frank and realistic debate will hopefully win through tomorrow."
"Hence I am also saying this because the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Schulz, has tried repeatedly in plenary to drive a wedge between the groups on precisely these issues."
"Good/bad, left/right, state/market thinking does not equate with the reality of people's lives today, but emanates from an old electoral rhetoric based on class war, which I had hoped had been conquered in the EU, and today's debate has so far also thankfully shown this."
"Reason has triumphed and a realistic step forward can therefore be taken, a response given to the financial turbulence and people's questions answered."
"We have an enduring financial crisis."
"We therefore need action."
"We cannot ignore the agenda."
"We need more European Union, more transparency, more supervision, more European and global regulation."
"We need risk-based equity capital and we must ensure that we do what we admit to in these reports and that what we demand in both reports is implemented by all those involved."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Karras, if I have understood Morgan Stanley correctly in the last few days, they are less fearful of Mr Schulz's stranglehold than of hedge funds."
"If I have grasped one thing from the discussion of the last few days, Commissioner, it is that the American consensus in this company, which has made many mistakes in handling the property and financial crisis, is that we no longer want to allow individual gamblers to drive the entire financial system to the wall by exploiting its flexibility and lack of regulation."
"How much longer do we actually want to carry on waiting until not only the ailing institutions, but also the sound ones have the red light forced on them and then hedge funds and other funds bet on their decline in order to snap them up again later at cheaper prices?"
"This leeway must be dispensed with and for this reason I doubt that what you have done here will be sufficient."
"It is not the time merely to be commissioning further studies."
"It is not the time for further supervision of those involved."
"It is time for action!"
"Last week I looked at an enterprise in my constituency, a sound enterprise, an enterprise producing the new materials we need: the vacuum melting company in Hanau, near Frankfurt."
"For a very long time it was a sound enterprise, until it was taken over by an American investor."
"Debts from the takeover are affecting the workforce, they are affecting the enterprise."
"Since then the enterprise has been trying to pull out of the collective labour agreement and has been forced back into it by a bitter strike."
"Is this what we to happen all over Europe?"
"Do we really want the strength of the European economy to be based on this kind of conflict or can we regain some kind of understanding and fill the regulatory loopholes with European legislation?"
"This is what is on the agenda."
"In the last nine years in this House, Commissioner, I have not experienced a discussion on economic policy in which you have been asked to act so unanimously and by such common consent."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, six years ago we launched the global harmonisation of accounting rules and competitiveness in the European banking sector."
"The Union's cross-border financial integration has no equivalent in the world."
"Financial researchers have long been pointing out that the European Union is far from being sufficiently equipped with mechanisms for solving cross-border crises arising from the increasing interdependence of European banks and their links to the global financial markets."
"Although the European Central Bank has managed to maintain financial stability in the eurozone to date, the fragmented national regulatory bodies are not capable of implementing effective solutions to the cross-border banking crises we continue to experience."
"In other words, centralised control is crucial."
"However, rather than establishing an all-encompassing financial regulator, we should carefully define specific conditions for intervention by a pan-European financial regulator."
"State intervention in investments banks such as AIG also arouses fears that such a precedent will lead to banks behaving irresponsibly in the future."
"I am therefore convinced that we must introduce control mechanisms that will prevent the managers of investment and hedge funds from making ill-judged analyses of operational and systemic risks."
"For example, hedge funds and private equity should not be able to finance long-term investments through short-term loans without setting the minimum amount of their capital stock, according to the level of risk of their activities."
"The way mortgages have been financed not only in the US but also in the United Kingdom and Spain serve as a warning that the European financial markets are due some fundamental self-reflection, which will, I am afraid, be just that little bit too late."
"Even if the European Commission came up with concrete binding legislation tomorrow, it would be implemented not in calm conditions but in a stormy and possibly hysterical atmosphere."
"In any case, there is also the question of how acceptable the legislation would be to the Council."
"Madam President, let me start by saying that it is a rare event when a European institution is acting before and not after a problem occurs."
"And we are talking about a huge problem the real consequences of which will become visible in the months to come."
"Thanks to the efforts of the rapporteur, Paul Rasmussen, the issue of hedge funds and private equity regulation has moved from the periphery to the centre of attention of the financial experts and policymakers."
"It is the European Socialist Party that raised the need for better regulation of the activities of hedge funds and private equity."
"We did it because all European policies need long-term investment, which requires long-term financing."
"We did it because our main goal should be to secure sustainable growth and job creation, to ensure predictability and long-term planning for families and businesses."
"I urge all Members to support the report, which has been approved by a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"That will be a big step for Parliament since we are going to request from the Commission a number of legislative measures which are aimed at achieving transparency and financial stability."
"This is not an easy debate."
"It is true that this report foresees much less than we initially strived for."
"At the same time we are about to achieve more than seemed to be possible a few months ago."
"Recent times and developments on the financial markets prove that we are right."
"Now, Commissioner, we are not going to blame you if you decide to act preventively, and include in your legislative proposals more than the European Parliament will require from you."
"It is not a time for competition in regulation - since excessive regulation is not better than the lack of regulation - but it is high time to act, and you know it."
"(PL) Madam President, the events of recent years, or months, even, but also the efforts made by individual countries and regions, indicate the growing importance of transparency not only for individual companies, but also for the development of specific states' economies."
"One barrier to direct regulation of the activities of hedge funds is the global nature of this industry and the potential for a fund's offices to move to another state in order to avoid being subject to national regulations."
"This is the main reason why all international institutions dealing with hedge funds try to influence fund activities through their relations with entities that are subject to regulation, especially banks."
"The problems of transparency in the European Union are concentrated mainly on convergence and harmonisation of the law in Member States."
"The problem areas relating to transparency aspects may be summarised as follows: establishing unified standards for information disclosed by companies introducing their shares onto the stock market and company law and corporate governance in relation to the question of the collective responsibility of agencies for information contained in company reports, reinforcing the role of independent council members, standards in the area of setting up committees as part of councils, disclosure of information on council and board members' reimbursements, and also increasing investor protection."
"The introduction of unified regulations, creating better conditions within the European Union for hedge fund action and distribution, could have a positive impact on their development in Europe, but the introduction by individual countries of their own, individual regulations relating to these funds is not helping to create a unified, common European market."
"The establishment of common and transparent principles would considerably facilitate fund product distribution."
"In the opinion of the European Commission, which received a request to review the framework principles relating to non-harmonised products like hedge funds, with a view to creating a pan-European market, there are no significant arguments for the creation of EU regulations on hedge funds."
"Nothing could be more wrong!"
"I side with the rapporteur's call for the Commission to present a legislative conclusion on the transparency of hedge funds and private equity."
"Madam President, to begin with I would like to congratulate Poul Nyrup Rasmussen for his preparation of the report based on such profound analyses and excellent knowledge of the financial markets."
"Both types of alternative financial instruments that we are discussing have an increasing share of assets in the global market and participate in creating new jobs."
"However, the most important thing in the face of the financial crisis we have lately been observing with great anxiety and unsuccessfully trying to fight is to ensure financial stability."
"In my opinion, the most efficient way to increase not only financial stability, but also fair competition between participants in the market, is to enhance supervision and transparency at the appropriate levels without doing any harm to the model based on innovative market strategies."
"Some norms concerning the financial markets that have a direct and indirect application to hedge funds and private equity do exist above the national and European level."
"Nevertheless, we should strive for the coherent, non-discriminatory and consistent implementation and application of those juridical regulations."
"For this reason, I fully agree with the recommendations of the European Parliament, directed at the Commission, for increased activity and submission of the appropriate legislative proposals."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate rapporteur Rasmussen, and I believe that the recommendations contained in the annex to his report are particularly important."
"Hedge funds and private equity funds ensure the capital required in order to meet the demand for the funding of long-term investments and of innovative, often highly risky projects."
"Their operation, however, is less regulated than the banking system."
"The stability of financial markets requires appropriate transparency, and that specific measures must be taken in order to prevent excessive debt."
"Over the last 10 years, pension funds and insurance companies have provided one third of the amount collected by private equity funds."
"I believe that increased transparency is needed, particularly in the case of pension funds, for them to be able to accurately assess the degree of risk of various investments."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that hedge funds and private equity funds are based on a growth strategy designed for a term shorter than the duration of the investments which Europe needs."
"(ES) Madam President, the financial crisis has shown that the various financial operators are interlinked."
"Their conduct has weakened the financial markets and the real economy: growth and employment."
"Achieving open, competitive and reliable markets is not something that occurs by happy chance; this is shown by the experience in Europe."
"The fragility of the financial markets also requires political action at European and international level."
"It must remain clear that to innovate does not mean to imitate the old practice of privatising profit and socialising losses or that to diversify means to transfer the costs of decisions made by a few people to society as a whole."
"The European Union cannot just do nothing in the current crisis."
"The rapporteur, Mr Rasmussen, has taken the initiative and had the vision to propose that hedge funds and private equities, which hold assets amounting to over 4.5% of world GDP, are not free of responsibility towards society and must be subject to intelligent regulation and supervision."
"I congratulate him for this and support him, as I do Mr Lehne for his report on transparency."
"(EL) Mr President, with regard to the immense and tragically topical issue we are discussing, I should like to focus on a single question: is there a right and a left answer to the issue we are considering?"
"Is there a right and a left way out of the crisis?"
"Many would say, and indeed some of us today have said, that there is not - that everyone here must agree on such questions, which are technical and economic."
"Apart from the fact that those who say this are nearly always on the right, I want to say that the dividing lines here - and the reports show this - are very clear."
"What is the perspective of the left?"
"That the market cannot regulate everything on its own and regulation by state power is required - and regulation even means prohibitions."
"Why should we not think about what was said previously in the Katiforis report: that credit-rating agencies must only provide ratings and all other activities should be prohibited; that transparency is important, not for the markets, but for citizens?"
"Here we must think about the fact that pension funds must have special supervision."
"Lastly, that it is highly crucial that state intervention takes place not at the end, as is now happening in America, and the American people are paying for it, but at the necessary moment so that the crisis is avoided."
"(PT) Madam President, I agree wholeheartedly with what has been said here on the window of opportunity created by Poul Rasmussen's excellent report."
"I would say, however, that it would have been even more opportune if it had been politically possible to present it six years ago - and I think Poul agrees with me."
"Six years ago some of us tried to raise this issue of regulating hedge funds in the European Parliament, and the majority formed by the Liberals and the PPE systematically prevented the Socialist Group from incorporating it into various debates."
"We are now experiencing a crisis, a structural crisis as Mr Almunia puts it, a crisis that will end no-one knows where, and one that we cannot turn a blind eye to."
"We cannot take the position that Commissioner McCreevy has taken, we must - and I want to believe that the Commission is prepared to do this, bearing Mr Almunia's comments in mind - we must be proactive and must abandon the financial governance model that has regulated the European and global economy in recent years."
"This is what Poul suggests in his report, and this is what the Commission has the duty - I repeat, the duty - to examine and follow closely."
"(NL) Madam President, people are worried about what will become of their savings, but this seems to be of little concern to the Commissioner."
"Workers have been urged to take out non-statutory pensions, which were supposedly safer and more efficient than state pensions; their money is now in these pension funds, but they no longer have any certainty."
"Current events are a setback for those who believe in unbridled free-market forces."
"The Commissioner himself is one such believer in the free market."
"As far as can be anticipated, there should not be too much regulation, he said last year in this House, and he is still saying it today."
"Well, it is never too late for him to change his mind."
"After all, in his opinion, what further action is needed in the way of prevention?"
"The consequences of failing to act in good time will be felt for many years."
"Prevention is better than cure."
"Madam President, the new demon, I think the Commissioner will agree, seems to be short-selling."
"I would ask the Commission to arrange a study which compares in the case of HBOS the incidence of short-selling against sales by long-only investors - pension funds, insurance companies, private investors and their fund managers - and the plain withdrawal of deposits by frightened banking clients and other banks."
"I suggest we should have some facts before rushing to a conclusion, and yet another possibly mistaken conclusion."
"In his report, to which incidentally our group has made a lot of contributions, Mr Rasmussen used HBOS and Northern Rock in his speech as reasons for more regulation, but HBOS and Northern Rock were banks, not hedge funds and private equity, and subject to the full rigour of the existing regulatory system for banks, including statutory capital requirements."
"Is it not ironic that the crisis has occurred and spread in the supposedly most highly regulated part of the financial industry?"
"Beware Sarbanes-Oxley!"
"(RO) Sometimes we, politicians especially, are trapped in a dogmatism that leads to catastrophic consequences."
"A few years ago, the supporters of liberalism, and in particular those of neo-liberalism, would have thought it impossible that something like the recent events in Washington could have occurred."
"They would have rejected it on the basis of their doctrine, and yet it still happened."
"Today, in the context of globalisation, consequences are quick to arise and they affect every country and every economy."
"What the Rasmussen report says is that the EU must take action and I am convinced that, as a result of the vote of the European Parliament, the European Commission will be called upon to rise to this challenge that affects not only the life of a few, but the life of the population of the entire European Union- and will do so."
"Madam President, some time ago we had a hot debate about investment banks."
"Now investment banks have gone from the market, and we are feeling good with the current rules for the banking sector."
"The same issue is relevant to hedge funds."
"Hedge funds, in the current environment, are not sustainable any more, and I do think that we just need the same rules for all investment funds rather than specific rules for hedge funds."
"With these rules, Mr Rasmussen, we are actually hindering restructuring of the financial sector, and the losses will mount."
"That means that, in the end, you will not be able to protect the ordinary people you want to protect."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, one of the latter speakers, in furtherance of his argument, made the point - but I am sure he did not mean me to use it against him - when he said, people should not be blinded by their own dogmatism."
"The danger in this particular debate is to try and get a balanced solution to the problems that we now have."
"In the main, the report, which has been amended considerably from the initial ideas put forward by Mr Rasmussen, makes a genuine attempt, in my view, to have a balanced approach to this whole area."
"But many of the contributors to the debate here in this House want to have an unbalanced approach to it, and that is not reflective of what was in the report."
"Some - many of the speakers from one side of the argument, in particular - see the current financial turmoil and the difficulties which there undoubtedly are as the great opportunity to regulate everything out of existence, and the great danger is going to be, both nationally and in Europe in particular, that a very unbalanced approach is going to be taken to this."
"I think Mr Purvis put his finger on the pulse when he made reference to the fact that the supreme irony of this particular financial crisis has been that it was the most heavily regulated sector, namely banks, that got themselves and the rest of us into considerable difficulty, and that it was not the activities of private equity or hedge funds that caused any of these problems at all."
"In fact many of them suffered considerable losses as a result of the things that happened in other areas."
"I certainly will take on board what Mr Purvis said about looking at what the incidence of short selling contributed to the demise of some of these institutions as against what long-term disposals by long-term investors have contributed to it."
"I suspect that Mr Purvis knows the answer nearly as well as I do, which is that, in those two particulars which he has referred to, it will not be short sellers that will be deemed to be the problem in this area: it was long-term investors, rightly getting rid of long-term positions, because they felt that a particular institution was not on a sound financial footing."
"But, be that as it may, I think the Rasmussen and the Leinen reports as they have come before us are a genuine attempt to look at all of these particular areas in a balanced way."
"And I am prepared to do that."
"For a number of months - for nearly a year now - I have signalled that I am going to do something in the area of credit-rating agencies."
"As far back as last November/December, I started the process by writing to CESR, posing them a number of questions, finally getting reports from them this year, and ESME and other bodies, as well."
"And having received all of that, I will be putting forward a proposal before Parliament and the Council in the next couple of months."
"Credit-rating agencies are referred to in this particular in the Rasmussen report."
"I also have been making efforts for well over a year to try and get some semblance of order into the idea of colleges of supervisors or a better regulatory system for cross-border financial institutions."
"Anyone that has been following this particular debate is very much aware that there has not been universal agreement or anything near it among the Member States."
"The proposal which is currently before the ECON Committee under the rapporteurship of Peter Skinner, namely the Solvency II Directive, and the ideas I put forward there about cross-border supervision of insurance companies and the considerable advancement there as to supervision, has run into considerable opposition from a large number of Member States and from a large number of parliamentarians in this House who are affecting the views of the supervisors and in their own Member States."
"And, even though the call in the main in this House is for better cross-border supervision, when a test is put in front of them as to what I should do about it to have a more coherent approach to cross-border supervision, they go back and represent their national positions."
"So let us have a little bit of honesty in all of this particular debate and in all of these debates."
"In the area of the Capital Requirements Directive, as people who follow this in the ECON Committee will know, since the time we put through the Capital Requirements Directive, left over from that were a number of areas which we said we would deal with in an amended Capital Requirements Directive in the autumn of 2008."
"This is well over a year, 18 months ago."
"Then we have added on to that, in particular, other areas, such as the cross-border supervision of financial groups, about which we finally got some type of conclusions from the ECOFIN Council some months ago, and I have signalled what I am intending to do in the question of the 'originate and distribute' model."
"It goes a long way towards what I signalled were my intentions some months ago - what I want to do - and I put forward some propositions; it is reflected in Mr Rasmussen's report, which is more or less in the same idea as myself in this particular regard."
"But I will tell you this before it comes before the relevant committee: the Members of Parliament - if form is anything to go by in the past - will be representing the position of a lot of their own Member States, which is very much anti what I have put forward there."
"So the proof of the pudding is going to be in the eating."
"There is no point in supporting Mr Rasmussen's report in this particular area and then, on the other hand, when the specific questions come before Parliament in the form of a proposition - which I am putting forward also in the next couple of months and which many months ago I signalled I was going to do - if Members of Parliament then take their own national positions, representing the views of some of the banking firms in their own country and some of the views of the governments of the Member States, then this will not necessarily be a very good idea."
"Again I appeal for some type of rational approach, and at least some coherence."
"I very much respect the opinions of people who are consistent in all of this: people who say, 'I do not think that is a particularly good idea', and follow it through by saying it here in Parliament and when they go before the committee and stick with that position."
"But where I do have difficulty is with people who in the main go along with some advancement in some of the areas which are referred to and then, when it gets down to a specific proposal, go back and more or less represent the views of their own Member State's position or of institutions in their own Member State."
"But this particular city is probably the headquarters of the world lobbying industry."
"I have heard different figures over the years as to whether there are more lobbyists here than there are on Capitol Hill in Washington, but there is not much between them in any event."
"So I will be interested, when some of the ideas which I am bringing forward, which I have signalled for some time and which are now in the public domain (there has been consultation about it, the papers have been out and everybody knows some of these propositions in the areas which have been referred to) - when, in the next very short while, these propositions come before Members of the European Parliament - whether all the Members who spoke so heavily for some changes in the wider area, when it comes down to specifics, will follow through and support what is here."
"We have taken good note of the points identified in both the Rasmussen and Leinen reports."
"As I promised in my earlier remarks, we will respond to this in more detail in the context, as provided for in the framework agreement."
"Mr Rasmussen asked me if that would be before the end of this year - I think a couple of months ago he said that, hopefully, by the end of the year we would be able to respond - and I promised him we would be able to respond."
"But in response to the gentlemen who spoke about how everyone should not be blinded by their own dogmatism, I think he might be referring to the other side of the argument."
"I ask people on that side of the House not to be blinded by their own dogmatism either."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues, and also the Commissioner, for the debate."
"Just before I round off the debate as far as I am concerned on the report, I want to say to Mr Purvis, my colleague, that it is true that banks are regulated, but the products that were the cause of all this trouble we are having now are not regulated, and it was not regulated that we could put as much aside of the balance sheet as we actually did."
"So, Mr Purvis, the answer is that we need better regulation and we need regulation for the products as well."
"I would say to Mrs StarkeviÄiÅ«tÄ, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, that I am not talking about regulating the entity but about regulating the behaviour."
"We know that in real life hedge funds and private equity often change their legal constructions, and there are a lot of examples of that - investment banks themselves have executed private equity activities."
"So it is behaviour we have to change, and this is at the heart of this report."
"I would say to Commissioner McCreevy that there is one fundamental thing - which has nothing to do with dogmatism or whatever - that I want to underline to you, and that is that the first paragraph in our report underlines the following: that the regulation has to cover all financial actors."
"It is the fundamental intention of this report, for the first time in the European Union's legislative history, that what we want is a common total regulation based on the philosophy of a level playing field, leaving no one outside, but which has a unique regulation covering all financial actors."
"The report explicitly adds: 'including hedge funds and private equity'."
"Then you tell me, Commissioner McCreevy, and the rest of the European Parliament: yes, I agree with you, but not on hedge funds or private equity."
"What are we talking about here?"
"For three years we have been discussing with you whether private equity or hedge funds should be covered or not covered by regulation."
"Before the financial crisis you said this was not necessary: they are better than any government to regulate, so let them do their job."
"Now you say that they do not have a share in the financial crisis, so we will not intervene in regulating the hedge funds and private equity."
"Mr Commissioner, you talked about lobbyism here in the European Parliament."
"I can confirm to you that many hedge funds, lobbying organisations and private equity organisations are here every day, every night, every time."
"But I think this House must now insist that the Commission - and that is you - come up, before the end of the year, with a total regulation; this is the first paragraph covering all financial actors."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, so great is the transparency of funds that the well-endowed rating agencies, the even better-endowed boards of banks and the more meagrely endowed regulatory authorities no longer knew what was going on."
"That is how transparent things are!"
"The fact that we need to act here is self-evident and needs no further justification."
"Commissioner, you addressed the question of the position with regard to short sellers."
"It is not a matter of whether the short sellers themselves lose out at the end of the day."
"The point is what they set in motion and what damage it might have caused."
"It is really about the effects of their actions on others."
"That, indeed, is precisely why the regulators in numerous countries have reacted."
"As various Members have said, it is about ordinary people, about pensioners and taxpayers."
"I must re-emphasise that we are nationalising losses, and that cannot be right."
"My report, like Mr Rasmussen's report, contains a large number of very specific proposals."
"In my case, they mainly relate to issues of company law."
"It is relatively easy to draw up and implement proposals on these issues."
"In essence, the only thing that need be done is to supplement the existing rules."
"Nor is it in any sense a matter of discriminating against some hedge funds or other."
"At the present time, we have a situation in Europe - and no one disputes this - in which these alternative financial instruments are regulated by national law but are regulated in very different ways in some instances."
"It makes perfect sense to incorporate them all into a European financial market and regulate them uniformly."
"To call for more specialists' reports now, when we have already been discussing the matter, as Mr Rasmussen said, for three years, when we in this House already have specialists' studies, when the Commission has been dealing with the matter and we have held hearings about it, is, I believe, pointless and would only waste time."
"There is truly a need to take real practical measures."
"The situation demands action."
"Let me make one more remark, which relates to government funds."
"I entirely agree with you."
"We need government funds, and in the long term we shall also need government funds from other countries, from countries outside the EU, because otherwise it will probably become impossible in the long run to fund infrastructure expenditure in Europe."
"That is a matter in which you surely have the support of the Committee on Legal Affairs too, although it is not directly connected with the subject we are discussing today."
"We have always backed initiatives that the Commission has taken in this domain, and we shall continue to do so."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) The fact that the lack of transparency concerning hedge funds and private equity funds has led to a flare-up of the current economic crisis is not up for debate."
"It is one of the elements which have led, among other things, to the current impossibility of an accurate evaluation of the debt and loan balance of many financial institutions."
"For years on end these financial institutions have wrecked economies and carried out aggressive take-overs, ignoring not only medium and long-term economic consequences, but also the social consequences of their activity."
"Lured only by the prospect of short-term profit, they orchestrated the breakdown and sale of entire companies, disrupting national economies and toying with monetary markets, in total disregard for transparency and rules."
"It is clear that these funds must be regulated and that an appropriate level of transparency must be put in place."
"This is necessary not only for the stability, health and proper functioning of financial markets, but also in order to decrease the risk threatening those financial markets which are in an early stage, in developing countries, and therefore lack stability."
"This crisis has proven how dangerous the consequences of laissez-faire are, and how important it is to ensure the future transparency of financial activities."
"in writing. - (RO) I commend the rapporteur for his tenacity in pursuing a topic against stiff opposition from various vested interests."
"The deepening financial crisis has structural causes which are linked to a huge overexpansion of financial transactions during the past decade, which have been based on a flawed securitisation process, reckless risk-taking, a breakdown of due diligence and lack of understanding of systemic risks."
"The problem with hedge funds, in particular, is that they contribute to increasing systemic risks."
"The claim that it is the money of investors which is at stake is only a very small part of the whole story."
"Very high leveraging and focus on short-term gains increase overshooting."
"But, even worse, the speculative nature of such operations produces instability and can damage financial stability, as has been clearly indicated by the current crisis."
"It makes sense to bring the activity of hedge funds (and equity private funds) within the territory of regulated financial entities."
"Leveraging should not be unconstrained."
"Likewise, hedge funds should provide the regulatory and supervisory authorities with full information on their transactions."
"Citizens' petitions during the year 2007 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by David Hammerstein, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2007."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to thank all members of the Committee on Petitions, especially all the shadow rapporteurs and our Chairman, Marcin Libicki, for their cooperation and daily work on petitions."
"More than ever, we need petitions from citizens to bring Europe closer to the street and day-to-day problems."
"More than ever we need petitions from citizens to ensure that Community law is complied with and implemented."
"We need petitions from citizens so that we can provide tangible proof of what Europe is for, to prove that Europe is not an opaque institution but something that affects everyone's daily lives and that we are able to hold a dialogue with thousands of citizens."
"We are succeeding."
"In 2007 the Petitions Committee had 50% more cases than in 2006."
"That success is a reflection of our work; it is a success which blazes the trail for the European institutions in general."
"My country, Spain, is the country with the highest number of petitions studied at the Petitions Committee."
"One third of petitions on the environment of the European Union are from Spain."
"This is a reflection of the confidence in European institutions which exists in Spain, and a reflection of the work we have done in Spain."
"But there is an increasing number of cases from new Member States of the European Union such as Romania or Poland."
"However, the success of the Petitions Committee, the success in the number of petitions, is also causing a number of administrative and political problems."
"The Committee lacks resources."
"The number of cases is continually growing yet the same number of people are working at the Secretariat and the same number of people are working at the European Commission to process the petitions."
"The institutions need to respond sensitively to citizens' concerns; we need sufficient resources to be able to deal with the petitions quickly and appropriately."
"Sometimes petitions procedures drag on for years and years; if petitions are not processed they lose their validity and the European Institutions completely lose their capacity to intervene."
"Sometimes there is a lack of high-calibre legal and administrative care in the way petitions are handled by the European Commission."
"Yes, there are petitions which irritate the powerful."
"Yes, there are petitions which irritate the authorities."
"Yes, there are petitions which are inconvenient because they bring hundreds or thousands of people to the European Parliament."
"Yet this is how Europe will be strengthened."
"Last year we made six fact-finding visits to Germany, Spain, Ireland, Poland, France and Cyprus, each of which resulted in a report."
"We placed particular importance on petitions which reflect citizens' concerns about the environment and its protection, and petitions relating to directives on water, property rights and minority rights."
"In many ways we have improved cooperation with the Commission, the Ombudsman and institutions such as SOLVIT to speed up responses to petitions."
"Petitions often require mediation outside the courts, not a solution which simply consists in bringing the matter before the European courts."
"One of the most important cases in recent years, in 2007 and previously, was the petition on the Via Baltica, a roadway which goes through an area protected under Community law; the European Commission and the Court of Justice have already acted in an exemplary manner to prevent irreparable damage to the environment."
"Other very important cases (and at this point I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy, who is here today) were the Valencia urban development law, where Mr McCreevy and his team acted effectively to defend the Public Procurement Directive."
"Other cases were Equitable Life, the Loiret in France, protection of water quality in France and the delicate issue of custody of children in Germany."
"We currently have a number of petitions such as the petition for a single seat for the European Parliament, which has been signed by one and a half million citizens: we demand the right to process that petition, a right which has not been granted by the Bureau of Parliament."
"Finally, we make some proposals, including a change of name to the Petitions Committee, which would become the 'Committee on Citizens' Petitions' so as to clarify the essential function and role of European citizens within the Committee."
"To the same end we ask that Parliament be opened up in all ways on the Internet and request interoperability of Parliament's web systems; the web systems currently close the door to thousands or millions of Europeans who do not have the type of software needed to access the web, where my speech here in Parliament is being broadcast right now."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am taking part in this debate on behalf of my colleague Margot WallstrÃ¶m."
"The work of the Committee on Petitions is a fascinating source of insight into the concerns and grievances of citizens concerning European affairs."
"They cover a wide range of policy areas, although land-use planning and environmental issues crop up very often; they cover practically all Member States, and they cover a broad cross-section of civil society, from the individual citizen right up to the multi-national non-governmental organisation."
"Your rapporteur is right, I believe, to underline the importance of all the work represented by the thousand or more petitions you receive each year."
"There are two aspects of the report and resolution which I would like to pick up."
"The first is the recent development of on-the-spot visits of the committee to the sites of grievances, and which can have a considerable impact in the media, and will no doubt raise the visibility of your work."
"These missions, besides the press and media coverage, also give rise to very informative reports and would seem to me to be of a high quality."
"I think that these are important records of your activity and that they deserve wide publicity."
"It is a big investment of your time and resources, but I am sure that it is one that pays off."
"The second of the points I wish to raise is turned more to the future."
"I wish to reassure you once again of our intentions for the best possible collaboration between the Commission and Parliament."
"This collaboration is mutually reinforcing; the habit of collaboration instils a better exchange of information, and, as an outcome, a better all-round standard of service for our citizens."
"The recent increase in the workload in the petitions routine, described in the report, makes the need for an efficient and effective interinstitutional collaboration all the more important."
"I would like you to know that we will do our best to make it work."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Hammerstein, on the report he has drafted and the work he has done on it."
"The last Eurobarometer opinion poll at EU level shows that the European Parliament is the institution most trusted by European citizens."
"In fact, 52% of Europeans trust the European Parliament, which is more than the percentage who trust the European Commission (47%), more than the percentage who trust their national parliament (trusted by only 34%), and also more than the percentage who trust their national government (trusted by only 32% of EU citizens)."
"I feel that we should increase this trust that is placed in the European Parliament."
"The fact remains that the European Parliament is the institution most trusted by EU citizens."
"I think that this results from the fact that the Members of this Parliament are directly elected by the people; it also results from the fact that the Treaty recognises the citizen's right to make a complaint, to present a petition to this Parliament for its consideration."
"This is in fact the work that is performed by the Committee on Petitions, which is therefore a very important committee because it gives voice to the people and is therefore the committee, among the 20 committees in this Parliament, that is close to the people."
"What can we do to improve this situation?"
"I think that we should increase awareness of this committee and of the possibility for citizens to petition."
"Here I disagree with the rapporteur that there is sufficient awareness; I think that 1 500 petitions are too little when you consider that we represent a continent of half a billion people."
"Moreover, we have to increase awareness and the possibility for citizens to complain, to petition."
"We need more simplification so that it is easier for citizens to make a complaint."
"That is why we are asking in this report that the Secretary-General of the European Parliament negotiate with the European Commission to simplify the petition."
"We also want more efficiency, because we feel that there is too much of a delay in the consideration of complaints."
"To say the least, we take three months to register people's petitions or complaints; this delay is unacceptable."
"Lastly, we want a more effective remedy."
"We want there to be more cooperation before the start of legal proceedings and we want national representatives to be present too when our citizens' complaints are heard. Thank you very much."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done and for his concrete proposals."
"The text we have today reflects the need for his report to be more than a simple enumeration of the main activities carried out by the Committee on Petitions on 2007."
"I am glad to see that the points we insisted on are in the report."
"Petitions are about bringing to light the wrong or non-application of Community legislation."
"Petitions are about guaranteeing the rights that the European Union confers on its citizens."
"However, I cannot avoid sharing with you the feeling that this unique institutional instrument is not always effective, or at least not as much as it could be or it should be."
"As rapporteur, Mr Hammerstein has rightly underlined some shortcomings and deficiencies which exist, and these must be addressed."
"Firstly, it is hardly disputable that the number of petitions coming before the committee is constantly increasing."
"Petitioners sometimes face substantial delays before receiving a response or seeing the effects of proceedings."
"The instruments for exerting pressure on Member States are not always satisfactory."
"I am wondering what we can do to be more efficient."
"How can we ensure both effectiveness and a prompt response?"
"We need better rules and more stringent time-frames."
"We need to enhance the committee's own independent investigatory facilities, and for this we need more resources and legal expertise for its secretariat."
"The number of petitioners is increasing steadily."
"This is the voice of the European people and we cannot afford to ignore it."
"Secondly, the institutionalised channels of communication with national authorities are insufficient."
"The number of inadmissible petitions is significant."
"We need to establish additional coordination structures with the relevant authorities at a national parliamentary and government level."
"I again congratulate the rapporteur on his work, and thank him and the colleagues from the other groups for their valuable cooperation."
"Petitions are about citizens fighting for their rights, their European rights."
"We must be here, ready to defend them."
"That is the committee's institutional role and duty."
"That is what we owe our fellow European citizens, and I am sure you will agree that there could be no better time to show our commitment to meeting their expectations."
"Commissioner, this Committee is not just about visibility and making itself more effective in the eyes of the European media."
"I wish to refer here - even if this is not about the 2007 report - to the very successful way in which the Committee on Petitions and the European Commissioner, LÃ¡szlÃ³ KovÃ¡cs, have been working together to defend the rights of European citizens in my country of origin, Romania, and I wish to thank him."
"Thank you very much."
"I am sorry, but we have run out of time."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all I want to say well done to the rapporteur, Mr Hammerstein, on his very comprehensive and wide-ranging report."
"I was very interested to read in the report that, while other committees have a heavy responsibility of legislative activity, the Committee on Petitions has shown that its role and function are also essential."
"Indeed, I fully agree with that sentiment and I become more convinced of it with every committee meeting I attend."
"Our primary role in this Parliament is that of legislators, but, in order to be good legislators, we need to be aware of the impact of our legislation so that we can improve our efforts in Parliament."
"In my opinion, any legislation emanating from this House should improve the quality of life of citizens in some way, and in the Committee on Petitions we see that this is not always the case."
"This often happens because of the non-implementation of legislation, or inadequate implementation, or because of specific circumstances or situations that the legislation does not address."
"I think that is a salutary lesson to all of us and we need to hear and respond."
"For me, however, the core of this report is about how the committee responds to citizens, and I have said before that in order to respond effectively, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of the petitioners."
"They are approaching a large institution; they often have no legal or political background; they are put off by bureaucracy and are probably very frustrated at the situation in which they find themselves."
"For many petitioners, we are the last port of call and it is crucial that we respond effectively and efficiently."
"This in my opinion starts with clear, understandable information for citizens."
"And we as MEPs are not always the best people to judge."
"Panels of citizens, I believe, should road-test any information we supply, any websites we design, any booklets we print."
"We need to be very careful that we do not promise more than we can deliver, otherwise citizens will be totally frustrated and end up blaming Brussels bureaucracy."
"When I use the word 'promise', what I mean is this: We must understand that citizens do not know about national authorities stonewalling, they do not know how the system works and we have a duty to them to tell them how it is."
"Certainly, we can and should try to influence change and this report is certainly doing that, but we cannot allow citizens to get caught as the meat in the sandwich."
"Once citizens have good, accurate information and once they are aware of the possibilities for action, then we can provide the service they need."
"This report outlines in detail what is needed: sufficient resources so that the secretariat can respond in a timely way; greater involvement by the Council and Member States and maximum coordination with the Ombudsman and SOLVIT."
"But, above and beyond that, this report also clearly indicates that systemic weaknesses need to be further investigated."
"This happens where petitioners cannot obtain rightful compensation and where Member States delay to avoid compliance until fines are imminent and still avoid responsibility for past intentional violations."
"We as legislators, in conjunction with the Commission, surely have a responsibility to act in those situations."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, David Hammerstein."
"I am very pleased that Mr Hammerstein prepared this report, since he is one of the most committed and outstanding members of the Committee on Petitions."
"He is someone that I have enormously enjoyed working with over the past four years."
"I would also like to thank all the other members of the Committee on Petitions, as well as those who have already spoken and also those who are about to speak on this matter, and also the secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, which is doing great work."
"As can be seen from the report presented to us by Mr Hammerstein, the number of petitions has grown enormously."
"This is the work that has been weighing on the secretariat."
"The Committee on Petitions is a very special committee because, as has been mentioned before, it does not work on legislation in the same way as other committees; instead it works primarily to create communication between European institutions, especially the European Parliament, and our citizens."
"As Mr Busuttil reminded us, the European Parliament enjoys an enormous amount of trust and this trust results from, among other reasons, the work of our Committee."
"These 1 500 petitions do not just represent 1 500 people."
"Behind these petitions there are often hundreds of thousands of people."
"I would remind you that with regard to the issue of a single seat for Parliament, there were over a million signatures."
"With regard to the issue of references to God and Christianity in the constitution, there were over a million."
"For the COPE radio in Barcelona, there were 700 000."
"Tens of thousands of signatures on the petitions concerning area management plans in Spain, concerning Equitable Life and Lloyds."
"Millions of EU citizens know that the Committee on Petitions is part of the European Parliament and they know that, very often, this is their final possibility of redress."
"Unfortunately, I do not have the time to speak any more on this subject."
"Once again I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the good work of the Committee on Petitions."
"I would also like to say that the Conference of Presidents of the Political Groups rejected the report from the European Ombudsman concerning improper administration in the European Anti-Fraud Office."
"That is a great shame!"
"The Leaders' Conference also rejected a report concerning discrimination against children from broken families in Europe, which we called the Jugendamt, the Jugendamt report."
"It was about discrimination against children from broken families where one spouse is German and the other of another nationality."
"I am very sorry that the Conference of Leaders did not help European Union citizens to get help from the European Parliament."
"Mr President, please treat this as a small token of appreciation for your excellent work."
"We shall now continue the debate."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I speak here as a non-member of the committee."
"Petitions give a direct voice to the people of Europe; at a time of growing Euro-scepticism in many of the Member States, I consider that very apt and very important."
"The petitions themselves are taken seriously and acknowledged."
"This is reflected in an increase in the number of petitions."
"We therefore consider it crucial that all the matters addressed in these petitions be followed up appropriately so that public confidence in the institution of the European Parliament can be maintained."
"We must keep a watchful eye on this."
"Let me cite three examples."
"Firstly, the petition on a single seat for the European Parliament was signed by huge numbers of people."
"But there seems to be resistance to the idea of holding a genuine debate here and providing a clear answer."
"The public, however, deserve an answer, and we must give them one."
"My second example is the Via Baltica expressway project with all its attendant environmental problems."
"An appropriate response was made in this case, which the petitioners have duly acknowledged."
"My third example is a reminder that petitions sometimes relate to aims that the European Union proclaims but does not subsequently pursue, as in the case of the Open Parliament initiative."
"The thrust of this petition is that people should not be required to buy one particular computer program so that they can watch the material transmitted from the European Parliament and respond in the only permissible format."
"Open Parliament means open standards."
"We have an obligation here, and we must act on it."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I consider the Committee on Petitions the most important in this House."
"It is a forum in which the citizens tell us how the many laws that we deal with in other committees affect them or do not affect them."
"Without this feedback we are doomed to work in a vacuum."
"But, in terms of its work of standing up for Europe's citizens, there is something missing in the procedure, and that is the presence of the Council and the Permanent Representatives of the Member States."
"How can we mediate for citizens in a dispute with their country without the country attending the Committee on Petitions?"
"The people of Ireland came to the Committee on Petitions with three petitions in connection with our most valued and sensitive archaeological site: Tara, the Home of the High Kings and of St Patrick."
"The Committee on Petitions responded enthusiastically and called for the destruction of this site to stop, and urged the Commission to pursue its case against the Irish authorities, and yet nothing has changed."
"The destruction is nearly complete."
"There will soon be a toll gate where the Home of the High Kings once stood."
"The Irish people will, understandably, not get over their disillusionment."
"(NL) Mr President, it was with mixed feelings that I read the 2007 report of the Committee on Petitions."
"Positive feelings in the first instance, because it goes without saying that our citizens are entitled to see all legislation properly applied."
"Naturally I have no problem with people turning to any organisation, including of course the European Parliament, in order to get those laws implemented if a national or local authority refuses to do so."
"The 2007 report is full of examples of cases where the Committee on Petitions was quite right to take action."
"But my feelings were mixed, because on the other hand I am particularly wary of and alarmed by the growing encroachment of European law, by more and more European meddling and interfering in things which to my mind are unquestionably matters for subsidiarity and would really be better left to Member States."
"In my own region of Flanders, for example, we have increasingly seen Europe meddling in matters of major concern to us."
"I am thinking especially of the defence of our Dutch language, of our culture and identity in our capital city of Brussels and in the area of Flanders around Brussels, the Vlaamse Rand."
"On issues like these we find Eurocrats who know very little about it all preaching to us in very general terms and telling us what to do."
"That makes us particularly angry, and it is unacceptable."
"I also see that this report repeatedly refers to the procedures set out in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"And I must stress once again that following the 'no' vote in Ireland, this Lisbon Treaty is politically and legally a dead duck."
"We of the Committee on Petitions, perhaps more than any other members of this House, must show respect for the legal realities and the democratically expressed voice of the people, in this case the people of Ireland, who have consigned the Lisbon Treaty to the dustbin of history."
"(EL) Mr President, our fellow Member Mr Hammerstein always bears in mind matters that are of concern to citizens, and I have had occasion to see this for myself when taking part in delegations to the Committee on Petitions."
"He also shows great sensitivity in the way he wishes to present the work of the Committee on Petitions in a report."
"I daresay this is a ground-breaking report because it is not the same one we present every year; it tries to highlight certain cases that the committee has attended to."
"The aim of the endeavour is certainly to improve the effectiveness of the Committee on Petitions in order to meet European citizens' expectations."
"The endeavour aims to ensure that citizens have confidence in the way their cases are handled and that there is a distinction between the right to submit petitions to the European Parliament and the submission of complaints to the European Commission and other bodies."
"It is very important that citizens understand the differences between procedures."
"We are not aiming for more petitions."
"We are aiming for petitions that have substance and are apolitical."
"We therefore want a secretariat with integrity, one that will not get involved in political disputes or decide the petitions procedure on the basis of political developments in the country."
"Similarly, in the case of court decisions, we do not want the Committee on Petitions to get involved in legal developments, and we want it to respect the decisions of the European Court of Justice."
"We have not seen any benefits from the increase in the number of committee members from 25 to 40."
"Look at the results of the votes."
"How many members vote?"
"Never as many as the 25 who first made up the Committee on Petitions."
"Extrajudicial proceedings provide a valuable channel for citizens, and fortunately we have SOLVIT for cases concerning the internal market, a resource that citizens should make use of."
"Above all, everything should be conducted in a transparent, independent manner, so that we are equal to our task."
"(PL) Mr President, in 2007 the European Parliament received over 1 500 petitions, which is 50% more than the previous year."
"This shows unequivocally that there is an increased awareness among our inhabitants that they can pursue their rights on a European level."
"Over 500 petitions were discussed during meetings of the Committee on Petitions, 159 of these in the presence of the petitioners."
"In addition, in 2007 as many as 6 fact-finding visits were organised to Germany, Spain, Ireland, Poland, France and Cyprus, as a result of which recommendations were prepared for all interested parties."
"The concerns of EU citizens as contained in their petitions focus largely on issues such as: the environment and how to protect it, property rights, the right of free movement and employment rights, recognition of professional qualifications and discrimination."
"The process of submitting a petition can have a positive impact on the process of good law-making, especially through the identification of areas, highlighted by petitioners, where European Union law is still weak or ineffective."
"For this reason the competent legislative committees should pay particular attention to the problems described in the petitions when preparing and negotiating new or updated legislation."
"Taking into account the fact that Member States do not always display the political will to find practical solutions to the problems described in petitions, the Committee on Petitions should move in the direction of increasing the effectiveness of its work in order to serve its citizens better and to fulfil their expectations."
"Better inter-institutional coordination should accelerate the process of considering complaints, as also the system of passing on petitions considered as inadmissible to the competent national authorities."
"The fact that activities of the Committee on Petitions are effective gives inhabitants a clear signal that their justified concerns are being investigated effectively, which creates a real link between citizens and the European Union."
"(ES) Mr President, this is another report on the standard function and operation of the Committee on Petitions, and the truth is that we must acknowledge that from one report to the next the Petitions Committee and the European Ombudsman continue to be excellent tools that European citizens can use to flag up and request solutions to misapplications of European law."
"Therefore it is crucial that our proposals continue to keep European citizens in the leading role, even though sometimes on occasion things have perhaps not gone as smoothly as they should."
"Sometimes, especially recently, and here I must confess that I am as guilty as anyone, the leading role of MEPs and their political debates, even at national or local level, is too influential in procedures where national remedies have not run their course, and may give citizens false hopes that the European Union can resolve everything; therefore there is a need to set an example that the principle of subsidiarity is crucial to ensure that all bodies, whether at State, local, regional or even European level face up to all their responsibilities."
"I therefore would like citizens to be able to reclaim their leading role and for them to do so through greater and more extensive information on all the opportunities of the right of petition, the fact that they exist and that there are more of them than ever, and information on how the other means of recourse, whether local, regional or national, operate so that recourse to the European Parliament, recourse to a petition, is genuinely appropriate and effective and does not ultimately result in frustration."
"I also believe that there are contradictions in some of the proposals put forward by the rapporteur: we are told that resources are insufficient, there are delays, wishy-washy replies, duplication of cases, yet the proposals include, for example, transferring the register of petitions to the Secretariat."
"I believe that this would demote the profile of petitions and the ..."
"There is nobody on the catch-the-eye list at this moment."
"A rule is a rule."
"So you may finish your speech!"
"(ES) Thank you, Mr President; if this is another facet of flexibility then I am grateful to you for it."
"I believe, therefore, that we should hold the register of petitions at the Presidency; I am of the view that we should not demote the status of petitions, and holding the register at the Presidency would provide and even maintain visibility for petitions in our Chamber as they would not be restricted to the Petitions Committee."
"I am also concerned, and I would like to hear the Commission's - Mr McCreevy's - view on this, as he is here, about the rapporteur's proposals on revision of the infringement procedure."
"I would like him to give us some clarification."
"Finally, I am also concerned about the role of fact-finding and conclusive proof under discussion."
"I believe that the role of our Petitions Committee and its duties must be to maintain politicians' and citizens' standing to demand that other powers, other institutions, operate as they should."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would just like to thank Mr Hammerstein for his report, and also the committee chairman, Mr Libicki, and the vice-chairs, for all the work they have done in collaboration with us over the years."
"I trust that the spirit of collaboration will continue up to the end of this legislature."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for all the contributions, which I have tried to include in the report."
"The comments on the slowness of any procedure have merit."
"One of its causes is the register for petitions: there is no reason why a petitioner should have to wait three or four months just to be given a number for their petition."
"That is the reason behind transferring them to Brussels under the Presidency and, with the help of the Secretariat to the Petitions Committee, registering petitions here; there is absolutely no question of demoting petitions."
"More comments have been made on scant implementation of Community law or non-compliance with it in many cases."
"We on the Petitions Committee monitor this lack of implementation."
"We do not in any way view our task as one of interfering."
"The fact that the Chairman of the Commission, a Pole, visits Spain is not interference; it is a matter of European law."
"The Petitions Committee offers citizens recourse to Community law when remedies in their countries have been exhausted."
"In no way do I believe that any cases have been politically influenced, not at all."
"The important cases which have come to the attention of the Petitions Committee have been ones where there has been a continuous breach over many years of Community law, and therefore they have come to the right place, the Petitions Committee."
"The resources of the Secretariat of the Petitions Committee are important in order to maintain its autonomy and independence."
"By way of illustration, if we take the view that a procurement method for a computer service which cannot be operated by Parliament or Council and the Commission is incorrect, how can we ask the European Commission for its opinion on its methods of procurement if we do not have the means to conduct an autonomous, independent investigation?"
"Quite simply, we cannot."
"That is why we need greater capacity, and it is obvious to all members of the Petitions Committee that the Secretariat has too much work and needs more resources."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 23 September 2008."
"European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Katerina Batzeli on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009) - C6-0151/2008 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the proclamation of next year as the European Year of Creativity and Innovation is fully in accord with the aims and priorities of the EU to develop the European knowledge society as a key response of the Europe of 27 to the economic and social challenges of globalisation."
"This globalisation blatantly seeks to place at the centre of developments nothing other than the economy, which is in fact all too often the illicit distribution of profits."
"Globalisation, if it is to develop into an equitable development policy able to deliver its economic and social benefits to all regions, must be human-centred."
"It must provide equal access opportunities for all citizens, in every part of the world."
"We have made the right choice in opting for the combination of innovation and creativity as the key dimension of the European Year 2009."
"Thus, the 'knowledge triangle' - education, research and innovation, with creativity - makes the citizen the central pillar of the EU development model."
"In addition, the choice of 2009 as the Year of Creativity and Innovation is in terms of policy clearly an extension of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"Let me add that with your participation, Mr FigeÄ¾, it is proving to be a great success."
"The mobility of knowledge and creativity forms an integral part of open intercultural dialogue."
"The aim of this dialogue is to encompass cultural diversity, partnership in business, professional cooperation, social convergence and closer educational alignment among EU citizens."
"It is therefore essential that there should be a clear commitment and mobilisation of all social partners, SMEs, educational and professional bodies, as well as Community, national and regional authorities."
"The main driving force for all the actions in 2009 will be the educational programmes at national and European level, the Community programmes for lifelong learning, the actions linked to training and education under both the Social Fund and the other Structural Funds, and also the national educational programmes to be included in this Year."
"The fields of culture, communications, the job market, young people, women, immigrants, local and regional entities, cultural industries and SMEs are included."
"It has been decided that this cooperation should be based on multi-annual and one-year programmes with specified funding for projects, although Parliament would like this Year to have its own budget, as is the case with the Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"Parliament has made amendments that, if anything, will ensure that this Year is funded not primarily through the Community programmes for lifelong learning, but through each programme and sector-based action."
"Under this proposal, innovation and creativity will not place a burden on the educational programmes, but will be central to all Community policies."
"Let me end by thanking the Commissioner, the Commission departments, and the Slovenian and French Presidencies for the open dialogue and cooperation we have had."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I want to express my gratitude to Mrs Batzeli, to the Committee on Culture and Education and to all Members for their support and amendments - and improvements - to the original text, aimed at strengthening it and stressing several aspects of a potential European Year of Creativity and Innovation."
"The Commission can wholeheartedly support the text as it stands."
"This initiative is a response to calls from this Parliament and from the Member States to strengthen the links between education and culture."
"By focusing on creativity and human talents, the Commission wants to emphasise that, while we can draw inspiration from the past by learning from our rich European and world heritage, engaging with culture should, above all, be an experience which helps to unfold people's innate potential and engage their active participation."
"Creativity and capacity for innovation are linked competences which need to be fostered as widely as possible through lifelong learning."
"There is creativity and innovative potential in all of us, and everybody has different talents, be they professional artists or amateurs, teachers or entrepreneurs, from a rich background or a poor one."
"Fostering that potential can help solve societal challenges and also to shape Europe's future in the globalised world, as Mrs Batzeli just said."
"This European Year will provide an opportunity to highlight the fact that Parliament, together with the Council and Member States, has already drawn up a charter for a balanced approach to education in the form of the recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning."
"We adopted this in December 2006, and it will be our guideline throughout the year."
"One of its striking features is the definition of competence as 'knowledge, skills and attitudes', and we plan to use the Year to highlight particularly the question of attitudes, which is arguably the idea which Europe most needs to work on."
"When this proposed European Year was initially discussed with the Committee on Culture on a very informal basis, Mrs Pack emphasised that this was a European success story and a good one to put before voters in an election year - 2009."
"With this in mind, I would urge Parliament and all of us to become real ambassadors for creativity and innovation - not only in 2009, but also beyond that."
"on behalf of PPE-DE. - (RO) As you know, the Commission's proposal that 2009 should be the European Year of creativity and innovation is part of the initiative to emphasise the importance of various topics by associating them with individual years."
"Europe needs to stress creativity and innovativeness in order to cope with a mobile Europe, and choosing this topic for the European Year is a good opportunity for conveying information to the public with regard to the best practices in the field, and for stimulating political debate."
"The overall goal of the 2009 European Year is to promote creativity as a driving force for innovation and a key factor in the development of personal, vocational, entrepreneurial and social skills throughout life."
"Creativity and innovativeness are two values which become more and more precious as we use them."
"The more we use them, the more effective they become."
"However, top performance requires special attention under favourable circumstances."
"In 2009 it will be very important for each Member State to promote, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality, those activities which involve young people, men as well as women, as we know that women are under-represented in science and research."
"These activities should also involve disabled persons with a high potential for creativity."
"The European People's Party supports European innovation and treats the setting up of a European Institute for Innovation and Technology as a priority."
"However, we believe that reliance on people's innate creativity and innovativeness is not enough; we should organise activities and create events."
"In this context, we support the adoption of the draft report on the European Year of Creativity and Innovation which has been negotiated with the European Commission and the Council."
"Moreover, it is essential that we should launch a set of follow-up measures meant to keep up these efforts once the year is over, and, as the Commissioner said, in our capacity as Members of the European Parliament, we should indeed act as ambassadors of creativity."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we are still in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and we are thinking about the Year of Creativity and Innovation, which is a good thing, because the two subjects complement each other."
"That is very important, because it takes a lot of creativity and innovation to establish intercultural dialogue, to practise it and make it part of our lives."
"We should now get into practice so that we can then move seamlessly into the next year and the new requirements, for creativity must be regarded as a driver for innovation and as a key factor for the development of personal, occupational, entrepreneurial and social competences."
"Particular importance attaches in this context to lifelong learning."
"Europe must become more creative and innovative in order to rise to the challenges of global competition and to adapt and respond to rapid technological changes and developments."
"There is still a great deal to be done in this respect."
"If we consider the research and development programme and the budget that every country is supposed to provide, namely 3% of GDP, we cannot fail to recognise that we are still far short of the target."
"When we look at other countries, such as the United States and China, which invest far more in research and development, we can see where there are gaps to be filled here in Europe."
"It also takes a very great deal of creativity and innovation to assemble funding packages."
"This programme could certainly have done with one."
"Sadly, it had to get by without financial resources."
"The Member States - and organisations and institutions too - must now work out for themselves where they set priorities and how they fund them, to which end, of course, they will have to avail themselves of appropriate EU support programmes."
"For additional innovations and additional activities, however, we could have done with extra funding."
"That was surely essential."
"It is also very important to establish a close link between artistic creation and schools and universities."
"Art and culture also need support and encouragement if they are to engender creativity."
"The ideas are very often there, but the money to implement them is lacking."
"It is very important that we do not neglect evaluation in connection with the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the Year of Mobility and all these things which are actually intertwined, so that we know, at the end of the day, what advantages are accruing to the population and how we can make it clear and comprehensible to our fellow citizens that all of these priorities ultimately benefit them personally and foster the development of the European Union."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, it is a special pleasure for me to speak today, because Parliament's best vice-president, Marek Siwiec, is leading the session and the distinguished Commissioner JÃ¡n Figel' is here, and because the subject is most interesting: creativity and innovation; although one could always ask, when discussing such matters, what creativity and innovation actually are."
"It often seems as if they are just words which do not appear to have a lot of content."
"If I had to answer the question of what creativity is, I know at least one answer, which the Finnish composer Sibelius is said to have given: he thought creativity was pain."
"Of course we have no fear of pain in Europe if it begets added value, something which takes us forward as a group of nations and in the context of Europe as a whole."
"As I see it, it is the main purpose behind this European Year: to bring some added value to the European reality."
"How do we promote creativity and innovation?"
"As the President knows, your country, Poland, is to get the European Institute of Innovation and Technology."
"That is surely one factor in this area which is going to encourage the Member States of the European Union to create new added value and innovations using various incentives."
"We know, however, that it is not government decisions that bring about innovation or creativity."
"Whatever we decide here, they do not come about as a result of decisions."
"Instead, we need resources and the right prerequisites at universities, schools and in different sectors of our society, so that people can focus on creating something new and exchange best practices, and so that they can break free of the stereotyped thinking that prevents them from approaching things in a new way."
"This, I think, is a great challenge, because we all know that the education institutions in our own countries have in many cases developed as a result of traditions going back a long time."
"Certain traditions have been taught, a certain truth, but to some extent there is a need to question issues and examine them from a pluralistic angle."
"We need to realise that by being critical and by disagreeing, by challenging the paradigms and certain 'truths', we can succeed in creating new added value."
"I know that the Commissioner will certainly urge all the Member States to put forward national innovation strategies on how they will help students to think of new ideas or provide scope for new ways of thinking all the way from the early school years to university based on a programme of lifelong learning."
"This is an important issue, and I think that the main contribution that this European Year will make will be that creativity, innovation and new ways of thinking will become the core of the debate."
"Perhaps it will lead to innovation and new added value, and perhaps they will result in productisation, because the economy in the European Union is an important business. Thank you, Mr President."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Paul Gauguin said 'I shut my eyes in order to see'."
"We want to see better, to understand better and to act better."
"We need to awaken the skills and talents that are dormant within ourselves."
"It is essential to use all the powers of creativity that European society possesses in order to face the challenges that the world is bringing forward."
"We constitute less than 8% of the population on our planet."
"Other people are neither passive, nor any less gifted."
"For this reason, acting on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to support the establishment of the European Year of Creativity and Innovation."
"I would not, however, like this to be an activity just for the sake of the activity."
"We must do everything to avoid wasting the opportunities and abilities that we have to create new and positive values in all areas: in technology, entrepreneurship, in finances as well as in social and other areas."
"We cannot afford to waste the skills, abilities and hard work of thousands of talented Europeans, young and old, including those who are disabled."
"We must do everything to simplify procedures to introduce innovative solutions."
"Let us make use of objective 7. of the framework programme for this purpose!"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) I should like to begin by congratulating both the Commission on its proposal and the rapporteur, Mrs Batzeli, on a report which had almost unanimous support with the customary exception of one member of our Committee for the entire report."
"On one hand I should note that my region, the Basque Country, is holding a Year of Innovation this year."
"It is being carried out on the basis of concepts approved in 2007 and I believe it should be possible to draw on at least some of them to a fair degree."
"Specifically, one concept could be to promote critical, free thought in society."
"The year should at least include this concept."
"Thought which drives the scientific spirit forward and develops the ability to reason in order to facilitate change in the organisations and institutions in our territory and their contribution to the construction of a modern, supportive, open and innovative continent."
"On the other hand, the Year of Creativity and Innovation should encourage a concept of open innovation: innovation which, as well as being based on internal capabilities, incorporates all its possible sources - users, suppliers and networks - and which, going beyond product and technology, includes the intangible and generally manifold aspects leading to value creation."
"Similarly, the year should take innovation into all spheres: innovation which reaches all Governments, and here I do not mean only the governments of the Member States, regions or non-State bodies which have plenty to say during the year."
"I would also ask the Commission to please bear them in mind as well."
"Innovation should also extend to all organisations and institutions, whether public or private, profit-making or non-profit-making, and to all aspects of life; in particular it should promote social innovation and innovation in support of environmental sustainability."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (CS) Mr President, I was elected to the European Parliament in a former communist country."
"Surprisingly, here in the EU we are once again experiencing those things that we were convinced we had left behind long ago."
"It is strange case of dÃ©jÃ  vu."
"I lived through the entire communist era in my country, during which our lives were carefully divided into years, months, weeks and days, each dedicated to someone or something."
"We had the Year of Folk Culture, the Month of the Book, the Month of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship, the Cosmos Week, the Miners' Day."
"Every time we woke up in the morning, our day, week or month belonged to someone other than us."
"Our lives went by like one big endless campaign."
"This campaigning was designed to cover up the lack of freedom, as well as the scarcity of oranges and meat."
"As members of the European Union we have enough oranges and meat, and yet, the Union is succumbing to the same temptation: to achieve results through campaigning instead of patient and steady work."
"How does the European Union intend to whip up more creativity?"
"Creativity is based on invention and talent, on an inspired (or at least a good) idea."
"We will achieve nothing more than making hundreds of additional new NGOs happy."
"These NGOs are a strange disease affecting our democracy."
"Although unelected and unauthorised, they are allowed to draw money from our funds since they act for the greater good, of course."
"They will happily spend the entire budget for this annual campaign."
"They will spend taxpayers' money on thousands of leaflets, numerous advertisements, events and seminars."
"Creativity, however, will be the same one year on."
"Mr President, I have a suggestion."
"Instead of the European Year of Creativity and Innovation, let us declare next year to be a year of regular work, free from any campaigning."
"A campaign-free year: what a relief that will be."
"Mr President, the overall objective of the European Year 2009 is 'to promote creativity for all as a driver for innovation and as a key factor for the development of personal, occupational, entrepreneurial and social competences through lifelong learning'."
"But we are always talking of new legislation."
"An oppugnant state mired in legislation and bureaucracy stifles creativity and entrepreneurship among its people."
"Belgium, for example, is unlikely ever to produce a Joe Meek or a Richard Branson, and, let's be honest: the Singing Nun was never really on a par with The Beatles or the Rolling Stones."
"As the Commission sinks into caducity before becoming lost in caliginosity, the great works of European culture will remain as knitted beacons."
"Let us not stifle our artistes with any more legislation, and, as the great Ral Donner once lamented: 'You don't know what you've got until you lose it, uh-huh, oh yeah!'"
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Year of Creativity and Innovation is an excellent occasion for drawing the attention of citizens to the Union's activities in the field of education and research, particularly with regard to the Lifelong Learning Programme."
"Lifelong learning is an integral part of the Lisbon programme, and its most important goals include the development of a knowledge-based society, increased competitiveness, stimulation of the economy and the creation of jobs."
"When we talk about creativity, we are prone to thinking exclusively of scientists, engineers, builders or master craftsmen."
"However, in addition to economic and technological innovation, the concept of creativity has another, easier interpretation which is perhaps closer to us, namely creativity in the artistic sense."
"To a great extent, artists who dazzle us again and again contribute to making our lives complete, whether it be painting, sculpture, literature, song, theatre, graphics, photography, design or even film, which reaches vast masses of people."
"Artists and the works they create define our quality of life."
"The Year of Creativity offers a good opportunity to recognise and appreciate those people who make our immediate environment inhabitable and influence the tastes, value judgments and demands of young Europeans for the better."
"I realise that we have a great need of innovative and creative technologies that bring about revolutionary changes."
"We are dazzled by fabulous cars, miraculous means of communication and the results of innovative, scientific research, but what would life be worth without the beautiful works of art, statues, graphics, textiles or the creative works of music and literature that surround us?"
"I very much hope that the European Union's programmes will include the ethical and material appreciation of culture, especially the works that contribute to a sense of pride in European identity and as a result of which we can all like being European a little bit more."
"Finally, even though I have been speaking about the arts up to now, please allow me to express my hope that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, which has recently opened in Budapest, will also make an effective contribution to the success of this Year. Thank you for your attention."
"(PL) Mr President, growth in consumption as well as growth of resources for economic growth, healthcare and culture in the coming globalisation process depend to an ever increasing extent on the effectiveness of education, on activities to promote people's everyday creativity and innovation, on creating better organisational and financial models for the introduction of innovations and on ideas that increase productivity, improve quality, create jobs, reduce costs and improve competitiveness."
"What is important in all of this is the development of education, and this includes statutory education, which should encourage creative thinking."
"The media too should encourage innovative thinking by showcasing achievements and showing respect for those responsible for those achievements."
"Innovation in the economy, at different levels of local government, and so on, could unleash a high degree of involvement, providing that administrative barriers are eliminated and there is full social integration, which depends, to a large extent, on politicians."
"2009, the Year of Creativity and Innovation, should not be a year of thinking, but a year of concrete and creative activity."
"The draft directive is a necessary document and the changes put forward do not change its essence. Thank you, Mrs Batzeli, for your report."
"(PL) Mr President, creativity and innovation are key factors for knowledge-based economies, and the European economy is certainly one of these."
"Facing the challenges of globalisation and taking advantage of the opportunities that it presents requires an innovative and creative approach."
"Economic activity is only one of the areas where creativity and innovation are important factors for success and where they often provide a decisive competitive advantage."
"Without them it is difficult to think of products or services that fulfil the growing demands of consumers."
"For this reason I believe that increased involvement among companies, particularly as regards their experiences in taking advantage of the potential offered by human innovation and creativity, should be given considerable emphasis in European Commission plans."
"Creativity and innovation are skills that it is difficult to learn, but they can certainly be supported."
"Education is very important in stimulating their development."
"However, this should not be restricted to schools or academic education."
"What is important is that creativity and innovation should be promoted at every level of education, from different forms of education, throughout one's professional life and on into retirement."
"When promoting innovation and creativity it is worth taking advantage of experiences gained from existing programmes in education as well as from other initiatives, particularly those with a cross-border dimension."
"I believe that announcing 2009 as the European Year of Creativity and Innovation will be effective in helping to raise people's awareness, to spread information about good practice and to stimulate research and creativity and, above all, will stimulate a discussion about policy and the changes that should be initiated so that creativity and innovation gain more support from companies, European institutions and Member States."
"(PL) Mr President, it is a rare event indeed for me to say that I agree with everyone who has spoken before me."
"You have all explained clearly and convincingly why this year is important."
"Mr Janowski explained this particularly eloquently just a few minutes ago."
"However, I also agree with those who say that this could be just another of those years that do not have any real results."
"Therefore, if we do not want to be saying just that in a year or two, then we must prepare some concrete steps."
"One concrete step would be to state that we are realising our fundamental priority, which is the Lisbon strategy."
"I have not heard anyone mention this."
"This is an incredibly important issue."
"It is in the Lisbon strategy that we first linked technological and economic issues with artistic issues."
"If we are to speak of specific steps, then I believe we should do this on two levels."
"The first level (I am taking advantage of the fact that Commissioner Figel is with us and that he is in charge of schooling and education) is education."
"We should analyse the situation in the European Union."
"Does the matriculation examination in our secondary schools really provide a basis for creative thinking in the young people taking this examination?"
"There has to be a real review of what is happening in Europe."
"Aesthetic sensitivity on the one hand, and, on the other, mathematical abilities and science - this is what we are lacking."
"Traditional humanities do not make this possible."
"The European University Association often speaks of this issue."
"One last issue, which is very important."
"If we are to speak of resources, there is talk of allocating some resources on the level of the European Union."
"We have to try to create a situation where, at the end of this year, we have some report, some specific data, on the situation in individual Member States, what is missing, how can we make comparisons, because we have never made this type of comparison on the European level, not properly."
"This will help us with the Lisbon strategy."
"(SK) Commissioner FigeÄ¾, I am glad you are present for this debate today as your life experience is similar to mine in many ways."
"My own artist's experience allows me to say that devoting European Years to certain themes definitely helps increase public awareness and involvement."
"Since present-day Europe must rise to the challenges and opportunities of globalisation by strengthening its creative and innovative capacities, I welcome the Commission's decision to declare 2009 the European Year of Creativity and Innovation."
"The motive forces behind innovation are people, their occupational, entrepreneurial and social competences."
"Consequently, special attention must be paid to lifelong learning."
"I welcome the proposed measures to promote creativity and a capacity for innovation in all stages of lifelong learning through working life to retirement."
"I am convinced that, in order to achieve the 2009 goals that are meant to make Europe benefit from innovation, the set of measures should dovetail with other policies, which should continue beyond the end of the European Year of Creativity and Innovation."
"(RO) Declaring 2009 as the European Year of Creativity and Innovation is a firm commitment that we have undertaken."
"42% of the businesses working in industry and services within the EU have reported innovative activities."
"In 2003, 65% of German companies innovated and 312 patents were awarded per 1 million inhabitants, compared to the European average of 128 per 1 million inhabitants."
"In Romania, one fifth of companies do innovative business."
"In 2006, European investment in research and innovation amounted to a mere 1.84% of GDP, compared to the 3% target set by the Lisbon Strategy."
"Investment in research and innovation did not increase at the same pace as European GDP."
"I believe that surveys, polls, conferences and information campaigns are not enough."
"The European year of creativity and innovation must be a year when promises are kept."
"Promoting creativity needs appropriate support from the Community budget as well as from national budgets."
"Commissioner, together with us, with the European Parliament and the Member States, you are committing yourself to an increase in creativity and innovation in Europe in 2009."
"(RO) We thank all those who made a Central and Eastern-European country celebrate creativity a year earlier, as Budapest is, in fact, the capital of this new European trend of creativity and innovation."
"Along the same line, we propose that leading universities should have the opportunity to promote European policy by organising special actions in at least one university in each country from the last two waves of enlargement, and experts and specialists should have their say in these actions."
"We also propose that the top two or three researchers in the countries from the two most recent waves of enlargement should go on a tour of the top five universities and research centres in Europe."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, the designation of 2009 as the ""European Year of Creativity and Innovationâ provides an opportunity to promote cultural, scientific and economic cooperation, the prospects that are opening up for each country to develop its own national programme for encouragement of people's creative potential."
"Just as lifelong learning is important, so creativity, which underlies each innovation policy, is decisive for generation of new social value added."
"This policy shows that we count on and develop human resources, and that they are central."
"It is important that a direct link should be established between education, culture and science."
"It is important that institutions should interact for broadening their range."
"Creativity and innovation apply to all ages."
"It is also important that adequate resources should be allocated and public support should be enlisted for talent encouragement."
"Talents evolve, but they need support, because the driving forces in society are precisely the capable and talented creative personalities."
"I should like to say many thanks for an interesting discussion that shows interest in innovation and creativity and Parliament's support for this agenda."
"I noticed that the debate was dominated by Members from the new Member States, which in itself is a plus and perhaps sends a positive signal that Union enlargement means that new themes and realities are viewed both from the perspective of the global world and from the local perspectives."
"Richard Florida, an American sociologist, said that the key to an innovative society is the combination of 'three Ts': talent, technology and tolerance."
"Everyone has a talent to some extent, in a special way, of a different kind. Technology is represented by a computer or a musical instrument, perhaps by a wheelchair, as a means to develop a skill."
"The third T, tolerance, makes it possible for everyone, including the marginalised and weak, to participate in the processes leading to improvement, social inclusion and new knowledge."
"I am glad that we heard about the continuity with 2008 since our aim is to develop, on the basis of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue, another dimension of the cultural agenda, and that is the creative industry."
"It helps us to view culture as a creative part of society, not as a consumer, not as 'something, sometimes', but as a permanent part of the economy-creating process."
"Culture contributes."
"Culture is not about consumption."
"If we view culture this way, our creative industries will prosper and bring good jobs and significant economic growth which, in fact, is the same as the Lisbon Strategy."
"There is no dichotomy (either business or culture) but rather a communion which is of course balanced and reasonable."
"Secondly, the transfer of knowledge into practice is very important for the learning process."
"Our learning is often isolated and fragmented and has little relevance to practical needs."
"I do not want to talk for too long, just to recap that we had a real thumbs up here for the entrepreneurial sector, for business education, for the responsibility that not only the European Union but also the Member States have to promote and support talent and innovation."
"All this is interconnected with modernising the education system and with lifelong learning."
"I should like to conclude by saying that innovation is not only reflected in end products or new services."
"Innovation also shows in new approaches, new methods and new mentalities."
"This is the importance of 2009: to change our perception of the importance of innovation, of the value of talent and creativity."
"I will look forward to further cooperation."
"Mr President, I think all of us here in Parliament unanimously, and by political agreement, support the view that 2009 should be the Year of Creativity and Innovation."
"We have tried to shore up our confidence in the success of the 2009 Year programme, and this has been made all the more possible thanks to the co-decision procedure."
"The European Parliament has asserted that this procedure will be a policy based on interinstitutional agreement, not only in decision-making, but also in terms of the implementation and effectiveness of the programme."
"Let me now stress that the Commission must take account of our Members' concerns about the implementation and success of the programme during monitoring and submission of proposals by the national authorities and the parties concerned."
"This creativity and innovation will indeed be mainstreamed into all the policies."
"It will also facilitate mobility among artists, the cultural industries, educationalists and teachers."
"This calls for a much more extensive audit than in the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, when funding was clear-cut and guaranteed in the annual budget of the European Communities."
"Taking into account the message given by Commissioner FigeÄ¾ and other fellow Members that we should monitor the implementation of the programme, let me point out to this House that intercultural dialogue and the Year of Creativity and Innovation must be the spearhead of our communications policy in view of the European elections."
"This way we can make a small contribution towards mobilising citizens for entrepreneurship, creativity and culture."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Before I became a Member of the European Parliament I had the opportunity to learn about the principles behind the functioning of the educational system and private companies."
"The experience I gained showed me that Europe needs to develop its creative and innovative skills for both social and economic reasons."
"It seems to me that the coming Year of Creativity and Innovation is an excellent opportunity to improve EU competitiveness in the globalised world."
"Projects relating to the continuing growth of cooperation between Member States in the field of education, exchanges of good practice, as also the Europe of Knowledge and Innovation, are all supported both by the Polish government and the EU authorities."
"I was delighted to see the consolidation of the idea of the EIT through the establishment of its headquarters in Budapest in June 2008."
"To be able to use people's capabilities to the full and to take full advantage of ideas such as the EIT, what is needed is not just a well-developed infrastructure to encourage people's creativity, but also a support system that ensures there are proper working conditions, making it possible to continue personal development."
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to draw your attention to an initiative from Poland, and specifically from ÅÃ³dÅº, which is one of the EIT branches."
"ÅÃ³dÅº stands out in Europe by its innovation and exceptional skills in the areas both of modern education and in the concepts introduced into business."
"Making good use of favourable circumstances, such as the Year of Creativity and Innovation, as well as of the undervalued potential of cities such as ÅÃ³dÅº could be of benefit to us all!"
"in writing. - (HU) Creativity and innovation play an extremely important role in Europe's ability to react effectively to the challenges and opportunities of globalisation."
"Using knowledge more effectively and developing innovation are core elements of the European economy, so we need to place special emphasis on them."
"The European Year, which aims to develop creativity and innovation, wants to draw attention to this."
"The dynamism of the European economy largely depends on its innovative capacity."
"Europe must focus its creative and innovative abilities for both social and economic reasons."
"This is why I feel it is important that the European Year should also talk about practical measures and promoting the development of innovation."
"The results of creativity and innovation must become more widely known."
"For this reason, there is particular demand for initiating information and promotional campaigns, holding events at joint European, Member State, regional and local levels, formulating key messages and making good practices known."
"The cluster networks that are recognised as the driving force of innovation must be promoted, as well as the creation of knowledge triangles and forging ahead with different forms of education."
"In order to promote innovation, Member States must concentrate on the developments achieved in the field of services to support innovation, especially for the purposes of technology transfer, on creating poles and networks of innovation through contact with universities and businesses, on knowledge transfer and on better access to funding."
"in writing. - (RO) Diversity is one of the sources of innovation, and the EU's enlargement policy has brought new sources of diversity into Europe, and therefore new sources of innovation."
"Unfortunately, though, the cost of participation in Erasmus programmes is prohibitive for many students in Romania and Bulgaria, which decreases their level of involvement."
"Erasmus was created in 1987 with the aim of providing students with European mobility and the prospects of a better career."
"Twenty-one years later, not only has the programme attracted 2 million students and 3,100 higher education institutions, it has also made an active contribution to improving the academic life of students by helping them acquire intercultural abilities and self-confidence."
"Although this was not one of its overt aims, the Erasmus programme succeeded in making students understand the very essence of the European Union: freedom of movement within this diverse yet united family."
"Therefore, in light of the approaching Year of Innovation and Creativity, I believe that the allocation of extra funds to the budget for students coming from recent Member States would lead to increased participation in the programme and consequently to an increase in diversity as a source of innovation and creativity."
"Adaptation of a number of instruments to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, ""omnibus"" Regulation, Part Two - Alignment of legal acts to the new Comitology Decision (Legislative initiative) (short presentation)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by JÃ³zsef SzÃ¡jer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council adapting a number of instruments subject to the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty to Council Decision 1999/468/EC, as amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, with regard to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny - Part Two - C6-0476/2007 -, and"
"by JÃ³zsef SzÃ¡jer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, with recommendations to the Commission on the alignment of legal acts to the new Comitology Decision."
"rapporteur. - (HU) It has long been humanity's experience that a decision-making authority, and particularly the authorities in implementation situations, cannot go without parliamentary monitoring."
"Today, especially in connection with the preparation of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have very often heard about the European Union's so-called democratic deficit, and we have also heard a huge amount about bureaucracy in Brussels."
"Interestingly, the Treaty of Lisbon is not supported today by precisely those whose interests would best be served by all this change, and by those who remain to be convinced that the Treaty of Lisbon ensures precisely more effective monitoring of the implementing authority, the European Commission, and so-called European bureaucracy."
"I want this to be considered by all those who think there is no need for the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am convinced that, by safeguarding broader powers for the European Parliament, which is elected directly by the citizens, over the European Commission, we will serve this goal."
"Particularly when Parliament and the Council, or the legislative authority, delegate more and more powers to the implementing authority in Europe, it entrusts the European Commission in more and more respects with laying down the detailed rules."
"Since, in a huge number of cases, we need to react immediately when the complicated European legislative mechanism does not work, when the Council and Parliament cannot meet, and in this case there is no other alternative than to authorise the Commission in such matters in the interests of rapid, effective action."
"This still happens."
"These two reports concern the fact that, within the framework of the agreement concluded in 2006 by the European Parliament and the Commission, the European Parliament's sphere of influence and powers will extend to monitoring the actions of the Commission within the spheres of implementation and legislation."
"Up to now, only one legislature, the Council, had this opportunity."
"The European Commission has produced four packages, of which we adopted two during our summer session."
"The third is coming now, and my own initiative report is about the principles through which this process must be implemented and how this monitoring must be recorded."
"At the same time, I would like to establish that the discussions gave rise to a good compromise, but I would like to clarify fully, on behalf of Parliament, that we do not consider this to be a precedent, either for the Committee procedures that are currently under way, or looking to the future."
"These monitoring powers will be Parliament's due irrespective of the Treaty of Lisbon; in other words, the Treaty of Lisbon, which safeguards similar powers, has come a little further and we are already realising these powers within its framework."
"This is a gigantic amount of work for Parliament, and Parliament must be guaranteed the necessary instruments for this; and for this very reason I have taken action with regard to the budget too, so that, by taking it away from the bureaucracy, we can safeguard for Parliament the opportunities that are necessary for completing this new task."
"In other words, Parliament must also prepare for completing this task, and I think that by taking this step the European Union will also become more democratic and more transparent."
"In other words, we will be taking a significant step towards having the implementing authority monitored by the legislative authority, and thus by sovereignty, within the European institutions. Thank you for your attention."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I welcome the two reports from Mr SzÃ¡jer, and my thanks to the rapporteur for his work."
"KÃ¶szÃ¶nÃ¶m szÃ©pen JÃ³ska."
"With the first-reading agreement reached on the so-called 'second omnibus', an additional set of legislative instruments will be brought in line to the revised comitology decision."
"This implies a stronger role for Parliament - for you - and closer democratic scrutiny."
"The Commission is really pleased to see that work has been advancing at quite a good rate and fair solutions have been reached between the three institutions - the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"With the second report, Parliament actually invited the Commission to present new proposals to adapt a further limited number of acts."
"I can assure you of the Commission's intention to examine thoroughly the recommendations made in your report."
"Once this assessment is completed, we will be able to decide how best to respond to Parliament's recommendations."
"Finally, let me also express the hope that the examination by the Council and by Parliament of the next omnibus will also proceed rapidly and smoothly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Marianne Mikko, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, EU membership has almost doubled since the beginning of 2004."
"Ensuring the convergence of standards for the protection of democracy and basic freedoms towards the highest existing levels is one of the main post-enlargement challenges."
"In this context, the report welcomes all initiatives aimed at safeguarding democracy and points out that the media remains an influential political tool which should not be treated solely on economic terms."
"The report recognises the decision of the European Commission to entrust determining the reliable and impartial indicators of media pluralism to a consortium of three European universities."
"In addition, this report stresses the need to institute the monitoring and implementation systems based on the indicators thus determined."
"The report also recognises the ongoing efforts of publishers' and journalists' representatives to create a charter of media freedom."
"In addition, the report underscores the need for social and legal guarantees for journalists and editors."
"The report advocates the adoption by the multinational enterprises of the best practice for editorial and journalistic freedom in each country where they operate."
"It expresses concern over lower standards being applied in the Member States which acceded to the EU in 2004 and 2007."
"The development and acceptance of new technologies has led to the emergence of new media channels and new kinds of content."
"The emergence of new media has brought more dynamism and diversity into the media landscape."
"The report encourages responsible use of new channels."
"Weblogs: I understand and I do not understand the concern of webloggers."
"My entrance into cyberspace has created rapid reaction among a lot of bloggers."
"I shall make it clear now that nobody is interested in regulating the internet."
"That is why I support, as rapporteur, the compromise that has reached common understanding in the PSE, ALDE and Verts/ALE Groups and which underlines the following: 'encourages an open discussion on all issues relating to the status of weblogs' - full stop."
"We remain here."
"The report acknowledges the challenges posed to the print outlets by the migration of the advertising revenues to the internet, but points out that the new commercial media landscape is dominated by the established public and private media content providers."
"It also takes the standpoint that the concentration of media ownership is approaching levels where media pluralism is not granted by the forces of the free market, especially in the new Member States."
"The report recognises that the public service media needs a sizable and stable market share to fulfil its mission."
"It points out that, whereas in certain markets the public service media is a leading market participant, it mostly suffers from inadequate funding and political pressure."
"The report recognises the need to increase media literacy in the EU, recommends the inclusion of media literacy among the nine basic competences and supports the development of the European core curriculum for media literacy."
"Once again, the report welcomes all initiatives aimed at safeguarding democracy and points out that the media remains an influential political tool, which should not be treated solely on economic terms."
"Freedom of expression is the key of my report - for that I really stand."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate Mrs Marianne Mikko on her excellent report."
"The Commission shares many of the views expressed in this report."
"We are convinced that this resolution sends a very positive signal in favour of media pluralism to all interested parties, including Member States and European institutions, including the Commission."
"Safeguarding democracy and plurality of expression - as you have said - is essential."
"We must maintain a good balance between the objectives of the diversity of voices in the media and the competitive strength of the media."
"However, earlier and intensive consultations indicated that it would be politically inappropriate for the Commission and the European Union to harmonise media ownership rules or media pluralism."
"Subsidiarity is effectively a strong consideration here, and a one-size-fits-all measure or model would not suit the variety of situations."
"This is the reason why I think that it would be a mistake to over-regulate the very lively blogosphere."
"Nevertheless, I agree with you that certain legal obligations imposed on the press, such as respect for copyrights or the right of reply, must in any case be respected by websites."
"Putting user-generated content sites on an equal footing with any other forms of public expression seems to us to be a desirable aim."
"Conversely, creating a rigid and special status for blogs seems counter-productive and in contradiction to the genuine spirit of the internet."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament that the European Community's competition rules themselves can only partially ensure the pluralism of the media."
"This is exactly the reason why media pluralism is regarded as a legitimate public interest by Article 21 of the EC Merger Regulation."
"Therefore, Member States may take appropriate measures to protect media pluralism by implementing additional rules beyond the Merger Regulation."
"They must, however, apply national and EC law."
"However, as regards competition rules, I would like to nuance a little your statement on the harmful character of the concentration of ownership on media pluralism."
"Europe's media companies, including the written press, must be strong enough to withstand competition at global, international level."
"We are against over-restrictive rules on media ownership which could reduce the competitiveness of EU companies."
"Situations are not comparable from one Member State to another."
"There is a real diversity of situations."
"I am, of course, in favour of more transparency of ownership and of complete information being available to the public regarding the aims and background of broadcasters and publishers."
"This is a sine qua non condition to attaining more authoritative and reliable media."
"As you insist in your resolution, public service broadcasters are an indispensable element for media plurality."
"This is why the Commission thinks that their public-service missions must be clearly specified and their funding ensured; otherwise great uncertainty will ensure."
"In this respect, Ladies and Gentlemen, we all agree that the definition of the public service remit is, in principle, a matter for Member States, rather than the Commission, to decide."
"Member States also decide the means of financing public service broadcasting, as indicated in the Amsterdam Protocol."
"In this context, the Commission's role is to minimise distortion of competition between all types of media."
"The Commission also appreciates your position on codes of conduct and self-regulation as instruments to support media pluralism."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 September."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Concentration and pluralism will continue to be at the centre of debate at national and Community level."
"Today's society and citizens receive live information and can see discussions on the media."
"Against this background, then, the primary objective is to settle and define the limits within which the public and private media can cooperate and intervene."
"In each case, there must be an assurance that information will not be manipulated."
"Independence from political power, the financial independence of the media, transparent funding of the media, safeguards for journalists' working conditions, and the quality and variety of news reporting - all must be guaranteed."
"As democratic dialogue through the media opens up, a new means of communication is being developed: the blog, which individualises the exchange of views."
"In many cases, however, this form of expression has turned into a 'collective protest', such as on crucial issues like the environment and society."
"Self-regulation codes can at this stage form an adequate basis for mutual respect between users and readers; they need not impose any limitation on the right of expression and response on either side."
"The media and online exchange of information forums are being expanded, assessed and regulated with unfailing regard for the principle of democratic expression and participation, and respect for human rights."
"in writing. - (NL) We attach great importance to pluralism in the media and we also endorse the broad principles of the report."
"It is a pity we were not able to agree on every last point in it."
"We fully agree that public service broadcasters must be given room to play their part in a digital, interactive media environment, in proper balance with the commercial broadcasters, of course."
"An open debate on weblogs should be encouraged."
"Blogs and other 'user-generated content' provide a lively contribution to the multifaceted media landscape and are increasingly influential in the interpretation of news and current affairs."
"But the quality of a blog stands or falls by its author and not all bloggers are equally honourable in their intentions."
"If blogs are not to degenerate into anonymous sources of libel, we need to think about how to deal with breaches of privacy or the right of reply, for example. But Parliament absolutely must not be overly paternalistic."
"in writing. - (PL) I would like to emphasise that the European Union needs to make sure there is a balance between private and state media in Europe."
"Interference in information content by the proprietors of television or radio stations is a breach of democratic standards."
"I come from a country where the present government is destroying the independence of the media."
"A whole series of measures is being taken to make the state media subservient to the ruling elite."
"I would like to express my support for any initiative aimed at protecting public mass media, since these constitute a powerful political tool."
"Public service broadcasters need additional protection because of the lack of sufficient funding and the political pressures to which they are subject, particularly in the new Member States."
"in writing. - (SV) The European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education seems to have a problem of underemployment and, in its eagerness to find subjects to keep it busy, it produces reports which the world would manage quite well without."
"The report on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union is an example of this."
"It is an own-initiative report from the Committee and, in her original text, the rapporteur proposed a voluntary classification of blogs on the basis of the professional and financial responsibility and interests of the author and publisher."
"There are many objections to such an idea, as regards both implementability but also, and even more importantly, its possible implications for freedom of expression."
"Although the draft report was amended during its passage through committee, it still contains much that is unnecessary and harmful."
"in writing. - (FI) I wish to thank Mrs Mikko for her report on pluralism in the media."
"This is a burning issue in European society: what is our role and our influence?"
"History has made it crystal-clear that the concentration of power is never for the good."
"People are always ill-disposed to power in whatever shape it presents itself, and concentrated power makes the whole of society sick."
"This is also true of the fourth estate, the media."
"One of the main functions of the Union is to guarantee competition in the single market."
"Why should that not also be true of the media?"
"The notion in the report of interlinking competition law with media law to avoid conflicts of interests between media ownership concentration and other forms of power in society is justified."
"Nevertheless, I am more worried about the media's ability as the watchdog of what is good in society, because the interests of both are more and more exclusively about profit."
"The Church has not spoon-fed morals to the people for a long time."
"This has been the work of a certain kind of press, because sin, defamation, and condemnation are what it thrives on."
"In an ingenious way, this type of journalism can combine the adoration of immorality with extraordinary narrow-mindedness to make a productive business: provoke, condemn and make money."
"'For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.'"
"These words showed a good knowledge of the human mind."
"When will the media itself address itself to the question of whether it ultimately achieves something socially evil or socially good through its actions?"
"in writing. - (RO) As we all agree, pluralism should be a vital element of the mass media."
"Pluralism must be supported, and the adoption of the Mikko report constitutes a major step in this direction."
"The need for a balanced mass media market should be recognised and supported by the Member States, which should commit themselves, both individually and collectively, to giving European citizens the opportunity of obtaining accurate and diverse information."
"Cultural diversity, as well as the ever-increasing need for integration of the migrant population and of minorities, along with the importance of providing quality information to the active population, are the priority reasons for creating a Media Freedom Charter."
"I would like to express my full support for the European Parliament's recommendation that public media services should be encouraged to act as alternative providers of information to ones based exclusively on commercial criteria."
"Active exercise of rights and obligations by European citizens, and their being informed and capable of understanding and criticising the provision of information is a necessity which should bear on every measure to be adopted in the future both by European institutions and by each Member State."
"in writing. - The report of Marianne Mikko reflects very well on the general tendencies in the media in the European Union, pointing out an extremely important aspect in paragraph 35, regarding public broadcasting services."
"In order to maintain sufficient media pluralism and diversity, public broadcasting corporations must also provide programmes that might not gain the highest ratings or advertising revenue."
"I have always been convinced that if a public service broadcaster becomes extremely popular among the people and profitable for the state, it need not be a public broadcaster at all."
"The purpose of the public broadcaster is also to cater for the various needs and interests of the people, who are not always the unexacting audience of private broadcasters that tend to go with the mainstream."
"The public service broadcasters across the European Union should not neglect high-quality niche programmes in order to compete with privately owned broadcasters."
"One of the principles of providing public goods is solidarity."
"Public broadcasting services should operate in solidarity with viewers of more demanding or fastidious tastes as well."
"in writing. - The report concerns an important subject, media diversity, which is an important element in safeguarding democracy and the right of citizens to have access to reliable and independent media."
"Countries where economic, religious or political interests control the media have difficulties offering their citizens a variety of means of gathering information, which creates large gaps in their ability to absorb information and guarantee free and impartial elections."
"Now we in the European Parliament are voting on a report concerning these important issues."
"We Swedish Social Democrats had really hoped to be able to vote for this report. But as it stands today, we will not do this."
"There is great purpose in the compromise proposal reached, but there remain several ambiguities, mainly around issues that affect web-blogger status."
"We do not want to contribute to the European Parliament equating web-blogging with traditional media by questioning and proposing discussions on web-blogs status, as proposed."
"This is not required for other groups, so why the web-bloggers?"
"However, we share the view, with many web-bloggers, that violations and slander are equally punishable on web-blogs as in other media."
"Therefore, we will vote against this report."
"in writing. - (CS) The European Parliament own-initiative report on concentration and pluralism in the media in the European Union is very significant and useful, and in many places accurately describes the situation already existing in the Czech Republic for a number of years."
"Here I want to emphasise two particular aspects that the report rightly criticises in broad terms and on which it calls for redress."
"The first one is the almost total concentration of the daily newspapers in the hands of foreign (specifically German) syndicates, whose economic and political interests clearly contradict the objective interests of the Czech Republic, in particular with regard to the pluralist view and media independence."
"In the Czech environment, these have become nothing more than a fiction."
"Instead, there is a clear tendency towards a radical right-wing slant and bottomless manipulation."
"The other aspect concerns the activities of statutory television broadcasting that exclusively serves the interests of the present right-wing government and is so tendentious in news coverage and journalism that the term statutory does not apply to it any longer."
"Consequently, my recommendation to the authorities and institutions that are concerned with the issue of media concentration and pluralism in the EU is to pay increased attention to the situation in the Czech Republic in particular."
"Follow-up of the Monterrey Conference of 2002 on Financing for Development (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Thijs Berman, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the follow-up to the Monterrey Conference of 2002 on financing for Development."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, the UN is currently debating the Millennium Goals in New York."
"Unless things change, we shall not achieve those Goals by 2015."
"That means that poverty will not have been halved, the maternal mortality ratio will not have been significantly reduced, and not all children will be benefiting from primary education."
"Here and there we are even hearing calls for the Millennium Goals to be shelved."
"They are not working."
"Aid fatigue is the problem."
"That is another term for cynicism and short-sighted self-interest."
"Insufficient aid is guaranteed not to produce results. And yes, aid programmes frequently fail."
"And that is the problem. Too little aid doesn't work."
"It is as if a football trainer kitted his team out with shoes for their right feet only."
"After a dozen or so matches he says 'you lose every time, you'll never be any good."
"I'm out of here - keep the shoes, but you're on your own from now on.'"
"There are plenty of countries where aid does produce results."
"The scale of the aid is important."
"In Rwanda substantial aid was given after the genocide."
"The country has recovered admirably."
"There are many criticisms one might level against President Kagame - I have plenty myself - but following the terror of 1994 Rwanda offers a lesson in living to the whole world. But without aid its economic growth would have been less impressive."
"In Mozambique too, aid has produced results; and there are many other examples."
"Since the Millennium Goals were formulated, 29 million children have been able to benefit from primary schooling."
"If the world kept its promises, there would not be a food crisis."
"If every prosperous country spent 0.7% of its GNP on development aid the number of malnourished children would not now be rising again after being in decline for years."
"So this report constitutes a sharp reminder by the European Parliament to Member States to keep their promises, especially those Member States which are dragging their feet - France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy, to name just those big Member States."
"They must increase their aid by 2015, within a clear time frame and in equal increments."
"No backloading, because a late surge after a series of small increases would mean the poor countries losing out on aid worth 17 billion euros between now and 2015."
"One thing has to be clear: public funds alone are not enough to get development going and keep it going."
"It takes more than that."
"The European Union has to go on investing in peace and security, in good governance and respect for human rights."
"In Kenya that has worked, thanks to pressure from Europe, and Raila Odinga is now prime minister."
"In Eastern Chad EUFOR is having a far harder time of it. But it is vital to harness private funds for public goals."
"The ability to borrow money is key here."
"Loans are rarely available to the poorest, and that must change."
"With development as the goal, there must be equal access for women as well as men, no punitive rates of interest, investment in opportunities for small employers who are very good at networking, all this in association with local organisations."
"Private banks do not automatically think about these conditions and are slower to lend to women than to men."
"The European Union can make an enormous difference here through credit guarantees. And the European Investment Bank must lend a lot more than it does at present to microcredit institutions."
"These things give people a real chance to show what they are made of and consolidate their own existence as independent, self-sufficient citizens."
"The poor countries also need to be given more of a say in the IMF."
"More money is also needed to cope with the consequences of climate change using the carbon emissions trading system."
"The polluter pays; it is not the poor countries that are responsible for global warming."
"Aid here must focus on sustainable forms of energy."
"Development policy is a central concern of the European Union."
"The European Union must be a strong player on the world stage, each Member State in its own way but standing together and contributing 0.7% of GNP."
"That is Millennium Goal number 8, and achievement of that eighth goal will bring the other goals a little closer to realisation."
"In conclusion, in the time it has take for me to deliver this speech, eighty people will have died of starvation and fifty children under the age of five will have died from easily curable illnesses."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to express gratitude especially to Mr Thijs Berman for his report."
"It is very thorough and forward-looking."
"I think this report is very timely and can make an impact especially in two areas."
"One is the UN negotiations in New York on the outcome document of the Doha Review Conference on Financing for Development which should start at the end of November."
"Secondly, the EU position for the negotiations in the United Nations and Europe's own contribution to a successful outcome of the Doha conference."
"This position is being currently developed."
"In 2002, as you said, Monterrey was a success; the developed and developing countries joined forces and committed themselves to a concrete set of actions, the so-called 'Monterrey Consensus'."
"The role of the European Union was strong and decisive in order to bring about this successful outcome."
"I think Europe has been serious in following up the commitments made in Doha, and the Commission has assessed the progress in our Member States annually."
"In 2005 the EU reviewed and further strengthened our commitments."
"The most prominent EU commitments are the time-bound targets to increase the volume of official development assistance with a view to spending, by 2015, 0.7% of the EU's gross national income for development."
"I think you all know that we decided to get there step by step with the first immediate target in 2006 - collectively reached by the EU."
"The next deadline is 2010, when our aid should collectively reach 0.56% of GDP."
"In June this year (2008) the European Council strongly reconfirmed those commitments, a welcome and essential measure since EU aid levels dropped last year, for the first time since Monterrey."
"This was a rather negative signal."
"Against this background, the Commission remains confident that the European Union aid levels will increase again as of 2008 - this year."
"Multiannual rolling timetables illustrating how each EU Member State wants to achieve the agreed targets are an important tool in this context."
"We need to see the overall picture but also a country-by-country mosaic."
"Since Monterrey, the European Union has also achieved progress on its other commitments."
"The aim of the Doha Conference is to assess progress made, reaffirm commitments, identify obstacles, but also find ways to overcome these obstacles."
"It should also be about new challenges, for example climate change and high and volatile food, fuel and commodity prices in the light of the global economic downturn and even financial crisis."
"The Commission hopes that at Doha the international community will reconfirm the global partnership on financing for development based on shared responsibilities between developed and developing countries."
"Therefore it is not one way, but a two-way process."
"Doha should lead to an action-oriented forward-looking outcome that facilitates an effective implementation of the Monterrey Consensus in all its dimensions, including mobilising domestic resources, foreign direct investment for development, international trade, external debt of developing countries, financial and technical cooperation and global governance."
"The report that you are going to adopt tackles a number of the issues at stake and provides a welcome contribution to the international debate."
"Thank you for your report and for your attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."

"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Berman for his excellent report, which sums up well the direction that EU development policy is taking: development has taken place, but there is still a lot to do."
"Very recently, the EU published a research paper called Millennium Development Goals at Midpoint, which looked at the implementation of the Millennium Goals and the Union's role in achieving them."
"The report concluded that there had been positive development but also areas that needed improving."
"The EU is the world's largest donor of development aid, accounting for 60% in all."
"In 2006 the EU reached its official target to channel 0.31% of its combined GNP into development aid."
"Despite achieving its 2006 target, the amount of aid is insufficient and forecasts for 2007 show that it is decreasing alarmingly."
"Most of the EU countries have not increased the amount of development aid they have donated in the previous year, and in some countries that amount has actually fallen by more than 100%."
"The EU countries, which committed to the Millennium Development Goals, therefore have much to improve on."
"According to the EU targets set, the percentage figure for aid needs to rise to 0.7% of GNP by the year 2015."
"Development problems and poverty will not be automatically eliminated with the 0.7%: there is an urgent need for planning, structure and monitoring."
"Without cash, however, nothing will happen and it is crucially important that we keep to this goal and our promise."
"Internal Market Scoreboard (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Charlotte CederschiÃ¶ld, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Internal Market Scoreboard."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I am extremely glad to note that great progress has been made since we adopted our internal market report in committee."
"The new Internal Market Scoreboard, presented in July, showed that the Member States had achieved their best result ever as regards transposing internal market rules in national legislation."
"The target set by the Heads of State and Government of an average 1% transposition deficit has been met, and we have a winner with 0% transposition delay: Bulgaria."
"Well done!"
"Let us hope that this positive trend will continue and that our citizens will in future enjoy the full benefit of our internal market."
"We must place greater emphasis on correct implementation."
"In our report we urge members of the European Parliament and the Commission to include new and more sophisticated tools and indicators that provide more information in depth, in order to give the public means of measuring and making good the losses which they and industry incur because the Member State Governments do not always do what they are supposed to do on time or in the correct manner."
"In particular, we must develop the monitoring and assessment of implementation in such a way as to coincide with the national implementation process."
"For everyone stands to gain if legal proceedings can be avoided in this way. We must find ways of avoiding infringement cases to begin with and, should they go to court, of speeding them up."
"Through implementation working groups and networks, differences in implementation and unnecessary 'gold plating' can be avoided. With the aid of an efficient SOLVIT and sectoral reviews by the Commission, any remaining problems can be detected at an early stage."
"SOLVIT is an instrument that should and will gain in strength."
"One of the major issues under discussion here in Parliament has been the link with the Consumer Markets Scoreboard."
"I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise here and now that we should not press ahead with any decision at this stage."
"As we have noted, the Internal Market Scoreboard performs its function as a means of exerting pressure and there is still considerable development potential."
"Furthermore, it is appropriate to let the two grow separately, so that each one develops its own qualities."
"After that, we can examine whether it would be worthwhile, as may well prove to be the case, to merge them."
"After all, the Consumer Markets Scoreboard is still a very immature product, whereas its counterpart for the internal market already performs a major role in promoting harmonised EC legislation."
"Despite its power in that respect, the Member States are very positively disposed towards it."
"In other words, it is an extremely effective instrument which we must retain, but perhaps also transpose to other sectors further down the line."
"I must also mention the sectors in which the worst problems arise."
"They are environment, taxation, customs, energy and transport."
"Here I believe we should try new models and perhaps take up the model of the Services Directive, where implementation calls for extremely close cooperation with the Commission."
"That is to be recommended."
"I hope that there will be more opportunities to discuss this immensely important subject in the future in a yearly Internal Market Forum, and through strengthened networks, administrative cooperation arrangements and perhaps a new Internal Market Council in the Council of Ministers;"
"I would appreciate that."
"Regular updating is after all a method which helps to develop this field."
"I would like to thank all who have contributed to the work on this matter, for I am convinced that what we have done will lay the basis for EU cooperation in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The quality of Community legislation and its timely implementation are vital to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Correct transposition and application of internal market directives have implications for competitiveness and the economic and social balance within the EU."
"For example, the Construction Products Directive that we should replace with a regulation on which I am currently working as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group was transposed in such a way that CE marking is voluntary in four Member States and compulsory in others."
"This situation creates huge problems for the production sector."
"Unclear provisions and incorrect implementation of secondary legislation often ends in proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"In my opinion, establishing single points of contact where European citizens can get assistance with all legal and practical matters when moving within the internal market is a very important step."
"In an open and competitive internal market, better targeted and more stringent tools are needed to improve the fight against counterfeiting and piracy."
"Please note that my colleagues and I prepared the Written Declaration 67/2008 in order to draw attention to the counterfeiting and piracy that pose a growing threat to European economy, employment and creativity."
"Our priority must be the protection of consumers who often unwittingly purchase a counterfeit product believing it to be the genuine article and who, in so doing, may endanger their health and safety."
"Improving the quality of teacher education (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Maria Badia i Cutchet, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on improving the quality of teacher education."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Commissioner, I believe we can agree that adopting a report on such a current, key topic as the quality of teacher education is good news, given that the aim of teacher education is in fact quite simply to improve pupils' education and give them knowledge which provides them with intellectual maturity and a critical mindset while at the same time providing them with the skills necessary to be able to participate in a society which is increasingly competitive and demanding."
"This is a concern shared by many stakeholders, from pupils to their parents, the teaching profession and business leaders among others."
"In Europe there are currently over six million teachers performing this key role in developing the knowledge and skills of society's young people and making a decisive contribution to improving the opportunities for economic growth and greater competitiveness."
"Current working conditions in this sector are more complex and more demanding: classrooms are more heterogeneous from the social and cultural point of view, teaching concentrates on individual learning, teachers have gone from being ex-cathedra trainers to being classroom managers; there is a requirement to have a good knowledge of foreign languages and information and communications technologies (known as ICT), not only as a means of transmitting knowledge but to be able to use them as a teaching tool."
"The data available to us show that there are shortcomings in teaching quality; this is in line with the increased complexity of the profession mentioned above, and it makes greater investment in teacher education crucial during both initial training and in-service training, and highlights the need for greater support in the first years of a teaching career."
"There is also a whole range of related issues which should be taken into consideration: considerable differences in salaries between countries, and differences relative to average wages within the same country, a high proportion of older workers, demotivating working conditions in some cases, low numbers of people wanting to enter the profession, etc."
"This is the context in which this report was written."
"It proposes various recommendations which I shall now summarise:"
"First, we need to attract better candidates into the profession, a factor which is closely linked to improved status in society and the remuneration of the teaching profession."
"This involves improving the working conditions of the teaching profession by formulating proposals to support teachers in their first years in the job; young teachers could gain from the knowledge of older teachers, who could reduce their contact hours with pupils and spend more time in applied research and transfer of knowledge."
"It also involves investing in initial and in-service education for teachers, making university education compatible with professional development and facilitating improved qualifications and skills for existing teaching staff."
"Thirdly, encouraging the exchange of good practice by enhancing mobility programmes, especially under the Comenius programme, which also contributes positively to the updating of language skills."
"Fourthly, promoting decision-making at school level; in other words, greater autonomy bearing in mind the different backgrounds of each school and the various stakeholders involved in each school community: parents, local cultural amenities, etc."
"Commissioner, this report, in accordance with the provisions of Article 149 of the Treaty on the Union on education and training, will not be binding on the Governments of the Member States."
"It is nonetheless a resolution to which regard should definitely be had."
"Key issues such as those surrounding education are also closely related to the values of the Europe of the future and European citizenship, and I therefore ask the Commission to support this report from the Committee on Culture and to do its utmost to defend the proposals it contains to the Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in our conversations we often note the importance of thinking about the kind of country we are going to leave to our children. We should also think about the kind of citizens we are going to leave to our countries, and that is an area in which education has a crucial part to play."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, distinguished Members of Parliament, I warmly welcome this report, especially as I am the Commissioner responsible for education."
"I would like to thank Mrs Maria Badia i Cutchet and the Committee on Culture and Education for their work."
"Like you, the Commission believes that all Member States face significant challenges as they seek to improve their educational and training systems, especially vis-Ã -vis higher quality."
"We have talked repeatedly - and I remind you again - of the importance of key competences as well as equity and efficiency in our systems."
"These challenges cannot be met or reflected in a full sense without a high quality in the teaching profession, which is key to all of this."
"The quality of teachers is the critical factor for the modernisation of our education system and the achievement of equity and efficiency."
"Without such teachers, it is difficult to achieve any improvement."
"The particular challenges faced by teachers are increasing as economic, social and educational contexts become more complex and schools and classrooms become more heterogeneous and more diverse."
"In the debate on the first report this evening we spoke of creativity and innovation."
"We can only achieve higher creativity and innovation in pupils if we have creative and innovative teachers in our schools."
"We need to attract the very best candidates into the teaching profession."
"We need to give them the best possible preparation for their career and - most importantly - we need to continue training and developing all our teachers throughout their careers."
"This is - as you said, Mrs Badia i Cutchet - about the recruitment and salaries of teachers."
"Every teacher must also be an autonomous learner, constantly reflecting on the way she or he teaches, learning from her or his peers and seeking new ways to develop knowledge and skills and to meet the individual needs of pupils."
"Every teacher must also be a lifelong learner."
"He or she cannot teach lifelong learning if he or she is not a lifelong learner."
"An initial education of three or four years can never be enough to equip a teacher for a lifetime of teaching."
"Only if teachers continue to learn can they keep up to date and provide learning that is truly relevant to their pupils."
"I was very pleased to note that there is such a large consensus on these issues - as indeed there was in the Council among Ministers last November."
"We must now work to build on these good intentions and this consensus to put in place real improvements in teacher education."
"We need to encourage Member States to invest more in developing their teaching staff."
"Three or four days of in-service training per year is simply not enough."
"Induction support for new teachers also needs to be improved and extended."
"We need to encourage Member States to improve the quality of in-service training and ensure that it provides the kinds of practical teaching skills that teachers really need today and tomorrow."
"We need to promote school leadership."
"Schools these days are major organisations affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people."
"They need to be well-administered and well-managed, but most of all they need to be well-led by a leadership team with a clear vision of high quality education for all of its pupils."
"Thank you once again for your report and your commitment."
"I look forward to continuing not only our discussions, but especially our cooperation on this important issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The report was based on the European Commission's communication 'Improving the Quality of Teacher Education' (SEC(2007)0931) and stresses the need for the Member States to reform the national education systems in order to improve teachers' training."
"The rapporteur has pointed out some very important facts such as the difficulty of keeping the best candidates for the teaching profession, the low payment of teachers in many countries, the poor social status of teachers, teachers' low level in foreign language learning and many more."
"In order to solve these problems, we should have a coherent, complex and complete strategy all over the EU."
"We should have more training programmes for teachers, and these programmes should be structured in such a way that the qualifications obtained in the end are recognised in all the Member States."
"In order to achieve this, we need to share the responsibility with the national governments, as we may have the desire but they have the competence to reform the education system."
"I hope this report will be the first step in a long process that will end with a real improvement of the quality of teachers' education across the European Union."
"in writing. - European Roma have been subjected to low-quality education in the form of segregated education and gypsy-only classrooms, not only in the post-communist countries but in Europe as a whole."
"Roma children encounter difficulties in receiving quality education in new and old Member States alike."
"Geographical segregation of Roma is a major obstacle to equality in education."
"The living conditions of Roma make it difficult to take the steps necessary in the long battle to eliminate gypsy-only classrooms."
"Making progress on this fight depends on highly-qualified teachers from Roma and non-Roma backgrounds to ensure the essential development of Roma children and to change the status quo."
"Providing highly-qualified teachers to give Roma children the challenges found in mainstream schools is of huge relevance to the education future teachers receive in teacher-training colleges."
"If we are to expect results from our children we must provide our teachers with exemplary training."
"The knowledge about progressive teachings in multiculturally diverse classrooms must be a main focus in future teacher training."
"The goal of equalising the quality of education between schools, stopping early drop-outs, and making sure Roma children make it to university and that they are prepared to face life's challenges is not one taken lightly but one we must endeavour to fight for."
"The Bologna Process and student mobility (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the Bologna Process and student mobility."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do hope the fact that we are once again meeting in camera this evening does not imply anything about our basic attitude to education."
"The Bologna Process is truly the most radical reform of higher education in recent years."
"The flow of knowledge should surely not stop at national boundaries any more in this day and age."
"This is why it is also essentially gratifying that the Member States and the universities are prepared to work together on this matter, regardless of the subsidiarity principle they always prize so highly."
"I welcome that, but I also note that all the parliaments have been bypassed in this matter."
"The European Parliament was not contacted, nor were any of the 46 national parliaments."
"The galling thing is that we Members of Parliament are constantly being asked out there about this Bologna Process."
"If anything goes wrong, the finger is pointed at us, yet we have nothing at all to do with it; not even the Commission has had anything to do with it."
"I am glad to say that the Commission is now on board and is helping to get this Bologna Process off the ground in the framework of our educational programmes with which you will be familiar."
"In short, the labour pains were difficult, and they are not yet over."
"It would have been wise to involve the parliaments."
"By 2010 we want to create a European area of higher education."
"That goes without saying."
"Students must have a broad spectrum of choice, a wide range of high-quality courses."
"To this end, the Bologna Process envisages three priority areas for action: the introduction of the three-cycle system of bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and doctorates, quality assurance and recognition of qualifications and periods of study."
"Student mobility and high-quality education are supposed to be among the top priorities of the Bologna Process, but the process itself, and particularly the rushed introduction of bachelor's courses, has resulted - as we have learned from our hearings - that fewer students dare to spend any study time abroad during their bachelor's courses because these courses have been overladen with far too much learning material."
"Five years of university study cannot suddenly be packed into a three-year bachelor's degree course."
"That is what has been done in some cases."
"Then it emerges that students cannot get away at all, that studying abroad is out of the question."
"That is a pity."
"Erasmus is such a great programme, and the opportunities it offers, plus all other opportunities to go abroad, ought to be taken."
"In fact, a course involving mobility really ought to be made compulsory."
"In my view, the credit system is not working."
"It is not right that three credits should be awarded for a particular module in one country while another country awards only one."
"There must be a European framework within which everyone is treated equally."
"This is an area where more work is needed."
"I believe the theory is good, but it is not being applied particularly well."
"We should also ensure that universities do everything in their power to take advantage of funding opportunities in order to make it easier for students to exercise their mobility if they wish to do so."
"For many universities, this will mean coming out of their ivory towers and linking up with the business community."
"How many large companies would consider it an honour to sponsor a doctorate or master's course?"
"If it meant that a master's course had to bear the name of Mercedes or Sony or some other corporate brand, so be it!"
"The point is that the sponsorship money would help students."
"It is not a matter of selling anyone the right to stipulate the content of the curriculum but of locating sources of funding that really do enable anyone who is interested to study abroad."
"If we make progress towards the achievement of these goals with the aid of the Commission, we shall all be well content."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I especially want to thank Doris Pack again."
"She is one of the founding mothers of the lifelong learning programmes, which are very popular programmes for student mobility."
"This report on the Bologna Process and student mobility is a very concrete contribution towards even better and even more mobility."
"As we all know, the Bologna Process is well advanced and will soon have existed for a decade, having become continent-wide."
"It started because we had already had a mobility scheme, called Erasmus, since 1987, and most of its instruments became part of the Bologna Process."
"The two are mutually supportive and make a very important policy contribution."
"It is not just mobility for mobility's sake, but for modernisation and openness and the internationalisation of our universities."
"The report provides a very comprehensive overview of what further actions are needed in this field."
"Your conclusions are in line with the findings and recommendations of the special group I invited to work with the Commission, which was the high level expert forum led by former Minister Maria JoÃ£o Rodrigues, who reported to me in June this year."
"Both reports suggested we need substantial and concerted action to increase student mobility and, if I may add, mobility of young people in general: pupils; young people in training; young artists; and young entrepreneurs."
"I would like to see a mobility period introduced into all degree programmes to encourage students to go abroad, and for mobility to be seen as the standard rather than as a special case."
"I agree with you that the Bologna reforms should be used to open up our higher education systems, and not become new obstacles to mobility."
"Your ideas on flexible formats for courses in some study areas would be compatible with the Bologna rules and deserve to be explored."
"I also agree that we should invest better and more, which means more effectively, in the mobility of our citizens."
"We need to combine public, private, national and European funds."
"I welcome the suggestion that 'strengthening the financial envelope provided for the programmes in the field of education and notably for Erasmus grants could be considered.'"
"That would be very beneficial not only for education but also, for example, for citizenship - to feel like Europeans in Europe, and to have access and opportunity and a real experience of Europe."
"I am sure that Parliament will take its responsibility in full in this respect."
"Once again I offer my congratulations and thanks and recommend adoption of this report to the House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) I welcome this report and the sound recommendations it contains regarding the effective implementation of the Bologna objectives and the creation of a European space for higher education by 2010."
"This year, it is important to analyse existing obstacles as well as the opportunities for strengthening this process in the future, after 2010."
"I would like to emphasise two of the many proposals in the report, due to their major importance."
"First of all, greater effort should be made to harmonise national education systems, to complete mutual recognition of qualifications and the equivalence of degrees."
"I believe that persisting diferences in this field constitute the main obstacle to the equal treatment of students. ."
"Secondly, I would like to draw the attention of all European institutions to the fact that mobility is still something inaccessible to many students, researchers and teaching staff, particularly those from new Member States, due to insufficient grants."
"Consequently, the appropriate funding of projects in the new Member States is a priority."
"Only in this way can the objective of European mobility be accomplished in a coherent and balanced manner.."
"in writing. - (RO) Young people, especially students, are a priority in my political agenda, and I can only welcome the adoption of Mrs. Pack's report on the Bologna process and the mobility of youth."
"I believe that the principle of reciprocity in the exchange of students and scholarships, as well as the setting up of a European framework for the quality and recognition of degrees, must remain two priority aspects of this policy, all the more so as a reduced level of mobility of students towards the new Member States has been noticed."
"The exchange of good practice between the Member States is a highly effective way of improving the European mobility framework; therefore, it needs to be constantly supported and extended."
"The social side of this report, shown in its concern for young people coming from disadvantaged environments, is commendable."
"Other considerations aside, we must promote quality and excellence, both among students and among teaching staff, and this can only be done with constant support, both in terms of politics and of investment, for mobility within the education system; this support should be both national and European."
"in writing. - (RO) I would like to tackle the social dimension of mobility, which is extremely important: it provides young people with an extremely rich experience in terms of academic, cultural and social diversity, and this is why I would like to congratulate Mrs. Pack on this report."
"As a Romanian MEP, I proposed the amendment that students from all Member States should receive a single European student card."
"I believe that the single card will encourage the mobility of young people throughout Europe, which will lead to the exchange of ideas and implicitly to a change of mentalities, to opening up towards other cultures, stimulating creativity and the capacity for innovation."
"From my point of view, this measure is perfectly in line with both the objectives of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, 2008, and with the objectives of the European Year of Creativity and Innovation, 2009."
"Hill and mountain farming (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Michl Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the situation and outlook for hill and mountain farming."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to express my pleasure at the fact that the Commissioner is also dealing with this issue, and I hope this will be reflected not only in his brief address but also in the work of the Commission, because we naturally have a duty to ensure that the actions of the European Commission duly reflect our wishes and ideas."
"Anyone reading the title of my report, or rather the report of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which adopted it unanimously, namely 'Report on the situation and outlook for hill and mountain farming', must realise that it represents only part of the actual content of the report."
"This report says that we must formulate a policy for areas that cover up to half of the entire territory of some Member States, such as Austria, Italy and Spain, and more than a third of the territory of other Member States, for areas that are home to a total of 19% of the EU population."
"These are areas that may be described as uniquely disadvantaged in many aspects of farming and rural life and extremely vulnerable."
"The Alps, for example, feel the impact of global warming far more acutely than lowland regions."
"Mountainous areas are disadvantaged in many respects as a result of steep slopes, weather conditions, erosion, height differences, high altitudes and rocky terrain."
"For this reason we need an overall strategy for these areas and not only an agricultural policy which has borne fruit and needs to be nurtured but which is not sufficient to deal with the problems affecting mountainous regions."
"Old proven recipes therefore need to be preserved, but old and new recipes must be combined if agriculture is to be maintained as the lifeblood of mountainous areas, and other major factors must also be incorporated into this approach, namely a wide range of sustainable uses of natural resources, the creation and improvement of transport networks - not only physical transport but also Internet access and communications networks - the improvement and development of municipal and local services - which is made all the more difficult in these areas by the dispersed settlement pattern - and reinforcement of the social fabric."
"New features must be added, such as a sharper focus on basic and continuing training, sensitivity to biodiversity in the landscape and the aforementioned adaptation to climate change."
"This report, which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted unanimously, devotes 13 recitals and 72 paragraphs to these matters."
"The aim is to develop a framework strategy on the basis of the existing sectoral efforts."
"For this reason, the report calls on the European Commission to develop an integrated strategy with a wide range of instruments within six months in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and in harmony with the Member States' national action plans."
"I hope that the Chamber will give its assent in the same way as the Committee, and I ask the Commissioner to make our case to the Commission and to remind it that the contribution of the inhabitants of mountainous areas is made on behalf of the entire population and benefits them accordingly and should therefore be duly acknowledged."
"It is a contribution to the environment and to the value of our continent as a tourist destination, a contribution that must be taken into account because it serves as a guarantee against depopulation in regions such as Piedmont and Lombardy and parts of France and Spain."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) Farming in mountain areas is a crucial factor in both local economic development and environmental protection (e.g. combating climate change, biodiversity, provision of open and secure recreational and tourism areas)."
"The specific disadvantages connected to altitude, topography and climate that face mountain farmers justify compensatory payments to offset the natural disadvantages and direct income support to offset their additional production costs and the growing role of managing their local area."
"In my view, the key issues are as follows: to avoid full decoupling of agricultural aid in the stockfarming sector, as it risks leading to job losses; to support the dairy sector, for it plays a central part in disadvantaged areas; to increase support for the settlement of young farmers; and to encourage solidarity between upstream and downstream in regard to water management."
"I am also in favour of establishing a genuine integrated European strategy for mountain areas, to ensure that the specific features of mountain areas are taken into account in the formulation of the various European policies."
"in writing. - (PL) The European Parliament report on the situation and outlook for hill and mountain farming is right to oblige the European Commission to present a strategy for hill and mountain areas within six months."
"This is a real step towards considering the special conditions in which 19% of all EU citizens live and work."
"The European Parliament proposal relating to the everyday problems of the people living in the Polish Podhale region deserves our support."
"So far, guidelines for hill and mountain areas were based, in law, solely on agricultural policies."
"This report also emphasises the need to support agriculture through compensatory payments and through support for high-quality products."
"However, hill and mountain areas have many other problems in which the EU should get involved, as they include a wide spectrum of economic, social and quality of life issues."
"For this reason it is very good that the report speaks of the problems relating to access to transport networks and to the Internet."
"In addition, communities should be supported both financially and by specific solutions on the regional level, in order to improve the level of communal services."
"At the same time we must remember the importance of the 'hill people' in protecting national traditions as well as traditional knowledge of the natural environment."
"The significance of permanent social structures and the needs of sustainable use of the environment are deserving of special emphasis."
"In this context, the Podhale region is without doubt the best example of good practice."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me congratulate Mr Ebner on his report."
"Hill and mountain regions are particularly important in the EU because they cover more than 50% of the territory of some Member States, whose rural population is still a significant component."
"The specific physical characteristics of such regions (steep slopes, differences in elevation) put them at a disadvantage compared with other EU regions."
"The difficult conditions for agricultural production, high transport costs, inadequate transport and communications networks, as well as the cost of transporting people and services, affect the economy and everyday living conditions of citizens living in hill and mountain areas."
"On the other hand, producers in those regions are known for their quality agricultural products and for their experience in the sustainable exploitation of forest and pastureland."
"These characteristics should therefore be strengthened and exploited to reinforce their competitiveness and cultural identity."
"A strategy is therefore needed to take account of the specific features of the regions in question, and to help new challenges, develop alternative forms of employment and maintain the population."
"Such a strategy should also provide special care for stricken regions, such hills and mountains ravaged by fire."
"in writing. - In my opinion, people in small and isolated rural communities, and especially in mountainous areas, are disadvantaged and confronted with constraints and difficulties in everyday life."
"Their needs should be high on our list of priorities, as basic necessities, such as access to services, are often lacking."
"They are under constant pressure from daily financial and practical problems, which create feelings of anxiety."
"Looking at the situation in my country, Bulgaria, I would say that predominantly the basic human needs seem to occupy the minds of the majority of rural inhabitants."
"Therefore, long-term development strategies are often lacking."
"Further, it becomes clear that rural policies still lag behind and do not correspond to the reality in rural areas."
"Regional and rural development policies and measures should be decentralised in order to be adapted to local conditions."
"Thus, there is the need to develop concrete, flexible and tailored regional and local programmes for employment and social benefits."
"We thus need to focus on human resources development and capacity building, with a special focus on young people, women, and minorities; and on the development of more rational policies in small and remote villages, taking into account the existing local natural and human resources as well as people's needs."
"in writing. - (DE) This report contains every conceivable thing; it is a veritable patchwork, reminiscent of the result of a rapid brainstorming session on agriculture and mountainous areas."
"It is a catalogue of wishes and demands, couched in empty words and platitudes, with repetitions and contradictions, and it cannot be endorsed, even if something can be found in it to please everyone."
"The greatest contradiction is to be found between the environmental and social window dressing and the ruthless policies pursued by Michl Ebner and his party on a daily basis."
"A genuinely sustainable approach to farming and food production must be at the heart of any viable European agriculture policy."
"Anyone who destroys water, soil and biodiversity must foot the bill in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle."
"What we need to encourage is a form of agriculture that truly protects the climate and seeks to market a diverse range of healthy consumer products."
"Organic farming must be brought out of its niche into the mainstream."
"We Greens do not support a policy of subsidising the major players in the global market."
"We want to strengthen local and regional food markets, to ensure that farmers can earn a decent income and to guarantee consumers fresh and healthy food."
"This form of management is also the best way to protect the agricultural landscape and the environment."
"in writing. - (FR) The Ebner report on the situation and outlook for hill and mountain farming highlights the features and needs of these regions, which make up 40% of the territory of Europe."
"These regions face natural difficulties, which makes production more difficult and restricts access."
"They therefore deserve special attention."
"I therefore call on the Commission to draw up a global plan based on continuity with the measures taken to date while also integrating them among themselves in order to make them more effective."
"That would mean continuing to make compensatory payments to offset natural disadvantages, giving financial support to young farmers and attaching special importance to the dairy sector."
"Human activity needs to be maintained in 'Natura 2000' mountain areas."
"Lastly, emphasis must be placed on the role of hunting and fishing in land maintenance."
"A strategy of that kind will enable these regions to meet the challenges of competitiveness and sustainable development, for they are not just potential sources of economic growth but also the guardians of traditions that produce quality and contribute to preserving our landscapes."
", in writing. - (RO) Mountain regions constitute a major part of the European Union; and what is more, traditions, culture and language are preserved much better in these areas compared to any other regions in the 27 Member States."
"Unfortunately, national governments are not implementing integrated regional development strategies, and there are major gaps which are leading, slowly but steadily, to the depopulation of these regions."
"Starting from the Union's motto of âUnity in diversityâ, I welcome the Parliament's decision to ask the Commission to draw up an integrated strategy for the sustainable development and use of mountain resources, thus giving equal opportunities to European citizens who choose to live in the more difficult conditions of mountain areas."
"Given the current talks on the decoupling of payments in mountain areas, I believe that it is our obligation as Members of Parliament to lobby for the continuation of financial support to mountain areas."
"Thus, mountainous areas will become protected areas, capable of ensuring their own sustainable development and of acting as an oasis for European and international tourists."
"in writing. - (RO) Mountains cover one third of the area of the country that I represent, Romania, and the inhabitants of mountain areas are disadvantaged compared to other people living in rural areas."
"The proposals contained in the Ebner report are welcome and I strongly believe that a coherent EU strategy on mountain areas, which is essential and urgent, would contribute to a great extent to an improvement in living conditions in these areas."
"At the same time, I would like to stress that better regulations are required, with equal urgency, as regards community funding for rural development."
"For instance, Romanian authorities have launched various EAFRD-funded programmes supporting small enterprises and tourism."
"Small enterprises and boarding houses are particularly important for boosting mountain areas."
"The guides for applicants for these measures, involving complex paperwork, were made public one day before the launch of the session, although they had been written in August."
"This is a clear breach of the principle of providing fair and transparent information to potential beneficiaries."
"I believe that EU legislation should provide for the avoidance of such situations, which render the EU's financial effort useless."
"Mountain areas can provide high-quality agricultural produce and add to the diversity of agricultural products in the European market."
"Consequently, greater coordination of rural development and structural support is needed."
"Sustainable, modernised and multicultural agriculture is necessary in mountain areas."
"Exploitation of biomass and agri-tourism increase the incomes of local people."
"Preserving certain animal and vegetable species, upholding traditions and especially fostering tourist activities help to combat climate change by protecting biodiversity and capturing CO2 through permanent grassland and forests."
"Sustainable forestry exploitation will make it possible to produce energy using wood residues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to stress the importance of the issue of water management in mountain areas."
"It is important that the Commission encourages local and regional authorities to develop all-round solidarity between upstream and downstream users and that it uses appropriate funding to support the sustainable use of water resources in these areas."
"These regions are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change."
"Consequently, it is important to promote the immediate implementation of measures to provide protection against natural disasters, in particular forest fires, in these regions."
"I am convinced that mountain regions require new means of protecting their territory against flooding, with an emphasis on flood prevention, whilst farmers and foresters can support anti-flooding preventive measures by means of the direct area-related payments which they receive under the common agricultural policy."
"in writing. - (RO) We welcome Mr. Ebner's report."
"Mountains account for 33% of Romania's surface area."
"As in other European countries, mountain areas are at risk of being depopulated and devoid of specific economic activities."
"We need an integrated European strategy for the sustainable development of mountain areas."
"We ask for particular emphasis on supporting agriculture, ecological products, agro-tourism, and access and communication means in mountain area."
"At the same time, we insist that young families should be encouraged to start agro-tourism farms, with a view to reviving the economic potential of the area."
"in writing. - (BG) As a representative of a Member State with distinct problems in the sphere of agriculture, and especially in hill and mountain farming, I would like to express my support for Mr Ebner's report regarding the state and prospects of farming in such areas, which is of special importance for us."
"In Bulgaria, as the report emphasizes, there is a risk of depopulation and an impoverishment of the social life of local communities, which are also facing the threat of even a discontinuation of farming."
"The common policies for farm support are hardly applicable to such areas (e.g. the requirement for a minimum number of animals)."
"Therefore, there is a need of special financial assistance for milk producers, as well as concrete additional financial measures, which should be adopted in implementation of the proposals contained in the report."
"Only thus can the animal genetic resources be preserved, along with the human resources and, on the whole, the uniqueness of these areas, considering their extraordinary importance for particular Member States as well as for the EU at large."
"This will boost the other sector policies as well, in environmental protection, tourism, small and medium-sized undertakings, and education."
"I therefore insist on the laying down of common rules for schemes of direct assistance within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy and for the establishment of special assistance schemes for mountain areas."

"Combating terrorism - Protection of personal data (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mrs LefranÃ§ois, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision amending Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA on combating terrorism - C6-0466/2007 - and"
"the report by Mrs Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (renewed consultation) (16069/2007 - C6-0010/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, before anything else, I would like to thank all my fellow Members who have worked with me on this dossier, because our cooperation has been truly excellent throughout the procedure."
"The text we will be voting on today is a particularly sensitive one because talking about combating terrorism spells danger for the rights of European citizens, whether this danger comes from the terrorists themselves or from the freedom-destroying potential of the measures adopted to combat the problem."
"The scale of the terrorist threat has indeed had the potential to be exaggerated in recent years by certain governments in order to justify the adoption of security policies, whether domestic or international."
"The threat is nevertheless real and the European Union must play its part in the efforts made to prevent and combat it as resolutely as possible."
"The security of its 500 million inhabitants and the defence of the essential values and principles on which it is founded depend on this."
"Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, EU territory has itself been the target of terrorist attacks on a number of occasions, with dramatic consequences, as we are all aware: in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005."
"You will all have heard of the wave of attacks that took place only yesterday in Cantabria."
"The increasingly sophisticated and diverse tools and methods used by terrorists make the task much more difficult."
"The development of information and communication technologies, particularly the Internet, makes it easier to organise terrorist networks and spread propaganda or even training manuals online."
"There are currently believed to be around 5 000 websites of this kind. Hence the European Commission's entirely legitimate wish to adapt Community legislation to try to prevent not only actual terrorist attacks, but also the preparations for these attacks."
"In order to do this, it has drawn direct inspiration from the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism."
"The problem is that it has chosen to take up only the repressive aspects, ignoring the provisions relating to the protection of fundamental freedoms, which constitute the essential counterweight, according to the Council of Europe."
"My concerns were mainly linked to the concept of 'public provocation' and the risk this poses to freedom of expression because, by criminalising this, things people say or write that are alleged to have led to an act of terrorism, or are simply likely to do so, will be punishable."
"At the round table organised in April in collaboration with national parliaments, we noted that we were not alone in expressing reservations about certain aspects of the Commission's text."
"Several national parliaments expressed doubts about the application of this framework decision and the scope of the concept of 'public provocation'."
"The Council of Europe also highlighted the danger of leaving out safeguard clauses."
"Finally, within the framework of various studies, independent experts expressed their reservations, particularly about the definition of 'public provocation' and about the level of legal certainty of the text."
"Under the impetus of a handful of national delegations particularly concerned about the protection of fundamental rights, the Council itself added a number of safeguards to the text of the framework decision."
"On one or two specific points, however, it also proposed the tightening up of the framework decision and, in any case, work was still needed to reach an entirely satisfactory level of legal certainty and protection of freedoms."
"With our fellow Members from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we have therefore tried to find a balance between these two apparently opposite but fundamentally inseparable objectives, namely the fight against terrorism and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms."
"In order to do this, we have had to perform a delicate balancing act, all the more so because it is sometimes difficult in practice to work out where freedom of expression ends and the violation of people's rights begins."
"Think about the outrage caused two years ago by those Danish cartoons, or more recently by the controversy aroused by the short film on Islam by Dutch MP Geert Wilders."
"Having said that, I believe that the compromise we have reached is a good one."
"The principal changes we have made are as follows: firstly, the replacement of the term 'provocation' with the term 'incitement', which is more precise and is used more frequently in legal language; secondly, a stricter definition of 'public incitement', which more clearly delineates the behaviour to be criminalised and therefore prevents any abuses that would lead to the restriction of freedom of expression; thirdly, the incorporation into the text of many provisions relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and, in particular, freedom of expression and freedom of the press; fourthly, a reminder of the need to guarantee that the measures taken are proportionate to the aims pursued, which is essential in a democratic, non-discriminatory society."
"Those are the main points of this dossier."
"I am delighted that this subject was chosen as the priority for this morning's plenary and I am looking forward to a rich and lively debate."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that today we are holding a joint debate on the report by my colleague Mrs LefranÃ§ois on combating terrorism and my own report on the protection of personal data processed within the framework of police and judicial cooperation."
"It should be remembered that the fight against terrorism cannot really be effective and proportionate unless we guarantee that the fundamental rights of each citizen are strengthened."
"We must use our fundamental values of respect for fundamental rights to combat the terrorist movements that threaten our democratic societies."
"In my view, the Commission's proposal on combating terrorism was unbalanced because it simply strengthened security while neglecting many measures to protect fundamental freedoms."
"In this regard, I congratulate Mrs LefranÃ§ois and her colleagues once again for their rebalancing of the text to ensure that it safeguards respect for human rights and freedoms."
"Terrorist networks, as we know, increasingly make use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for their incitement and recruitment activities."
"Surveillance of this type of activity on the Internet requires the collection of a large amount of personal data, but collection must take place with the guarantee of a high level of protection for this personal data."
"I would like to remind the Council of the commitments it made when adopting the Directive on the retention of data."
"At the time, we expressed our wish that valuable information for combating terrorism could indeed be used."
"In exchange, the Council has a duty to honour its commitment and adopt a framework decision on the protection of personal data that offers a high level of protection."
"My warmest thanks go to all my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and to everyone who worked with me, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, because the amendments we are proposing in my report were approved unanimously in committee."
"These amendments are proof that we will not put up with harmonisation to the lowest common denominator."
"We believe that the scope of the framework decision should be broad so that it is not limited solely to data exchanged between the Member States."
"It must also apply to data processed at national level, which would enable cooperation between the Member States' various police and judicial authorities to be strengthened while guaranteeing an equivalent level of data protection throughout the European Union."
"The principles of purpose limitation and proportionality need to be guaranteed by specifying and restricting the cases where data can be processed further."
"You must realise how essential this is!"
"Data must not be used for a purpose other than that for which it was collected."
"We do not wish to prohibit all transfers of data to third countries, since such transfers may prove necessary as part of the fight against terrorism."
"However, for each transfer, an assessment must be made of whether the third country in question is providing an adequate level of protection of personal data, and I would underline the fact that this assessment must be made by an independent authority."
"We are asking the Council to include, in the framework decision, provisions concerning national authorities that have access to data collected by private parties, in accordance - may I remind you again - with the commitments made following the adoption of the 'Data Retention Directive' by the British Presidency."
"Finally, the use of sensitive data, such as data relating to political opinions, religious beliefs, health or sex life must, as a matter of principle, be prohibited, contrary to what is currently proposed in the framework decision."
"You will notice that, with its amendment, the European Parliament is overturning the Council's proposal, which permits the processing of these data under certain conditions."
"On the contrary, Parliament wants the processing of these data prohibited, while providing for exceptions."
"The process has been totally reversed, and this is important to us."
"By adopting this position, the European Parliament wishes to respect people's dignity, and we think that the Council should be able to agree with us on this necessity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Deprez, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, this is a day for the French, and it is also my day: I would ask you to kindly excuse the unexpected absence of Rachida Dati, but it is an honour for me to participate once again in the work of your Parliament, particularly on the sensitive subjects that have just been spoken about."
"I would particularly like to express the gratitude of the Council Presidency to Mrs Roure and Mrs LefranÃ§ois for the personal commitment they have demonstrated and the interest they are showing in the issues of combating terrorism and the protection of data."
"With these two texts, Parliament now has a firm grip on current developments and the everyday life of European society."
"We need to protect our citizens from terrorist threats, and we also need to safeguard their private lives and privacy."
"That is political responsibility in its noblest sense."
"I would like to respond to several points regarding the two reports just presented."
"First of all, with regard to the draft framework decision on combating terrorism, combating terrorism is a challenge for the European Union that requires the pooling of all our efforts."
"Mr de Kerchove, EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, whom I met several weeks ago, has also told this Parliament that the activity of Al-Qaeda, for example, is particularly worrying."
"There were 583 terrorist attacks on European soil in 2007."
"The framework decision you are looking at today is therefore a major legislative step forward in combating the spread of terrorist techniques."
"It is unacceptable, for example, that a website can explain how to make homemade bombs with complete impunity."
"Today there are nearly 5 000 websites contributing to the radicalisation of young people in Europe on these issues, and the Slovenian Presidency, as you know, managed to secure an agreement on these challenges at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 18 April."
"I welcome the report by Mrs LefranÃ§ois, who has supported the Council's objective of incorporating, in the framework decision of 13 June 2002, the offences provided for in the Council of Europe Convention. Her proposals largely tie up with the amendments made by the Council during the negotiations and, as you know, discussions within the Council on this text were very lively."
"Clearly we are in the midst of a classic debate for all democratic societies seeking to combat terrorism effectively while respecting the fundamental rules of the rule of law and fundamental principles, such as freedom of expression, that govern all democratic life."
"I would like to draw your attention to two points."
"Firstly, this framework decision aims to make criminal offences of three types of behaviour likely to occur before attacks are actually perpetrated: public provocation to terrorism - and I stress the word 'public', which thus excludes the regulation of private exchanges of correspondence - training for terrorism, and finally recruitment for terrorism."
"It would create offences for the European Union that Member States are already familiar with through the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, finalised in 2005."
"The definitions of these offences have been copied word for word in the framework decision, with a few limited changes for consistency with the concepts of 'terrorist offence' and 'terrorist group' that have existed in European law since 2002; hence, Mrs LefranÃ§ois, the term 'public provocation' instead of 'incitement', which you are proposing."
"The adoption of a text at European level will make it easier to control its transposition within the Member States and to apply it more quickly throughout EU territory."
"The second consideration is that the Council paid particular attention to respect for fundamental rights."
"This concern was expressed at the round table Parliament organised on 7 April this year."
"The Council was very aware of the discussions that had taken place in Parliament and was careful to follow the approach adopted in the Council of Europe."
"Safeguard clauses were added to the initial proposal - two in particular, regarding freedom of the press and freedom of expression on the one hand, and proportionality of the criminalisation of offences defined by national law on the other."
"It should also be noted that the Council did not retain the proposals aimed at introducing rules on extra-territorial jurisdiction, which your rapporteur did not approve of anyway."
"A concern for balance therefore motivated the Council during the negotiations, leading to a text that largely takes account of your concerns."
"Moving on now to the framework decision on the protection of personal data, presented by Mrs Roure - it is a fact that there is very little, or even no regulation of so-called 'sovereign' files, particularly as regards public security, as you pointed out, Mrs Roure."
"However, it is in this area that it is particularly important to manage and regulate data exchanges, with the aim of protecting public freedoms."
"You are right: we must act quickly and effectively, while respecting the rights of those whose data are exchanged, retained and stored."
"The Justice Ministers reached agreement on 8 November 2007 on a draft framework decision."
"As you yourself have pointed out, some of you in this Parliament would have liked to go further."
"The Presidency is aware of this, but the framework decision on which the Council secured unanimous agreement at the end of a debate lasting more than two years is a first step, providing the EU minimum standards for personal data within the framework of criminal cooperation, at a time when no common rules have ever existed within the framework of the third pillar."
"It is a compromise; that is how Europe is built, particularly in this area."
"It is a compromise, but that does not make it a second-rate decision."
"Rather, it is the best possible result today, as it fills a void and opens the way for further developments."
"It is the first step towards the regulation of data exchanges for legal purposes within the framework of the European Union, the application of which can be controlled much more effectively than within the Council of Europe."
"The transposition and application of this framework decision could be submitted to the Justice and Home Affairs Council for evaluation, as was the case, for example, with the European arrest warrant."
"Eventually, when our institutional framework has evolved - which we all hope will happen - it will be possible for infringement proceedings to be launched by the Commission, Vice-President."
"The question in Europe is often to know whether we are better with minimum standards that can be raised later on or whether we should stick with the status quo, which today means extremely varied standards of data protection, a lack of proper control by the European institutions, and bilateral negotiations on the exchange of data with third countries, which do not offer our citizens sufficient guarantees and can be performed without our consent."
"That is the case with the bilateral agreements made with the United States."
"Personally, I believe it is better to go forward rather than to maintain the status quo."
"In our view, the framework decision is the first vital step."
"Furthermore, the work done by previous Presidencies has basically enabled us to find points of balance that also take account of your concerns."
"I will mention a few of these, Mrs Roure."
"The first is that the future framework decision will indeed apply only to data exchanged between Member States, as you have pointed out, but the Member States have also made a commitment to adapt their own levels of protection."
"One clause you should look at is Article 27, strengthened by recital 8 of this framework decision, which invites the Commission to extend the scope of the text after a period of five years, and it could concern national data."
"As the Council Presidency, we do not see any drawbacks to this."
"The second is that all data exchanges are subject to the proportionality principle, which means it is possible to check, on a case-by-case basis, the purpose for which the data are being transferred and whether or not the volume of data being exchanged is greater than strictly necessary."
"The third is that the transfer of data to third countries is subject to important conditions and safeguards to provide an adequate level of protection."
"You are well aware that this provision has not gone unnoticed among some of our external partners, whose names I have mentioned."
"Article 14 is a bulwark that we can rely on to prevent the transfer to third countries, without our consent, of personal data we have transmitted to another Member State."
"It also gives us an assurance about the equivalence of the level of data protection in this other Member State."
"Fourthly and finally, the Member States have made a commitment to report on their national measures to the Commission, which will present its assessment and proposals for the modification of this first framework to Parliament and the Council."
"Consequently, you will be fully involved in the follow-up to this framework decision."
"Mr President, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency is well aware of your attachment to the respect for fundamental rights within the European Union and I would like to stress that the future group, which has brought together the six justice ministers from Germany, Portugal, Slovenia, France, the Czech Republic and Sweden, has made strengthening data protection a priority for the European Union in the coming years."
"It is a concern shared by all the Member States, and all the Justice Ministers supported it during the informal Council meeting on 25 July."
"That is what I wished to say to Parliament, Mr President."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, obviously I welcome the President-in-Office, Mr Jouyet, and also our two rapporteurs, who have done a remarkable job."
"Mrs LefranÃ§ois has reported on the proposal for the amendment of the framework decision on combating terrorism, and Mrs Roure has reported on the framework decision on the protection of personal data."
"Obviously I also thank the Council Presidency."
"The comments made by Mr Jouyet should demonstrate the Presidency's concern to bring the differing points of view closer together."
"I will try to be brief, Mr President, because we are expecting a very interesting debate this morning before Parliament."
"First I will talk about the proposal for a framework decision on combating terrorism."
"As the President-in-Office quite rightly said, modern information and communication technologies play an important role in propagating the terrorist threat."
"The Internet, which is cheap, quick, easily accessible and reaches almost all over the world, is indeed used by terrorists."
"The advantages of the Internet appreciated by law-abiding citizens are unfortunately exploited for criminal purposes."
"Terrorists use the Internet to spread propaganda for mobilisation and recruitment purposes, as well as instructions and online manuals for training terrorists or planning attacks."
"Preventing this threat is obviously a political priority."
"The European Union must combat modern terrorism and its new methods with the same degree of determination that it demonstrated in combating traditional terrorism."
"The proposal prepared by the Commission updates the framework decision on combating terrorism and aligns it with the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism by including, in the concept of terrorism, public provocation to commit terrorist offences and recruitment and training for terrorism."
"The Commission is pleased with the positive reception that Mrs LefranÃ§ois's report has received, which underlines the added value of the proposal."
"However, Mrs LefranÃ§ois, you have also expressed concerns about the proposal, and the wish for a number of amendments."
"I am going to try to respond briefly."
"Firstly, your report challenges the use of the expression 'public provocation' and you clearly indicated that you felt the term 'public incitement' was more precise."
"It is a fact, however, that the Commission's proposal is based on the Council of Europe Convention and very closely follows the definitions of offences in the Convention, for two reasons."
"Firstly, we wanted to take account of the Council of Europe's unparalleled expertise in human rights, and the work done by the Council in drawing up the text of the Convention that we are discussing."
"The Convention is also based on the case law of the European Court of Human Rights as regards freedom of expression."
"Secondly, the Commission wanted to make it easier for the Member States to implement both the modification of the framework decision and the Council of Europe Convention."
"Would different terminology not make application slightly complicated?"
"That is the question I want to put to you."
"As regards the second point raised in the report, the Commission supports your idea of incorporating into the amending text safeguard clauses on human rights equivalent to those in Article 12 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism."
"Actually, Mr Jouyet, the Council's common position of 18 April 2008 already contains extra safeguard clauses parallel to those in Article 12."
"I will now move on to the desire to exclude any obligation to criminalise an attempt to commit an offence."
"We agree on this."
"The Commission's proposal already guaranteed the exclusion of this obligation and the Council's common position of 18 April 2008 did so too."
"What I would also like to say is that, as regards the jurisdictional rules applicable to the new offences, we largely - but not totally - agree with the modifications proposed in the report."
"The Commission can therefore accept the elimination of the additional jurisdictional rules it had included in its proposal."
"However, the Commission does not share the report's view as regards the existing jurisdictional rules in the current framework decision, because this would be like imposing a limitation in relation to the new offences."
"The amendment proposed in the report removes the obligation on a Member State to pursue new offences when they are committed outside the territory of this Member State but on behalf of a legal person established on its territory, or against its institutions or population, or against a European institution with its headquarters in the Member State concerned."
"We are afraid that removing this obligation of pursuit by the Member State in question will limit the effectiveness of the Commission proposal because the new offences are very often transnational, particularly when they are committed via the Internet."
"The Commission hopes, however, that the evolution of this dossier will above all allow the entry into force of the amended framework decision in the very near future."
"Updating our legislation is truly worth all our effort and I thank both Parliament and the Presidency for doing all they can to achieve this result."
"We do need this new tool."
"I now come to the report by Mrs Roure who, in her very strong defence, has made a firm case for Parliament's wish to have a meaningful framework decision that opens the way for further progress."
"The framework decision must indeed promote police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters by giving it the effectiveness conferred by genuine legitimacy and by respect for fundamental rights, particularly the right to respect for private life and the right to the protection of personal data."
"Common rules for the processing and protection of personal data, processed with the aim of preventing and fighting crime, can help to achieve these two objectives."
"Mr Jouyet, it will not surprise you to learn that the Commission is disappointed with the rather limited scope of the framework decision."
"We intended to go further, but I know the current Presidency largely shares this view."
"The text of the framework decision now covers only cross-border exchanges of personal data, and that is why we wanted to go further."
"Meanwhile, the processing of personal data by these authorities at national level is not being harmonised at European level."
"These activities will still be covered at national level by national data protection legislation."
"It is quite true, Mrs Roure, that the Member States have all acceded to the Council of Europe Convention 108 on data protection."
"Nevertheless, I am among those who think we should go further."
"The subsequent evaluation of the application of the framework decision, to which Mr Jouyet referred, is obviously one way of reviewing the application of the rules in the framework decision, and also of checking that the principles of purpose limitation and proportionality, which you were quite right to mention and are essential in this area, are indeed being respected."
"It is true that a revision, an evaluation clause, would, in the light of the assessment made by the Member States, certainly make it possible to extend the scope of this data protection."
"What is certain, and there is no need for me to insist on this, since the Presidency has just alluded to it, is that the text will be important not only for Europeans but also in our negotiations with third countries."
"We will be in a much stronger position, particularly in negotiations with the United States, - which I have not lost sight of - if we can lay claim to a data protection measure that truly responds to the needs and expectations of our citizens."
"That is why I hope the Council will push on with this dossier and we can reach agreement."
"This is a first step, Mr Jouyet, but this step still needs to be sufficiently significant."
"That is my wish."
"In any case, Mr President, I will be pleased if these two proposals and two reports - which are of great interest and value as far as the Commission is concerned - enable us to reach an agreement, which I would really like to happen."
"Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs for the report by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on this matter."
"I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs for the support that it gave me and to thank the rapporteur, Mrs LefranÃ§ois and say that in conducting this task she has been open to understanding and dialogue in order to seek a consensus, which on this matter is absolutely essential."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a framework decision could be seen as unnecessary."
"The Council of Europe has already taken up the issue in its Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, recognising the three types of criminal offence that the Commission includes in its proposal: public provocation to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism."
"However, it is just as true that it adds value, as it contains a better definition of terrorism, and is more comprehensive, as it includes a significant list of penalties."
"I would like to say in all sincerity that this action by the Commission is necessary and that it is an extremely valuable contribution."
"There is no need for concern about fundamental rights, and there is no conflict with freedom of expression."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in Spain, the terrorist group ETA is not on the European Union list of terrorist groups because of what it says, but rather for what it does, because it uses extortion, kidnapping, violence, terror and death in order to achieve its ends."
"This is why it is on the list; not because of what it says, but because of what it does."
"In the Spanish Parliament there are pro-independence groups that speak quite legitimately, advocate independence, and are naturally not in any way pursued for doing so."
"It is not about establishing crimes of opinion; it is about cooperating in using modern techniques and effectively combating terrorism."
"Allow me to remind you that yesterday, in Spain, an honest person, a member of the armed forces, an officer named Juan Luis Conde, was murdered by the terrorist group ETA using the cowardly method of a car bomb."
"The European Union needs to speak with one voice on this, firmly and competently."
"We need to be capable of establishing types of criminal offence that are not cumbersome, because if the courts consider that there are difficulties, presumption of innocence will always prevail, and we must not waste this opportunity."
"ETA and all the terrorist groups in the world should know that the European Union is speaking to them with one voice, they should lose all hope, they should be certain that the democratic weight of the Union is going to fall on them and that we shall not give up until they are entirely excluded from the life of our countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we have before us today two very important reports."
"They are unusual for their balanced approach and because they are the outcome of broader collaboration on issues which have generally been agreed on combating terrorism, and the protection of human rights, along with personal data, of course."
"Terrorism is the scourge of our age."
"It is hydra-headed, inhuman, barbarous and unrelenting."
"We therefore need to combat it by all lawful means, while always bearing in mind that human rights must not be violated."
"That is exactly what Mrs LefranÃ§ois's report achieves."
"What has been said is that the proposal to combat terrorism is based on the Council of Europe Convention."
"However, we have chosen to alter the definition of 'public provocation' so that it is legally more comprehensible in all countries."
"We talk about 'public incitement', which is much more in keeping with the spirit of the Convention and the aim we wish to pursue."
"Our concern when discussing this report was centred on the issue of human rights."
"We conducted extensive discussions, settled on a form of wording and included provisions to ensure the balance that I have mentioned."
"Anything extra will probably upset this balance and any attempt to further define terrorism is asking for trouble: it was no easy task for Europe to arrive at a definition."
"I was in the Council of Europe for three years."
"We tried to find a definition of terrorism and did not succeed."
"Now that we have arrived at this definition, there is no need to go against it."
"In any case, on the issue of human rights, there is paragraph 10 of the introductory part of the proposal; it deals extensively and thoroughly with the specific rights being protected: the right of assembly and of trade unions, and all related rights."
"There is therefore no need for any further efforts in this direction."
"To conclude, let me add that all this is in good hands."
"However, there is another area we should look at: we should turn our attention to the societies that nurture terrorism."
"We should talk to reasonable people, to the moderate elements, so that the moral support given to terrorists in these societies can be removed."
"We should direct our efforts, thinking, programmes and campaigns towards this."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, after seven years of combating terrorism I believe that we are now skilled in cataloguing the risks of terrorism, its effects and its devastating consequences."
"I also believe that one of the most dramatic of these consequences is a loss of balance - a loss of a sense of balance in reacting to the threat of terrorism."
"This balance is necessary for investigating not the superficial but the deep causes underlying this violence, and is vital for putting in place preventive and punitive policies, without abandoning the fundamental principles of our legal culture."
"This is a valuable but difficult balance, because it has to be translated into rules that do not leave any margin for discretion."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's initiative to revise the 2002 framework decision, provided that attention is paid to the very timely recommendations that have been made in the two reports we are debating today."
"The first recommendation, Mr Jouyet and Mr Barrot, is that we must avoid the culture of suspicion, because basing our society on suspicion, and dreaming up integration and immigration policies drawn up on the principle of mutual mistrust would be a gift to terrorism, since terrorism's aim is above all to create divisions."
"This is why, when discussing terrorist offences, and the concept of provocation - which is a concept that seems to us both general and subjective - we prefer the legally more consistent and more specific concept of public incitement."
"I believe that it is a less confusing and less subjective principle, and this is not a terminological issue, Mr Barrot, but a substantive issue: provocation lends itself to abuses, to excesses, it also lends itself to excessive attention to the socially emotive, which would often dictate excessive and confused reactions."
"All this leads us to the second risk that we must avoid: interpreting the fight against terrorism as grounds providing justification for revising, reducing and altering the scope of fundamental rights."
"From these two reports we expect a clear and unequivocal signal on this point: this is the challenge which we are called upon to tackle as legislators: combining the fight against terrorism and acts that prepare the way for terrorism with respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and especially freedom of expression and freedom of association, without which our cultures would return to the age of barbarism."
"Mr Barrot, we must tell the truth: the risk is that we will turn the fight against terrorism into a conflict between cultures or religions, that we will speak racist language; this is quite a real risk, as demonstrated by the meeting in the last few days in Cologne, with the irresponsible participation of a Member of this Parliament, Mr Borghezio."
"It should thus be said strongly, and said here, and said by this Parliament: fascist intolerance has nothing to do with the war on terrorism!"
"The valuable work done by the two reports that we are debating here also takes this approach: combating terrorism, preventing terrorism's desperate violence, but at the same time ensuring that there is the right balance between the need for safety for our citizens and their freedoms and fundamental rights."
"On this point, Mr President, Mr Jouyet and Mr Barrot, we call for vigilance from the Council and the Commission and we promise that this Parliament will do its utmost to work together with you."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission Vice-President, with their reports, Mrs LefranÃ§ois and Mrs Roure have done a great deal of work, and I have also been delighted to have been able to work together with them as they did so."
"We have achieved a lot and also made a big difference."
"I regret that Mrs Roure's report is still stuck in the Council even though we have revised it."
"In this regard I feel the things Mr Jouyet spoke about are lacking somewhat, namely that we seize on topics and declare them a priority."
"We also heard this repeatedly and most recently from the German Council Presidency."
"Unfortunately, it has just not been translated into action."
"Parliament cannot be satisfied in the long run purely with lip service."
"With regard to the report by Mrs LefranÃ§ois: there is definitely something remarkable in this report that none of you has yet addressed."
"It implies that we have here one of the rare cases in which we are harmonising substantive criminal law - quite clearly beyond the field of the environment."
"This is something that goes way beyond what the European Union has been doing until now."
"In civil law we have seen it in cross-border matters."
"However, harmonising substantive criminal law goes much deeper than has been broached here."
"Hence the Commission understands perhaps why we are conducting such an intensive discussion on public provocation or incitement."
"'Incitement' is a normal judicial term in every Member State."
"The member states of the Council of Europe decided on the term 'provocation' as a compromise."
"This also includes countries such as Russia."
"I do not believe that we have to discuss whether we all have a common legal basis with this."
"I have also continued to make it clear in discussions with Mrs LefranÃ§ois that, from my national perspective alone, I have a problem with the term 'incitement', as it is also worded here, because the fact that an incitement can be punished without there being a premeditated unlawful predicate crime is alien to our system."
"In that the clause allows for incitement or provocation, both these terms are at worst even a bluff."
"They both fail to show premeditation on the part of the perpetrator."
"It is solely dependent on the perception of third parties whether what someone has said could be a serious provocation to commit a terrorist offence or not."
"At the moment I am wondering where you draw the line between the terrorist and the irate citizen around the regulars' table who is denounced by his neighbour."
"In this respect we must also touch upon the existing legal systems."
"I know that it is different in some respects in Spain, but this is so that it can combat home-grown terrorism."
"Believe me, I am thankful that I am young enough not to have lived through the bad times of the RAF in Germany, but then, too, appropriate laws were discussed."
"Of course countries must act exceptionally in special cases, but in the last seven years we have also seen that much of what was decided at the outset in a frenzy of activity must now be retracted."
"In this respect I am also glad that we have been focusing on people and fundamental rights across party lines in this report."
"With regard to the Roure report, it is much more critical that the Council takes action."
"We must not fool ourselves with regard to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We all want it to stand until the European elections in 2009, but we also know that I want never gets."
"We now have to try to weave this report into these discussions - particularly with regard to the talks currently being conducted by the Commission with the United States on an EU/US data protection agreement."
"Indeed, the two cannot be allowed to exist independently of each other."
"Hence I should like us not only to seize the political will, but ultimately also to take a political decision, to enable the Framework Decision on data protection to finally come into force."
"The Commission and Council are striving, with an incredible amount of activity, to take action in the field of the economic protection of personal data."
"When we see what is happening in the United Kingdom, Germany and other Member States, where there are cases of loss or theft of personal data administered by public authorities, we have just as urgent a need for action here."
"This is ultimately more than ever about citizens' rights, as they are not able to prevent their government behaving in this way."
"With enterprises, the citizen is still able to choose a different one in case of doubt."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Vice-President of the Commission, as well as the rapporteurs for what I consider to be very important reports."
"When we discuss issues with regard to terrorism and data protection - sometimes when you look at the substance of the debate within Parliament - there appears to be a conflict taking place between those who want to give more protection to individual rights and freedoms and more protection to the general populace from the risk and threat of violence or even incitement to violence, as some of my colleagues have already mentioned."
"To that extent, when we move forward with regard to these proposals, we should be certain that the legislation which we are proposing, which we are amending within this Parliament, has a definitive legal basis, so that when it comes into operation it is above challenge and above rebuke."
"One of the difficulties we face is that, because of the framework decision, because of the legal basis - or the lack of a legal basis - with regard to certain aspects of that framework decision, we could be leaving ourselves open to being accused of being hypocritical, merely appearing to act without actually taking any decisive action."
"If you look back over the history of the cooperation in judicial matters and police matters that we have instigated here within this Parliament, 90% of it has been predicated on the basis of mutual trust between the different authorities at Member State level."
"That has been the only effective way of finding a mechanism to move forward, because, even though you may put in agreements or decisions, unless the authorities in each Member State are willing to work with each other and exchange that information, then there can be no real meaningful cooperation or movement forward."
"We have to be very careful with regard to the issue of data protection and the personal data which is collected, because many of us know that, in our own Member States, there are countless agencies, both of a national and a local level, that retain data on every single person."
"The biggest scare there is at the moment in the United Kingdom has been this issue of identity theft, and big concerns because computers are lost that contain information from state agencies - whether it is social welfare, defence or police agencies - personal data, information that you would never individually give out to anybody."
"Yet there appears to be no protection for that data."
"That is why we have to be careful at this level - at European level - that we are creating a European framework decision that will allow cooperation between Member States, but which does not impose these controls on national Member States."
"The reason I say that is because there are greater protections available to individuals to challenge national authorities when they misuse, abuse or lose their data than would be available in this framework decision, and in many ways, if we force this framework decision on protection of data to apply to national data as well, we will undermine the rights that already exist."
"Because we are moving forward with a new plan at a European level, there is some leeway for a slightly more fluid response to the difficulties we are facing with regard to the protection of the data."
"However, to be certain for this legislation to be effective, not only must it be clear and definitive with regard to the role that it wants to carry out, but it must also have the trust of the people that it will protect them and not abuse them."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am convinced that the Council genuinely wishes to improve the security of citizens and also that it sets store by civil rights."
"You may well welcome the present reports with enthusiasm, but if you have read them carefully you will have noticed that the conclusion we draw is totally different from your own."
"As a matter of fact, we believe that the proposals you have adopted are simply inadequate, and that they threaten to infringe civil rights."
"How come we assess things differently?"
"First of all, parliaments traditionally pay more attention than governments to civil rights, which constitutes a problem when it comes to decision-making."
"In particular, however, Parliament wants to look at the impact of these decisions on society in the longer term."
"Viewing the relationship between government and citizens from a historical perspective, we see that the government has the monopoly on the use of force, and citizens have fundamental rights that cannot be violated by the government unless this is necessary, effective and proportionate."
"Yet if too often citizens see government action that is neither necessary nor justified, their trust in and therefore cooperation with that government will wane, and then we shall really have a massive security problem in the long term."
"Trust is hard to gain but easy to lose."
"In my opinion, the proposal on data protection fails to offer the intended protection, and the Council is on thin ice with its extension of the framework decision."
"Starting with the report by Mrs Roure, I should like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for all the years she has spent steering this report through Parliament."
"In particular, I should like to put a series of questions to the Council."
"The proposal relates to police and judicial cooperation in Europe; that is, to services concerned with security."
"However - and the President-in-Office may be able to contradict me here - I understand that it is now specified that the Council does not consider itself bound by these proposals if essential national security interests are at stake."
"What interests are we talking about here, and can you give an example of a matter that would induce you to simply throw this framework decision in the bin?"
"Another point, which Mrs Roure herself has already broached, is that of sensitive data."
"There are some data I can understand the Council wanting; but can it explain to me on what kind of occasion it would stand to benefit from knowing whether a person was a trade-union member?"
"I should like you to give me an example of when it would be useful to know whether a person was a member of the Trade Union Federation (FNV) in the Netherlands."
"Is this supposed to indicate recalcitrant behaviour?"
"Under what circumstances would this be relevant, for goodness' sake?"
"People's sex lives?"
"If we are talking about active paedophilia, fair enough: this is a crime and can of course be recorded."
"For what kind of things do you actually want more information, however?"
"Regarding the transfer of data to third countries, I can still recall a hilarious moment during the German Presidency when a representative of the Council stated that it was sometimes indeed necessary to transfer data very quickly to Iran."
"He had the whole House gaping; surely he could not mean that - transferring data to Iran!"
"I put the question now, therefore, whether that Council member will guarantee that sensitive data will not under any circumstances be transferred to Iran."
"Could you perhaps also give me the article number on which you base that guarantee?"
"Although I consider the level of protection insufficient, I do welcome the objective: better cooperation between police and judicial services at European level (this has been known to malfunction even at national level)."
"One key word when it comes to improving this cooperation is 'trust' - here, too, it is a matter of trust."
"My accusation is that the Council is failing to work hard enough to increase this trust and thus also cooperation."
"After all, trust needs to be based on something, such as substantial data protection or rights of suspects that befit our rule of law - but you fail to deliver the goods."
"You have now been working on the procedural rights of suspects for my whole term of office and still nothing has emerged."
"In addition, where you could really help move cooperation forward, you fail to do so."
"Instead, you present the crude Framework Decision on combating terrorism."
"Mrs LefranÃ§ois has produced an apt report on this, for which I should like to express my warm thanks to her, too."
"My question remains: what problem is the Council actually trying to solve here?"
"Incitement to violence is banned in all Member States, and that is the way it should be - but now provocation, too, is being criminalised."
"What constitutes 'provocation'?"
"Someone writing that the United States is a rogue state, an axis of evil that must be combated?"
"If that person also writes: 'those who are not for us are against us', is that provocation?"
"If a Western man deliberately makes an anti-Islamic film with the aim of offending people, is he provoking an attack?"
"Am I myself being provocative now?"
"Unclear legislation is bad legislation."
"You have my support for criminalising incitement to violence at European level too, but not by this means."
"If one compares all the language versions, it is not even clear whether it is 'provocation' or 'incitement' that is being discussed."
"A woman may dress provocatively, but that does not mean she is inciting rape."
"Article 1(1) is alarming in that respect, as it states that a person can be convicted of terrorist offences whether or not he or she directly advocates such offences."
"As far as my group is concerned, that is really going much too far."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, owing to the short time available to me, I should like to discuss only the report by Mrs Roure."
"When we talk about the processing of personal data in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, I should like to say very clearly that I am of the opinion that we need uniform European regulations."
"In recent years, several projects concerning the processing of these data have been launched, in particular the second generation Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System (VIS)."
"These data are also relevant, however, in relation to the proposal to exchange criminal record data among Member States and even the introduction of a European PNR system."
"A high level of data protection is in the interest of every citizen and, in my view, can be guaranteed only by uniform regulations at EU level."
"The President-in-Office has said that the present Council Decision was the best solution that could be reached."
"I have to tell you, President-in-Office, that I am disappointed with the Council's new proposal, as Parliament's key demands have not been taken into account, and I think it provides a level of data protection that in some respects still falls below that of Council of Europe Convention 108."
"Incidentally, criticism of the proposal is shared by all groups across their dividing lines, and I think that this unequivocal message should give the Council food for thought."
"In particular we should ensure that the Framework Decision is also applied to national data processing; otherwise the point of the entire proposal is called into question."
"I should also like to emphasise what our rapporteur, Mrs Roure, has said, namely that particularly sensitive data categories - that is, data revealing a person's ethnic origin, political opinion or religious conviction - should not be processed."
"If we are to allow any exceptions at all to this principle, it is essential that the approval of a relevant judicial body be obtained beforehand, for example; this data category should not simply be processed automatically."
"The Council has been promising Parliament for a long time that it will adopt this Framework Decision."
"I think it is high time now that the Council finally kept its promise, and indeed with a Framework Decision worth the paper on which it is printed."
"I support all the amendments that Parliament proposes in the report, as I think we need the highest possible level of data protection and this is not yet guaranteed by the Council Framework Decision that now exists."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, these Council decisions are part of the process of harmonising our national justice and legal systems into a common EU system."
"Already any EU citizen can be extradited from one EU country to another by means of a European arrest warrant with minimal safeguards."
"Even when a national legal system or national government knows that a gross injustice is being done, it cannot prevent it."
"Under the new rules on trials in absentia, we can now be tried and sentenced in another EU state without even being aware that this has happened, and then face extradition and imprisonment."
"We can be fined or have our property confiscated, again without our own national legal systems or governments being able to prevent it or protect us."
"Under the Lisbon Treaty a European public prosecutor is planned, with wide-ranging powers to investigate and prosecute those charged with offences against the Union's interest - aided by Europol, whose officials have immunity from prosecution for anything that they do or anything that they say in the course of their duties."
"And, of course, we have the European Union's own paramilitary police force, the European Gendarmerie, being constructed in Vicenza, which will have the power to cross borders to suppress civil unrest in EU Member States."
"All this is being done in the name of protecting us from terrorism; but what is actually happening, of course, is the never-ending mission of the European Union to increase and entrench its own power and dominion in every area of our national lives."
"Terrorism is indeed a real threat, the single biggest source of which in the world today is the ideology of fundamentalist, literalist and extremist Islam."
"But terrorism should be combated by national governments working in cooperation with each other, not used as an excuse to increase the power of the European Union."
"(NL) Mr President, it is often heard from various quarters that the fight against terrorism is threatening our freedoms - but this is a false dichotomy."
"Freedom of expression, freedom of the press and the right to privacy are indeed fundamental characteristics of our Western society but, as the previous speaker has just said, it is these open societies that are currently under threat from an Islamic extremism that incites terrorist acts against these values."
"The measures in this report are one step - but only one - in the right direction."
"States not only have the duty to protect their citizens against terrorism, but also must be able to take every measure to safeguard public order."
"I should like to make a marginal note here, however, as many speakers on the margins of today's debate have referred to Italy."
"Yet the Italian Government has every right to fight illegal immigration and crime in such ways as it deems necessary, provided this is justified by objective, legitimate factors."
"In addition, last week's disgraceful hearing in Rome, at which a few extreme left-wing Members of this House accused the Italian carabinieri of torturing Roma children, was an insult to the Italian people and did not befit this House."
"I hope, therefore, that the President of the European Parliament will apologise to the Italian Government on behalf of us all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak at this stage because unfortunately I have to go on to participate in an interinstitutional dialogue."
"I apologise to Parliament and the rapporteurs for this."
"I just wanted to respond to the group leaders by saying, firstly, regarding the report by Mrs LefranÃ§ois and following the speeches particularly on the distinction between 'incitement' and 'provocation', that the Council's text copies Article 5 of the Council of Europe Convention in order to prevent differences in application."
"We think that we should trust judges to apply this criminalisation reasonably and - as Mr de Grandes Pascual quite rightly said - taking due account of context, particularly as regards Spanish terrorism."
"Lastly, I would like to point out that the Council's text largely takes account, on the one hand, of the freedom of expression clause in Article 2 and on the other, of the proportionality clause in Article 14."
"Regarding the report by Mrs Roure, I would like to say that I also agree with Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Alvaro: it is indeed progress to have regulation in the third pillar that opens up the right of redress."
"I have also heard all your demands relating to scope, particularly that of Mrs Kaufmann."
"France thought the same as the Commission, but we have to be realistic."
"We could unanimously adopt a different text."
"We would have liked to go further - that is what Commissioner Barrot said too - but only if the scope was extended, which would be a really good thing;"
"I do not believe we would make this progress in the short term."
"There is a compromise to be achieved, a balance to be established."
"I agree with Mrs Roure that this is not entirely satisfactory, but it is still progress and we must accept it for what it is."
"Anyway, as I said, we also have the evaluation clause."
"I invite the Commission, the Vice-President - and I know he will do it - to make the best possible use of this evaluation clause and the provisions on data collection that suggest we will also think about files under national sovereignty."
"You mentioned the inclusion of certain data appearing in this decision."
"Personally, I would also be glad if the inclusion of religious and sexual data were reviewed or, at the very least, if it were worded better than it currently is."
"In answer to Mr Dillen, regarding the Roma: as he knows, the Roma Summit on 16 September demonstrated the commitment of the French Presidency and the Commission to the Roma issue."
"The Vice-President was there and we took stock of past measures, to which the Member States can commit themselves in the future to encourage the integration of the Roma into our societies; an issue which also crops up a great deal on Commissioner Å pidla's social agenda."
"That is all I wanted to say in response to the speeches made as part of this very exciting debate."
"(DE) Mr President, Commission Vice-President, President-in-Office of the Council, a word of praise first of all to the French Council Presidency for the fact that we are discussing these subjects together, as they illustrate the balance of the challenge: overcoming a major challenge - terrorism - on the one hand, and data protection on the other."
"It is a shame that the President-in-Office cannot be present for the whole time."
"That would have been very useful for this debate."
"Firstly, with regard to data protection, we have already heard many Presidencies here tell us of major and significant progress."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to note that our rapporteur, Mrs Roure, has the full support of the entire Parliament on this issue, as we need progress here."
"Three items are of particular importance to us."
"I should like to emphasise specifically that we must continue to emphasise that we support the exchange of data."
"We know from the Schengen Information System that we can trace many criminals by exchanging data, and that exchanging data ensures success and also guarantees security."
"Other aspects are important, however: the right of access for citizens is particularly important to me - strengthening citizens' rights - and the scope, which has already been discussed repeatedly."
"Vice-President Barrot has pointed out that it is important to him to have these decisions as backing, particularly during the negotiations with the United States."
"I should like to add, however, that if the United States objects that this legal framework unfortunately applies only to European issues, and not at intra-European level in connection with the situation in the Member States, it will have an argument against us, as we do not even dare to implement this legal framework in full in the European Union."
"With regard to the fight against terrorism, I think it is a shame that, although the Council is continually launching new approaches here, it is getting nowhere in the practical implementation of many operational measures."
"We all remember that it took over a year to appoint a new EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Mr de Kerchove, that we acted quickly on data retention but have unfortunately seen delays in implementation, and that within Europol we still do not have a task force, a dedicated department, for this sector."
"We must work and fight with greater commitment in this regard, and we should be making operational progress rather than just arguing over wording."
"Particularly with regard to Islamic terrorism, we are experiencing the greatest problems with converts - people who grow up in our society, become adults and then convert to the Islamic faith."
"We have to ask ourselves here what is going wrong in our societies and what is going wrong in the Islamic environment for these people to become radicalised."
"We have to consider this."
"In Europe we are able to live in safety also because we have a committed police force, who are to be thanked at this point."
"(ES) First of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent reports, but I am mainly going to discuss the LefranÃ§ois report."
"Step by step, always through legislation, we are continuing to close in on terrorism."
"The Framework Decision of 2002 enabled us to establish a common definition and legal framework for terrorist offences."
"The changes put forward today involve including three new offences to protect ourselves from, in response to old and new terrorist threats, and their increasing use of information technologies, including cyberterrorism."
"There is a long chain of terrorist acts ranging from indoctrinating and arousing fanaticism in a child to murder."
"This proposed modification is restricted to public provocation to commit terrorist offences, and recruitment and training of terrorists, which now covers traditional and modern methods for sowing terror."
"However, we do not distinguish between the methods, but we need to be extremely careful about drawing the line between what is unacceptable and therefore should be punished, and freedom of expression as a fundamental right."
"In the case of public provocation, this line is more blurred."
"Therefore, intention and manifest danger are essential requirements in order for something to be described as an offence."
"Everything else is freedom of expression, which is protected by the Framework Decision itself, Article 6 of the EU Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe Convention."
"In the case of the Convention, what is lacking is that many Member States have not yet ratified it, which is doing little to help the fight against terrorism or to protect freedoms."
"Neither the original Framework Decision nor the current amended version are substitutes for the Convention; rather, its ratification would strengthen European legislation, giving it added value and a more complete legal framework."
"As in the PrÃ¼m Treaty and many other texts, European legislation does not distinguish between different types of terrorists; it is just as valid for use within the Union as for international terrorism."
"Last year Europol recorded a total of 583 terrorist acts, 24% more than the previous year, 517 of which were by separatist groups operating in Spain and France."
"There were 201 arrests of people suspected of Islamist terrorist acts."
"I would like to congratulate the police forces on their commendable work and their efforts to put an end to terrorism and to detain terrorists."
"Mr President, unfortunately my country is back in the news."
"We have a long and wretched tradition of terrorism."
"We know that there is no place for terrorists in a democracy, but nor is there a place for those who encourage, harbour and assist terrorists."
"I therefore think that there is another legal concept that would complete our legislation: the criminalisation of demonstrations discrediting or humiliating the victims of terrorism or their families."
"It would be good to keep this in mind for the next changes to be made."
"I will conclude, Mr President, by regretting that we are unable to apply Protocol 10 of the Lisbon Treaty, which would have speeded up the communitarisation of matters that are so significant and urgent in the minds of citizens."
"Mr President, to start with, on a point of order, I would like to ask the presidency of this House to write to the French presidency and indicate that we find it unacceptable that the French presidency is not available for the whole duration of such an important debate."
"(NL) Mr President, terrorism was not invented on 11 September 2001; it had always been there."
"In addition, as the previous speaker has just remarked, Europol's EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report does indeed state that the vast majority of attacks are not committed by Islamic extremists, but by separatists, by forces on the extreme right and extreme left."
"What is new since 2001, however, is that governments worldwide have been seizing on the fight against terrorism to curtail civil rights and freedoms."
"I am all for cooperation in the fight against criminals, and I concur fully with the words of Mr Weber, but very often measures, such as the collection of personal data, have been taken for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with terrorism."
"For example, the PNR data are used in immigration control or in fighting 'ordinary' crime."
"In itself this is quite legitimate, but in that case let us call a spade a spade."
"The solemn declarations by the Council on civil rights and privacy ring somewhat hollow when the Council is not even here and, in particular, is not prepared to implement the European Parliament's recommendations, as laid down in the Roure report, in particular."
"Perhaps, then, the Council should stop weeping crocodile tears over the Irish 'no'."
"Finally, I have two specific questions."
"I should like to ask the Commission - since the Council is not here - for some information on the High Level Contact Group."
"After two years of negotiations behind closed doors and without a mandate, US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff is now urging Commissioner Barrot to sign an agreement in December."
"I should like to know whether Commissioner Barrot will be saying 'no' on our behalf."
"My second question is as follows."
"Negotiations are being held on behalf of the EU on a system permitting customs - in Europe, and without any explanation or restrictions - to search and confiscate laptops at the border."
"I should like to know what the situation is with this."
"I think it is important to inform you that the French Presidency correctly notified its apologies in advance of the beginning of the debate and informed us that Mrs Dati was unable to participate in the debate because she was detained for unavoidable reasons and that Mr Jouyet, who was replacing her, was not able to stay."
"Your objection remains important, however, and we will pass it on, but I must emphasise that the apologies of the French Presidency were given in advance."
"(PL) Mr President, terrorism is one of the greatest threats of modern times."
"The 11 September attacks made us aware of that in no uncertain terms."
"Terrorism is based on both a psychological and a social and media effect."
"Hence the problem that has arisen of the endless list of questions on how to avert threats of this type, which have acquired a global dimension."
"The sowing of fear and terror and attacks on civil society - this is the face of terrorism."
"The EU must provide its citizens with a high level of security."
"Particular attention needs to be given to terrorists' use of IT and communications technologies, particularly the Internet, which helps to disseminate propaganda broadcasts and training manuals."
"This is what we really need to be countering."
"Combating terrorism must become a priority for us in the EU, particularly combating its most threatening variant, Islamic terrorism, the objective of which is the absolute destruction of Western civilisation."
"What can we do?"
"The choice is simple: either we annihilate terrorism, or terrorism will visit apocalypse on the world."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can hold this debate on basic principles - we have to hold it - but not without discussing a particular instrument."
"I am talking about what is referred to as the list of terrorist organisations."
"Since the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, we know that the legal assessment is perfectly clear."
"The system of lists of terrorist organisations of both the EU and the UN violates citizens' fundamental rights and therefore has to be reformed."
"What has happened?"
"This EU list of terrorist organisations operates in a completely grey area without any parliamentary control."
"It is indeed bizarre when we as Parliament hear that a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 15 July - bringing together politicians specialising in agriculture, forestry and rural development - adopted a new EU list of terrorist organisations without debate, and without knowing what was on it."
"We know that foreign policy complications result, as international law is being trampled underfoot here in a completely grey area."
"We want to change this, and I am asking for your support in doing so. Many thanks."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am also disappointed that the French minister has left, because he could have learned, for instance, that the information that he supplied to us is incorrect."
"In fact, Mrs DÃ¼hrkop is correct in saying that the vast majority of terrorist attacks carried out in the European Union have an independent basis and have nothing to do with Al-Qaida, contrary to Mr Jouyet's statement."
"In that case, we could have removed that suggestive equation, often put forward to us, between Islam and terrorism."
"This is a frequent tendency and, unfortunately, it also has its adherents in this Parliament."
"I am thinking of the attitude adopted by Mr Borghezio in the recent Cologne demonstration as, if this framework decision were valid, he would certainly be accused of provocation to terrorism."
"I would define Mr Borghezio's activities as provocation, and on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left, I would like to make a formal request for the President of Parliament to issue an official warning to Mr Borghezio."
"I believe that the strategy adopted over recent years in the fight against terrorism has been a losing strategy, and has been too subordinate to US interests in the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, in the formulation of the list of terrorist organisations, and in the restrictions placed upon the rule of law."
"There have been too many instances of improper handling of personal data and I believe that we must all work together - and I am just finishing now - to ensure that we do not restrict individual freedoms, to increase democratic areas and to ensure that we do not, in the name of security and the fight against terrorism, help to achieve the very goals of the terrorist organisations themselves."
"(SV) Mr President, Mrs LefranÃ§ois proposes important changes in order to safeguard confidentiality, freedom of expression and legal certainty."
"What should be viewed as criminal is incitement, not provocation, to commit terrorist offences."
"Protection of privacy must also apply to e-mail and other electronic correspondence and the basic principles of all our legislation, proportionality, necessity and non-discrimination, are emphasised."
"Excellent."
"But, for there is a big 'but': what happened to subsidiarity?"
"What kind of terrorism is to be dealt with at EU level?"
"A dreadful crime of terrorism was committed in Spain last weekend, and our sympathies go out to the Spanish people, but that crime is not an EU matter."
"Neither was the terrorism which continued for decades in Northern Ireland."
"Clearly, fear of terrorism is being deliberately exploited to advance EU positions in the fields of justice and police affairs at the expense of the Member States."
"Subsidiarity is a fitting subject for political speeches, but does not feature in legislation."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, this weekend the Czech Republic's Ambassador to Pakistan became a victim of a bomb attack in that country."
"Yesterday, three Czech servicemen were wounded in a rocket attack in Afghanistan."
"These days, terrorism is having a direct impact on the citizens of my country too."
"There is no doubt that this is one of the most insidious and dangerous phenomena of civilisation and that we cannot give in to this cowardly and wicked evil, but must fight it."
"The war on terrorism must nevertheless not become an all-encompassing incantation."
"Despite all the bloody consequences of terrorism, everyday mistrust and fear for security cannot be placed above freedom."
"I therefore reject the European Commission's proposal that incitement to commit a terrorist offence should be a crime."
"The proposal aims to punish verbal and written addresses and thus poses a clear threat to freedom of expression and fundamental human rights."
"For me, as a democratic politician, this is unacceptable."
"(PT) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I shall start with the report by Mrs Roure, which I once again support in its efforts to reach a political agreement on the proposal for a Framework Decision on the protection of personal data in the framework of the third pillar that is not based on the lowest common denominator, a minimum level of data protection and serious shortcomings."
"I should like to reiterate my position, which I have made clear here several times before: it is essential and urgent for a legal instrument to be adopted that guarantees the protection of data in the framework of the third pillar and ensures a level of protection of personal data that is at least equivalent to the level guaranteed under the first pillar by Directive 95/46/EC."
"I very much enjoyed listening to Vice-President Barrot's statements."
"He is tuned in to Parliament's concerns, but I regret that the Council's empty chair is a living example of the political deafness that has filtered through every presidency."
"I am not at all optimistic about the Council's response."
"On the LefranÃ§ois report: in 2002 we adopted a framework decision in which we harmonised the definition of 'terrorism' and the applicable penalties."
"Several speakers have already referred to the Internet, the new information technologies, and the advantages they bring, but also to the use criminals can make of the net."
"As has already been said, there are some 5 000 terrorist propaganda sites, which are tools of radicalisation and recruitment, as well as serving as a source of information on terrorist means and methods."
"That is why we need to amend the 2002 Directive, so as to create the necessary instruments to deal with this form of cyberterrorism."
"I support Mrs LefranÃ§ois' proposals, which combine the urgency of this fight with the indispensable respect for freedom of speech and association."
"Lastly, Mr President, it is very important that Member States ratify the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism so as to ensure parallel implementation of both instruments, together with a more thorough and comprehensive legal regime."
"(EL) Mr President, over recent years, discussion of terrorism in the European Commission and the Council has almost invariably sprung from self-evident acceptance of the protection of our fundamental rights."
"The almost equally inevitable consequences are perverse legislative proposals that violate these very rights."
"A typical example is the proposal we are considering today, to combat terrorism on the Internet."
"This is based on the acknowledgement that some terrorists use the Internet to instigate terrorism, and that we must stop them."
"However, the proposal concludes with the following extreme measure: to combat terrorism on the Internet, we should imprison any citizen who writes anything that could be interpreted by the police as being intended to encourage terrorism - not even 'instigate' it, mark you."
"Furthermore, anyone directly or indirectly supporting terrorist crimes is guilty."
"In other words, anyone who dares to express, verbally or in writing, a political opinion that could be interpreted as supporting terrorism is risking arrest."
"The proposal states elsewhere that people can be prosecuted, even if they have no intention of encouraging terrorism with their writings, simply on the grounds that their words, in the opinion of the police, had such an effect."
"In other words, one of the fundamental principles of criminal procedure is being completely overturned."
"Fortunately, the LefranÃ§ois report is here to restore the self-evident values of a democratic society to this crazy framework decision."
"It protects the freedom of the press and the contents of our e-mails from pre-emptive spying by the authorities; and it expressly states that criminalisation of any kind 'shall not have the effect of reducing or restricting ... the expression of radical, polemic or controversial views in the public debate on sensitive political questions, including terrorism.'"
"I hope the Council will accept these self-explanatory changes."
"No-one in this House underestimates the need to combat terrorism, but when the fight against it gives rise to measures that ultimately gag our democracy, then the European Parliament, quite rightly, is obliged not to endorse them."
"This is because - again, one of those self-evident truths that are in danger of no longer being taken for granted in today's Europe - it is absurd to claim that we are fighting terrorism to 'protect our democracy' while proposing measures that are contrary to the fundamental principles of democracy."
"The moral superiority of democracy lies in the fact that there are many ways of responding and protecting it, but these certainly do not include pre-emptive monitoring of the thoughts and words of its citizens, let alone the pre-emptive gagging or criminalisation of the self-expression of those who disagree with what is self-evident to the majority."
"I call on you to support the LefranÃ§ois and Roure reports."
"To the Council in its absence I say, take heed."
"Mr President, there are fundamental flaws in how the EC is currently proceeding in justice and home affairs, notably the lack of fully transparent and democratic law-making in the absence of the Lisbon Treaty (I too regret that Mr Jouyet showed his indifference to our views by leaving, whether he apologised or not) and, secondly, the lack of balance and respect for fundamental rights."
"Both are, unfortunately, fully on display here in the two measures being discussed."
"The criminalising of 'public provocation to commit terrorism' - a vague term - risks casting a chilling effect on free speech when the criminal offence of incitement, which we already have, is perfectly adequate."
"The other measure gives only weak protection for personal data exchanged ostensibly for law-enforcement purposes, but with massive loopholes."
"I can inform the House that, in the UK, the Data Retention Directive - that landmark achievement of the UK presidency three years ago - is being used to give hundreds of non-law-enforcement agencies access to personal contact details."
"Local councils use it to check up if parents have lied about living in the catchment area of a popular school - which might be naughty, but is not a major crime."
"It is disgraceful the way that interior ministers have left a space for Europhobes like the UK Independence Party and British Conservatives to castigate the whole EU effort on cross-border crime."
"We know that a large majority of the European public, including in the UK, supports EU action to catch criminals and terrorists, such as through the European arrest warrant."
"However, UKIP and the Tories, who claim to put a high priority on law and order, give a cheery wave goodbye to any criminal who escapes across the Channel."
"We should not allow them to get away with their propaganda, especially because interior ministers are doing their very best to undermine public support for police cooperation by their blinkered approach which gives insufficient attention to civil liberties, be this protection from invasions of privacy or the rights of defendants."
"EU Governments have stupidly allowed Mr Batten and his ilk a head of steam over the issue of recognition of judgments in absentia by their failure, led by the UK Government, to strengthen defence rights."
"Talk about an unholy alliance between the Europhobes and a spineless Labour Government!"
"Lastly, I want to ask where the justice ministers are in this whole exercise."
"They need to get a grip on the interior ministers' circus and start to construct a real European area of freedom, security and justice."
"We need the Lisbon Treaty to get transparency and democracy into this project, and quickly, before the European elections."
"(PL) Listening to this debate, there are times when I get the impression that we are forgetting that the framework decision is aimed at democratic states, at EU Member States with a democracy based on firm foundations."
"There is therefore no urgent reason, no urgent need, to constrict the effect of the framework decision by introducing concepts like 'incitement' or 'genuine terrorist threat'."
"What this is is the culture of suspicion that Mr Fava was talking about, suspicion with regard to the state."
"Who should assess how genuine the threat has actually become?"
"Does blood have to flow on the streets of one or another European city for us to be 100% certain that the threat linked to training, to incitement or to provocation has become genuine?"
"These and other safeguard clauses may be interpreted with an ill will, at the level of the courts, for example."
"They may end up being taken as an expression of an ideology, a false appreciation of human rights, which in this instance would undermine the effectiveness of combating terrorism."
"I am appealing to Member States to show more trust, not to weaken the framework decision, and to maintain convergence of the framework decision with the counter-terrorism convention drawn up among the family of nations of the Council of Europe."
"(EL) Mr President, terrorism as an act is to be condemned by all Members present in this House."
"However, this should not lead us to make protecting our true security difficult."
"In reality, the choices made by the EU to stamp out these hideous crimes leave us divided and deeply uncertain."
"Adopting increasingly reactionary measures confirms that we were right to disagree from the outset with the ethos of the whole enterprise, and that we are right to be concerned now about substantial protection for our citizens' freedoms."
"The reform proposals presented call for an even heavier investment in measures and policies that can put innocent people in the dock and bring about their conviction."
"On the basis of suspicion alone, they overturn the fundamental legal principle of presumed innocence."
"How can public incitement or provocation constitute a crime when it does not have any consequence or lead to any action?"
"How far-fetched can the definition of provocation be?"
"When can it be considered public?"
"When is it genuinely dangerous and therefore punishable?"
"The declaratory nature of some of the provisions on the protection of freedom of expression is not enough: what determines the implementation of the proposal is the thinking behind its definitions."
"These contravene Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and may lead to the criminalisation of demonstrations, speeches, etc."
"In our view, the EU is once again making a choice based on political expediency rather than attempting to protect citizens' real freedoms."
"It is trying to dispel our worries with declarative clauses that are unable to guarantee the protection of those who some wish to see as potential terrorists."
"(EL) What grief, what suffering, what pain, what hate terrorism involves!"
"Fortunately, we have been taught to hide, to protect ourselves and to hate, for such are our basic rights, and this is what they have been reduced to."
"However, we have not been taught a fundamental obligation: not to provoke terrorism."
"Terrorism is not a vice; it may be a criminal act committed in protest, and one committed in vengeance, and it is unquestionably an appalling crime: but it is not a vice."
"I have not seen terrorists who are perverts and who die with their victims."
"Terrorism is provoked."
"Inasmuch as it is provoked by those who provoke and make use of it, terrorism will kill."
"We in Parliament must protect Europeans, but we must also protect those who are being killed in Islamabad, in Sharm el-Sheikh, and most recently in Algeria."
"It is now Parliament's obligation to protect those who are not to blame."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, two weeks ago the Chairman of the Muslim Council of Great Britain addressed a meeting in this building, at which he categorically rejected reciprocity between faiths and demanded that the indigenous population had an obligation to welcome newcomers, and that those newcomers had a right to remain separate."
"He made no reference whatsoever to weeding out the Islamic fundamentalists in his own community, despite knowing - as he must - that Muslims, and only Muslims, have the knowledge to find and stop their fanatics."
"It was not Scottish rugby players who blew up the tube trains in London, nor Welsh farmers, nor even English cricketers."
"It was a bunch of brainwashed Muslim youngsters who were looking for 72 vestal virgins in Paradise, believing that they had a God-given right to slaughter non-believers."
"We are not fighting terrorism."
"We are fighting a war of religion, and it is about time we faced up to that distinction."
"Mr President, many colleagues have made wise comments on how to strike the right balance between preventing terrorist acts and safeguarding our civil liberties, especially with respect to data storage and collection."
"I would like to raise the issue of what data is being collected on our citizens and how it is stored and accessed."
"Let me just give one example of data collection which probably affects most colleagues in this hemicycle."
"We frequently travel by air and are customers of airport shops, and any purchase that we make requires the presentation of a boarding pass."
"While different tax rates on perfumes, alcohol and tobacco may justify this, have you ever considered why your boarding pass is needed when you purchase a newspaper?"
"Who needs to know whether you purchase the right-leaning Daily Telegraph or the left-leaning LibÃ©ration?"
"If it served no purpose, why would someone collect it?"
"Secondly, we need to increase safeguards on storage and access to data."
"How on earth will we convince our citizens that the sacrifices they are being asked to make with respect to their personal freedoms are justified if government agencies in Member States have mislaid massive data bases, as was the case in the United Kingdom, or even published them on the internet, as was the case of tax records in Italy?"
"Just these examples show why Commission and Council should listen to the LIBE Committee, which postulates - amongst others - that processing of data revealing political opinions should be prohibited and that the framework decision should also apply to national data processing."
"Only with these and additional safeguards proposed by Parliament will citizens accept the collection of data."
"Without this, we will have a European haystack of information with bits of straw blowing around in the wind and without any hope of finding the proverbial needle, that needle which is the key piece of information that prevents a terrorist atrocity."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt at all that we have to continue fighting terrorism with every resolve."
"I therefore specifically welcome the fact that we are continuing to develop the necessary instruments and adapting them to the insights we have gained."
"One thing must be clear, however: we can win this battle only on the basis of the rule of law."
"Abandoning laws and morals only strengthens, not weakens, terrorism."
"The actions of the Bush administration have shown us this quite plainly."
"Europe can lead by example here."
"The safety and freedom of the general public are always connected to the freedom of the individual, however."
"You only have to look at the Basque region, for example."
"People live in fear and terror, as walking the streets or visiting the wrong bar can have fatal consequences."
"It is our job to protect our citizens from such threats."
"Restrictions on other personal freedoms are occasionally necessary in order to do this."
"Our citizens have to be able to trust that these restrictions are also appropriate, however, and that their data are not being distributed throughout the world by the intelligence services."
"In short: our citizens ought not to have to open their eyes one day and discover that Orwell's visions are no longer a Utopia."
"That is exactly what this is about: guaranteeing the safety of life and limb without destroying privacy."
"At this point I should like to thank both my colleagues, who have submitted two excellent reports here."
"Both make it clear that we are calling for greater efforts by the Council to protect fundamental rights, that we want greater care to be taken and better protection to be afforded when handling personal data."
"We shall give our full and total support to the Council for all meaningful and appropriate measures to combat terrorism."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament will always see to it that all citizens can feel safe, whether on the street, at major events or in their home."
"Freedom is too precious an asset to have it destroyed, no matter by which side."
"We know this well enough from our own painful history in Europe."
"(FR) Mr President, much has already been said, so I will not go on at length about this subject."
"I would simply like to draw attention to a new state of affairs: terrorism has introduced something into our society that did not previously exist."
"Terrorism has allowed governments and taught states to mistrust not an external invader, but all of their citizens, and that is where the difficulty in governing lies."
"There is no exercise more difficult than guaranteeing security and respecting rights."
"From that point of view, I would like to say that the reports by Mrs LefranÃ§ois and Mrs Roure provide an extremely balanced synthesis of the progress needed to ensure the protection of citizens and the protection of their freedom."
"Arbitrating between these two necessities is something governments do not know how to do."
"It is not part of their tradition, and it is something they are currently learning to do bit by bit; it is certainly an honour for the European Parliament and for this chamber to be the ones putting the stamp of balance on the search for progress in these two areas: the security of citizens and the security of their freedom."
"As it is, it seems to me that the framework decision, as amended by the two reports by Mrs Roure and Mrs LefranÃ§ois, is the fruit of several years' work and is therefore extremely precious."
"However, this is only one step along the way."
"Governments have to learn how to strive for a balance between governing citizens and protecting their lives."
"In this respect we can play a valuable part in helping them to make the decisions required, which in my opinion they are incapable of making alone or of applying within the limits of their national borders."
"(PL) Mr President, terrorist attacks like the recent attack in Islamabad clearly demonstrate that terrorism is in fact a terrifying reality."
"We must therefore greet any proposal to combat terrorism effectively, in other words to provide security for the nations of Europe, with satisfaction."
"On the one hand the report under discussion here comes out against these objectives, by attempting to clamp down on the phenomenon of terrorism at the incitement stage, while on the other hand it alludes to the rejected Treaty of Lisbon."
"The objectives stated in the report and its justification are mutually exclusive."
"We cannot combat terrorism effectively without cutting back on or restricting certain citizens' rights."
"This, sadly, is the price we have to pay."
"The European Union has so far not taken any steps aimed at coordinating international action and is simulating combating terrorism in a virtual-cum-verbal sphere."
"On the initiative of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, a 'Committee on CIA Matters' was set up in the European Parliament, which has not succeeded in establishing anything and has merely undermined the fight against terrorism."
"We must cherish the hope that this time, under the pretext of protecting fundamental rights, we shall not be pushing in a similar direction."
"(EL) Mr President, the proposal of the Council and the Commission, with which the report is generally in agreement, is a profoundly reactionary attack on even the most fundamental civil democratic rights and freedoms."
"Its aim is to strengthen the institutional framework of suppression so that it can be used to crush the people's struggles."
"By introducing the new terminology of 'violent radicalisation' culminating in 'extreme ideologies', the proposal arbitrarily criminalises every form of expression, opinion, view and ideological perception calling the exploitative capitalist system into question."
"In conjunction with this, an amendment to the European terrorism law adds three new crimes, all related to use of the Internet."
"Under this medieval institutional framework, repressive mechanisms are allowed to prohibit and punish the circulation of ideas on the pretext that they foster or incite terrorist acts."
"At the same time, according to the same philosophy, forms of struggle and combat that question EU policy and seek to overturn it are considered to be terrorist acts."
"The people must respond with disobedience and unruliness rather than accept these reactionary laws."
"(PL) Mr President, we are talking today about the form of the Council framework decision in respect of the protection of personal data processed as part of police and court cooperation in criminal cases."
"This is a very important matter that requires profound analysis."
"Right at the start of the report, however, there is a reference to the Treaty of Lisbon and the changes its entry into effect will bring about."
"May I remind you that, following the Irish referendum, this Treaty is surely defunct, and it is not right to try to tweak things in this way."
"The Parliamentary amendments proposed in the report will lead to even greater harmonisation than is proposed by the Commission."
"My view is that we should leave it to the Member States to come up with more detailed definitions at national level and not spell everything out in Brussels, and this goes for personal data protection too."
"(EL) Mr President, let me begin by congratulating the two fellow Members who drew up the reports we are discussing today."
"Combating terrorism is unquestionably the common, self-evident aim of us all."
"Nonetheless, our legal set-up requires individual rights and personal data to be protected."
"Thus when it is a matter of Council interference in individual rights, I object completely."
"However, let me focus our attention on another fact."
"The numerous leaks of great amounts of personal data in several Member States have convinced me, so far, that the protection of such data is ineffective."
"Need I remind you of the incidents in the United Kingdom that obliged none other than the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, to apologise to his citizens?"
"Should I remind you that in the United Kingdom, according to a report, half the country's population runs the risk of forgery and bank fraud?"
"Need I remind you that there have already been cases in Germany, too, that are forcing the government to take strict measures?"
"I am sure that in other countries, too, there will be similar incidents that I am not aware of."
"Thus in view of such occurrences, I am very reluctant to accept the transfer of personal data from one country to another."
"I fear that the only result achieved by this procedure will be exactly what the terrorists are aiming for: a reduction in the trust citizens should have in the state."
"This must be avoided."
"(PL) Mr President, the law does not define terrorism, but we all nevertheless know what this phenomenon is based on."
"Thousands of Europeans have experienced for themselves the atrocities perpetrated by terrorists."
"We wish to have a society that is free from the mental contagion that is terror."
"This is why we must arm ourselves."
"We must arm ourselves against this phenomenon, but we must do so wisely and effectively."
"We must combat terrorism, but not according to the retaliatory, albeit biblical, principle of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth'."
"We are a democratic society, and we have inscribed values on the EU's standards in which we profoundly believe - these are fundamental rights, respect for human dignity and protection of privacy, which includes personal data."
"I therefore thank the rapporteurs for their work."
"I am pleased to see the proposal for amendments to the Commission's conclusions, but at the same time I would like to appeal for efficient and harmonised actions that offer everyone protection against terrorist propaganda and agitation, especially our children and young people."
"These individuals, who are most susceptible because they are young, open and trusting, must be protected from the dangerous texts that are being spread via the Internet and other media, often specifically under the banner of freedom of speech."
"Incitement is a good word to define such actions, but it is not enough to write it into the framework decision."
"We need to set up mechanisms, we need to create an efficient European system and good procedures that will enable what we are today calling a crime to be wisely enforced."
"Without such tools, without a common policy on this, we shall not achieve the success we so desire."
"(PL) The debate on what to do about terrorism is becoming increasingly pressing, especially in the light of the tragic events in Pakistan and Spain in recent days."
"The European Union, which has chosen as its objective to provide citizens with a high level of security and justice, is currently facing new challenges and threats because of the development of information and communications technologies, including the Internet."
"The appearance of new methods used by terrorists, such as the creation of thousands of websites used for terrorist propaganda, demands a firm response from the European Union."
"I support the position taken by the rapporteur, Mrs LefranÃ§ois, that the crucial thing is to establish an appropriate legal framework for cyberterrorism with simultaneous protection of the fundamental freedoms and rights of EU citizens as guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Moreover, in my view it is essential that all Member States ratify the Council of Europe's Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament defends freedom of speech throughout Europe - including in Cologne, since Cologne is part of Europe - for anyone who wants to speak out against fundamentalism and Islamic totalitarianism, whose ideological basis is not Islam, but the fundamentalist Islam of terrorism."
"So enough of censorship - let us defend that right!"
"Here there are attempts to do furtive deals and defend the right to liberty by giving the opportunity to anyone who wishes to to speak in the mosques in favour of terrorism; if they include a few words against racism and xenophobia, we can no longer censure them, and we cannot prevent them from spreading their propaganda."
"We have been prevented from speaking and that is why I am gagging myself!"
"Thank you, Mr Borghezio;"
"I think, or rather, I deduce from your decision to gag yourself that we have reached the end of your speech."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as usual, the reports attempt to combine data protection with the prevention of terrorism."
"Of course, we all wish to step up the fight and win the war on terrorism, but frankly I wonder if, since we have both these aims, what we are debating will - as with all compromises - end up toning down the scope of the initiatives."
"Well, police cooperation and protection of individual rights are not infrequently antithetical, but here they manage to find a reasonable balance."
"What is certain, however, is that citizens of the EU are harassed by continuous, not to say suffocating, restrictions on their privacy, and likewise it is certain that this is totally useless in protecting us from terrorists."
"In fact, regardless of the global controls on the communications and movements of persons, terrorists continue to make converts and to sow death."
"Unfortunately, our initiatives do not reach as far as the criminal hand of a certain Islamic radicalism, and so we ought perhaps to take a different approach to combating it."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous speaker has, I believe, wrongly made a connection here."
"What happened in Cologne was not about banning speeches against fundamentalism or speeches by democrats, but the imminent threat to citizens."
"These were right-wing extremists, and their behaviour in public was such as to jeopardise public safety."
"This is something else entirely and cannot be confused, not even for effect here in Parliament - I find this extremely irritating."
"Secondly, the fact that we have agreed on taking action against terrorism here in Parliament is prudent, right and urgently necessary."
"Since this is always difficult to balance with data protection, every single decision is insanely difficult for every individual here in Parliament."
"However, it is true, of course, that when we see things such as what happened at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, or what is happening again now in Spain, when we are constantly being confronted with violence of this kind - and we all know that what these murderers are planning is being planned via modern information channels and then being processed via media using modern information and communication technologies - no other path remains for us either."
"The Commission was right to propose that we endeavour to come to Europe-wide agreements on this."
"It is a difficult balancing act and will remain so."
"First and foremost, however, we have a duty to protect human lives."
"To put it bluntly, what use is data protection if people then die?"
"Therefore, it is right that we simply take a good look here at modern information technologies in relation to the recruitment, financing and implementation of attacks and the glorification of attacks and come to agreements on how to combat them across Europe, and also supplement national regulations on this with European arrangements and agreements."
"This is our imperative duty."
"Action needs to be taken here."
"It is also, ultimately, a positive advertisement for Europe that we are in a position to resolve such important issues, even if the individual decisions are by no means easy."
"(DE) Mr President, I should first of all like to take the opportunity to offer my warm congratulations to the rapporteurs, Mrs LefranÃ§ois and Mrs Roure, as they have achieved something in their reports that, in my view, is of very particular significance."
"Every time terrorism comes up, we have to take great care that we are not serving the aims of the terrorists with the laws we enact, specifically in taking these instruments to our society, which is based on equality, freedom and the rule of law, as this will probably mean they have actually achieved their goal, and none of us wants that."
"It is therefore immensely important to me that there will be substantial restrictions on the transfer of data, that sensitive data may be passed on only in very tightly regulated exceptional cases, and that very strict limits can be imposed on the transfer of data to third countries."
"In addition, I am of the opinion that the word 'provocation' is wrong."
"It is not appropriate for our constitutional system, and the term 'incitement' would certainly have been better."
"In the same way, it is important to ensure there is freedom of the press, freedom of expression, privacy of correspondence and secrecy of telecommunications."
"All I can do now is appeal for this all to happen."
"If we had had the Treaty of Lisbon, I would not now need to be making this appeal, as we would be using the codecision procedure."
"It is good to see, however, that this has exposed those Members up there at the back on the far right who have cursed the Treaty of Lisbon."
"They want fewer citizens' rights, they want less data protection, they want less freedom and they want a weaker Parliament."
"I am sure the electorate will have recognised this next time around."
"Mr President, I naturally support the reports but I find discussing the European Union's combat against terrorism rather strange at this point in time as the presidency has seriously undermined this combat by fixing the People's Mojahedin of Iran to the EU blacklist of terrorist organisations, against the ruling of the European Court of Justice, the European Court of First Instance and the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission of the United Kingdom."
"It has emerged that the previous decision to blacklist the PMOI has allegedly been the result of shady diplomatic bargaining incited by petty national interests."
"The European Union cannot continue deviating from the rule of law and therefore I call on my colleagues to join the newly-formed European committee for justice under the leadership of Vice-President Alejo Vidal-Quadras calling for the immediate removal of the PMOI from the blacklist."
"Mr President, our open democratic societies are a strength, but their very openness can be exploited to become a vulnerability."
"It is this aspect which we are discussing today."
"Of course, security is not just some technical process."
"Security and liberty are complementary, and our strongest protection is a united, cohesive society in each of our nations, based on shared democratic values and mutual trust."
"However, in recent years, our institutions and traditional values have been under constant assault from within and without."
"At the same time, we have seen the growth of subcultures within our own societies that are scornful of our liberal values, deliberately seeking to establish alternative political and legal structures, sometimes through the use of violence, and sheltering behind our complex and generous legal systems and our liberal view of human rights."
"The EU often has not helped."
"Unfortunately, it sees every crisis as an opportunity to extend its own powers and rarely asks whether its actions in one area are having a detrimental effect in another."
"I question, for example, the open-border policy, the lax approach to asylum and immigration and the attempts to introduce the Charter of Fundamental Rights onto the statute book."
"While I am sure we all wish to find ways of combating the threat of terrorism, I am not at all clear why the EU feels it necessary, with its framework decision, to duplicate action that has already been taken in the Council of Europe."
"All EU Member States are members of that body, along with 19 other states, and presumably they will already have legislated appropriately."
"There is, however, an area of Council of Europe competence which would benefit from review, and I refer to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)."
"This is a convention that was drawn up in very different circumstances, over 50 years ago."
"Its judicial interpretation often creates an obstacle to the deportation of terrorists from our countries."
"If we want to do something useful, perhaps we could agree that it would be useful to have a fresh look at the ECHR."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, personal data is sensitive information which must be handled extremely carefully."
"There must be no gaps in data protection; it must work properly."
"That is precisely the aim of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the proposal for the draft Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"I also congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done."
"The Framework Decision will have a considerable impact on one of the basic rights of European Union citizens: the right to privacy."
"Since the European Parliament has always resolutely supported a strong, protective Framework Decision which would make a high level of data protection possible, the Council should give serious consideration to Parliament's amendments."
"Exchange of personal data should be regulated by a standard code of practice which is easy to understand; its role must be to provide reliable protection which guarantees respect for people's basic rights."
"Paramount importance must be given to how personal data are in fact to be used."
"The processing of personal data which reveal a person's racial or ethnic background, political views, religious or philosophical convictions, membership of professional bodies, state of health or sexuality must be regulated as strictly as pharmacies are."
"It must not be restricted only by a clause saying that it is permitted when essential and that safeguards are sufficiently guaranteed - this is too general, exceptions must be spelled out."
"Access to personal data and disclosure of such data must take place within the law, security must be fully guaranteed."
"To that end we need a watertight, specific, protective Framework Decision and a control system."
"Our role is to safeguard our citizens' basic rights and at the same time to discourage terrorism."
"Let us do both with utmost care."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, let me thank the rapporteurs for an excellent piece of work which has significantly improved the Commission's proposals."
"I have previously had difficulty in supporting reports dealing with terrorism, despite the fact that I seriously regard terrorism as one of the most important tests of the Union's credibility and capacity for solidarity and shared responsibility."
"With all due respect for fellow Members from Member States which are afflicted by the madness of terrorism, I have to say that our duty to ensure that democracy is never defended by undemocratic means is paramount."
"The rule of law must be upheld, along with respect for the privacy of citizens."
"The Commission's woolly formulations on the criminalisation of public provocation, alongside other proposals to extend the coverage to utterances excusing terrorism, are so broad and open to interpretation as to risk bringing the purpose of the legislation - to achieve a common level of protection throughout the Union - seriously into disrepute."
"The fight against terrorism must be conducted on a common basis, but with respect for the Union's various legal traditions and standards and, not least, with respect for democratic traditions and values."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning many have spoken here about the war on terrorism, and have gone on to say that it is difficult to wage war on something that is not a concrete entity, does not have an army and does not have a territory, but is simply a tactic."
"This strange war has not been won, and it will certainly be difficult to win it, but there have been some positive results, such as the mere fact that the United States has not suffered any more attacks since 11 September."
"These successes, however, have come at a price, and I share the concern of Mrs LefranÃ§ois, who considers the dividing line between freedom of speech and law-breaking to be sometimes rather blurred, and can see the risk that efforts to increase the security of European citizens will in practice result in restrictions on those citizens' rights and freedoms."
"It is very difficult to find the balance between these two requirements, partly because we are in unknown territory: terrorism is too recent a phenomenon for us to be able to rely on precedents, or to have experience from which to learn."
"There is no doubt that in the name of the war on terrorism illegal acts have been carried out, chiefly by that country which has done most to fight against terrorism, including in our interests - namely, the United States."
"This is because there is a price to be paid for keeping terrorism in check, and that is the restriction of civil liberties."
"On the other hand, it is easy not to make any mistakes when one does little or nothing."
"Hence, in the European Union, if we want to ensure that we have a more secure future, we must do more; we must improve coordination of action by Member States and the initiatives taken by the secret services and, above all, we must not leave the United States to bear the burden of this responsibility alone."
"If we do this, we will perhaps be able to try to make our principles prevail, as well as our ideas about that blurred line between citizens' security and breaches of human rights."
"(RO) Cooperation between EU institutions in the fight against terrorism must work perfectly, especially as this phenomenon has intensified."
"Terrorism has become the main enemy of stability and world peace."
"If we think of the events of September 11 or the ones in Madrid and London a few years ago, we have the perfect depiction of terror, fear, and suffering."
"In order to safeguard the security of citizens, we need to take urgent action in the fight against terrorism, in close cooperation with local and regional authorities."
"No element in the framework decision can be construed as a reduction of or constraint on fundamental rights and liberties, such as the freedom of expression, of association, or of assembly."
"The expression of radical, polemical or controversial opinions concerning sensitive political issues, terrorism included, does not fall within the scope of the framework decision."
"As long as we keep a balance between respect for liberties and protecting the security of citizens, any initiative should be welcomed."
"(SL) The two reports on the framework decisions form two further pieces in the jigsaw of a broad range of regulations, directives and other documents relating to the fight against terrorism."
"I support both reports because I believe we need both framework decisions and because a reasonable balance has been struck between measures to ensure security and freedom of the individual."
"I consider that in future the Commission and Council need to pay greater attention to the following issues."
"Firstly, the burgeoning growth in anti-terrorism laws and the provision of greater transparency in such laws."
"In this regard too, we have unnecessary and impractical laws or provisions in them which need to be rethought or repealed after assessment."
"Secondly, the applicability of laws and thus the effective combating of terrorism do not depend solely on sound legislation but also on effective cooperation between the Member States and their police and security services."
"Here we have not yet achieved the proper level of cooperation."
"We need to examine and compare the control mechanisms available to the European Union and the Member States."
"We need to pay particular attention to cases of database loss or misuse, and there should also be a mutual exchange of information on this matter between the Member States."
"Finally, we need to do more to raise public awareness to make it easier for people to understand why certain measures are necessary."
"Congratulations on both reports."
"(BG) Regrettably, the latest developments in Pakistan come as further categorical evidence of the timeliness of today's discussion."
"This discussion must provide a clear and categorical answer to two questions of principle: in the first place, whether we have really done enough by the proposed document to help the fight against crime, and in the second place, whether in doing so we have respected human rights and have provided adequate protection to our citizens' personal data."
"During its long history, this document has seen a lot of controversy and has undergone a lot of changes, and I would like to give special credit to the rapporteurs for the fine work they have done to achieve, ultimately, in a consensual and balanced text."
"Particular attention should be paid to the amendments proposed in Mrs Roure's report, which require collection of personal data for lawful purposes and observance of Convention 108, as well as mandatory informing the data subject of the purposes for which the data concerning him are being processed."
"Nevertheless, some provisions proposed by the Council give reason for concern."
"I entirely back Mrs Roure's proposal to drop Article 1, paragraph 1 of the Council Proposal, which practically exempts cases of national security from the effect of the present Framework Decision."
"I am convinced that if this provision is kept, the legislative decision on which we will take a vote within hours will make it possible to circumvent the law and even to abuse it because ""national securityâ is an all too general notion and lends itself to various interpretations."
"Recently, for example, there was a case in Bulgaria in which unauthorised retrieval of data, personal data, from the National Health Insurance Fund was attempted, and this attempt was frustrated only by the prompt action taken by the management of the Fund."
"The control functions, the powers of the national supervisory authorities and of the European Data Protection Supervisor, must be augmented."
"Unfortunately, the analysis shows that these authorities are rather and quite often used only for observance of the specific provisions of the law but actually do not possess any sanctioning or investigating functions."
"An increase of these functions must be recommended to the Member States of the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to discuss the second report first of all, namely the Framework Decision on combating terrorism."
"We know that actions to combat terrorism are needed, as it is a fact that there are over 300 Al-Qaeda initiatives within the European Union and over 500 websites available, which even contain instructions on how to make bombs."
"This is clear, and I believe that it is necessary to try to maintain a balance; that is, to protect fundamental freedoms but also, on the other hand, to take every conceivable measure to prevent deadly terrorist activities."
"I should like to highlight one point here."
"I believe that the European Parliament would be making a crucial mistake if it were to amend the concepts and replace 'public provocation to commit a terrorist offence' with 'incitement'."
"This is for the very simple reason that proof of incitement cannot be produced until people have already died - but then it is too late."
"Nobody would be able to understand or accept this."
"If, however, public provocation is included in this legal act, there is the possibility of intervening if general disobedience to a law is provoked or action is provoked that is punishable in relation to terrorist activity."
"This means there is the opportunity to save lives before a terrorist act is committed."
"I would regret it, therefore, if Parliament were to take the wrong path here and amend these concepts - for the further reason that the Council of Europe has laid down that the concept of public provocation should exist."
"If I have understood correctly, the Council and Commission are also of this opinion, to which we should be subscribing - and this is an appeal to you all - and leaving the term 'public provocation' in, as this enables lives to be saved before terrorist activities take place."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Roure for drawing up her report on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"There is no question that the swift adoption of a framework decision on personal data protection in the third pillar will help to protect the personal data, private life and fundamental rights of all citizens of the Member States."
"This matter is a priority for us socialists."
"This is not just because the current legal solutions in this area are inadequate; it is most importantly because of its significance for everyone living in the EU."
"It is my view that the legal act drawn up previously by the Council contained too many gaps."
"It guaranteed protection only to a minimal and certainly not an adequate extent."
"Because of this, I fully support the rapporteur's proposed amendments to the Council's draft, with which we were not satisfied, particularly those relating to the protection of data relating to DNA, health or the sexual orientation of citizens."
"All data relating to personal and sensitive spheres of life such as racial and ethnic origin or information relating to religious convictions or world views require special protection and their processing should be admissible only in exceptional situations that are precisely defined in the law, and with the consent of a court."
"It is also of exceptional importance that the rapporteur has taken the trouble to regulate the problem of data protection when the data are further processed, passed to third countries or passed to private entities, because it is precisely at these stages that abuse most commonly occurs."
"What we need is a precise framework decision that will protect data to an extent that is at least on a level with that guaranteed in the first pillar by the 1995 Directive and Convention 108."
"Mr President, I sometimes fear that the fact that this House so frequently debates terrorism reflects a worrying absence of consensus on our response to it."
"Surely the terrorist atrocities perpetrated over decades around the world, including the recent bomb attack in Islamabad, should have opened our eyes to its true, evil nature and the need to stand resolutely and unequivocally against the existential threat it poses to western democracy and way of life."
"I welcome, therefore, EU countries working together to define and inflict heavy criminal penalties on those who incite terrorism."
"I remember the demonstrations in London that coincided with the publication of cartoons in Denmark depicting the prophet Mohammed."
"We, of course, are proud in Europe of our rights to free speech and expression, and protesters carrying placards calling for the beheading of those who insult Islam clearly crossed the boundary between free speech and hate speech inciting violence."
"In the UK we have recently been debating limits on pre-trial detention without charge on suspicion of involvement in terrorism."
"I am personally of the opinion that we need to give the police and security services the resources they need to protect our citizens, subject, of course, to rigid legal safeguards."
"That is certainly what most people in my country and the rest of Europe want, according to opinion polls."
"Furthermore, with regard to data retention, I am often dismayed at the way this House takes such an absolutist rather than a balanced approach to civil liberties."
"Again, provided there are clear safeguarding rules in place on how the information is shared, we need to support our law enforcement authorities."
"Finally, the EU should place Hezbollah on the list of proscribed terrorist organisations."
"Not to have done so in the past in the face of prima facie evidence demonstrates an apparent lack of EU resolve that is giving succour to those who would destroy our way of life in a democracy."
"Mr President, information exchange between our Member State police forces is essential to combat terrorist threats and indeed prevents atrocities."
"Many atrocities have been prevented by such exchanges on my own island of Ireland."
"For a long time Ireland and the UK were reluctant to do so due to deep-seated distrust."
"The consequences were horrific."
"It would be no surprise, therefore, that I broadly support information exchange."
"However, I am concerned, as are my colleagues, that the Council's revised proposals bear insufficient protection for personal data as outlined in Martine Roure's report."
"We will not defeat the likes of ETA and the IRA and others who despise democracy and human rights by undermining our democratic norms ourselves."
"I appeal, therefore, to the Commission and Council to take seriously our concerns as directly-elected politicians."
"It is essential that the progress of the European Union is not blocked and that we avoid giving the impression that the EU can act beyond the law of Member States."
"I had hoped we could have dealt with these matters under Lisbon's new codecision procedures."
"Unfortunately that is not possible right now, but we must continue to work to enhance the legitimacy of this Parliament and the European Union."
"We will not do so if we undermine personal rights."
"Mr President, I welcome this report."
"I want to say at the outset that I strongly support the fight against terrorism, and I have spent all my political life opposing IRA and Loyalist terrorism in Ireland, so please take that as stated."
"But we must ensure that we have sufficient checks and balances to protect citizens from state terrorism or abuse of data by the state, the Union, or by journalists, organisations, individuals, or agencies for that matter, those who steal or otherwise come into possession of information which is private and confidential."
"The cure must not become worse than the disease."
"The storage and disposal of such data is a crucial part of this safeguard."
"Any attempt at embarrassing individuals or any form of attempted blackmail - be it political, financial or otherwise - should be a particular offence and should be strongly condemned by all right-thinking people."
"The disposal of this data is often left to the private sector to destroy after a certain period of time has passed by."
"I, for one, am not satisfied that the private sector, in particular - or, for that matter, the public sector - have in place sufficient safeguards for the destruction of data which is no longer needed in the fight against terrorism."
"I believe there should be the severest penalties for those who do not protect private information and leave this open to abuse and misinterpretation, whether those persons are in the public or private sector, and I urge the Commission to take this into account."
"Our job as parliamentarians is to ensure that democracy can survive."
"We must, therefore, ensure that we have all the tools we need to fight terrorism tooth and nail, but that does not mean we can be careless with the reputations, the confidentiality or the privacy of our citizens, and I urge the Commission to take that into account."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, terrorism represents one of the most serious threats to democracy and to economic and social development in Europe and throughout the world."
"Modern information and communication technologies unfortunately play a significant role in the propagation of the terrorist threat."
"The cheap, fast, easily accessible and globally available internet is often misused by terrorists to disseminate terrorist information and to recruit new members and sympathisers."
"I therefore welcome the Council Framework Decision amending Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA on combating terrorism, among other things because it includes the criminal offences of incitement to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism."
"I welcome this amendment because I am convinced that it is essential to find an international response to the international threat of terrorism."
"No single EU Member State can handle this problem on its own."
"There is a need for coordinated efforts by all Member States."
"In a democracy, in the democratic Union of European states, however, the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the framework of a democratic rule of law, given human and civil rights."
"I therefore support the amendments proposed by our two rapporteurs on the strengthening of just these elements."
"In conclusion, I should like to urge all those involved, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, towards the rapid adoption of the compromise proposal."
"(RO) In the third millennium, the beauty of the global village is being threatened by global terrorism."
"Since individual countries, owing to the principle of subsidiarity, can control only 10-15% of cyberspace, the rest being the concern of private entities and families, we believe that a global approach is required for the first time, and the response to global terrorism should be a new concept, ""Global care of the global villageâ."
"Through such an approach and through a strategy for the protection of global cyberspace, the European Union will prove its preoccupation with world security as well as with its own security."
"Mr President, in spite of its horrible consequences, international terrorism is still, sadly, a controversial subject."
"We want protection, but we protest at the cost and distress to authorities when they propose to implement measures to that effect."
"We deplore the terrorist attacks, but we protest at the limitations to the full exercise of our rights, in spite of the fact that we know very well that the perpetrators are abusing our democratic system."
"Ideally any limitation of our rights should be compensated by a corresponding increase in our security in the face of terrorist attacks."
"Equally, we tend to resist legislative uniformisation against terrorism, although we know that the consequences are similarly destructive."
"Furthermore, attacks might increase in frequency when the punishment is milder."
"Therefore, to have an effective protection against terrorism, perhaps we should make up our minds and reconcile first these conflicting views."
"Mr President, hardly a day goes by without a terrorist act."
"Terrorism is a fulminant infection in the body of our society."
"Like any infection, if left untreated, it will keep spreading until it incapacitates, or even kills, the patient."
"Drastic measures are called for."
"Some of those measures are controversial and undoubtedly infringe somewhat on personal freedoms but, on balance, they are necessary."
"In an ideal world, strict personal data protection is paramount but, in a terrorism-sick world, concessions must unfortunately be made."
"Exceptional circumstances call for exceptional measures."
"I feel that this is the spirit in which we must look at decisions on combating terrorism."
"If we absolutely have to choose between some minor compromises on personal liberties and a much more effective way of fighting terrorism, it is my opinion that we should choose the latter."
"I conclude with the following question: if promoting certain atrocious crimes like paedophilia on the internet is a crime - and rightly so - why should it not be so for promoting terrorism?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of pensioners and the pensioners' party which sent me here to the European Parliament, I would like to express our view on how to combat terrorism: the financial funds of the European Parliament and Europe ought to go in greater measure towards alleviating the sufferings of the people from whom the terrorists receive the greatest assistance."
"These funds must be controlled, so that they are used for the benefit of the people and not for the illegitimate interests of certain corrupt leaders."
"Therefore, I believe they should be used for the 'Marshall Plan' proposed by Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, to aid the people of Palestine."
"(RO) I would refer to Mrs. Roure's report."
"The right to the protection of personal data is a fundamental right."
"Those citizens whose data are being processed have rights which must be respected both at national level and at EU level."
"There are numerous EU regulations and directives which require an exchange of information concerning the offences committed by European citizens in a Member State other than their state of residence."
"Cases in point are the Regulation on access to the road freight business, or the Directive facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety."
"All these European regulations require the set-up of information systems capable of relaying notifications and information between the Member States."
"All the corresponding IT systems must include a public component as well as a secure component containing data about offences committed in Member States; the latter should be accessible only to the relevant institutions, and only in compliance with personal data protection regulations."
"Mr President, having seen further savage terrorism in recent days in Pakistan, Spain and Jerusalem and, in my own country, several renewed IRA terrorist attempts, none of us can be complacent about the vile scourge of terrorism."
"However, it is naive to think that there is a pan-European panacea."
"Yes, we need effective extradition and, yes, we need effective cooperation, but legislation so harmonised as to reduce it to the lowest common denominator is more of a hindrance than a help."
"First and foremost these are matters for national decision."
"The United Kingdom, for example, is attempting to provide for 42-day detention, which is more than I think is necessary, but London, not Brussels, has the right to make that decision."
"Under the approach in these proposals, we would soon strip away that discretion from Member States."
"That might suit the EU's expansionist agenda, but it will not defeat terrorism."
"(RO) As a representative of Romanian citizens, I believe that it is extremely important that the European Parliament takes part in the decision-making process concerning the protection of personal data collected in the context of law enforcement."
"We should take into account that the European citizens' right to data protection is fundamental; but at the same time the institutions involved in the fight against terrorism and crime must have access to such information."
"This report plays a particularly important role in the creation of the legal framework laying down the quality, definition and characteristics of personal data and their transfer to third states or individuals."
"I commend the provision stating that data should be kept no longer than necessary, and Member States are called upon to put into place the procedural and technical measures meant to enforce these limitations."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleagues, Mrs LefranÃ§ois and Mrs Roure, on their reports, but also to take this opportunity to say that the French police have just arrested a major terrorist, and I therefore congratulate the French Government and the French police."
"I think that the political authorities in all countries should cooperate with our police, our judges and our governments."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the European Parliament as a whole on the high standard of this debate."
"The European Parliament is indeed legitimately awaiting the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, but it has demonstrated maturity this morning by producing a very large majority in support of your two reports - the report by Mrs LefranÃ§ois and the report by Mrs Roure."
"These two reports seek to find the right balance between collective protection against terrorism, which we need to guarantee for our citizens, and individual protection of our freedoms."
"I believe it is there, in this dual balance, that we have to seek the right solutions."
"Mr President, I will very briefly sum up the discussion."
"I will first go back to the report by Mrs LefranÃ§ois on combating terrorism."
"I would just like to say that although freedom of expression, including the right of criticism, is one of the fundamental pillars on which the European Union is built, incitement to racial hatred cannot be considered acceptable under the pretext of freedom of expression."
"Racist discourse is an abuse of freedom of expression and cannot be tolerated."
"Next, I would like to remind you that the Commission's proposal was drawn up on the basis of an in-depth impact assessment."
"Many consultations were held, and the Commission's proposal is indeed based on the Council of Europe Convention for the Prevention of Terrorism and we have tried to follow the balanced formulation of offences in the Convention."
"If Mrs LefranÃ§ois and the many MEPs who have come out in support of the term 'incitement' will allow me, I would like just like to spend a couple of minutes defending the term 'provocation'."
"The advantage of the term 'provocation' is that it is new."
"That is why the Council of Europe used it; its newness means it can have a common and precise definition in the European Union."
"Provocation is not a concept open to interpretation."
"I believe it can be properly identified through case law."
"What is correct is that we want to avoid any kind of terrorist attack actually occurring while criminalising those who, mainly through what they have said, have called for such an attack even if one did not take place, and that is where the problem lies."
"I will leave it to the wisdom of the dialogue between the Council and Parliament, however, to find a solution."
"I would also like to say that Article 1(2) of the current text of the framework decision contains a human rights safeguard clause that concerns - I think Mrs LefranÃ§ois agrees - the whole framework decision."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like to emphasise the value of placing this action to combat terrorism within the integrated institutional framework of the European Union."
"By inserting this text into European law, we have a guarantee of its efficacy."
"For specific acts, it will give us a uniform legal framework regarding the nature and level of criminal sanctions and jurisdictional rules."
"Consequently, it will be possible to apply the European Union's cooperation mechanisms referred to in the 2002 framework decision."
"To sum up, Mr President, while thanking the rapporteur and Parliament again for all the work they have done over the last two years on this important matter, I would like to hope that a decision will now be taken quickly in view of all the work done and the need - as many of you have underlined - to effectively combat terrorism."
"Now I come to the second text, which is inseparable from the first, and I think it was a good idea of Parliament to link them together, demanding data protection and protection of personal freedom at the same time."
"My thanks, of course, go to Mrs Roure, who has defended this balance, and data protection, so energetically."
"It was indeed important for this text to come at the same time as the text on combating terrorism, so that the forces of law and order could have specific rules on data protection in the near future."
"As I have said, and I do not want to overstate this, like Parliament, the Commission obviously wanted to go further on data protection."
"The Minister, Mr Jouyet, mentioned that the French Presidency had to take account of whether a compromise could be achieved, although it wanted the same thing."
"I can simply say, then, that the Commission will try to put the evaluation clause and 'whereas 6a' to good use."
"We are therefore listening to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and will try to take account of your desire for an ambitious revision of the framework decision to evaluate the extension of its scope."
"In any case, that is what the Commission can do and what I personally will try to do."
"I know the European Parliament would like this revision to take place quite soon."
"I only hope the Council will agree to a revision within a timescale that enables the European measure to be sorted out very soon."
"That is all I wanted to say, Mr President."
"I would also like to make clear to each of the speakers that I appreciated the high standard of the debate on such an important matter - a matter in which Europe must set an example - both by guaranteeing effective collective protection against terrorist threats and also, of course, by remaining very attentive to the protection of individual freedoms and personal autonomy."
"I think Parliament has once again clearly demonstrated its maturity and its ability in future to be co-decision maker on this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank all my fellow Members who have spoken this morning for the high standard of their speeches."
"The sheer number of them clearly demonstrates the level of interest in this issue."
"Without going back over all the various speeches in detail, I would just like to mention three or four of them."
"Mr Fava clearly showed what a difficult exercise this is."
"We need to avoid a culture of suspicion and mistrust, but at the same time we need to think about the context and to guarantee both the security of citizens and the protection of freedoms."
"Mr de Grandes Pascual explained clearly the added value of the definition of terrorism, saying that the definition we were using was more important, and also insisting on the list of offences."
"As this is about working together to combat terrorism, we need to send a firm message, while protecting individual freedoms."
"Mr Demetriou, you mentioned the scourge that terrorism represents, and which we need to combat."
"However, you used the term 'public incitement', saying that it was a concept better understood by all the Member States."
"Mrs Ludford also shares this concern."
"She also felt the term was more appropriate, given that we do need to safeguard fundamental freedoms."
"The report is indeed the outcome of a long and tricky negotiating process."
"I do believe, though, that we can be satisfied with the result, particularly from the point of view of the balance between combating terrorism and respecting fundamental freedoms."
"The report by my colleague Mrs Roure falls firmly within this second category, since the protection of personal data is one of its key components."
"I have just one regret, which I know is shared by many people in Parliament, particularly my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. It is the fact that the implementation of a text with such a big impact on the freedoms of European citizens is not subject to the full jurisdictional control of the Court of Justice."
"For this to be the case, it would have been necessary to adopt the framework decision under the Treaty of Lisbon regime."
"Even before the 'no' vote in the Irish referendum and question mark over the entry into force of the new Treaty on 1 January 2009, the Council clearly had a desire to move as quickly as possible to avoid the switch to codecision."
"In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs we nevertheless tried to work in the most conscientious and detailed manner, while keeping up with the pace set by the Council."
"At the vote in committee on 15 July, my draft report was adopted by 35 votes to 4 with 1 abstention, and I hope it will attract a solid majority in plenary too."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would first like to thank all my fellow Members because this debate has shown that the European Parliament was united on a really tricky subject, and we are the representatives of the European Parliament, we are the representatives of the people."
"It is worth pointing this out."
"Today I am addressing the French Presidency in particular."
"We are asking the Council to fulfil commitments made a long time ago by several successive presidencies."
"It is absolutely necessary to adopt this framework decision quickly and take account of the European Parliament's amendments."
"The Council must be true to its word."
"We absolutely must work in an atmosphere of trust."
"That is essential."
"I hope this message will be passed on to Mrs Dati, who unfortunately is absent from this priority debate, which we are very disappointed about."
"I would also particularly like to thank Commissioner Barrot for his support, which is very valuable to us."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) The establishment of a legal framework for personal data protection within the third pillar has been a concern shared by all EU presidents over the last years."
"Nevertheless, the framework decision adopted in 2006 was something of a compromise, establishing the lowest common denominator in the protection of personal data."
"Therefore, we can but welcome a new EP consultation on the extension of the scope of the framework decision and on an analysis of its impact on fundamental rights."
"The main objective of the changes should be to ensure the same level of data protection as for the first pillar; from this point of view, I regret that the Commission's initial proposal has been modified by the Council."
"Equally regrettable is the fact that the provision concerning the working group of national data protection authorities was removed by the Council, which is a setback in the process of creating an effective personal data protection system."
"Ã®n scris. - (RO) The effective protection of personal data remains a natural requirement of modern democracy."
"If under certain circumstances this protection requires the modification of community databases so as to prevent the correlation of certain personal or material information with identifiable persons, we should be aware that the management of this global system for the storage and processing of information implies a state-of-the-art security system."
"As real security cannot be guaranteed simply by our endorsement of a set of common principles, I believe that what is needed is a pragmatic analysis of the risks involved by cooperation between the law enforcement and the judiciary of countries with varying levels of expertise in the field."
"For the sake of clarity, I would like to reiterate the need of new Member States for a fast transfer of expertise in the field, so as to prevent any prejudice to the global security of the system."
"in writing. - (RO) Given the growth of terrorism and its inclusion of cyberspace, the possibility of manipulating the masses faster, and the limited possibilities of identifying terrorists quickly enough, I believe that such a decision is welcome in the overall context of protecting the civil rights and freedoms of every citizen and of creating a favourable framework for the quick identification and tackling of crime, particularly of crimes against the security of persons, countries and national infrastructure."
"I welcome the decision to consider the objectives set in the framework decision as being of major European interest, particularly as regards common regulations on personal data protection, which will enable Member States to enforce the same rules and principles."
"Moreover, I think a recommendation is needed with respect to the classification of information by reference to international classifications, so as to eliminate all the differences between Member Sates and other states in the enforcement of security measures."
"There are two basic strategies that should be taken into account in ensuring the protection of data and security systems: ""Whatever is not expressly forbidden, is allowedâ, and ""Whatever is not expressly allowed, is forbiddenâ."
"The question of the increased threat to Europe from terrorist acts is one of the most important challenges facing the security of our continent."
"Today we are threatened by political terror controlled by states that declare cooperation with us, and groups of a criminal nature, but it seems that the greatest threat facing us is that posed by Islamic fundamentalism."
"I am amazed by the lack of concern on the part of those who govern Europe."
"Our total openness to an unlimited number of newcomers from Islamic countries, as favoured by socialists and liberals, will bring a wave of tragedies for the Community's populace in the future."
"Unlimited Islamisation of Europe is not on!"
"Let us give aid to poor countries, but let us not turn our continent into a place where the limits of people's tolerance are tested."
"Newcomers are currently demanding ever increasing rights, and the traditional peoples of Europe have to consent to all of it along with the destruction of traditions that go back many centuries."
"This is dangerous."
"One example of what this may lead to is Northern Ireland, and the groups warring with each other there are simply people practising different Christian religions."
"in writing. - The attacks of 11 September 2001 have utterly changed the world."
"The terrorist attacks of that day have not only altered how Americans see and understand the world but have also offered democratic societies all over the world a new perspective on this modern world, in which terrorist threats of attacks such as those that devastated Madrid (March 2004) and London (July 2005) pose a frequent and daunting challenge."
"Now terrorists are using modern means of communication, such as the internet, to push for training, recruiting, and planning attacks."
"The use of this technology presents a unique threat to the Union, and we should all work together to combat terrorism with all the means that are at our disposal."
"However, in order for our democratic society to effectively counter these threats, the fight against terrorism must be accompanied by a strengthening of our fundamental rights and freedoms."
"To address the threat of terrorism, it is necessary to have common provisions in the EU, and existing legislation should be amended accordingly."
"Modern terrorism has a new way of operating, but it must be fought by the EU with the same strength and determination demonstrated in fighting traditional terrorism."
"Mr President, I will be brief."
"I speak under Rule 145 to rebut remarks and comments made about me by Dame Sarah Ludford in her speech in this debate."
"She said a number of things, but in particular she said that I was 'a Europhobe' and that in relation to extradition, I would 'give a cheery wave to criminals who made it to the Channel'."
"I would like to correct her factually."
"I am not a Europhobe."
"I love the continent of Europe, its history, its culture, its achievements as much as anybody, but I am an EU-phobe."
"I hate the European Union, which is anti-democratic and undemocratic."
"In relation to the European arrest warrant and the trials in absentia, what I want is for an English or Scottish court to be able to consider prima facie evidence against a suspect before granting extradition and, indeed, have the power to prevent it."
"They must be able to decide that there is a proper case to answer and that a fair trial will be given."
"I do this in order to protect the interests of British citizens, such as exemplified by the case of Andrew Symeou, a 19-year-old London man who faces extradition to Greece on 30 September on a manslaughter charge."
"The evidence against him is extremely suspect, and no account can be taken of that or the fact that witnesses have been allegedly tortured in order to extract statements from them."
"I understand Dame Sarah's sensitivity on this issue since her party, the Liberal Democrats, have obviously backed the wrong horse and she fears - quite rightly - the electoral consequences in 2009."

"- Concerning paragraph 31:"
"rapporteur. - (ES) In order to take into account recent legal decisions, I am tabling this oral amendment, which I will read out in English:"
"'customs authorities continue to confiscate, as an extraordinary measure only, the cars of Greek nationals', I add, 'provisionally', and I add the last sentence: 'takes note of the ruling of the European Court of Justice C-156/04 (07.06.2007) that deems satisfactory most of the explanations provided by the Greek authorities in this case; welcomes the implementation of new legislation adopted by the latter in the purpose of addressing the shortcomings highlighted in the aforementioned ruling;'."
"I see no objections to that oral amendment."
"- After the vote:"
"Madam President, looking at our efficient voting time, I think I can make a short but justified remark."
"In the name of those who can, and do, read the results on the screen, I would like to express my gratitude for your efficient way of doing that."
"I hope that the other presidents - including Mr PÃ¶ttering, who is very efficient - will follow that example."
"Thank you."

"(For the results and other details on the vote: see minutes.)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Madam President, this is a report that gives me the opportunity to mention the City of Liverpool, which is in my constituency."
"It has enjoyed the benefits of being City of Culture and has performed extremely well in that role, and the people of Liverpool have responded magnificently to it."
"Whilst many of the aims of the European Year are laudable in this report, we have to consider the budgetary implications that accompany it."
"Excessive bureaucracy and the focus on state-led efforts to foster what is termed 'creativity and innovation' are not really to be welcomed."
"It would be a much better use of taxpayers' money if we removed these types of promotional exercises and concentrated simply on giving people real choice of decision-making."
"(NL) Madam President, is it any wonder that some Member States are demonstrating aid fatigue - to quote this report verbatim?"
"I think not."
"Ever more Member States and other donors have had enough of continuing to pump funds into all manner of corrupt regimes that really do not give two hoots about good governance or the prosperity of their own citizens."
"Approximately one year ago we learned from an unimpeachable source, the aid agency Oxfam, that the wars in Africa had already cost roughly the same as the hundreds of billions of euros in development aid received by the continent in the last few years."
"It is time Africa took meaningful steps in the fields of democracy, good governance and the fight against corruption first of all."
"Only then can we talk of highly targeted development aid."
"Simply advocating without qualification an increase in development funds and presenting all manner of percentages as dogma is totally irresponsible, and so I voted against this report."
"(NL) Madam President, it is a clichÃ©, but young people are our future, and so I would be the first to admit that the quality of our instructors and of teacher education is extremely important."
"The question is, of course, whether it is for the European Parliament to lecture the Member States on this."
"Is it for Parliament to express its opinion on the composition of the teaching workforce at all levels of school education in the Member States?"
"Must education in the Member States conform rigidly to the 'multicultural society' - we know what is meant by this - and must education in the Member States conform to the 'gender aspect', whatever that may be?"
"Must all this be made compulsory in teacher education because Europe says so?"
"As far as I am concerned, Parliament can think what it wants, but it has absolutely no competence in this sphere."
"Education falls within the competence of the Member States, and that is the way it should stay, in my opinion."
"This is known as subsidiarity, and must be respected."
"(FI) Madam President, I wish to say a few words about this report by Mrs Badia i Cutchet on improving the quality of teacher education, which I think is an excellent one."
"It is true that teacher education very largely falls within the competence of national governments, and so it should."
"Since, however, we have a common aim of promoting pan-European Union competence, knowledge and innovation and of developing the European Economic Area, we need to have certain common rules."
"That is why we also need wider forms of cooperation in the exchange of best practices in the area of teacher training, because at present, as we all know, there are differences between the course levels for teachers in the Member States which are simply far too great, according to the OECD's PISA survey."
"This gulf has to be narrowed and we need a mechanism, an open coordination system at EU level, so that all children and young people can receive an adequately sound basic education."
"In this respect the report is excellent."
"I would urge you all, if you have not read it yet, to read Mrs Badia i Cutchet's splendid report."
"Thank you."
"(SK) I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the report on the Bologna Process and its impact on student mobility."
"The introduction of harmonisation of the three-cycle system of higher education in the countries of the European Union, quality assurance and, above all, the recognition of qualifications represent a fundamental objective of this intergovernmental initiative."
"In today's vote, I unequivocally supported Doris Pack's report, in which the rapporteur emphasises the partnership approach and cooperation in policy-making and implementation of the Bologna Process."
"This initiative represents an example of dynamic cooperation not only among EU countries, but also beyond."
"I also agree with the view that the mutual recognition of qualifications should be further simplified and that the Bologna Process should be more uniform at the national level in Member States."
"Support for student mobility is a basic prerequisite for the creation of a European Higher Education Area."
"(DE) Madam President, the Rasmussen report is entitled 'hedge funds and private equity'."
"If we look at the content of this report more closely, it has virtually nothing to do with hedge funds and private equity any more, but now rightly refers to the financial institutions and financial players as a whole."
"This is important."
"We have proposed a list of items for regulating the financial markets and eliminating the chaos in these markets."
"I am pleased that Mr Rasmussen largely adopted our position in the negotiations with us."
"Madam President, the European Union is a solution in search of a problem."
"Whatever the question is, the answer is always more regulation, and so these recent events in the financial markets have been predictably seized on as a justification for further Brussels rules."
"I am reminded of the situation that pertained after the attacks of 11 September 2001, when a number of proposals for the harmonisation of justice and home affairs, which had been kicking around for years, were repackaged as anti-terrorism measures and, in the febrile atmosphere that followed those terrible attacks, nobody wanted to be seen voting against."
"Similarly, a bunch of legislation for which there is really no proportionate need in remedying the problem is now being repackaged as a measure for financial stability, and it would take a brave MEP to risk being seen as a speculator's friend, as we saw in the result of the vote today."
"I must say that, looking at the underlying causes of the recent financial problems, it seems to me that 'too much government' was the problem, not the solution."
"Interest rates were kept at too low a rate for too long, and that was a problem in Europe, in the United States and in Japan."
"If too much government was the problem, it is difficult to see how we can solve that problem by additional regulation at Brussels level."
"Madam President, in many ways I would echo the comments of my good friend and colleague, Mr Hannan, in relation to the Lehne report, because in many ways the Lehne report is yet another attempt to impose legislation and regulation on the markets."
"We should not rush to judgement here."
"Nor should we rush to judgement to impose regulation and legislation in respect of markets as a whole in Europe."
"Markets, by their definition, are different."
"Markets in Europe, in the different countries, are different, and therefore we should not try to impose a blanket coverage of regulation which would apply to all of them."
"The essential thing Europe and the European Union has to remember at all times in these matters is that we are in a global environment."
"Europe and the individual nations of Europe are competing with the world, and, if we erect barriers against ourselves, then we will damage our own interests and those of the people we represent."
"(DE) Madam President, I am speaking here also on behalf of the Austrian People's Party delegation."
"We voted in favour of this report, quite simply because we have to do everything we can to combat terrorism in good time."
"I should like to draw attention to one point, however, against which we would speak out most decisively, as I am of the opinion that Parliament has made a mistake."
"We should not be replacing the crime of 'public provocation to commit a terrorist offence' with the crime of 'incitement to commit a terrorist offence', for the very simple reason that proof of incitement cannot be provided until the act has already taken place; that is, until people may have already died."
"We are in favour of the possibility of timely intervention when a terrorist act has not yet been committed - that is, beforehand - so that lives can be saved."
"(NL) Madam President, I am of course in favour of combating terrorism effectively, and I consider this particular field - the fight against terrorism - to be one that requires very intensive cross-border cooperation in Europe."
"For once, therefore, I am less in agreement - you could say in disagreement - with the more Eurosceptic voices."
"I feel that, in this field, they are playing the national sovereignty card too rigidly."
"Having said that, we should have the courage to speak rather more clearly - in this report, too, for example."
"Terrorism in Europe originates from the extreme left and/or Islam."
"So does incitement to terrorism, and this is taking place not least in some of the mosques, answerable to nothing and no one, that are currently shooting up like mushrooms in Europe."
"There lies the heart of the problem of 21st century Europe."
"Islam is incompatible with our Western values and freedoms, and I fear that we shall come to heartily regret our open-door and open-border policy."
"Madam President, this is an important matter."
"It is probably one of the most important matters that we face in the West today - the threat of international terrorism."
"I probably depart a little from my own party on this, in that I take the view that, if we have to pay a price in civil liberty to protect the true liberty of our citizens - namely their health, safety and well-being - then that price will have to be paid."
"During the Second World War, measures were taken in my country which were not in accordance with civil liberties, in order to protect the population from the external threat."
"People accepted it."
"We face today, in Europe and in the civilised world, a threat from those who are not civilised and who do not regard human life as sacred and something to be sanctified."
"Therefore, if we need to have laws to prevent them doing their evil work, then we should have them and have them speedily."
"(PL) The attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 made the whole world aware of what a huge threat organised terrorist movements are."
"Thanks to access to modern technologies, these groups have got their hands on previously unattainable means of communication, which, in conjunction with black markets for weapons, make them the number one enemy of the democratic world today."
"Despite taking firm action, the European Union has not succeeded in protecting itself from such events."
"In recognising the particular need to act in order to guarantee the security of EU citizens, I wish to make the point that the best way of combating organised terrorist groups is supranational cooperation between the institutions responsible for security."
"The common foreign and security policy has established a good basis for this, and its development is in all of our interests."
"(NL) Madam President, I voted in favour of the LefranÃ§ois report."
"It is not perfect, of course, but at least it pays attention to the problem of Islamists who incite to violence and call Muslims to jihad."
"We all know that there are innumerable mosques that are hotbeds of fundamentalism, where young people are recruited for terrorist organisations and where the faithful are called daily to a holy war on our European values."
"It is high time that the final whistle was blown and that tough action was taken against accomplices to terrorist acts, too."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report, quite simply because we have to take every measure to ensure that cross-border police and judicial cooperation is organised efficiently."
"To do this we need data exchange, but we have to ensure that there are uniform standards across Europe for this."
"What made me uneasy - and against which I should have liked to vote, but there was no separate vote - was Amendment 10."
"Here, Mrs Roure did not want this Framework Decision to be without prejudice to essential and very specific national security interests."
"By contrast, I should like framework decisions, too, to naturally be without prejudice to very specific national security interests, which concern the internal security of a country, and to naturally enable autonomous action."
"I consider this absolutely vital in the interest of individual Member States."
"(NL) Madam President, this House has just decided by a vast majority, after the committee did likewise, that under no circumstances may racial or ethnic origin or a number of other parameters be considered during the processing of personal data."
"In my opinion, the original Article 7 of the Council proposal was prudent and balanced, but Parliament - whose political correctness is legendary, of course - amended it."
"Parliament is on the wrong track with this."
"Not only the fight against crime, but also any kind of sound management of public affairs requires accurate basic information - and a person's ethnic or national origin could be particularly significant in this regard."
"This has nothing to do with racism or discrimination."
"It never ceases to amaze me how the same MEPs who, in a Stalinist way, call for bans on public speaking or even prison sentences or the loss of parliamentary immunity for right-wing dissidents, get cold feet when it comes to common-or-garden data processing - in the context of the fight against terrorism, mark you."
"Madam President, today's vote was an important moment for citizens fighting for their rights, their European rights."
"National governments at times abandon their citizens and reject their legitimate claims."
"Through petitions European citizens can raise their voice, can hold their government accountable."
"Ultimately they can have the justice they deserve."
"But this is not an important moment only for the European people: it is a crucial time for the European Parliament too."
"Today the European Parliament, by voting in favour of the Hammerstein report, shows its commitment to defend and protect European citizens."
"Today the European Parliament has the opportunity to regain at least part of the confidence and trust that some in Europe have lost."
"Many of our fellow citizens have worked hard to be in the EU, but membership is not only about duties - it is also about rights."
"We are here today to show our commitment to the Europe which our citizens expect from us."
"(NL) Madam President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has just taken advantage of the voting on the Hammerstein report to hold a vote sneakily - on the quiet, as it were - on the seat of the European Parliament, even though this actually had nothing to do with the report as such."
"I should like to clarify that I voted in favour of this amendment by the Greens as I agree that the travelling popular theatre that is the European Parliament is already squandering enough of our taxpayers' money without the monthly migration from Brussels to Strasbourg adding to it."
"Therefore, I, too, advocate - and this is reflected in my vote - one seat and one place of work in Europe."
"For the sake of clarity I would just add that, as far as I am concerned, there would then have to be an open debate, and that in my opinion this one seat does not necessarily have to be Brussels."
"After all, the presence of the European institutions in this city and this region also entails social, political and human costs that do need to be discussed and are on no account to be underestimated."
"(PL) Mountains are an important area of biodiversity, a refuge for many animals and a location for unique plant species."
"They are often also called water towers, as they provide the source of rivers."
"Their landscape and environmental benefits are valued by tourists all over the world."
"The lives of those who dwell there and the agricultural activities engaged in this terrain are, however, far from easy."
"In most of the EU's mountainous regions we are seeing a process of depopulation, a fall in the level of activity of the people who remain there and an abandonment of agricultural activity."
"This is particularly true of rural areas that are less attractive to tourists and are forgotten."
"Problems include the significant distance from towns, harsh climatic conditions, communications difficulties, high production costs and inadequate access to services of all types, including even education and health care."
"Regional disproportions between mountainous and lowland areas are clearly apparent."
"There is therefore an urgent need for special support for those known as hill farmers, who not only grow traditionally environmentally friendly produce, healthy foods, but also take care of the environment and maintain cultures and traditions."
"The common agricultural policy should do more to support these regions and the people who live there in their struggle against the challenges they face."
"Madam President, there is none so blind as those that cannot see."
"I notice Mr Hannan and Mr Sumberg have, unfortunately, left the Chamber at this time, but anyone who thinks that there is no financial turmoil should just pick up the newspapers and read, or watch the television."
"To believe that the Rasmussen report and the Lehne report did anything else other than try to adequately convey the necessity for us to be able to act and that this has to be done at a collective legislative level is to ignore the truth; it is also to ignore the reality of a global world economy."
"Frankly, sitting back in a little England may help some people relieve their consciences, but it does not help people meet their mortgage payments, it will not help people keep their homes, and it will not keep people in services and in industry."
"It is only through the European Union and through activity of regulation, where we are extremely good, that we will be able to do something about it."
"It is true that the markets expect us to be delicate, but they do not expect a knee-jerk reaction either."
"But the fact is that, if we do nothing and just stand still and say nothing, then, frankly, we will in fact be accused of cowardice in the face of strong tumult and crisis."
"Madam President, I fully support the purpose of the LefranÃ§ois report, but in this context I would just like to use my explanation - having supported it and not being in a position to be able to speak on it - to urge Commissioner Tajani to speed up the ongoing bilateral agreements with other third-country airports' authorities in relation to airport security - which was clamped down on because of the terrorism incidents - particularly bilateral agreements around the whole area of the purchase of duty-free liquids."
"It may be a very small issue in the context of the major challenges facing us globally today, but we in the EU have to win the hearts as well as the minds of our citizens in terms of what we do."
"Again this summer, when people visited relations abroad or when relations in Australia and the US and other places came to visit Ireland, the UK, Germany and France, they had all their - what they thought were legitimately purchased - duty-free liquids taken from them as they transited in the main hub airports in Europe to their final destination."
"This is a small issue - those of us who travel every week will put up with the nonsense of having our lipsticks taken from us, and I am sure it makes a huge contribution to combating terrorism."
"I do not want to make light of a very serious problem, but I just want a little sense, rationale and bilateral cooperation brought into this, so that our citizens - our electors - can understand what we do and why we do it."
"Madam President, as regards the Hammerstein report I followed the PPE-DE line and voted against the Green amendment about the two seats of Parliament."
"I want to explain why I did so."
"It is not because I agree with this monthly and sometimes bimonthly trail to Strasbourg."
"I understand historically why we have got in the position we are in."
"I understand that 12 visits to Strasbourg per annum are part of the Treaty and we are signed in, but in a rational and calm way."
"Those of us who have serious concerns about the lack of access, the difficulty of doing work, the need to transport all our files, our staff, the committee staff, Parliament staff, the group staff, to Strasbourg for four days 12 times a year believe it can no longer be justified given the enormous expense."
"It is a beautiful building and once they have sorted out the difficulties I feel that we could find another very serious use for that building."
"Strasbourg and France deserve no less, but a major institution must be housed in that building."
"But to expect us to work efficiently in terms of human resources and costs and to continue this pilgrimage to Strasbourg can no longer be justified, so having voted one way I support those who say one seat for plenary sessions, but please, a rational debate, not a polarised political debate, on the issue."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of the report by my German fellow Member Mr Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, amending the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics relating to external trade with non-member countries and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/95."
"I welcome the Commission's decision to make legislation clearer, simpler and more transparent; to adjust the system of extra-Community trade statistics to the changes to be introduced in the procedures regarding customs declaration; to increase the relevance, accuracy, timeliness and comparability of external trade statistics, and establish a system for quality assessment; to support the linking of trade statistics with business statistics; to respond to user needs by compiling additional trade statistics using information available in customs declarations, and finally to control, in line with the European Statistics Code of Practice, the privileged access to sensitive external trade data."
"I support the amendments aimed at making greater use of comitology with scrutiny."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this report because the draft regulation represents the legal framework required for improving the quality and transparency of EXTRASTAT (the statistics on foreign trade between Member States and third countries), by including a single customs declaration in customs procedures, so as to simplify data reporting procedures."
"The appropriate enforcement of this regulation will make it increasingly possibile to compare foreign trade statistics and to strengthen the control over access to inside information regarding sensitive issues of foreign trade."
"in writing. - We have often asked ourselves whether it is worth dedicating a year to a particular topic."
"The whole idea is to raise visibility of the topic itself."
"It is a way of attracting attention and giving extra focus to a particular subject."
"There can be no harm in this."
"The idea has become so popular that we have to make a judicious choice when selecting the subject."
"It is often a question of priorities."
"Creation and innovation are an ideal subject because they affect the very essence of what Europe represents and the direction which Europe has to take."
"Creation and innovation cannot be evaluated in a vacuum."
"They have to be understood on what they can contribute. First and foremost is their importance within the manufacturing sphere."
"Also, the importance of creation and innovation has to be viewed within the services framework."
"It is only through creative and innovative ideas that Europe can remain competitive."
"It is only by being one step ahead that certain sectors can survive."
"To an extent Europe has recognised the need to invest more heavily in research and development, and this is synonymous with the current subject of creative and innovative ideas."
"I voted in favour of the report by my Greek fellow Member Mrs Batzeli, approving the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009)."
"I support the series of amendments aimed principally at clarifying the objectives of the proposal and making them more concise."
"As regards financing, I also agree with the removal of all references in the proposal to the Lifelong Learning Programme so that, where appropriate, programmes and policies in other fields, such as culture, communications, enterprise, cohesion, rural development, research and the information society, can also be used."
"I voted in favour of the Batzeli report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009), as I believe creativity and innovation are essential for Europe to be competitive in a globalised world."
"Creativity is a key driver of innovation for both economic and social reasons."
"The European Year of Creativity and Innovation will stimulate political debate, alert the public to the importance of innovation and creativity and disseminate information on best practices within the Union."
"I also believe it is important that Parliament has opted for co-decision in this area, which will allow it to have influence in this important dossier."
"in writing. - (SV) We have previously criticised the various campaigns for 'European years' devoted to various themes, such as intercultural dialogue and creativity and innovation."
"These 'European years' are a charge on the EU budget, hence on the taxpayers, but they have little effect on reality."
"If there is a demand for 'European years', they should be financed through private sponsorship and not by the taxpayers."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the report presented, even though it only dealt with detailed amendments to the Commission's proposal."
"I voted in favour on condition that the Commission committed itself to bringing innovation to all areas."
"During the Year of Creativity and Innovation, innovation should extend to all organisations and institutions, whether public or private, profit-making or non profit-making, and to all aspects of life; in particular it should promote social innovation and innovation in support of environmental sustainability."
"We should also take into account non-state authorities, who have a key role to play in this area."
"In addition, a concept of open innovation should be encouraged."
"Innovation which, as well as being based on internal capabilities, incorporates all its possible sources - users, suppliers, networks, etc. - and which, going beyond products and technology, includes the intangible and generally manifold aspects leading to value creation."
"Finally, we need to extend the culture of cooperation, working in networks and using tools and methods aimed at creating the dynamic capabilities in those networks that will enable them to evolve with their environment, and generate cutting-edge research and visible results in terms of competitiveness and creating value for society."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Batzeli on the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009)."
"I regard information and promotion campaigns, events and initiatives at European, national and local level to promote creativity and initiative as extremely important."
"Creativity is also an important factor in the development of personal and social skills."
"This year of promotion is intended to improve Europe's creativity and capacity for innovation to enable it to rise to certain challenges of globalisation."
"This report underlines the importance of creativity and innovation."
"I see this year of promotion as a great opportunity for disseminating information concerning creative processes and various practices."
"in writing. - I support Katerina Batzeli's report on making 2009 the European Year of Creativity and Innovation."
"The report not only outlines the initiative in more detail, but also adequately attends to the dangers of such European years becoming PR exercises."
"In regions in which nature confronts people with difficult basic conditions, they have to act in a creative and innovative manner in order to survive."
"The peoples of Europe can therefore look back today on a history of groundbreaking achievements, and specialist firms are in demand worldwide on account of their wealth of ideas."
"Europe is also regarded as a cultural stronghold, however - and particular attention should be paid to this in the context of the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009)."
"Along with Vilnius in Lithuania, Linz is currently preparing for its role as European Capital of Culture 2009."
"Creative and innovative projects, with the involvement of the surrounding regions, will provide a cultural experience of a particular kind."
"It is to be welcomed if, under this prestigious title, whole city districts gleam in renewed splendour, and new building works and projects are started - provided sustainability is not forgotten in the process."
"In the EU, emphasis must be placed on ensuring that funds are not blown on one-off events, so that structures set up do not disappear into the ether immediately after the year ends."
"A Capital of Culture project is only successful and innovative if culture remains permanently in place in the city concerned."
"More importance should be given to this particular consideration in the current report, and so I abstained from voting."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the report by my Spanish colleague Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, approving as it stands the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) No 549/69 determining the categories of officials and other servants of the European Communities to whom the provisions of Article 12, the second paragraph of Article 13 and Article 14 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the Communities apply."
"The Council Decision establishing the European Police Office (Europol), providing for the financing of Europol from the Community budget, will apply from 1 January 2010 or the date of application of the proposal amending Council Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) No 549/69, if this is later."
"To ensure that the Europol decision applies from 1 January 2010, it was necessary, in good time, to amend Council Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) No 549/69 specifying that immunity from legal proceedings does not apply to Europol staff taking part in joint investigation teams set up by at least two Member States at their own initiative."
"in writing. - This amendment appears to limit the immunity from prosecution of Europol officials but it only does so for those operating as part of Joint Investigation Teams."
"This is a smokescreen to make it appear that Europol officials' immunity will be limited when in fact Europol's powers will be extended after 2010 and the immunity of its officials will be even more far-reaching."
"I do not believe that Europol officials should have any immunity from prosecution whatsoever and therefore I voted against this amendment."
"in writing. - AugustÃ­n DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra's report on the status of staff regarding privileges and immunities seeks to clarify pre-existing guidelines on the issue."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I voted in favour of the report by my Finnish fellow Member Mr Virrankoski proposing to approve Draft amending budget No 6/2008 of the European Union for the financial year 2008, which includes the following: strengthening of the framework programme for Competitiveness and Innovation - Entrepreneurship and Innovation by increasing the commitment appropriations by EUR 3.9 million; an increase of EUR 2.24 million in commitment appropriations to cover, among other things, part of the rent and related costs of a new 'Arc' building for Eurojust; adjustments to the number of posts in three executive agencies; creation of the necessary budgetary structure to accommodate the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU), which is the fifth joint undertaking to be set up under the Seventh Framework Programme, and allocation of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 1.9 million in payment appropriations."
"I entirely share the rapporteur's view that under Article 179(3) of the Financial Regulation, the European Parliament, as a branch of the budgetary authority, should have been informed of the building project for Eurojust, because this has a significant financial implication for the budget."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Dutch fellow Member Mr Berman on the follow-up of the Monterrey Conference of 2002 on Financing for Development."
"We need to constantly reaffirm Parliament's commitment to poverty eradication, sustainable development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as the only way to bring about social justice and an improved quality of life for the one billion people around the world who live in extreme poverty."
"The European Union is the biggest international donor for development, providing nearly 60% of Official Development Assistance (ODA) worldwide."
"I support the proposal to open up access for small-scale entrepreneurs to micro-credit, particularly farmers, as a means of increasing food production and providing a sustainable solution to the food crisis."
"I also welcome the proposal to call on the European Investment Bank to set up a guarantee fund in support of micro-credit and risk hedging schemes that respond closely to the needs of local food producers in the poorer developing countries, but this proposal only makes any sense under a Commission mandate."
"In 2001 the EU made a big commitment: to devote 0.7% of its wealth to development in 2015."
"In 2007 Europe turned its back on this commitment, with a drastic fall in its collective effort."
"This adds up to EUR 1.7 billion that the poorest people of the planet will not have received."
"EUR 1.7 billion that would have provided healthcare for thousands of children at a time when 11 million people are dying each year owing to a lack of access to healthcare."
"EUR 1.7 billion that would have provided access to primary education for some of the 114 million children without it."
"The EU's primary responsibility when it comes to international solidarity is this: to keep its word."
"The EU must, however, guarantee the effectiveness of its aid in order to make any real improvement to the situation of the most deprived."
"The Monterrey Conference of 2002 prepared a roadmap, particularly concerning the end of 'tied aid', the acceleration of debt cancellation initiatives and the introduction of innovative finance schemes like the 'Tobin tax'."
"Six years on, the EU still has a long way to go."
"The Doha Conference in a few weeks should enable it to start moving forward again."
"Half of humanity is counting on it..."
"in writing. - (SV) The United Nations Millennium Development Goals Report for 2008 says that the international community must continue to be prepared to take significant responsibility for the challenges facing humanity."
"Extreme poverty and hunger, infant mortality, poor maternal health, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases and the lack of universal primary education are just some of the challenges which merit attention and recognition by all countries in the world."
"Reflecting the position of Junilistan, the report notes that in many cases these challenges call for international coordination."
"However, Junilistan thinks that cooperation of this kind should be channelled through organisations with broad international legitimacy and long experience, such as the United Nations, and not through the EU."
"Junilistan also opposes the passages in the report which blatantly advocate direct control of the bilateral aid schemes of individual EU countries."
"Aid is and must remain a national matter."
"For that reason, Junilistan has voted against the report."
"In addition to the many questions and comments that the report's content (and omissions) raise, its condemnation regarding the volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) should also be highlighted:"
"'... notes the alarming decrease in EU aid in 2007 from EUR 47.7 billion in 2006 (...) to EUR 46.1 billion in 2007 ...';"
"'points out that the EU will have given EUR 75 billion less than was promised for the period 2005-2010 if the current trend continues';"
"'Expresses serious concern that a majority of the Member States (18 out of 27, especially Latvia, Italy, Portugal, Greece and the Czech Republic) were unable to raise their level of ODA between 2006 and 2007 and that there has even been a dramatic reduction of over 10% in a number of countries such as Belgium, France and the United Kingdom; ...';"
"'Observes that the 2007 decreases in reported aid levels are due in some cases to the artificial boosting of figures in 2006 by debt relief; ...';"
"'Views as totally unacceptable the discrepancy between the frequent pledges of increased financial assistance and the considerably lower sums that are actually disbursed ...';"
"Words that speak for themselves ..."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"Funding development aid is not an easy task."
"It is not easy to explain to European taxpayers why their money is being handed out so far from its country of 'origin'."
"On the other hand the demand for aid funds, arising both from a desire to implement the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and from promises made earlier, is huge."
"On an EU scale, the attitude of certain states is becoming a particular problem."
"Some Member States, such as France and Great Britain, have cut back their Official Development Assistance (ODA)."
"It does not require much effort to imagine what a very disincentivising effect this has on countries that are less wealthy than these, in which development aid is only just beginning to appear."
"We also need to take a good look at the way in which aid statistics come about."
"Each country would like to allocate as much outlay as possible to the category of development aid."
"This leads in effect to some pretty ridiculous situations."
"In my country, Poland, a report was published last week on aid in 2007."
"It transpires that the greatest beneficiary of Polish aid was none other than China."
"This is not because China is the poorest country in the world; nor is it because China has become a priority country for Polish development aid."
"China has become the greatest beneficiary of Polish development aid simply because an export trade contract with that country has been included in the category of development aid."
"in writing. - A common European position is needed on the effectiveness, transparency and flexibility of the way development assistance is financed before the Doha Conference on Financing for Development in late November."
"Thijs Berman's report goes some way towards helping achieve that goal."
"I agree that reform is needed to secure greater representation of developing countries to the IMF and World Bank."
"Indeed, I further agree with the rapporteur's calls to encourage Member States to adequately prepare a timetable to reach the target of 0.7% of Europe's GNP going to public development aid in 2015."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (NL) The members of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Berman report, one of the reasons being that it makes useful comments about the possible role of the European Investment Bank in developing countries."
"However, the members of the VVD distance themselves from the 0.7% target for development cooperation laid down in this report."
"It is not the quantity but the quality of development cooperation that counts."
"in writing. - Turbulent global finance has put the governments of the Member States under serious strain."
"The Estonian Government, for example, has been struggling for months to draft a balanced budget for the year 2009."
"Although I supported Thijs Berman's report, I have serious doubts about reaching the targeted Official Development Assistance level in the next couple of years."
"As the EU has no command of coercive measures regarding development aid, it would be naive to expect that the Member States would significantly increase their contribution when experiencing financial uncertainty."
"The European internal market is one of the most important achievements of the process of European integration."
"Only a well-functioning internal market can guarantee competitive conditions for businesses activities and assist the development of the European economy."
"The internal market scoreboard is an instrument that makes it possible to monitor progress in the introduction, proper transposition and correct application of directives relating to the internal market."
"Analysis of the data contained in the internal market scoreboard provides some exceptionally interesting information about the work of Member States in introducing EU legislation."
"It is a typically political instrument that should, however, not be treated lightly, but should serve as an instrument encouraging responsible individuals to carry out more rapid and proper transposition."
"This particularly concerns the new Member States, where the deficit as regards transposition of law is often greater than the objective stated by Heads of State or Government."
"The internal market scoreboard should also be used more frequently in discussions about the state of the internal market."
"It is therefore essential to come up with a more accessible form of scoreboard that could also be used by citizens interested in internal market matters."
"The rapporteur has drawn attention to the fact that certain directives, such as the Services Directive, are more important for the effective functioning of the internal market than others."
"I share the rapporteur's view on this and as a result I think that the European Commission should take notice of indicators that better reflect the immediate significance of directives for businesses and citizens."
"in writing. - (RO) Through my positive vote today for the internal market scoreboard, I am expressing my support for the timely enforcement and accurate transposition of internal market directives into national law, because these directives constitute the prerequisite for the effective working of the internal market, and for promoting competitiveness as well as social and economic cohesion within the EU."
"The two scoreboards, those for the internal market and consumption market, respectively, jointly contribute to the improvement of the internal market, which is beneficial to consumers."
"The scoreboard should encourage timely and accurate transposition, but at the same time it should become a tool enabling policy-makers to identify barriers and fields that require new initiatives."
"I hope that the result of today's vote will lead to the strengthening of the SOLVIT network and that Member States will promote the services of this network for the benefit of consumers."
"Member States must also make sure that SOLVIT centres are adequately staffed, so as to reduce the length of time required for examination and to solve complaints at a faster rate."
"in writing. - A priority of all education ministries must be the recruitment of the best candidates to the teaching profession."
"The profession has to be sufficiently attractive."
"Teachers must benefit from remuneration which reflects their importance to society."
"Investment in education is never wasted."
"More resources have to be allocated to teacher training."
"The profession has to be fulfilling."
"It has to be seen as a good career."
"Supporting teacher education through the Lifelong Learning Programme is essential."
"A certain freshness is achieved through teacher exchange programmes between schools in different countries."
"The place of a teacher is in the classroom."
"Bureaucracy in the form of increasing levels of administration and paperwork result in less time spent by teachers with their pupils."
"An added concern is violence in school."
"Aggression in schools, either by pupils or their parents, is on the increase."
"All efforts must be made to curb violence and aggression in schools."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Spanish fellow Member Mrs Badia i Cutchet on improving the quality of teacher education and I strongly support the analysis that 'raising the quality of teacher education leads to substantial gains in student performance.'"
"I fully agree that providing more and better-quality teacher education and recruiting the best candidates to the teaching profession should be key priorities for all education ministries."
"There is an urgent need to encourage mobility and the learning of foreign languages."
"However, we should also be promoting excellence in native languages, since this is what enables pupils to acquire other knowledge more easily."
"All this cooperation will be very useful when the time comes for organising school exchanges (of pupils and teachers), regardless of the level of study, based on the model already used for the Erasmus programme for students."
"in writing. - (NL) As a former teacher at what was known as a multicultural problem school in Antwerp, I can only welcome the rapporteur's expression of concern about the quality of teaching in the EU."
"However, it is for the individual Member States and not the EU to work out what can be done about the quality of teaching."
"If there is one field in which the principle of subsidiarity and respect for the diversity of the various cultures must hold, then that is most certainly education."
"Education does not have to be multicultural as stated in this report; it only has to be of good quality."
"In my experience in Flanders, for example, I have seen all too often that it is the multicultural 'concentration schools' - those with a high proportion of migrant children - that bring quality down."
"Ideological blinkers are not the way to remedy this."
"I therefore voted wholeheartedly against this report."
"I voted in favour of the Badia i Cutchet report on improving the quality of teacher education as I believe that improving education in the European Union is a key factor in promoting high-quality education and training, which in turn contributes to job creation and boosting Europe's competitiveness and growth, in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"On the subject of violence in schools, I should like to reiterate the rapporteur's recommendation on the need to create the tools and procedures to tackle the phenomenon, for which cooperation between teaching staff and parents needs to be stepped up."
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote 'no' in the final vote on this report."
"This is an extremely important matter - so important that it must remain the political responsibility of the Member States and their devolved authorities."
"The Member States must have exclusive responsibility for the organisation of education and the content of training provision."
"This is another attempt by the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education to meddle in an area which currently does not fall within the Union's responsibilities, but which some want the Union to become involved in for the good of us all."
"This own-initiative report is a waste of taxpayers' money, which the European Parliament should have nothing to do with."
"in writing. - The Badia report has much to commend it."
"The quality of teacher education has direct and important impacts upon our children's education and EU-wide cooperation to ensure a high standard of teaching is to be encouraged."
"I do consider, however, that decisions relating to curriculum content and the governance of schools should be taken within the cultural and political context of different nations' separate education systems."
"At times the Badia report tended towards prescribing issues on an EU-wide basis, and I accordingly abstained on the final vote."
"in writing. - Maria Badia i Cutchet's report has my support."
"To preserve the high quality of our respective education systems we need to have well-trained teachers."
"Teacher training must develop in tandem with the demands of the modern classroom and I believe that this report recognises this fact."
"in writing. - The report from Ms Badia i Cutchet on improving the quality of teacher education today touches on some important issues."
"The report is right to point out the need for adequate remuneration for teachers along with adequate training and teaching equipment."
"Ultimately, however, it is up to the national governments who fund our education systems to manage the education of our children."
"In Ireland, children today are still being taught in prefabs instead of proper, safe buildings."
"The pupil-teacher ratio remains too high to allow for the best possible education of our children."
"These problems need to be tackled first and foremost in Ireland by means of adequate investment in the short- and long-term."
"The development of information and communication technologies is currently imposing greater demands upon the teaching profession since the educational environment is becoming more and more complex and varied."
"I voted for Mrs Badia i Cutchet's report which deals with the Commission's communication entitled 'Improving the Quality of Teacher Education'."
"The communication assesses the current situation in the EU as regards the education and training of teachers."
"The report reflects upon the various options in EU Member States."
"Within the Union, there are more than 27 different teacher training systems, but the challenges facing teachers are essentially common to all Member States."
"Teachers are required to have a quality of teacher training which has a direct effect not only on pupils' level of knowledge but also on the formation of their personalities, particularly during the first years of their school experience."
"Teachers are also subjected to enormous mental stress, leaving them little energy for self-education."
"In the past, teaching was a respected and valued profession."
"Today, the teaching profession is not attractive."
"Teachers, most of whom are women, do not enjoy the corresponding level of social recognition, status and, above all, remuneration."
"For example, in my country, Slovakia, teachers' pay is way below the national average."
"I believe that the report will attract the attention of Member States, ensuring that the teaching profession is properly appreciated."
"We are voting today on two reports that appear to be mutually complementary: Mrs Pack's report on the Bologna Process and Mrs Badia i Cutchet's report on improving the quality of teacher education."
"The objective of these two initiatives is to improve the competitiveness of European education, and consequently to increase the potential and competitiveness of the European Union as a whole."
"Placing the emphasis on education is an excellent way to go, but neglect is easy."
"In many countries we are dealing with all the fundamental sins of the teacher education system."
"There is a lack of incentive and motivation for the best graduates to choose the teaching profession; the status of teachers (especially at primary and secondary level) is frankly low, teachers are poorly paid and there is no investment in their development."
"The relationship between the quality of teacher education and the quality of teaching, and consequently the level of knowledge of pupils, is obvious."
"Neglect in this area may therefore have disastrous consequences, not only cultural, but also economic."
"The recommendations for Member States that are contained in the report seem to be the right ones, and these are: employment of the best candidates, improvement in status, teacher recognition and remuneration, investment in training at all stages of an individual's career, exchange of best practice among the 27 different education systems in the EU, and an increase in schools' powers."
"A high level of teaching is an essential element of a high quality of education, which should be a crucial factor in Europe's long-term competitiveness and its capacity to create new jobs."
"It transpires from the Commission's analysis that:"
"â¢ on-the-job training is compulsory only in 11 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Malta and the United Kingdom),"
"â¢ where there is on-the-job training, this usually lasts less than 20 hours a year and never exceeds five days a year,"
"â¢ only half of the states of Europe offer new teachers any form of systematic assistance during the first few years of employment (e.g. induction into occupation, training, pedagogical care)."
"If pupils are to be suitably prepared for life in the EU, teachers should be required to apply the latest educational methods."
"An improvement in the quality of teacher training may guarantee that the EU has the highly-skilled employees it needs in order to tackle the challenges of the 21st century."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my excellent German colleague Mrs Pack on the Bologna Process and student mobility."
"I share my colleague's view that an increase in student mobility and the quality of the different educational systems should be a priority of the Bologna Process beyond 2010, which aims to establish a European Area of Higher Education."
"To encourage student mobility, a whole series of measures needs to be taken since the problem of mobility goes beyond the scope of higher education and concerns the scope of social affairs, finance, immigration and visa policies."
"Special assistance must be provided to students from disadvantaged groups in society by, for example, proposing inexpensive and decent accommodation."
"I support the introduction of a single European Student Identification Card in order to facilitate mobility and to enable students to get discounts for accommodation and subsistence, culture and transport."
"in writing. - The aim of the Bologna process, launched in Bologna in June 1999, is to establish a European Higher Education Area by 2010."
"The main objectives of the process are the reform of the higher education system and the elimination of remaining barriers to the mobility of students and teachers."
"I voted in favour of the report since I agree that our universities need an innovative and methodical curricular reform that would better support student mobility and the transfer of qualifications."
"Also, I support the rapporteur's recommendation to obtain reliable statistics on student mobility and the socio-economic profile of students."
"Next year's 10th anniversary of the signature of the Bologna Declaration signals the need to redefine the aims of the Process."
"Seriously redefining these goals will require reflection on how the Bologna Process has been implemented in the Member States."
"We will need to examine whether the policies followed in the name of Bologna have actually led to the desired consolidation of a European Area of Higher Education that can meet the challenges of competitiveness on an international scale."
"I support this initiative - it is a tangible contribution towards identifying problems and challenges that have arisen over 10 years of implementation on the one hand, and issues that need to remain priorities on the other."
"This is the case with student mobility, the cornerstone of a richer and more competitive education and an essential contribution towards developing the concept of European citizenship."
"It is essential to call on the Member States to assess the impact of this Process as regards ensuring that young people are adequately qualified and prepared."
"As our rapporteur points out, we must not lose sight of the goals of the Process or of the notion of students being at the heart of all questions concerning their education."
"I voted in favour of the Pack report on the Bologna Process and student mobility as I believe that high-quality, effective and innovative European higher education that is accessible to every European citizen is vital for the European Union to continue to be competitive and successful in the face of the demands of globalisation."
"With this in mind, I believe measures such as promoting reciprocity in terms of the flow of students, ongoing training of teachers in the various areas of study and developing means of financing student mobility are essentials for achieving the Bologna Process objectives."
"Although the rapporteur says she is particularly concerned about student mobility within the European Union and considers that Member States should be supported in their efforts to modernise and innovatively reform their respective higher education systems, the fact of the matter is that the entire report tackles this question by focusing on the Bologna Process and on what is deemed absolutely necessary in order to face the challenges of globalisation, insisting that the process should be deepened."
"We therefore abstained, as we disagree with this analysis."
"However, we do agree that it is time for reflection and debate on the Bologna Process, in particular to try to determine how education systems have changed and how these developments and changes have affected the quality of higher education in the various Member States."
"Access to high quality education must be an option for every citizen, regardless of their citizenship, country or area of birth."
"In addition, mobility can have extremely positive effects, not only for the individual taking part in a mobility scheme, but also for higher education institutions and society as a whole."
"Moreover, its social dimension should not be forgotten, as has happened up to now."
"in writing. - (SV) This own-initiative report from the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, as usual, exceeds the Committee's competence in putting forward new ideas on how the EU should become more involved in education."
"This is a field which currently falls within the responsibility of the Member States, and that is the way we think it should remain."
"Among other things, the report proposes the introduction of a single student ID card in the EU."
"We find it hard to believe that these proposals in themselves would increase mobility for students; they are more likely to increase the bureaucracy associated with student activity."
"The rapporteur also writes in her explanatory statement about the need for a legal framework for students at EU level."
"These proposals seek to circumvent the arrangements agreed in the EU regarding the levels of political responsibility for various policy areas."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"Next year's 10th anniversary of the signature of the Bologna Declaration signals the need to redefine the aims of the Process."
"Seriously redefining these goals will require reflection on how the Bologna Process has been implemented in the Member States."
"We will need to examine whether the policies followed in the name of Bologna have actually led to the desired consolidation of a European Area of Higher Education that can meet the challenges of competitiveness on an international scale."
"I support this initiative - it is a tangible contribution towards identifying problems and challenges that have arisen over 10 years of implementation on the one hand, and issues that need to remain priorities on the other."
"This is the case with student mobility, the cornerstone of a richer and more competitive education and an essential contribution towards developing the concept of European citizenship."
"It is essential to call on the Member States to assess the impact of this Process as regards ensuring that young people are adequately qualified and prepared."
"As our rapporteur points out, we must not lose sight of the goals of the Process or of the notion of students being at the heart of all questions concerning their education."
"The aim of the Bologna Process is to establish a European Area of Higher Education by the end of 2010."
"It is intended, among other things, to help students choose from the rich educational assortment on offer."
"The introduction of three cycles of education, educational quality assurance and recognition of qualifications and study duration periods are crucial to the functioning of the Area."
"Clearly the attractiveness of the European Area of Higher Education will be greater, the better and more evenly spread the quality of education in the different Member States."
"It is therefore crucial to support Member States in their efforts to modernise and reform their higher education systems."
"All European citizens must have the opportunity to access higher education, regardless of their citizenship, country or place of birth."
"Increasing student mobility is one of the anticipated benefits of the Bologna Process."
"Mobility has a positive impact not only on individuals who move, but also on higher education institutions."
"Exchange of views, heterogeneity and drawing on the experience of others are, after all, components of the academic experience."
"We should not forget either that there is a social dimension to this: mobility provides for the acquisition of invaluable and rich experience in the sphere of scientific, cultural and social variety."
"in writing. - (RO) Although I voted in favour of this report, I would like to point out two issues that need to be carefully analysed and regulated by the Commission."
"First of all, we need to look at the geographic distribution of scholarships granted through the Lifelong Learning Programme."
"Most of the universities that benefit from student exchanges are concentrated in the old Member States."
"At the same time, the number of students in the new Member States is much lower."
"The Commission should take urgent action, such as by accrediting an increased number of universities capable of participating in academic exchange programmes, thus increasing the attractiveness of new Member States as destinations for students from all over Europe."
"The Commission must also make sure that a proportionate number of students from each Member State get the opportunity to have a European scholarship."
"Secondly, I believe that article 11 of the report should be applied to all Member States, notwithstanding its recommendation status."
"This period of academic mobility, be it for a term or for a year, can contribute significantly both to the knowledge and to the personal development of young Europeans."
"However, I must add that the inclusion of such a provision should be accompanied by corresponding financial support for the Member States."
"Various sectors that are critical of the Bologna Process consider that the change will cause university education to become elitist."
"This report calls for special assistance to be provided to students from disadvantaged groups in society by, for example, proposing 'inexpensive and decent' accommodation, and taking into account that extra support after arrival is often necessary."
"Although I tabled an amendment on this point to extend it to all expenditure, in other words, so that the assistance is not limited to accommodation, I think that the report is based on a concept of universal education that is accessible to the whole of society."
"In the voting Mrs Pack and her report on the Bologna Process and student mobility received my support."
"This is a good, business-like report."
"In the EU today we continue to see inadequate outlay on scientific research and academic education."
"The Bologna idea, which is already nine years old (and currently unites 46 countries), should lead in 2010 to the appearance of a European Area of Higher Education."
"The underlying principles of this process come down to three priority fields of action. These are: the education cycle (which covers three stages: bachelor, masters, doctorate), provision of high-quality education and recognition of qualifications obtained and periods of higher education study."
"What is needed, then, is multiple and cohesive actions in all Member States, including in our universities."
"Evaluation systems in the form of what are known as ECTS points should be clear, understandable and unified."
"This will enable us to sustain the potential for the flexible and mobile education of young people at a variety of academic centres and the very necessary exchange of professorial-level staff."
"Although higher education does not form part of EU competence, we must nevertheless - while maintaining the independence of Member States in this matter - strive for close cooperation and coordination."
"We must also remember to provide EU citizens with equal opportunities to access education at as high a level as possible, and this requires both organisational changes in the education system and appropriate financial outlay."
"in writing. - Doris Pack's report 'The Bologna Process and student mobility' is a constructive contribution to the debate on student mobility."
"The ability for students across the EU to be able to move freely between Europe's borders must remain a core element of the Bologna process."
"Students from all backgrounds should have the opportunity to benefit from the wealth of cultural and intellectual opportunities the EU offers."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report's recommendations."
"The objective of making it easier for students to choose from a wide range of high-quality courses as part of the Bologna process is, of course, to be welcomed."
"The EU has also placed an important emphasis on student mobility, and furthermore wants to improve the mutual recognition of training."
"The fact that not everything is running smoothly in this regard as yet is beyond question."
"Not only are there serious problems with recognition, some courses converted to bachelor's and master's degrees are supposedly so specialised that a change in the place of study - either at home or abroad - is no longer possible, which runs counter to the objective of a European Higher Education Area and of increasing mobility."
"Critics also believe that the ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) is being administered so differently from country to country that achievements are barely comparable any more."
"In this respect, the intention to take stock provisionally will be beneficial, and so I, too, voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of the report on ""The Bologna Process and Student Mobilityâ for several reasons: the Bologna Process was one of the most revolutionary elements in the world market of education and training."
"The labour market itself was not ready for such a change."
"It is still not fully receptive to the 3-cycle educational system (bachelor, master's degree, doctoral degree) in the 3-2-3 structure; on the other hand, before the new system was applied, enterprises often hired undergraduate students."
"Another element of progress was student mobility in European schools and the common degree system, facilitated by the ETCS."
"The success of these mechanisms has been proven by the tendency of major universities around the world of moving students to several geographical locations, particularly where they have older branches."
"Another revolutionary proposal is that of ECVET (European Credit system for Vocational Education and Training), meant to transfer, acknowledge and accumulate the results of learning acquired by an individual in formal, non-formal and informal contexts, with a view to obtaining qualifications, irrespective of the time spent learning or acquiring these skills and apritudes."
"This is a worldwide trend."
"Mrs Pack deserves our thanks for her contribution to the development of and creative reflection on the Bologna Process, which is an initiative enabling students in Europe to choose their own educational path and career without reference to state boundaries."
"This initiative, which enhances the competitiveness of the European education system, enriches the nations themselves through cultural and scientific penetration."
"Clearly questions of the content of education and raising its quality at every level currently lie in the hands of the EU Member States."
"In this respect there is still much to do."
"Mobility, and increasing it at European level, which is the principle motif of Mrs Pack's report, happens, in Poland for example, on the principle of the outflow of a valuable workforce, which quite often cannot be recovered."
"I agree with the report's thesis according to which the most important thing is student mobility, with the creation of a system of incentives and facilitations, so that young people may take advantage of offers to study wherever they like."
"One particularly important matter, though, would appear to be that of fully educated and developed people returning to their country in order to make use of their potential in their country of origin."
"This is definitely a challenge for the new Member States and I think that prudent continuation of the Bologna Process is a step in this direction."
"A united Europe is not just a matter of a single currency, free movement of people and a common market in goods and services."
"It is also, or even primarily, the intellectual, cultural and social dimension of Europe."
"The intergovernmental initiative known as the Bologna Process, which began just under 10 years ago, is chiefly aimed at making it easier for students to choose courses of the highest possible quality."
"One of the most important elements in the idea of setting up a European Area of Higher Education is increasing student mobility and the quality of education, as these are what specifically create the opportunity for personal, social and scientific development."
"I think that, in striving to improve the quality and attractiveness of education, what is important is actions taken at both European level (the European Parliament treats mobility as a priority issue) and national level."
"We must bear in mind that in the European Union higher education is not among the duties of the European Commission."
"The content and organisation of studies remain within the remit of the individual states, which is why their role, and that of the universities themselves, is so great."
"They should place emphasis on the need to create European curricula for doctorates, and make an effort to provide special assistance to students from social groups that are in an unfavourable situation."
"Another important aspect is dialogue and a two-way exchange of experience between businesses and universities, so higher education institutes should strengthen cooperation with the private sector with a view to discovering new and effective mechanisms for co-financing student mobility."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my Hungarian colleague Mr SzÃ¡jer containing recommendations to the European Commission on the alignment of legal acts to the new Comitology Decision."
"For the sake of quality legislation, it is becoming increasingly necessary to delegate to the Commission the development of the non-essential and more technical aspects of the legislation, as well as its prompt adjustment to take account of technological progress and economic change."
"However, this delegation of powers must be facilitated by giving the legislator the institutional means to scrutinise the exercise of such powers."
"It should be noted that the current alignment of the acquis with the Comitology Decision is still not complete, since there are still legal instruments that provide for implementing measures to which the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be applied."
"I support - and to my mind this is essential if European democracy is to function properly - the granting of additional resources in the European Parliament for all comitology procedures in preparation for the eventuality that the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, but also during the current transitional period, in order to ensure that every comitology procedure between the three institutions functions satisfactorily."
"I agree with the report when it says that for the sake of the quality of legislation, it is increasingly necessary to delegate to the Commission the development of the non-essential and more technical aspects of the legislation as well as its prompt adjustment to take account of technological progress and economic change."
"However, such delegation of powers must be facilitated by giving the legislator the institutional means to scrutinise the exercise of such powers."
"Parliament should be the guardian of this scrutiny, something which, despite the subject having been discussed for so many years, has still not been completely resolved."
"There are still parliamentary committees that have been lacking information in decisions taken under the comitology procedure."
"Parliament therefore needs to remain very vigilant."
"It is very important to further examine how the supervisory structures in the European Union can be improved."
"However, the report by Mr Rasmussen concerns the recommendations to the European Commission on hedge funds."
"On procedural grounds, I do not support the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to the recitals."
"The recitals are not the place to draw up value judgments on the current situation on the financial markets."
"I voted against Amendments 6 to 10 inclusive this morning not because I oppose European supervision of financial markets, but because this report is not the right place to launch this initiative."
"I would advocate that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs deliberate upon supervision of financial markets and the desirability of reinforcing this at European level."
"If a good report is presented on this, there is every likelihood that I shall yet be able to support this initiative from the Greens."
"in writing. - (HU) Contrary to expectations, the financial crisis that started in America last year, triggered by the unregulated, speculative financial processes there, has now, far from abating, shaken the whole world, including Europe."
"The current crisis requires a long-term change of paradigm by European decision-makers in two areas, so that in future they will not only reduce the danger of a financial crisis but also promote stable economic growth."
"The developments in America have demonstrated that the market itself is not capable of dealing with these and similar crises."
"It is therefore necessary that we create, as soon as possible, the central European financial supervisory authority which was proposed by the Hungarians last year and was subsequently embraced by the French Presidency and which would, among other things, see to it that such risky, speculative transactions in the banking and financial system can be subject to conditions that can be monitored and calculated."
"This would be the prerequisite for Europe gradually to take over America's broken role in the world of finance."
"In order for the European economy, which has also been hit by the current crisis, to get on track for the growth it wants as soon as possible, it would be necessary to bring funding for real economies to the fore as soon as possible, instead of the risky, speculative transactions of the finance and banking world."
"A prerequisite for this is that the European Central Bank should not only, as up to now, concentrate on fighting off inflation, but also promote the recovery of the real economy using preferential interest rates."
"We voted against this report as, notwithstanding the odd token gesture and criticism in relation to the financial crisis, it does not include any specific measures to effectively combat the increasing financialisation of the economy, unregulated speculation, the proliferation of financial instruments and products to secure ever-greater speculative profits, nor does it decide on an end to tax havens or banking secrecy."
"As we stated in the plenary debate, it is always the same people who will suffer the consequences: workers who lose their jobs and the general public who have to pay more interest, including here in the European Union, particularly in countries with weaker economies, as is the case for Portugal, where the debt ratio is around 120% of GDP, while household debt is roughly 130% of disposable income."
"We therefore stress the priority of supporting the creation of jobs with rights, production, solving poverty, improving the purchasing power of workers and pensioners, supporting quality public services and increasing low-interest credit facilities to support micro, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs."
"in writing. - (SV) Hedge funds and private equity are high-risk investment vehicles."
"In order to restore confidence among investors, among the public and - not least - among the supervisory authorities, operations must be subject to both transparency and satisfactory legislation."
"Junilistan welcomes many of the points and proposals for action contained in the report."
"Despite this, we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety."
"We have done that because the report gives preference to measures at EU level, despite the fact that it ought to be obvious to everyone in this situation that solutions to the potential risks associated with such vehicles as hedge funds and private equity should be sought primarily at global level."
"in writing. - It is regrettable that the report by Rasmussen on hedge funds and private equity has been watered down following the compromise negotiations between the three largest groups in Parliament."
"It is also regrettable that the amendments tabled by the Greens and the GUE/NGL group, which were taken directly from the Rasmussen draft report, were not adopted during the plenary vote."
"For example, one of the paragraphs which has been weakened from the original draft emphasised the need for enhanced appropriate levels of transparency towards the public, investors and supervisory authorities, including, in the future, any new EU supervisory body."
"In spite of this, we decided to support the report in the final vote."
"This is due to the urgent need and necessity to counteract harmful financial speculation and instability in the markets."
"In this respect, the report could be seen as a step in the right direction."
"in writing. - The Rasmussen report comes at an appropriate time in the week following the financial turmoil which saw Scotland's oldest bank being sacrificed by, in the words of Scotland's First Minister, ""spivs and speculators""."
"The Scottish financial sector has been let down badly by the UK's regulators and I support tighter regulation of the market."
"I voted in favour of the report which contains a number of recommendations which are worthy of consideration and look forward to the day when independent Scottish regulators will work in this area in cooperation with our EU partners."
"in writing. - Both global and local financial markets are developing complex financial instruments, making it very difficult for financial institutions to develop adequate regulations and supervise systems."
"As a result of this, there are possibilities for actions which are not transparent and cases of speculations by financial market participants, which lead to the perversion of the financial markets."
"In this regard, I support Amendment 2 tabled by the Greens group, which calls for substantial reinforcement of the European Regulatory and Supervisory Framework in order to maintain financial stability."
"in writing. - It is regrettable that the report by Rasmussen on hedge funds and private equity has been watered down following the compromise negotiations between the three largest groups in the Parliament."
"It is also regrettable that the amendments tabled by the Greens and the GUE/NGL group, which were directly taken from the Rasmussen draft report, were not adopted during the plenary vote."
"In spite of this, we decided to support the report in the final vote."
"This is due to the urgent need and necessity to counteract harmful financial speculation and instability on the markets."
"In this respect, the report could be seen as a step in the right direction."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the hard-won compromise negotiated by the three political groups in this Parliament and I am pleased with the comprehensive, balanced content of the report."
"The rapporteur had tried to place the burden of the financial crisis with hedge funds and private equity, but these products are neither the origin nor the catalyst of the current crisis, and I congratulate the rapporteur on having recognised this and put it right."
"The recommendations we are making to the Commission are intended to cover all relevant actors and financial market participants and to close the loopholes in existing regulations to address and combat those practices that contributed to the property market collapse in the United States becoming a global financial crisis."
"We are thus addressing bad risk management practices, the lack of transparency of certain investment products and conflicts of interest in credit rating agencies, which are the main causes of the financial crisis we are currently experiencing."
"in writing. - Colleagues, the recent financial crisis has many victims, of which HBOS - who last week were taken over by Lloyds TSB - was one."
"To see such high-profile casualties is not only destabilising for the world economy, but for those who entrust their money and their future to these companies."
"What the world has learnt from the last few weeks is that our approach to market regulation is outdated."
"We need global measures to regulate a globalised financial system."
"The EU and the European Parliament therefore has a significant role to play in resolving the root causes of the crisis and must act responsibly by voting in favour of Mr Rasmussen's report."
"In encouraging hedge funds and private equity firms to be more prudent and transparent in their dealings, the EU will help construct a solid framework that will help restore much-needed stability to the financial sector."
"in writing. - It is regrettable that the report by Rasmussen on hedge funds and private equity has been watered down following the compromise negotiations between the three largest groups in the Parliament."
"It is also regrettable that the amendments tabled by the Greens and the GUE/NGL group, which were directly taken from the Rasmussen draft report, were not adopted during the plenary vote."
"In spite of this, we decided to support the report in the final vote."
"This is due to the urgent need and necessity to counteract harmful financial speculation and instability on the markets."
"In this respect, the report could be seen as a step in the right direction."
"However, a stronger hand is required in applying these ideas."
"The secretive nature of many hedge funds is unacceptable as the system as it currently stands does not allow for transparency for the public."
"It is therefore difficult to assess the nature of hedge funds, and their capacity to contribute to sustainable social cohesion and economic stability cannot be ascertained by citizens."
"The concerns mentioned in this report, which are accompanied by due acknowledgement of the importance of the financial products in question, lead me to agree on the whole."
"Bearing in mind that we are going through a period of obvious turbulence in the financial markets, it is important to react firmly, but also calmly and with knowledge of the facts."
"Much of the economic success of recent decades in Europe, the United States and in fast-growing economies is precisely because of the agility of the financial markets."
"In terms of the corrective action the current system needs, it is important to tackle the roots of the crisis, but without wiping out the virtues of the system."
"This is how the European Commission needs to understand this call for action by the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (SV) The role of the European Parliament in the EU system is to be the voice of the people."
"This voice is strengthened in particular by the work done in the Committee on Petitions, which takes up questions arising from citizens' initiatives."
"A good example is the 'One Seat' campaign - to move the seat of the European Parliament from Strasbourg to Brussels - which was taken up for formal discussion through the efforts of the Committee."
"Certainly, some recommendations to the Member States are rather extreme and some proposals are not very well considered."
"Nevertheless the work of the Committee on Petitions is a crucial part of the work of the EU on behalf of citizens, which for me was a crucial factor in my decision to support this report."
"The financial world is rocking on its foundations."
"Ordinary American taxpayers are paying the price of a rescue plan (USD 700 billion) whilst those who caused the problem are getting off scot-free."
"In the form of the Rasmussen report, the European Parliament had an instrument with which to do something to improve scrutiny of certain areas of the financial sector: hedge funds and private equity."
"With the crisis now so urgent, we had an opportunity to call on the European Commission to introduce strict legislation."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance therefore tabled various amendments to this report but, since these were rejected by Parliament, we voted against the report."
"There is to be no European authority to monitor the financial sector, no European legislation on the registration and monitoring of hedge funds, no limit on private investment companies taking root excessively."
"In the very week when the capitalist system is on the point of imploding, the European Parliament has missed its opportunity."
"We Greens are signalling that we shall continue to devote ourselves to severely curtailing a free market whose only objective in speculating seems to be to make the fastest possible profit for a small group of people."
"This is socially and economically irresponsible."
"I have always been in favour of market liberalisation, as, in my opinion, it is the main prerequisite for competition among market participants, which is always beneficial to consumers, enabling them to choose and purchase goods at the lowest possible price."
"However, in voting for the transparency of institutional investors, I support the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, who is asking the Commission to propose certain standards to prevent investors from 'robbing' companies (the case of the partial sale of companies) and abusing their financial powers so that companies encounter problems in the future and there is no benefit either to the company itself or its employees, creditors or business partners."
"In my view, the European Commission should investigate the measures implemented by the Member States to prevent the partial sale of companies."
"in writing. - I support the general approach of Klaus-Heiner Lehne's report on the transparency of institutional investors."
"Recent events in the financial markets point to the need for global action to improve market regulation."
"Well-functioning markets depend on the respect of transparency across the board, and this report is a step in the right direction."
"I voted in favour of its recommendations."
"The acute and ongoing crisis of casino-style capitalism is burdening American taxpayers and the entire world economy because of the failure of the profiteering games played by companies."
"Radical changes to the regulatory legal framework for the inspection of transparency and audits are needed."
"The Commission must act immediately and propose a comprehensive framework for a common model of transparency."
"The policy of less legislation has failed miserably."
"Transparency should be a guiding principle in how markets operate - financial markets in particular."
"However, this should not be the only consideration, lest the principle should become the rule, confusing the desired result (healthy and efficient financial markets) with the proposed means of achieving this (sufficiently regulated and supervised markets)."
"In the context of the current political and economic debate on financial markets, it is important for the Commission to interpret this recommendation in this sense, committing itself to defending the quality of European financial markets."
"Let us not forget that the greatest economic benefits for society stem from the smooth and fundamentally free functioning of these markets."
"in writing. - (SV) Transparency is crucial to restoring confidence in the financial market."
"Recent months have shown what problems can arise in a complex and fast-moving market if there is no possibility of understanding and following advanced products as well."
"There have certainly been problems in the OTC market, but there must also be transparency in other areas of the financial market."
"In the light of this broad complex of problems therefore, I chose to abstain in the vote since the amendments which would have given the report the breadth it needed were not adopted."
"I voted in favour of the report by my Hungarian fellow Member Mr Hegyi, amending the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council modifying, as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)."
"I support the proposed amendments aimed at using the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to adopt certain measures concerning products of animal origin derived from or containing ruminant materials."
"The same goes for assessing whether the level of protection applied by a Member State is equivalent, by way of derogation from Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as regards measures following detection of the presence of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)."
"We voted in favour of this report as Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, is a serious threat to our health."
"As we know, this deadly infectious disease spreads through a protein which can be found in infected meat and causes deterioration of the human brain."
"It has been possible to reduce this epidemic, thanks to strict European regulation."
"In this report, the rapporteur builds on the work of the previous rapporteur by adding new elements to be regulated by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny."
"We therefore agree that the Commission's proposal should be amended so as to guarantee that controls are not reduced."
"We have to be extremely cautious to ensure that the regulatory procedure with scrutiny does not slow down the implementation of measures against this disease."
"We also have to avoid creating loopholes in the legislation when granting derogations to Member States."
"Hence the importance of this report."
"Let us hope the European Commission bears it in mind."
"After the well-known scandals concerning this disease, the public in the Member States rightly needs and deserves this transparency."
"in writing. - Gyula Hegyi's report on amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission seeks to propose amendments to the regulation on transmissible spongiform encephalopathy - a deadly disease spread by infected meat."
"Updating the regulatory procedure associated with this issue to one that involves the European Parliament more is a positive step."
"The report therefore has my backing."
"Every year the EU has to contend with two billion tonnes of waste, 40 million tonnes of which are hazardous waste."
"The quantities of waste products similar to domestic waste produced probably constitute the major part of this together with industrial waste, even though the latter does, of course, contain a disproportionately higher risk potential."
"The statistics reveal all this, which is why the EU has set itself the lofty aim of reducing the amount of waste to be disposed of by 20% by 2010."
"In any case it is to be hoped that, in the agricultural waste sector, for instance, the need to obtain statistical data does not end up tying our farmers up with red tape."
"Since I was not able to find any indication of this in the report, I voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this report because, through this new legislative proposal, the Regulation on waste statistics is adapted to comitology, that is to regulation by control."
"The European Parliament's resolution also calls on the Commission to submit the evaluation reports on pilot-studies in time, in order to avoid the double reporting of data concerning waste statistics."
"in writing. - (RO) Insufficient data on waste generation and management prevents the European Union from enforcing a harmonised policy regarding waste."
"Statistic tools are necessary for an evaluation of compliance with the principle of prevention of environmental degradation as a consequence of waste usage and the monitoring of waste at the time of generation, collection and disposal."
"Member States have recognised that there are insufficient statistical data and that the definitions contained in this report are not enough to lead to comparable results between the states."
"This is why data collection can be done much better at Community level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity."
"As far as agriculture, fisheries and forestry statistics are concerned, we should take into consideration the degree of coverage by this Report of the treatment of agricultural and biological waste."
"Therefore, there are several essential issues that need particular attention in order to ensure the accuracy of data and consequently the harmonisation of statistical information at Community level."
"in writing. - (LT) The spectrum, like other natural resources (sun, water, air), is a public asset."
"Market mechanisms themselves, despite being an effective means of generating optimal economic value (private and public), cannot satisfy general interest and generate public assets, which are vital for the creation of an information society."
"Therefore, the coordination of political and market measures is a must."
"Better coordination and a greater level of flexibility are necessary in order to make full use of this limited resource."
"However, it is also necessary to maintain the balance between flexibility and harmonisation in order to achieve the added internal market value of the spectrum."
"The spectrum does not recognise national borders."
"To enable Member States use the spectrum effectively, better cooperation must be achieved within the EU, especially in the area of the expansion of European service and negotiations on international agreements."
"Although the management of the spectrum remains within national competence, it is only EU principles that can ensure that the EU's interests are defended worldwide."
"I am in favour of the further protection of economic interests in locations where mineral water is exploited, as guaranteed in the European Parliament's Directive on the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters."
"The income obtained by districts and businesses, particularly in the MaÅopolska province, constitutes a significant contribution to the development of the region and its attractiveness as a health resort and tourism destination."
"It is worth pointing out that these areas are often agricultural and have little opportunity to generate income because they are located in hilly and mountainous terrain, although they conceal beneath their surface very valuable mineral and spring waters with therapeutic properties."
"The EU mineral water document specifies a Europe-wide standard on natural mineral water."
"This regulation determines the conditions under which natural mineral water is to be recognised as such and lays down guidelines for the use of mineral water sources. Specific rules for supplying the market with mineral water are also laid down in the guidelines."
"The discrepancies in these regulations interfere with the free movement of natural mineral water, creating different competition conditions, which have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market in this product."
"In this particular case the existing obstacles could be removed by each Member State agreeing to accept mineral water recognised by other Member States in their territory with the introduction of general guidelines on meeting microbiological requirements for the product, which would determine the name of a certain mineral water brand."
"The principal aim of any regulation on mineral water is to protect consumers' health and prevent consumers from being misled by information on the product, thus guaranteeing fair trade."
"in writing. - Needless to say, roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles are an important ingredient for the safety of drivers, passengers and pedestrians."
"They are also essential in the fight against climate change in terms of CO2 emissions."
"On the other hand, the Government of a country has the obligation to provide a framework which contributes to the health and safety of drivers, passengers and pedestrians."
"Malta and Gozo have one of the highest densities of private cars per capita."
"Cars in Malta are extremely expensive, due to a high registration tax."
"This is making it very difficult for citizens to change to more efficient cars."
"The Government must address the issue of car registration immediately and should do so in the next budget."
"People use private transport because the situation of public transport is not acceptable."
"It is about time a general overhaul of public transport was carried out."
"In addition, the state of many of our roads is terrible."
"The allocation of Structural Funds by the EU for 2007-2013 is 53%."
"Under the circumstances all major roads have to be brought up to standard."
"in writing. - UKIP considers terrorism as a major problem."
"We simply do not believe that the EU should decide about the actions to be taken to fight terrorism."
"We feel nation states are best placed to decide appropriate security measures trough intergovernmental cooperation."
"in writing. - British Conservatives supported the report whilst having some reservations with regard to the necessity of the EU's involvement in this area, given that there is already in existence a Council of Europe Convention covering the same issues."
"We favour close cooperation between Member States but also in the context of a global approach to the war on terror."
"We are, however, unconvinced of the effectiveness of 'one size fits all' approaches at a European level."
"I voted against the proposal to insert a new offence of 'provocation' or 'public provocation to commit a terrorist offence' into European law in implementation of the Council of Europe Convention because I believe that the definition put forward by the Commission is too vague and is based on purely subjective elements, jeopardising human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly freedom of expression in Europe."
"In fact, any public statement, or any statement reported in the media, or any message posted on the Internet that might in some way - whether directly or indirectly, on the basis of 'intent' and with 'the danger that such offences may be committed' - be considered incitement to commit a terrorist offence, will be made a crime at European level."
"The declared objective is to come down on 'terrorist propaganda' on the Internet."
"The rapporteur has attempted to clarify the European Commission's text in order to make it more respectful of human rights, seeking to introduce greater legal certainty."
"Despite this, I believe that we should reject this proposal, partly in order to send a clear signal to the Commission and the Council, which have already announced that they do not wish to accept Parliament's proposals."
"in writing. - (SV) The Swedish Freedom of the Press Act represents fundamental values in Swedish society."
"We cannot accept laws to combat terrorism which are at variance with the Swedish Constitution."
"There are many other ways and possibilities by which to achieve the same aims."
"The proposals we voted on today do not offer any scope for an opt-out which would allow us to retain our legislation in Sweden."
"We support the improvements which the European Parliament has proposed but cannot support the proposal as a whole."
"Since a settlement in line with the Swedish Constitution has been reached in the Council, however, we choose to abstain instead of voting against the report."
"The LefranÃ§ois report proposes a number of good measures to improve the efficiency and coordination of the fight against terrorism within the EU."
"I therefore voted in favour of it."
"The ETA attacks a few days ago and the murderous attack in Islamabad have demonstrated that we can never be too vigilant and efficient in this fight."
"Cross-border cooperation in the fight against terrorism - which, nowadays, is mainly Islamic in origin - is essential if we want to achieve results."
"However, we cannot disregard past mistakes either."
"After all, for years the Schengen area has been offering potential terrorists and criminals an ideal environment to carry out their criminal plans, often with impunity."
"There is an urgent need for Europe to reflect on its open-border policy and the pernicious consequences of this policy with regard to immigration, crime and Islamic extremism."
"If not, the framework proposed here will also prove worthless."
"I voted in favour of the LefranÃ§ois report on the proposal for a Council Framework Decision amending Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA on combating terrorism, as I believe we need to adapt the instruments for combating terrorism to the new information and communication media available to terrorists."
"Revising the EU framework decision will allow the inclusion of the concept of terrorism in specific preparatory acts, such as recruitment and training for terrorism and public provocation to commit terrorist acts, which will become criminal offences in all Member States."
"It is also important to highlight the important amendments tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, with the aim of guaranteeing the fundamental freedoms of speech and association."
"The current international and Community legal framework includes a set of instruments that are more than necessary for combating real terrorism and the organised, violent and transnational crime that is associated with it."
"The aim of this proposal is to step up the set of security measures, which, on the pretext of the events of 11 September 2001, have put citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees at risk."
"This proposal, as the rapporteur herself points out, puts forward ambiguous definitions that do not safeguard respect for fundamental freedoms."
"As in 'Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA on combating terrorism' - with its definition of 'terrorism' - once again the possibility remains open for implementing security measures and criminalising individuals or groups who speak out against or write about State terrorism."
"This proposal does not represent any added value in combating real terrorism and the associated transnational crime and in fact poses genuine threats to the security and fundamental freedoms of citizens in the various Member States."
"As we have pointed out, rather than security measures we need to tackle the real causes fuelling terrorism."
"As we have already stated, 'we will not trade freedom for security, as we will be left with neither'."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"On Saturday 20 September a suicide bomber caused a lorry to explode in front of the Marriott Hotel in the heart of the Pakistani capital, reducing it to a burned-out ruin and killing at least 60 people."
"This attack was attributed to the Pakistani Taliban linked to Al-Qaeda."
"On Sunday 20 and Monday 21 September it was the turn of ETA, the Basque separatist organisation, to spill blood in three attacks."
"The preparations for these attacks are thought to have been made in France."
"Terrorism has no borders, and the Schengen area offers it the perfect cradle in which to recruit, indoctrinate and make the logistical preparations for attacks."
"In France the Interior Minister MichÃ¨le Alliot-Marie said on the subject that 'French prisons are a hotbed of recruitment for radical Islamists.'"
"An honest admission!"
"It is a fact that terrorism has many causes, but today they mainly lie in the armed combat of radical Islam."
"Curiously, there are no legislative texts aimed at detecting and preventing recruitment in prisons or in certain so-called 'sensitive' neighbourhoods."
"The European Union intends to give itself a body of legislation to combat terrorism."
"(Explanation of vote cut pursuant to Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs LefranÃ§ois, since a central tenet of the fight against terrorism has to be the prevention of terrorist offences."
"Provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism are three preparatory acts that are also to be regarded as offences."
"In so doing, however, fundamental rights must continue to be protected."
"I therefore voted for the use of the term 'incitement' rather than 'provocation', since this is more accurate and gives less leeway."
"Action must be taken against the Internet as a virtual training camp, as the new information and communication technologies mean that it is becoming increasingly easy for terrorists to disseminate their propaganda."
"The EU must counter terrorism clearly and decisively, and the adoption of the three new offences is an important step in doing so."
"Freedom of the press, freedom of expression and the right to respect for the privacy of correspondence and secrecy of telecommunications, which also includes e-mail and other kinds of electronic correspondence, should not be curtailed, however, and so I support the amendments by Mrs LefranÃ§ois."
"We certainly have sleepers within the EU, who could become active at any time."
"It should not be forgotten, though, that terrorists do not appear from nowhere, but come into a country and grow up in an environment hostile to that country."
"If the EU really wants to pursue counter-terrorism effectively, it has to grapple with measures to counter the formation and expansion of parallel societies and suchlike, instead of condemning wholesale those who highlight the problems of coexistence with migrants."
"Equally, counter-terrorism should not lead to a stealthy cutback in citizens' rights, which even the European Court of Justice recently brought into the arena, or result in the fight against crime receding as a result of the obsession with terrorism."
"If we bear in mind that Islamist zealots are at the forefront of the terrorist threat, cracking down on Islamist preachers of hatred and criminalising terrorist camp training at European level is long overdue."
"On this note, I voted in favour of the LefranÃ§ois report."
"in writing. - (RO) The recent attacks in the Basque Country show once again that terrorism is a daily reality and that we need effective instruments to fight it."
"The Council's new framework decision on fighting terrorism is certainly a step forward and I welcome its adoption."
"I am surprised that the commemoration of 7 years since the New York terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 went unnoticed by the European Parliament."
"We should try not to forget the victims of those attacks, and we should have stressed that Transatlantic relations are a priority among the day-to-day tasks of the European Parliament."
"Legal clarity of the legal framework for combating terrorism is just as necessary as clarity and determination in this whole regard."
"In this sense, the Commission's concern about the mechanisms, means and methods involved in recruiting terrorists, particularly those who are recruited in European countries - who are often born and bred here - is understandable."
"In this area, we need to ensure that police authorities and the State have the necessary means to act, preferably in a preventive way."
"Actions aimed at combating this phenomenon that do not involve police or judicial authorities are also relevant."
"It is a question of ensuring that, alongside the reaction of the legal system, there is also an alert and attentive political system that can take action, whether by strengthening integration, promoting the voice of the moderate majority, or tackling the marginalisation associated with illegal immigration."
"For all these reasons, the political authorities need to be attentive and active."
"Whilst it is impossible to prevent all acts of terrorism, it is possible to avoid an environment that promotes, provokes and fuels terrorism."
"One of the main aims of the European Union within the framework of a policy for a common area of freedom, security and justice is ensuring the security of its 500 million citizens."
"To achieve this, the European Union and its states must face up to modern terrorism."
"The most controversial issue in the content of the proposal to revise the Council framework decision on combating terrorism is the demand for the introduction of the concept of public provocation to commit terrorist offences."
"There is a very fine line between freedom of speech and breaking the law."
"We cannot allow a situation to develop where increasing security causes a restriction of citizens' rights and freedoms."
"For this reason I take the position that it is indispensable to ensure the highest possible legal level for the framework decision under discussion, and this should primarily be done through a tighter definition of the concept of public provocation to commit terrorist offences."
"The newly created document must be clear and harmonious from a legal aspect in order to make it an effective instrument in combating terrorism, while at the same time providing a high level of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The attacks in Madrid and London have shown us what an important problem terrorism is for the EU."
"The year 2008 reaped an enormous harvest, beginning on 1 February with the attack in Baghdad during a funeral, which caused the deaths of 30 people, and ending on 20 September with the attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, in which over 60 people died and over 250 were injured."
"There have been as many as 49 terrorist attacks in total during 2008."
"For the sake of comparison it is worth adding that this is the same number of attacks that took place between 2002 and 2007 (inclusive)."
"One of the most effective ways of combating terrorism is to eliminate its causes."
"This is why I think that the European Union should apply every effort to combat terrorism on a global scale, with respect for human rights."
"The EU should make Europe safer by enabling its citizens to enjoy freedom, security and justice, which must to a large extent depend on the will of the Member States."
"I voted against this report out of absolute conviction."
"The Roure report demonstrates for the umpteenth time how political correctness is blinding Europe."
"It is evident that, in the fight against crime and the fight against terrorism, the government has the right to gather as much data as possible on potential suspects, including 'ethnic' data."
"Even the rapporteur admits this."
"However, why should the civil authorities not process data in other fields too - while respecting personal privacy - if this guarantees good governance?"
"Why, for example, should the Italian Government not take the fingerprints of illegal immigrants if this is the only means of identifying them?"
"The original Council proposal on the matter was sufficiently balanced."
"Similarly to the left, taking action against dissidents throughout Europe like a full-blown thought police - as a Fleming I know a thing or two about that - the intention here is to act as a watchdog of civil liberties."
"It is too ridiculous for words."
"Bearing in mind that this is a case of the Council 'consulting' the EP, we would like to emphasise that although we have supported amendments put forward by the EP, even though they water down previously adopted positions, we believe that this proposal falls far short of what is needed in the area of 'protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters'."
"In addition to other crucial aspects in our negative assessment of this proposal, we highlight the fact that it does not rule out, even though it attaches (pseudo) conditions, 'the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade-union membership and the processing of data concerning health or sex life', which is unacceptable!"
"As was pointed out in the debate, it is a proposal based on a lowest common denominator for an issue of such overarching importance as safeguarding the rights, freedoms and guarantees of the citizens of the various Member States, that is below what is laid down in other legal instruments, particularly those of the Council of Europe."
"Ensuring the protection of personal data is an urgent and indispensable issue."
"It cannot be achieved through a legal instrument that - because of its gaps and flaws - does not guard against the possibility of non-compliance or non-protection."
"That is why we abstained."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Roure, which guarantees a high level of data protection with regard to the processing of personal data."
"Combating terrorism should not be at the expense of citizens' fundamental rights, which is why it is imperative to guarantee the protection of personal data."
"The Council's agreement has some deficiencies and therefore cannot guarantee this."
"This report remedies the shortfalls and modifies the Council's agreement to the effect that the use and dissemination of personal data is more strictly regulated."
"The report words the proportionality and purpose of data processing more precisely, imposes stricter controls on transfer to third countries, and calls for a group of experts, which is to function as both supervisory authority and performance location."
"The lengthy discussion in the European bodies shows the contentiousness and sensitivity of the subject."
"Reaching agreement on it is difficult, but should not lead to a superficial result or the watering down of data protection in the EU."
"Personal data must always be handled with extreme care and with every possible safeguard."
"in writing. - While the measures put forward by the Commission in this Framework Decision fall short of what I would have liked to see, I supported the general principle of setting a minimum level for personal data protection."
"The Civil Liberties Committee of Parliament did some good work in improving the proposal, which I hope will be taken on board."
"Sinn FÃ©in supports the highest possible level of data protection for citizens and will continue to support any measures which improve the privacy and rights of citizens in this field."
"The Council's proposal can on no account be accepted in its present form."
"Its forfeiting of the protection of personal data is unacceptable."
"A comprehensive legal framework on personal data is needed to ensure that there is substantial protection and no processing of such data by the state or by individuals, at either international or national level."
"The European Parliament's criticisms and recommendations on the Council proposal are generally a move in the right direction, but they are not enough."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats chose to vote for Amendment 1 to the Report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2007."
"The reason for this is that we think the European Parliament itself should be able to decide on its own seat."
"However, we think that, in the interests of our climate and environment and on economic grounds, the European Parliament should only have one seat: in Brussels."
"in writing. - The Petitions Committee of the European Parliament performs an invaluable service to the European Union citizens, channelling their concerns to the Commission, questioning national, regional and local authorities on irregularities in the application of EU law, and taking on instances of violations of citizens' rights."
"The sharp increase in the number of petitions received by the European Parliament last year illustrates both the citizens' growing awareness of how Parliament can serve them and the need for the Committee to be adequately funded and staffed."
"No less than 65 petitions concerned Ireland in the year 2007, and the country has been visited by a Committee fact-finding mission due to the breach of EU Directives concerning water and the environment."
"I am convinced of the crucial role of the Petitions Committee as a resort for citizens faced with breaches of rules, as well as a bridge between them and all levels of administration and government within the EU via their elected MEPs."
"This report deserved an abstention."
"It is a good thing, of course, that European citizens are able to petition the authorities - including their 'European authorities' - but I regret the federalist undertones of this report."
"One example is the completely irrelevant way it extols the Charter of Fundamental Rights chiselled into the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Another example is its call for even greater efficiency - read 'interference' - towards Member States on the part of the Commission."
"The way in which this report has been used to argue in favour of one European seat, to be located in Brussels, also disturbs me."
"Naturally we are all sick of the waste of money caused by the 'fragmentation' of the European Parliament, but this one seat could of course just as easily be located in Strasbourg."
"in writing. - (SV) This report is in fact an activity report from the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions."
"But, since the report refers at several points to the Treaty of Lisbon in glowing terms and in the hope that it will soon be ratified, we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety."
"Our fundamental view is that the Treaty of Lisbon has been rejected, since voters in one Member State and in one referendum said 'no' to the Treaty."
"Yet there are many more Member States in which there is no doubt that a majority of voters would have rejected the Treaty of Lisbon if they had been given the chance."
"That ignorance, which the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions shows at various points in its report, is something we cannot endorse."
"As regards the question of a single seat for the European Parliament, we back the principle that it is for the Member States together to decide on the seat of the European Parliament, but we also think it reasonable for the European Parliament to express an opinion on the matter."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of Mr Hammerstein's Amendment 1 to his own report."
"We have today discovered that next month the European Parliament will once again embark upon its monthly trek to Strasbourg at a cost of billions of euros to the taxpayer."
"We must end this travelling circus, and Parliament itself must be at the heart of the debate."
"I voted in favour of Mr Hammerstein's report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2007, as it provides a transparent presentation of the positive effects of this committee's actions."
"The committee itself, chaired by Mr Libicki, has shown through its actions that it is very much needed."
"It enables EU citizens to submit petitions concerning breaches of their rights as citizens by public authorities in the Member States."
"Rule 191 of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure states that 'any citizen of the European Union ... or ... person residing ... in a Member State shall have the right to address, individually or in association with other citizens or persons, a petition to Parliament on a matter which comes within the European Union's fields of activity and which affects him, her or it directly.'"
"I consider the provision of the ePetition database to be a significant achievement in the work of this committee."
"Thanks to this database it is now possible to gain online access to all documents relating to each petition."
"Mention should also be made of the significant rise in the number of petitions submitted electronically."
"Last year this amounted to 42%."
"The Committee on Petitions cooperates well with the relevant departments within the European Commission and with the European Ombudsman, and also with the appropriate representatives of the Member States and regional and local authorities, in providing appropriate explanations."
"The fact-finding visits by committee representatives are very helpful to its work."
"The well-functioning secretariat does a lot to increase the effectiveness of its work."
"in writing. - (LT) The signatures of more than 1 million EU citizens have been collected in support of the EU-wide citizens' initiative calling for one permanent seat for the European Parliament."
"This gave the people involved the right to submit a petition to the Committee on Petitions to appoint a permanent seat for Parliament."
"In my view, the European Parliament's existing system of working arrangements is inefficient and involves unjustified financial expenses."
"Taxpayers' money is being wasted instead of being put to good use with the aim of creating added value for citizens."
"Back in 2005, during the preparation of the report on the European Parliament's budget, I suggested that the European Parliament work from a single seat, thus eliminating travel expenses and enabling Parliament to save on financing travel by its Members and staff."
"However, in today's vote I am not supporting the amendment tabled on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on a permanent seat for the European Parliament in Brussels."
"In my opinion, it is not right to presume that Brussels should exclusively be appointed as the permanent seat of the European Parliament."
"This is a matter that falls within the competence of the Member States."
"in writing. - I welcome the report's acknowledgement of the rising significance of the Committee on Petitions."
"This year has seen a 50% increase in the number of petitions received compared to 2006."
"I also recognise the rapporteur's concerns about the length of time taken by the Commission and the Court of Justice to resolve cases referred to the Committee."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - I welcome the Hammerstein report on the Petitions committee today."
"In particular, I welcome the report's taking to task of the Irish government on many issues."
"The Irish government's decision to push ahead with the M3 motorway through the heart of one of our most historic national sites is unjustifiable."
"The project should be abandoned or re-worked to protect our national monuments."
"The campaign must continue in Ireland and Europe to make sure that this happens before it is too late as the government is trying to ensure."
"I have voted in favour of the Hammerstein report on the work of the Committee on Petitions."
"It supports the work of that committee, which is one of the primary channels of communication between citizens and the European institutions."
"The effectiveness of the Committee on Petitions in negotiating and supporting citizens' causes needs to be improved by strengthening its institutional role and further improving its cooperation with the European Commission, the European Ombudsman and the authorities of the Member States."
"in writing. - The failure of Parliament to support Amendment 1 on the issue of the one seat is disappointing."
"This is the second Strasbourg part-session which we have had in Brussels, and we have proved that we can meet effectively and vote in Brussels."
"We no longer need to hold sessions in Strasbourg."
"I encourage colleagues to sign Written Declaration 75 calling on Parliament to meet in Brussels and end Strasbourg sessions."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to vote against the report, since we are opposed to the introduction of special support for hill and mountain farmers in the form of a dairy cow premium."
"Although we welcome a comprehensive strategy for hill and mountain regions, increased support to the dairy sector is not the right way to go."
"If the aim is to reduce the share of the common agricultural policy in the EU budget as a whole, transfers from the first to the second pillar are also not appropriate."
"The report on the situation and outlook for hill and mountain farming identifies, if only in a piecemeal way, the specific problems faced by farming and stock-rearing in those regions."
"Among other things, these are inaccessibility, high transport costs and difficult soil conditions for crops etc. However, the report does not mention the responsibility of Member States and the EU for the lack of infrastructure, and for the substantial absence of specific measures."
"Such measures should be aimed at minimising the natural disadvantages of these regions in producing and marketing agricultural products, and at making good use of comparative benefits."
"The EU uses vague wording and empty expressions of good intent."
"Whatever measures are taken turn out to be ineffective and fail to halt the depopulation of these regions."
"The same unproductive stance is maintained in the report, which tries to whitewash Community policy."
"It contains no mention of the steady reduction in EU agricultural funding, the fiscal budgets and the negative impact of the CAP."
"On the contrary, the EU is merely repeating the same old measures, which it is trying to adapt to the framework of the forthcoming CAP health check."
"An essential pre-condition for improving living conditions, and increasing agricultural income in hill and mountain regions, is the struggle of the farmers themselves against the CAP, and the demand for special funding for hill and mountain regions in a bid to improve infrastructure and support the agricultural production process."
"in writing. - (SV) The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wants to bestow favours on all the special interests it comes across in this sector."
"If special provision now needs to be made for hill and mountain farmers, the question arises whether special measures and agreements need to be drawn up to protect agriculture in Norrland."
"We are strongly opposed to this report on grounds of principle."
"Junilistan notes once again that it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have codecision powers on the EU's agricultural policy."
"If it did, the Union would be caught in a trap of protectionism and costly subsidies to all the various groups involved in agriculture."
"The members of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Ebner report, one of the reasons being that it gives a good impression of the specific problems of hill and mountain farming."
"However, the members of the VVD do not agree with the provisions of the report that anticipate the decision-making procedure in respect of the CAP 'health check', particularly the plea for a 20% national reserve."
"in writing. - This report highlights the key role mountainous regions play in terms of the environment, agriculture and even culture and tourism."
"Most importantly, it is recognised that these areas are essential for maintaining pockets of biodiversity and the implementation of a forestry strategy."
"However, these unique areas can also present significant challenges for people living and working in them, especially in terms of infrastructure, communications and high production costs."
"It is for this reason that these areas deserve a coordinated and integrated strategy, much like the approach which relates to the European Union's coastal regions."
"Of course, sheep farming is intricately linked to agriculture in these areas, and it must be recognised that sheep grazing is especially important for their environmental stability."
"However, although this industry is currently facing many challenges, the Commission has aggravated the situation with its recent proposal on electronic tagging."
"Moreover, although special assistance for sheep farmers is urgently required, unfortunately it does not seem to be forthcoming."
"in writing. - I and my British conservative colleagues welcome the focus that this report places on mountain and hill farming, which does need specific measures to ensure that environmentally beneficial farming practices can continue in such regions."
"Unfortunately the Ebner report calls for a number of measures using primarily the first pillar, including the introduction of a dairy cow premium for mountain areas and for the upper limit of resources under Article 69 to be raised to 20%."
"We do not favour the introduction of new coupled subsidies within the first pillar."
"They are not consistent with the ongoing reforms of agricultural policy and do not offer good value for money for the European taxpayer."
"The challenges faced by these regions can best be met through rural development funding in the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"For this reason we will not be supporting this report."
"I voted for Mr Ebner's report because I consider it an important signal from the European Parliament to the mountainous regions of Europe."
"I base this on personal experience as I live in a mountainous region in northeast Slovakia, in the foothills of the High Tatras."
"I have undertaken a few studies on the attraction of life in mountainous regions."
"I thank the rapporteur for incorporating into the report my draft amendments which I submitted to the Committee on Regional Development and which received support when the committee voted."
"Mountainous regions can provide quality agricultural produce and more diversity of agricultural products in the European market and there is therefore a need for greater coordination of rural development and structural support for the development of common programmes and maintenance of other activities, such as the exploitation of biomass and agri-tourism, thus increasing the incomes of local people."
"Mountainous regions have a constant requirement for sustainable, modernised and multifunctional agriculture."
"Sustainable forestry exploitation will make it possible to produce energy using wood residues."
"The preservation of certain animal and vegetable species, upholding traditions, ecological activities and tourism will make a contribution to the fight against climate change by protecting biodiversity and capturing CO2 through permanent grassland and forests."
"I am convinced that mountainous regions require new means of protecting their territory against flooding with the emphasis on flood prevention, whilst farmers and foresters could support anti-flooding measures by means of the direct area-related payments which they receive under the common agricultural policy."
"in writing. - I support this report looking at promoting sustainable development in mountainous regions."
"The move to a more market-orientated CAP means that mountainous regions, where agricultural production is less competitive, are not only facing new challenges but also, I believe, new opportunities."
"Mountainous regions may not be able to adapt as easily to competitive conditions and may entail extra costs so that they cannot produce very competitive products at low prices, but the focus needs to be on exploiting the resources available, including the beauty of the natural landscape to attract tourists, and exploiting the potential competitive advantage of these regions, including the array of regional and traditional products, the wealth of traditional knowledge and manufacturing procedures, which give their products competitive edge."
"I differ from some of my colleagues here in the European Parliament in that I do not believe the solution to the challenges facing mountainous regions is to throw more CAP money at these regions."
"Where there are clear public benefits to supporting farming in mountainous regions, such as environmental benefits, I believe that public funding under the rural development pillar would be more appropriate."
"Exploiting the potential of mountainous areas is key to their sustainable development, not simply throwing more public money at them."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"

"Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system - Investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector - The liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of an accident - Port State control (recast) - Ship inspection and survey organisations (Directive recast) - Ship inspection and survey organisations (Regulation recast) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"

"the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position (05726/2/2008 - C6-0223/2008 - for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations (recast) (Rapporteur: Luis de Grandes Pascual)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, the question we must ask ourselves is whether, nine years after the accident involving the Erika and almost six years after the one involving the Prestige, we are prepared if anything like this should happen again."
"This is the real question before us."
"Is everything in order?"
"Do we have a sufficient number of experts who are independent enough to take decisions?"
"Can they work quickly enough?"
"Have we finished all the preparations enabling them to call on other specialists or on relief workers to resolve the matter?"
"Is the crew properly treated in such a case?"
"Is compensation paid out?"
"Do we know enough about the ships travelling along our coasts?"
"These are the questions we asked after the Erika and also after the Prestige."
"At that time, the Commission lost no time in presenting proposals in this regard, and we also put a few things down on paper - which we now need to refine."
"We have had a first reading, to which the Council responded in the form of a common position - a particularly disappointing one."
"However, to my great satisfaction I must say that, since then, we have held informal talks with the Council - first with the Slovenian Presidency and now, particularly, with the French - that have produced very good results."
"As regards the competent authority, we are almost there."
"We have a good text down on paper that I would at all events advocate to my fellow Members."
"There is an authority that is involved in planning, is permanent in nature, has the necessary expertise and can take independent decisions to improve the accommodation of ships."
"We have also made progress in the field of vessel monitoring, not only by means of ordinary radar, but also by satellite."
"We have more detailed information on the cargo and know who is responsible for providing this information."
"Monitoring also applies to fishing vessels, so that the safety of small vessels can also be increased."
"We have worked out the measures to be taken in the presence of ice."
"We have made progress, therefore, but we are still not completely finished."
"What remains to be resolved?"
"The tendency to regard crews as criminals, compensation in the event of financial losses for ports, and compulsory notification for bunker fuel."
"After all, small quantities of this highly polluting fuel can sometimes do very great damage to the environment - as was the case, for example, with the Tricolor accident off the Belgian/French coast, where 180 tonnes of fuel, although a very small amount, caused fairly considerable damage."
"President-in-Office, I should like to express my appreciation for the work that we - Parliament and the Council - have managed to do together in connection with my report, and I wish to encourage Parliament and the Council to continue in that vein."
"This brings me to the two texts on which we have no common position."
"As rapporteur for one of the texts, I would urge the Council to adopt a decision on the two missing texts, too."
"I know that the President-in-Office is working hard on this, but the two issues of the financial responsibility of shipowners and the task of flag states are regarded by Parliament as an essential component in order to reinforce maritime safety."
"The International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea ('HNS' Convention), for example, must be ratified by all Member States if a proper system for the accommodation of ships is to be developed for the various Member States and for the Union."
"Parliament urges the President-in-Office to do everything possible to ensure that the Council adopts a decision on these two texts, too."
"If it does not, we shall have a very serious problem; the likelihood is that Parliament will regard everything we have achieved, however much I value it, as unsatisfactory."
"I would ask the President-in-Office to keep up the good work, therefore."
"Parliament - this rapporteur, in any case - is behind him."
"Let us continue to work to achieve the best possible result for maritime safety."
"I do not see Mr KohlÃ­Äek in his seat."
"We will move on to the other rapporteurs, and if he arrives in time we will give him the floor."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we were in this Chamber in April 2007 for the first reading."
"Now it is September 2008, and I do not think that the time has passed in vain."
"There have been many developments, many advances have been made, and I remain confident that we will be able to go the last mile that we still have to travel for the completion of a major task, that of giving all European citizens, and non-Europeans too, in fact all those who sail on Europe's seas, safety conditions that are certainly better than the existing ones."
"I would like to call to mind not only the Erika or the Prestige, as mentioned by Mr Sterckx, but - and this is the task that I have set myself for my report on the sector - I would also like to say that we must avoid tragedies such as that of the Princess of the Stars, with 800 deaths in the Philippines, as well as the 'mere' 4 deaths recorded in the collision between a container ship and a hydrofoil on the Strait of Messina or again the 'mere' 2 deaths a few days ago among those on La Besogne, which hit a bateau mouche in Paris."
"To sum up, there are risks on all waters, and we need to take action on all waters."
"The direction is very simple, though: it seems to me that we cannot put ourselves in the position of regretting not having taken the decisions required in the face of accidents that recur."
"I would like to make the point again - these decisions relate not only to the protection of the environment, shores and seas, such as Erika and Prestige, but also to the protection of human lives such as in the serious accidents that have, through luck, up until now taken place on seas far from us - recently - as well as those incidents that seem smaller."
"I gave just two examples: one on the Strait of Messina and the other on the River Seine a few days ago."
"My report also contains a strategy, which I believe we should all adopt: making the best use of all European competences in terms of environmental protection and consumer protection."
"In this case, that means protection of lives, of individuals, and protection of safety and security to improve on the current situation."
"We need to be careful, however: we need to use the competences that the Treaty allows without any absolute transfer of further sovereignty, and without taking away any area from the Member States that, as we believe, and as we want to believe, fully share this objective."
"From this viewpoint, then, I think that we ought to continue to work in the area to which my report relates to find mechanisms whose scope can be extended in ways that nobody can reject, and to find gradual methods of implementation over a reasonable period that will allow everyone to adapt over time, without demanding that things should happen overnight."
"On the limitation of liability, we need to find a way to combine certainty on the part of the shipowner regarding the liability it is assuming and the amount of damages that it might incur, with certainty on the part of potential victims that they will receive compensation."
"We therefore need to come up with some solutions that take up the option of moving around the upper or lower limits - which are currently fixed - that we want to or will be able to impose."
"We need to ensure that better information is given to those who travel on our vessels and we need to make it possible for action to be taken immediately when accidents happen, including through advance payments in limited, appropriate cases, which can be verified."
"I believe that on these issues we can find an agreement very easily; we can find a way to respond to those points that still remain and close the dossier."
"The fundamental point remains, however: we must not permit ourselves to tackle just one point, but we need to close the issue and to be able to say to European citizens that we are working on all fronts and in all sectors."
"I will not repeat the issue relating to the two - let us say - reports that are missing, the two provisions that are missing."
"I would like to tell the French Presidency that it has made an enormous effort and I am sure it will continue to do so."
"Personally speaking, and as regards Parliament, I can assure you that in any case we will work every day, at all times, from now until 31 December this year, to ensure that the dossier can be closed under this presidency and that it can be closed in the best way possible for all those who are watching us."
"I am convinced that in the end we will all be able to feel proud of having made progress on maritime security in Europe, with nobody feeling - how shall I put it? - that they are losing any responsibility that they want to exercise directly."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to begin, may I just remind you all here that maritime safety must remain a priority on the European political agenda."
"We cannot wait for another major accident to happen at sea to make us realise that maritime safety is a priority for us as political leaders, and also for the population, which will no longer put up with seeing its coasts polluted, not to mention the fact that these accidents constitute an environmental catastrophe and cause financial disasters."
"The first reading in Parliament was in April 2007."
"It has taken the Council more than a year to advise us of its Common Positions and this has only been on five of the seven texts in the package."
"I must admit that I find this quite difficult to accept."
"It can, of course, happen that some issues raise major problems and it can be difficult to reach agreement."
"At least we agree on the package of legislation, which is indeed complicated, but I see few valid reasons to prevent agreement on technical yet concrete texts that actually form a very coherent whole."
"As I recall, a year ago we were all very happy - even pleased with ourselves."
"Clearly, along with my fellow Members, I would like to know why it has taken the Council so long to look at this dossier, and I would also like the Council to tell us what prevented it from reaching agreement on two important proposals, namely shipowners' civil liability and flag state obligations, particularly because the flag state text is the natural complement to my report on port state control."
"In view of this, it is quite easy to see how the interaction of one text with the other texts fully justifies this 'package' approach and the need for agreement on all of them."
"I may sound a bit harsh, but I want to know what is going on."
"However, I applaud the genuine efforts made by the French Presidency of the EU, which has tried to resolve the blockage and revive discussions on the two proposals currently missing: those of the Savary and Fernandez reports."
"It has not been a lack of progress on each of our texts or individual difficulties with each proposal that have prevented us from reaching agreement with the Council, but the fact that two proposals are not in the package at the moment, which obviously presents a problem for all the rapporteurs."
"Personally, I believe we will soon come to an agreement on each of the proposals, because we will have to, even if the conciliation procedure is used."
"Anyway, I know that the French Presidency is working on it and I hope it will succeed."
"I am not particularly concerned for my report on port state control because I know that at the end of our informal trialogue many problems were resolved."
"Apart from various differences in formulation, three major differences with the Council remain, for which my preference was to reinstate Parliament's First Reading position."
"The first point was the application of the Directive to anchorages, which is a key issue for maritime safety."
"We must include anchorages in this text."
"I believe we are sending the message of a firm and consistent policy."
"Ships that are not up to standard must not be able to escape inspection, regardless of their shipping route and where they are calling in European waters."
"The second point concerns the application of permanent bans."
"Once again, I believe this is a measure that should be kept as a deterrent for bad behaviour."
"This measure should, in fact, be used only rarely because there should be few vessels that meet its conditions of application, but it must exist for vessels that are not up to standard so that these vessels are not likely to present new problems and leave a feeling of impunity."
"The third point concerns the flexibility measures for the application of the inspection system."
"At First Reading we chose flexibility mechanisms based on specific circumstances; for example, inspections missed because bad weather prevents inspections from being carried out, or where safety conditions are not met."
"The possibility was included of postponing the inspection of a vessel from one Community port to the next."
"The Council wants more."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Mr Bussereau, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are returning once again to the debate that we brought to a close at first reading a year and a half ago."
"We are doing so with more reasons than we had then to be pleased with the results achieved, which were the fruit of the cooperation and consensus that exists in this House on such a sensitive issue for the public as safety on our seas."
"However, I regret that our pleasure is not complete or as we had hoped, as despite the fact that we have all learned lessons from the past, with the tragic examples of the Erika and Prestige disasters, which are still very recent in our eyes, and despite the need to act now and not wait for the consensus that always follows disasters, the attitude of the Council has unfortunately prevented us from being able to bring the matter to a close today with the adoption of the eight proposals that make up 'the third package' on maritime safety."
"This does not prevent me from recognising and expressing thanks for the will of the French Presidency, as it has taken the baton from the Portuguese and Slovenian presidencies, and has set the right pace in the Council, with the sound intention of reaching an agreement on a package of proposals that should be treated as a whole, as we all agree, because there are overlaps between them, and all those in the maritime transport chain are involved."
"There is therefore no room for discussing, as unfortunately many, or at least some governments think, whether any of these proposals are unnecessary or inappropriate."
"Each and every one of them is essential."
"Based on this, I call on the Council not to let slip away a precious opportunity for us to conclude this matter in conciliation, which some of us will come to with our homework almost done, as the informal trialogues that have been held so far, and the complete consensus that exists with all the shadow rapporteurs, have produced very satisfactory results and could provide a good basis for the final agreement."
"Having said this, ladies and gentlemen, there is still an issue that concerns me greatly, which I would like to mention, as it concerns an essential aspect of the package, in our opinion."
"I am referring to the independence of the organisations and authorities created specifically for the purpose of adopting the best possible decisions in the shortest possible time."
"In this respect, I am specifically talking about the independent authority to be created to make what is always a difficult decision: to accommodate a vessel in distress in a place of refuge."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there would be no point in creating an authority that is independent from the influences of political power if it is not provided with the necessary resources and decision-making capacities, but what is even more serious is to invest it with powers if, when the moment of truth comes, it is only left with one option: compulsory accommodation of the vessel, even if it does not have insurance or guarantees."
"That being the case, the entire burden will fall on the Member State concerned, which will end up being the victim of the ecological and social damage that may be caused by accommodating a vessel in a place of refuge, as well as having to cover that damage."
"So I say yes to creating this authority, but it should be given powers, and a vessel in distress should be accommodated only if the prior assessment of the situation leads to the conclusion that this is the best decision, and the risks are contained."
"I must tell you that I am not alone in this battle, as the European association that represents all of our ports has also protested greatly about this."
"Having said this, I thank Mr Sterckx for his persistence in this difficult undertaking, in which he has had to fight a battle."
"I particularly welcome the progress made with the ship monitoring tools, which are essential for reducing risk situations."
"As far as the differences are concerned, there will be time in conciliation, and we will make every effort to reach compromises;"
"I have no doubt that we will reach them."
"Finally I will move on to my report."
"Having been examined by the Council, what was previously only a proposal for a directive has been split into two legal instruments, a proposal for a regulation and a proposal for a directive, and the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism felt that this was the right thing to do."
"Our view of the common position is therefore positive, as it largely accepts the line advocated by Parliament: being able to strengthen the monitoring mechanisms for recognised organisations through the creation of an assessment committee of an independent nature with permanent powers and which acts autonomously; achieving a more flexible, fair penalty system, which is ultimately more effective, as it punishes those who do not act as they should, but does so based on the seriousness of the violation committed and the economic capacity of the organisation; finally, having managed to make progress on the very thorny issue of the recognition of class certificates, setting out the conditions under which the recognised organisations will have to recognise each other, without putting maritime safety at risk, and using the most demanding rules as a reference point."
"In any event, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that there is a solid basis for a final agreement, and that together we will find a sound solution for all the people of Europe."
"rapporteur. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in all sectors of transport there has long been careful investigation of the causes of serious transport accidents."
"Individual Member States view such investigations and the determination of technical causes as an essential component of accident reduction."
"The only exception up to now has been maritime transport."
"There are of course some framework regulations, but maritime transport and shipping are far more complex than other types of transport when it comes to establishing which state is to be responsible for investigating the causes of accidents."
"A ship owner need not be the operator of the ship and the two of them may come from different states."
"The seafarers may be multiethnic and multinational."
"Passengers may also be of different nationalities."
"The same goes for the cargo and for the client commissioning the voyage."
"A ship sails from a port in the territorial waters of one state to another, on the way passing through the territorial waters of other states or international waters."
"As if this were not complex enough, some states have subordinated the investigative bodies we are calling for to different state organisations."
"They are therefore not even organisationally independent."
"The investigation of accidents in the field of maritime transport has been discussed with shadow rapporteurs and with the Presidency."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism decided that it is desirable to retain the basic outlines of the draft directive."
"This involves standardised investigations in accordance with a common methodology, whereby deadlines for determining which state is going to conduct an investigation and for the submission of a final report must be laid down."
"It is of course open to discussion as to what classes of accidents are to be compulsorily investigated in accordance with the methodology adopted and as to how precisely the organisational independence of the investigative body is to be defined."
"During discussion of the materials, we reached agreement that the conclusions of a technical investigation may be used for further, for example criminal, investigations."
"The details of a technical investigation must, however, remain confidential."
"It was also clarified in committee that it is not possible to ignore the provisions requiring fair treatment of seafarers on ships which have been involved in maritime accidents, unless this is prevented by the inclusion of such provisions in other regulations."
"There is also agreement that the independent investigative body must comprise experts from several countries and that individual states may reach mutual agreement on representation in the investigation of maritime accidents."
"I should like to emphasise that one of the main aims of the maritime package under consideration is to strengthen the responsibility of the flag state."
"It is therefore appropriate that the proposed wording relating to the rapid notification of technical shortcomings identified should remain part of the directive, as should specification of the ships to which the directive relates."
"I do not think it would be a good idea, following the experiences with tanker accidents on the Spanish coast, for it still to be possible for several technical investigative bodies to be able to work in parallel."
"If the European Commission does not feel itself to be sufficiently competent to decide on the conduct of investigations, then the only option is for such decisions to be taken in the European Council."
"I certainly consider the launch of several parallel technical investigations to be a poor solution."
"The still incomplete investigation into the accident involving the tanker Prestige shows where such a buck-passing dispersal of responsibility for an investigation leads."
"It is right that the whole maritime package should be discussed at the same time, thus avoiding differences in the definitions of individual concepts in the various component directives and thus enhancing the clarity of the resultant materials."
"I believe that, even with the directive on maritime disasters, we can reach a sensible compromise which will be practicable and will make a contribution to a reduction in the likelihood of occurrence of further maritime disasters and perhaps to a thorough re-examination, including of the technical aspects."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow you will vote on the third maritime safety package."
"As you know, the maritime economy provides jobs for approximately 3 million people, making it a key sector for the European Union."
"There were seven legislative proposals in the package sent through by the Commission in early 2006."
"They aimed to introduce measures for preventing accidents at sea and to establish measures to be taken following accidents - that is, to analyse the causes and compensate any victims."
"The priority of the package is ensuring the safety and quality of shipping, while respecting the environment, as well as improving the competitiveness of the European maritime sector."
"The Council, Parliament and the Commission all support the objective of promoting maritime safety."
"At the Copenhagen European Council in 2002, the Council welcomed efforts to improve maritime safety and recalled the European Union's determination to 'take all necessary measures to avoid a repetition of similar catastrophes' to the Erika accident."
"The Council can also have no qualms about accepting many of the demands expressed by Parliament in its resolution of 27 April 2004."
"However, there are still some differences over the third maritime package, and these will require further consultation between the parties."
"Since the package was presented by the Commission, through the work of several presidencies - most recently the Slovenian Presidency - the Council has adopted six Common Positions on the following proposals: investigation of accidents, classification societies, port state control, traffic monitoring, and the Athens Convention, all while taking account of European Parliament opinions such as those adopted in April last year."
"Since the start of its term of office, the French Presidency has been making a major effort to reach agreement in Parliament at Second Reading on these six texts, for which the Common Positions were communicated by the Council in June 2008."
"During informal contacts with the rapporteurs during the summer months by the President of Coreper, real progress was made on each dossier, the purpose of which was to reach rapid agreement on these texts."
"In a recent letter, Mr Costa, you described this as 'substantial progress'."
"Furthermore, as you know, in accordance with the commitments I made last April, the Presidency has energetically and enthusiastically revived discussions in the Council on the last two texts on civil liability and flag state obligations."
"This revival was very necessary for maritime safety and, Commissioner, also came in response to constant requests from your Commission."
"You know this item was put on the agenda by the Presidency at the informal meeting in La Rochelle, to which I had invited the European Parliament representatives Mr Costa and Mr Savary, who were kind enough to attend."
"You know we are currently continuing with the technical aspects of the work so the Transport Council can look at it at its next meeting, planned for 9 October."
"Let me be frank with you: in view of the momentum this has triggered, I would have hoped we might avoid going to conciliation."
"Nevertheless, here we are."
"We must now make sure we do not lose the momentum, and above all we must not give the impression that all this progress and effort has been in vain, because this would send a poor message to the public."
"For this reason, in parallel with the work going on in the Council on the last two texts, the Presidency is still happy to maintain informal contact with each of the rapporteurs on the first six texts in order to reach agreement on the content."
"I particularly wanted to share this analysis with you, and I will tell the Council about it at its meeting on 9 October, when we will be looking at the last two texts."
"The Council will decide what its position is regarding conciliation on the first six texts."
"Mr President, I really hope that Parliament, the Council and the Commission can find a way forward for close cooperation on these dossiers."
"I think we have very nearly reached a final agreement, something we are all longing for."
"Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you in particular to my colleague."
"After so many years of being an MEP, I am pleased to be here in the Chamber."
"Mr President, Mr Bussereau, ladies and gentlemen, how could I not share the concerns and aims that have emerged from the outset of the debate on this maritime package?"
"Our concern and the concern of Parliament, which represents the peoples of Europe, is to provide guarantees or to seek to provide guarantees to European citizens that tragic events such as those we have unfortunately had to witness a few kilometres from the coasts of Europe do not recur."
"There have been accidents such as the more recent one, although it was less serious, in the port of Tarragona, that confirm that our undertaking is right, that confirm that we need to give answers to citizens."
"Of course, it is impossible to prevent accidents from happening, but we must certainly do all we can to prevent them, through legislation, and through political action."
"How can we do this?"
"Firstly, we can do so by making life more difficult for unscrupulous operators, with more rigorous, systematic checks in all EU ports and also with more effective provisions regarding the taking in of a vessel in danger to a place of refuge, and finally through more rigorous control of the organisations authorised to inspect vessels and issue security certificates on behalf of the Member States."
"In brief, we need to improve the way in which we tackle the consequences of accidents, obtaining fair compensation for passengers or their families or for the maritime community, and learning more thorough lessons from the investigations that take place after accidents."
"This is one of the important issues - understanding what happened in order to prevent it happening again."
"It is these various aspects that you will have to deal with, once the Council has decided on five of the seven proposals in the third maritime safety package."
"As we know, the Transport Council last April was not able to consider the proposals relating to the obligations of flag States or the civil liability of shipowners."
"We should not underestimate the difficulties expressed by the Member States, which also emerged during the course of the informal Council meeting in La Rochelle - concern about a transfer of competences to the European Union for subjects covered by international conventions and the fear of an increase in the administrative burden of checks."
"We sought during the Council meeting in La Rochelle - at which Mr Costa was present - and by 'we' I mean the Commission and the President, as well as the French Presidency, which I thank for the work it has done in coordination with the Commission to try to get the whole package adopted speedily, without abandoning two legislative texts that we all consider to be very important, as Mr Bussereau stressed."
"I really must warmly thank the French Presidency for the action it has taken, its attempt to mediate, and its wish to involve Parliament in what is a very delicate and also very difficult legislative decision."
"Certainly, I cannot say that I am satisfied with the situation as it is today."
"There are two issues that are at risk of being put to one side, and they are of extraordinary importance."
"The Commission wants the whole package to be adopted, and we will work and persist in attempts to reach an agreement."
"Europe cannot permit itself to fail to give concrete answers to its citizens; we must have an aim that is simple but binding: that all vessels flying flags of Member States are fully compliant."
"Our concern must be to guarantee, in addition, that the victims of maritime accidents receive adequate, uniform compensation throughout the European Union."
"In La Rochelle, we tried to set out on a path that will lead to an agreement between Parliament and the Council."
"We are working with the French Presidency, seeking to put forward texts that will receive a positive verdict from the Council and at the same time a positive verdict from Parliament."
"Yesterday, I met the Federal Republic of Germany's transport minister, and urged that Germany should also play its part; what I am trying to do with all the Member States, in the meetings that I have, is to try to take a step forward by supporting the mediation activity that the French Presidency, together with the European Commission, is attempting."
"I understand perfectly that meanwhile Parliament wants to insert into the texts at second reading amendments designed to incorporate the substance of the two proposals that have remained pending."
"I back these amendments."
"As for the dossiers that are being officially examined, I know that significant progress has been made in bringing the viewpoints of Parliament and the Council closer together and even though it has not been possible to translate this progress into compromise amendments, I am convinced that the rest of the procedure will be considerably facilitated by this progress."
"Naturally, I will be able to talk about these issues and the amendments envisaged after having heard what you have to say."
"I believe, however, that it is still possible for us to reach an agreement; it would be wrong to say that negotiations are easy, because they will be complex, but I believe that there is still room to attain an objective perhaps even before conciliation; certainly we cannot give up until we have made every effort to achieve the objective of the adoption of all the texts that make up the maritime safety package."
"Representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, you can count on the active commitment of the European Commission, all the managers and officials in the Cabinet and the Directorate-General that I have the honour of leading and my staff, in order to seek to achieve the objective of a specific answer for all the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am pleased to note the common ground - there is actually a great deal - that has emerged in the debate so far."
"Our French Council representative, our friend, has said he is of the opinion that we shall still be able to reach agreement by the end of the year."
"Yes indeed, let us reach that agreement!"
"I should also like to thank the Vice-Presidents for the support of the Commission during the discussions between the rapporteurs and the French Council Presidency."
"President-in-Office, we wish to acknowledge that you and your colleagues have already made great progress in the individual discussions on the six dossiers."
"We are very much on the right track but - and I also say this to you to support your reluctant colleagues in the Council - there is either one package or no package."
"I therefore hope that you will make progress in the two dossiers that are still unresolved at the next Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council meeting on 9 November."
"These are not unimportant dossiers."
"I do not wish to delve into the details of the civil liability of shipowners, but I do consider it particularly important in the case of the flag States."
"It is evident, however, that, despite all their professions to have maritime safety and the safety of seafarers, of passengers and of coastal waters in mind at all times, Member States are shying away from ratifying and implementing very specific obligations or even just the IMO resolutions on maritime protection."
"If we want these flag State obligations to become established, if we - Parliament and the Commission - want to be able to put pressure on the Member States - in court if necessary - to fulfil their obligations under the IMO Convention on maritime protection and the protection of coastal populations, the Member States recoil."
"Although there are good people who fulfil their flag State obligations, there are some who are very reluctant to comply with the inspection by Parliament and the Commission to ensure they are fulfilling their flag State obligations."
"This is unacceptable."
"We had the disasters of the Prestige and the Erika, and my fellow Members have also pointed out the disasters of recent times."
"We are beholden to people and to the natural environment to ensure that flag States, in particular, fulfil their obligations."
"It is bizarre."
"In Mrs Vlasto's sound report, we talk about port State control, which, in theory, is our way of checking the safety of third-country ships anchoring at our shores."
"We therefore inspect ships from third countries, but the Member States fear being subjected to the obligation to be checked to ensure they as flag States are fulfilling their duties with regard to ships' safety."
"This is unacceptable."
"In this respect, I should like to encourage the President-in-Office effectively to win the majority over on 9 October."
"I say 'majority', President-in-Office, because it could be, if I am not completely wrong, that majority decisions are possible in the transport dossier."
"You may perhaps have to break through the esprit de corps in the Council - if an individual is reluctant, the others will not push him - because this concerns the safety of the natural environment and people and we shall have to reach a majority decision if need be."
"I appeal to you to carry on."
"We are proud of you - you have fought well in the Council to date."
"Please pass on the following message to the Council: we are behind you, and we are ready and willing to achieve good results together with the French Presidency."
"However, some do need to budge - including the German Government."
"Let us all fight together on this!"
"Welcome"
"Before moving on to the next speaker I would like to inform Members that Mr Bronislaw Komorowski, President of the Polish Parliament, is in the official gallery, accompanied by a delegation."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Komorowski has responded to an invitation from our President, Hans-Gert PÃ¶ttering, and a moment ago they both opened the photographic exhibition with which we are recalling the career in pursuit of freedom of our dear, much admired friend and colleague, Bronislaw Geremek, who is no longer with us."
"Mr Komorowski, we warmly welcome you to this your home, the European Parliament."
"Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system - Investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector - The liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of an accident - Port State control (recast) - Ship inspection and survey organisations (Directive recast) - Ship inspection and survey organisations (Regulation recast) (continuation of debate)"
"Mr President, since I became a shadow rapporteur when the Council swept away my report, I have only two minutes to speak."
"I will therefore cut to the chase, firstly to say that I am not addressing the French Presidency, which is supporting us, or the Commissioner, who is supporting us, but the Council."
"I am also addressing my fellow Members to thank them for their solidarity, and to say that the Erika and the Prestige were very bad experiences."
"The Member States have accused Europe of not doing enough about them."
"Now, thanks to Commissioner Barrot, we are attempting to establish, from scratch, an honourable European maritime transport space."
"One of the measures we are proposing is shipowners' civil liability."
"What does that mean?"
"It means that, at the very least, we are ensuring that all vessels are insured by solvent insurance companies for the damage they cause, at least within the framework of the IMO conventions."
"In La Rochelle I was pleased to see Member States who had not joined the IMO suddenly becoming ardent fans of the organisation."
"My advice to them is to ratify the IMO conventions, starting with the one on chemicals."
"There could be a chemical hazard, a chemical disaster, today, or tomorrow morning."
"We would be transported back to the time of the Exxon Valdez."
"Practically no Member States have made a legal commitment as regards chemical hazards with the IMO."
"That is the first thing."
"The second is to create a guarantee and insurance certificate for the European maritime transport space."
"We need to have confidence in Europe."
"When it forges ahead, it takes the world with it."
"We have seen this particularly with the airlines blacklist."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I was recently at a symposium looking at whether the Erika was still possible."
"Indeed it is, and it was so in the Black Sea on 11 November 2007, when five vessels sank in the Strait of Kerch with worthless insurance policies."
"I genuinely believe we need to sort this out, and that is why I think, President-in-Office, that Parliament's resistance is not a question of pride."
"It is a question of public health and public interest."
"We will never accept the blame here for Member States' negligence if they fail to do their bit."
"I am counting on you."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I share the other rapporteurs' hope that we are close to adopting this important legislation."
"I think it strange that it should take the Council so long to come up with a common position on the seven directives that are intended to prevent maritime pollution disasters and also to reinforce preparedness for when things go wrong."
"It is regrettable that we have failed for so long with regard to the two directives on the obligations of flag States and the liability of rescue workers."
"In my opinion, this too must be included in the overall package."
"Several others have said, and I agree, that the French Presidency is making wholehearted efforts to seek a solution, for which I should like to thank the Presidency on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"Let us hope that these efforts will be crowned with success."
"We all agree, of course, that shipping is a global industry, and so the legislation we adopt must be compatible with the international maritime agreements under the auspices of the IMO and under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control."
"Parliament has supported this all along."
"The third maritime safety package is intended to make coffin ships a thing of the past in European waters."
"There must be better traffic monitoring, better quality control of ships and better exchange of experience on what constitutes an incident risk."
"The issue of ports of refuge has been a bone of contention between Parliament and the Council."
"In fact, I myself live near a port that has been designated a port of refuge, and I must give my clear support to Parliament's requirement that ports of refuge must be protected from an unpleasant additional bill in the event that a ship leaking oil is towed into port."
"It is important to ensure that it is not small local communities who are left with the financial burden of any subsequent clean-up operation."
"I should like to highlight in particular two directives for which I have been the rapporteur for my group, namely the Directive on port State control and the Directive on the investigation of accidents."
"With regard to the Directive on port State control, a consensus is emerging on the principles proposed by the Commission, namely that all ships must be inspected, and that ships in poor condition must be inspected extra thoroughly."
"Port State control must meet a suitable standard in order to render controls more uniform in all EU ports."
"There are still some sticking points, however."
"The Council has not accepted the inspection of ships at anchor, nor is its stance as firm as Parliament's on refusal of access for the very worst ships."
"The ALDE Group fully supports the position of the rapporteur, Mrs Vlasto, and thus backs the reintroduction of a number of first reading proposals."
"There are also a few points on which Parliament and the Council still disagree regarding the Directive on the investigation of accidents."
"Incident investigations and the communication of their results should ensure that accidents are not repeated."
"We have to learn from the accidents that do take place, and as many people as possible must learn from each other's experiences."
"As in aviation, it must be ensured that all parties involved provide as open and honest an account of the course of the accident as possible."
"A witness statement to the investigative inquiry must not be used in direct connection with any charge made as, in such cases, the accused must be granted proper rights during questioning."
"It is a difficult balance to strike, and there are some suggestions from Parliament's first proposal that the Council has not accepted, which we are therefore reintroducing."
"The main bone of contention, however, is the issue of which types of incident should be covered."
"The Council wishes to include only the most serious accidents, but it may well be equally valuable to learn from minor accidents, indeed even near-misses."
"In addition, the Council actually wants to give equivalent status to parallel investigations carried out by several countries, whereas we want some clarity regarding which investigation is considered the official one."
"It must be avoided at all costs that an accident investigation is politicised and the authorities seek to disclaim responsibility and influence the outcome of the investigations."
"The ALDE Group thus wholeheartedly supports Mr KohlÃ­Äek's proposal to reintroduce the first reading proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to express my appreciation to all the rapporteurs on this package for the fact that they are maintaining a consistent approach on this extremely important maritime legislation."
"At the same time, I would like to express my group's fears regarding two points in Mrs Vlasto's report on port State control."
"Firstly, it seems to us that, in relation to small States with small fleets, recital 13 was much better expressed in the common position than in the current version drafted by Parliament's committee."
"The original version said that Member States should endeavour to review the method of drawing up the white, grey and black lists of flag States in the framework of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding, in order to ensure its fairness, in particular with respect to States with small fleets."
"To be precise, if a merely mathematical approach is taken, then it is very difficult for a State with a small fleet of just a few ships that is included in the grey area of all these lists to be removed from that area; what reason do the ships have to become part of the grey list fleet if, in that event, they cannot improve the mathematical proportion?"
"I think that the Council common position had a very much more balanced approach towards EU Member States with small fleets."
"The same also applies in relation to the indefinite refusal of access, where there should have been a distinction between States on the grey list and States on the black list."
"The second point is that I believe that the Council common position also took a more balanced view of the possibility of having exceptions, when inspections need not be carried out, particularly if these take place at night, in a short period of time, and also very far from the shore; in such a case it is not possible to carry out high-quality inspections in States in which there are severe winters and northern seas."
"I therefore call upon you in this instance to support the position adopted in the Council common position on this issue."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the catastrophes associated with the names Estonia, Erika and Prestige have shocked Europe."
"The EU must therefore make improvements to maritime safety quickly, efficiently and credibly."
"Many seafarers and passengers have lost their lives in the past because the safety regulations and measures were not adequate."
"Furthermore, accidents such as these have caused dire environmental catastrophes on the coasts of the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea."
"The ecological damage has been enormous and taxpayers have had to bear the cost, not the polluters."
"The European Union's intention to adopt the necessary Europe-wide and cross-border binding legislation must not be delayed by national interests."
"The Council, in particular, should keep this at the back of its mind during the negotiations now pending, as its refusal in particular to instruct independent authorities, with all their expertise in accidents involving ships, to investigate such accidents, is totally incomprehensible."
"What is the rule for catastrophes involving aircraft should not be impossible for accidents involving ships."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance welcomes all seven Commission legislative proposals, and we therefore support the rapporteurs' recommendations on the five common positions, including the split and separate votes on the recommendations of the Costa report concerning inland waterway transport."
"This also applies to the Sterckx report concerning ports of refuge."
"The specific measures such as ports of refuge, transparency and liability are very important to us."
"It is essential for maritime safety that we retain the maritime package as a whole."
"We call on the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council to adopt a common position quickly within the next few weeks on the two open-ended subjects of shipowners' liability and port State obligations, in order that the package can finally be adopted as a whole."
"The fact that those very Member States want to block European agreements by referring to international IMO regulations who have not yet transposed these into national law themselves is sheer lunacy."
"A decision must be taken in the EU before the next shipping catastrophe rocks Europe."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, in shipping, entrepreneurial freedom can lead to dangerous abuses."
"Entrepreneurs wanting to keep their costs as low as possible can be tempted to operate ships that are old and dangerous."
"These present a danger to the crew and others and a potentially serious threat to the environment."
"Poor working conditions, as enabled by opting to register under a flag other than that of the owner's own country and the real operating base, also lead to abuses."
"The operating costs can also be reduced by discarding ship-generated waste and cargo residues into the sea along the way."
"To tackle all these abuses it must be possible to ban the ships of malicious entrepreneurs definitively from European ports, and also from anchorages outside ports, and a sufficient number of inspections must be carried out to determine what is wrong."
"There must be strict compliance with the port State obligations contained in the International Labour Organization's Maritime Labour Convention, the 'polluter pays' principle must hold and all the rules must also apply at night."
"All attempts by the Council to treat such entrepreneurs more leniently than Parliament wanted at first reading would have unacceptable consequences."
"The Council has rejected the vast majority of Parliament's 23 amendments with regard to the investigation of shipping accidents, which could jeopardise the independence of investigations."
"The Council has applied the brakes in the case of the protection of passengers on board ships, too, having refused to comply with the Athens Convention in 2003."
"The common position of June 2008 restricted liability and the obligation to inform."
"The Council does not support the proposals of the Commission and Parliament in the area of disasters at sea, which aim to ensure that ships in distress are always accommodated in a port of refuge in time and that crews are protected from punishment for negligence for which they are not responsible."
"All dangerous situations and abuses in shipping must be eliminated as quickly as possible."
"For this reason, it is important that Parliament stick to the line taken previously towards the Council at second reading too."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, today is the second time we have discussed the Erika III package in plenary."
"Although it is a shame that we are lacking two proposals, I am pleased with the contents of the package in its present form, and I am grateful to the rapporteurs for their work."
"There is one part of the package with which I am not satisfied, however."
"Two sections have found their way into the Costa report on the liability of carriers of passengers that ensure that the same level of liability is imposed on carriers of passengers by inland waterway as is imposed on carriers of passengers on the high seas."
"This is wholly undesirable."
"Firstly, there is no need."
"There are hardly any known cases of accidents involving the transport of passengers by inland waterway."
"Besides, these two sections would sound the death knell for a large number of carriers of passengers by inland waterway, as they would be unable to afford the associated exorbitant insurance premiums, assuming anyone would insure them given a level of liability such as this."
"After all, we are talking about smaller undertakings that transport at the most tens of passengers and whose turnovers are not so huge."
"It strikes me as abundantly clear and logical that the same level of liability should not be imposed on such carriers as is imposed on large carriers of thousands of passengers by sea."
"We must not make ourselves a laughing stock by imposing a sky-high, extremely expensive level of liability on carriers of passengers by inland waterway."
"In addition, I am still extremely unhappy about how these sections have once more found their way into the text."
"The Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism should never have declared the amendments concerned admissible, as there was already agreement on this matter at first reading between the Council and Parliament."
"For these reasons, I have requested roll-call votes on sections 9 and 20."
"I hope and anticipate that many of my fellow Members will back me up in rejecting these sections."
"(EL) Madam President, let me mention the Sterckx report on vessel traffic monitoring and congratulate both Mr Sterckx himself and the Council Presidency on the good progress made in consultations."
"At this second reading, the most important point for me is the provision made for vessels in distress to be accepted at designated ports of refuge."
"Many accidents causing environmental disasters could have ended very differently had suitable refuge been offered at the right moment."
"In order to reach agreement with the Council, there was, on the one hand, a need for an independent committee to take decisions on places of refuge."
"On the other hand, it was necessary to agree on a satisfactory system of compensation for ports of refuge in the event of any consequences."
"A balanced agreement here is a self-evident requirement."
"There has also been a favourable development as regards the Automatic Identification System (AIS) within the scope of the SafeSeaNet."
"To conclude, let me repeat here that shipping in some Member States contributes substantially to GDP."
"As an industry it has a worldwide influence."
"For this reason, efforts by the EU to make the seas a safe environment for people and for the ecological system must apply to everyone, not just to EU vessels."
"There should be no unfair competition at the expense of European shipping."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the shadow rapporteur for the report by Mr Costa and as rapporteur for the 'flag State' report, I should like to comment on the civil liability of passenger carriers and on the package as a whole."
"As regards the Costa report, my focus has been on strengthening the rights of passengers in the event of accidents or incidents, on guaranteeing appropriate financial compensation and timely support to alleviate the consequences of incidents at sea or on inland waterways, where sea voyages often terminate, and also on enhancing the information provided to passengers."
"I therefore agreed on keeping these proposals at second reading."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the package is concerned, I would say that each of the reports stands on its own and each definitely brings added value."
"Yet I believe that the package as a whole, including the area for which I was rapporteur - on the obligations of flag States - brings extra added value for maritime safety, which leads me to ask the Council and the Commission, and everyone, for their commitment towards adopting the package."
"Furthermore, I really must extend my thanks to the French Presidency for their efforts, following on from the Slovenian Presidency, to move forward in this area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is only through an integrated package that we will promote maritime safety."
"In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the rapporteurs."
"Unless we look at the package as a whole, we shall leave here with a 'hobbled response', because the only way to stop another 'Erika' or 'Prestige' happening again in the near future is to take the package as a whole, and this is the only approach through which we can effectively ensure maritime safety."
"Madam President, I represent Scotland, a nation with a long maritime history and a nation with tremendous potential for its future."
"Scotland is geographically very well-placed to be developed as a maritime transport hub between Europe and the rest of the world and we have considerable scope to develop additional short sea routes, both for passengers and for freight."
"Improved safety is therefore of considerable importance to us, having had our own share of serious accidents involving shipping in Scottish waters."
"The carrying of hazardous materials must, of course, be transparently declared and properly controlled."
"Crews should have the right to be treated fairly with due consideration for their safety."
"We must learn from past failings and ensure that independent investigations are carried out when accidents do occur."
"The Scottish Government recently announced that a new operator is to resume a ferry service between Rosyth and Zeebrugge."
"I would hope that if we are to move traffic from roads to the sea that the European Union can assist more proactively in the development of such ferry routes."
"(EL) Madam President, the Erika III legislative package on maritime safety comes stiflingly combined with more general EU anti-popular policy, the enforcement of competitiveness and the increase in profits made by shipowners and by EU monopoly groups generally."
"The package fails to address the seriously aggravated problems of the safety of human life at sea and protection of the environment."
"The Council has refused to accept even the utterly inadequate proposals by the Commission and the European Parliament, which fall far short of real needs."
"Complying with the shipowners' orders and the demands of uncontrolled capitalist profiteering, the Council opposes even the most basic measures to protect the environment and human life at sea."
"The Council is trying to undermine every positive measure; it is systematically eliminating the measures proposed."
"It does not tolerate anything that could have the slightest impact on the profitability of companies or impose the slightest restriction on the unaccountability of shipowners."
"This is why it has rejected even the inadequate proposals that lay down the flag states' responsibilities and inspection obligations and the shipowners' civil liability and financial guarantees."
"A serious issue is the enactment of shipowners' civil liability to compensate the victims of maritime accidents, in accordance with the 2002 Protocol to the IMO Athens Convention, which the governments of the EU Member States refuse to ratify."
"Even today we have witnessed attempts to invalidate the relevant proposal by the rapporteur, Mr Costa, on the need to extend this liability for shipowners and outfitters to all categories of ships involved in domestic and international carriage by sea, and carriage by inland waterway."
"Madam President, what is this: a bridge over troubled waters?"
"For the UK it was peaceful waters until the CFP got to work and near destroyed our fishing industry."
"Now you want to ruin our maritime trade."
"Seemingly the Sterckx and Vlasto reports just aim to use the automatic identification system, with Galileo, to plot ship movements in EU waters."
"That is spying on the movement of every ship in UK waters, in our harbours, at anchor off our shores, no matter what nationality."
"The details will be connected to an EU data centre, which like any database is prone to security lapses."
"The IMO fears that data of shipping information with cargo details could, in the wrong hands, endanger ships trading with Europe."
"Collecting data leads to control systems and the vessels of our trading partners, especially of our Commonwealth, could be ordered away in an EU trade war."
"For a nation that relies upon maritime trade to feed itself, this really is the end of independence."
"The EU would decide whether Britain eats or starves."
"The UK has the greatest interest in these reports, because we trade around the world - we have been doing it for centuries - and every UK MEP represents a region - bar one - with a coastline."
"Meanwhile, as the EU erects its protective trade barriers, all its Member States, whether or not they have a coastline, get to have a vote."
"I will encourage my government to reject this rotten proposal, for British maritime trade and global maritime trade are under threat from bureaucrats you would not trust with a rowing boat."
"Worse, according to Vlasto, the EU will be able to refuse ships access to our waters."
"So the EU could decide if foreign warships are permitted to visit - those of our friends and allies perhaps?"
"A nuclear-powered ship might be rejected for political correctness, which could apply to the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines."
"Now, they helped to keep the Soviet Union at bay and guaranteed the freedom you now enjoy."
"Well, if the EU goes on meddling with powder kegs like Georgia or Ukraine, you might just need that sort of protection again."
"What price political correctness then?"
"(NL) Madam President, Mr Clark, you should really examine this proposal thoroughly and not just rabbit on about other matters, as what you are saying is all wrong."
"You have really failed to understand that this is about maritime safety."
"I shall not take up any more of my precious two minutes with this, but instead move on to the real contents of this package."
"The course of this maritime safety package has been turbulent."
"We, the European Parliament, are digging our heels in, as we want the whole package."
"Yet evidently the Council, too, is digging its heels in."
"I am shadow rapporteur for the report on the independent investigation of accidents, and the Council has proved rather less than accommodating up to now."
"If, however, both of us now show some flexibility and make some concessions, we should succeed in reaching an agreement by the end of this year."
"One of the key points with regard to the independent investigation of accidents as far as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is concerned is that this investigation must be truly independent."
"The Council's position on this point is currently unsatisfactory."
"There must also be one person bearing ultimate responsibility for an investigation - as citizens find it very unclear, and lacking in transparency, if three Member States each carry out their own investigation."
"One person bearing ultimate responsibility is needed, therefore."
"Thirdly, we must not only investigate rare accidents that receive extensive media coverage, but also, as the PPE-DE Group sees it, investigate other serious accidents meriting investigation according to the ground rules of this Directive."
"Finally, I concur with what Mr Blokland said about the proposal in the Costa report to include inland waterways in the liability regime."
"The PPE-DE Group opposed and continues to oppose this."
"I would ask the Council, therefore, to hold firm on this point, and I hope that no qualified majority is reached for Amendments 11 and 20 tomorrow."
"(PL) Madam President, we have been recalling examples of disasters - ones that are known throughout Europe."
"I am from Poland, a country that recently commemorated another anniversary of the deaths of dozens of people on board the ferry Jan Heweliusz."
"Safety is of crucial importance."
"It is good that we are looking at safety as part of a package."
"It is a good package, numerically good, with seven regulations."
"The safety of people, ships, waters and even the safety of economic trade should be, and is, reflected in this package."
"In this regard I consider Mr Sterckx's report, for which I had the honour of being the rapporteur's auxiliary, to be a particularly good one."
"Yes, monitoring of ships must be carried out."
"Mrs Wortmann-Kool is right to say that we need to investigate the causes of potential disasters and prevent disasters from happening."
"Moreover, I am of the view that for sailing we should refer to the situation in aviation, in other words investigate near collision situations, because we could gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and causes of the occurrence of hazards."
"I do not understand and am far from being able to agree with the position taken by Mr ZÄ«le, who spoke of special, or specific, treatment for small states."
"Surely the size of an EU Member State has little to do with the numbers of vessels flying its flag."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, be serious!"
"Despite a few positive measures, the majority of the reports being proposed to us will never have any more therapeutic value than a plaster on a wooden leg, as far as maritime safety is concerned."
"Parliament and the Commission pretend to get cross with the Council, but this play-acting is no more than another crude attempt to bury responsibilities and favour private interests to the detriment of the general interest."
"All this will do is give the European institutions even less legitimacy in the eyes of the people if there is another disaster, especially with the knowledge that the European Union is engaged in the WTO general trade agreement, known as GATS, whose Commission on Maritime Transport says that the current maritime transport environmental and safety regulations are excessive and should be relaxed."
"The inhabitants of the communities that were the victims of the Erika shipwreck and others will appreciate the EU's cynicism."
"Properly addressing the problems of maritime transport safety means grasping the evil by the root."
"We should be attacking the tax havens that allow maritime transport activities to be segmented into a jungle of shell corporations that offer the possibility of sidestepping the regulations."
"We need to bring an end to the practice of flags of convenience - including on EU territory - which reduce registration fees and cut crew costs by 60% on average."
"Above all, we need to give new rights to employees as regards safety."
"You will never do this, though, because it would mean attacking the very foundations of globalised capitalism."
"(DE) Madam President, some of you are probably wondering, rightly, what a Member from a landlocked European country such as Austria is doing in a debate on deep-sea shipping."
"There is no very simple answer to this question, but it can perhaps be stated in a few words why this subject is important to us as well."
"Firstly - and this really applies to all the Member States of the European Union, not just to us - the safety and optimum organisation of navigation on the high seas are an important concern for all those involved."
"Catastrophic events, and not just those associated with the flowery name Erika, have made this very clear to many of us."
"However - and now we come to a very particular point, to which some of my fellow Members have already alluded - the incorporation of inland waterway transport in the rules on liability is a European act of folly without parallel. We should reject it, regardless of whether we hail from seafaring nations or from landlocked countries."
"It would entail excessive costs and excessive bureaucracy, and therefore pose a problem overall, for inland waterway transport in Europe, and this is a problem we should not be exacerbating."
"Quite the opposite."
"We should be establishing rules on liability for inland waterway transport too in the form of a sound special regime, and not artificially subjecting it to the rules for deep-sea shipping."
"(ES) Ladies and gentlemen, with the adoption of this third maritime package we are giving a clear response to many of the demands made by European society after the Erika and Prestige disasters, five and seven years ago."
"These proposals, which strengthen each other, as many of my fellow members have said, will enable us to make a decisive move in favour of the quality of the European maritime sector, and also, ladies and gentlemen, its transparency."
"The proposal for a directive on technical investigations after accidents is the guarantee that we will never again see a spectacle of opaqueness like the one that surrounded the tragic Prestige accident."
"The text strengthens the independence of the organisations responsible for investigating maritime accidents and incidents, and the obligation to make the results known in order to improve procedures and exchange good practice."
"I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteurs, because their excellent work has meant that the firmness of our position as the European Parliament regarding these proposals has been made clear."
"They are proposals that have no other purpose than to make the European maritime space one of the safest in the world and to contribute to the reorganisation of the European fleets, as well as ensuring that operators take greater responsibility for damage caused to third parties and, in particular, national assets."
"(RO) The third maritime package is the consequence of the collisions involving the ""Erikaâ and the ""Prestigeâ, the December 2007 accidents in the Black Sea and the accident in Taragona harbour this month."
"These unfortunate events caused immense damage to coastal areas and to the marine environment in particular."
"The package deals with the monitoring of traffic at sea, investigations into accidents at sea, the liability of people carriers in case of accident at sea, port state control, common standards and regulations for the organisations involved in ship inspection and control."
"I would like to state that the new version of the Paris Memorandum entered into force on 17 September 2008."
"It is essential that all ships entering European harbours should comply with certain safety standards."
"Let me remind you that the black and grey lists published on 18 June 2008 on the Paris Memorandum website include one and six Member States respectively."
"Therefore, one quarter of the Member States must improve the safety of ships registered under their flags"
"Irrespective of its technical condition, a ship in danger must have access to a specially designated and equipped refuge area."
"European harbours should provide this facility, and harbour administrations should be able to recover the cost incurred with dry-docking and repairing the ship."
"I believe that the masters' liability in the case of passenger freight should apply to inland waterways as well."
"I would like to congratulate my colleagues who worked on and negotiated this maritime package."
"I believe it to be of essential importance to the economic future of the European Union."
"(ES) The truth is that I would like to congratulate us all on the adoption and presentation of this third package."
"I would first of all like to congratulate the Commission and its Commissioner, Mr Tajani, who very early on, as a Roman, showed that he was ready to be sensitive to all aspects related to the sea and its ports;"
"I would also like to congratulate all my fellow rapporteurs, because the truth is that it is such a complex and broad subject and at all times they have been able to maintain Parliament's positions, which defend better and greater safety for all citizens in such a complex, tempestuous environment as the sea."
"I also think that it is right that we are responding after the various accidents, and that European citizens should see that Parliament and the European institutions not only look after them when there has been a disaster, but that having learned these lessons, they are capable of moving forward and making progress on the legislative aspects."
"In this case, I think that they are the aspects relating to safety: specifically safety in terms of the environmental impact, which we could say started the whole movement, but also safety, at present, in relation to the responsibilities of the different actors involved, identifying and clarifying which they are and how we should act in response to them, establishing landmarks for the future fight against piracy, and, even more importantly, making progress with improving the working, social and professional conditions of those who work at sea."
"I think that it is precisely on those aspects that we still need to make progress, and we ask the Commission to continue considering them."
"All that remains for me to say is that, from our point of view, there are some reservations regarding the guarantees needed in order to ensure that ports of refuge are the ports that we all need."
"(EL) Madam President, the serious maritime accidents we have witnessed on European seas must certainly not be repeated."
"In my country, Greece, we had last year's shipwreck on Santorini, the causes of which have not yet been investigated."
"The loss of human life, the considerable damage done to tourism and the environmental time-bomb of the oil trapped in the tanks, are proof enough that we cannot afford to be careless."
"The issue of safety at sea is of vital importance."
"The Union must not only ensure the sustainability of European shipping, but constantly upgrade it so that it can compete internationally."
"Meanwhile, we should not neglect the need to protect natural resources."
"If we do not act immediately, we shall undoubtedly have lost valuable time in responding effectively to the consequences of maritime accidents."
"In the wake of a maritime accident, systematic technical research carried out on the basis of international rules is an effective way of gaining a better picture of the causes."
"The independence of investigating bodies is therefore of key importance and I regret that the Council fails to grasp this."
"Another important issue is that of cooperation between authorities, especially when an accident affects a number of Member States."
"The question of ports of refuge and of the vessel inspection system is crucial in maritime safety."
"It must be extended to ships in transit, which should provide guarantees that they are able to respond in the event of an accident or another such disaster."
"I would like to end by congratulating the rapporteurs on their strong position with regard to the Council, and I hope that after the vote the Council, understanding our position, will contribute positively towards completing the legislative procedure."
"(BG) Madam President, Commissioner, safety of the maritime transport sector is an important element of transport policy owing to the fact that a large part of the goods are carried by sea and by water."
"The increased insecurity, in terms of possible adverse natural phenomena, terrorist acts, deliberate incidents and accidents, increases dramatically the risks to which vessel traffic is exposed."
"The adoption of this Directive is an exceedingly important act for the entire European Union."
"The replacement of the code, which has been applied on a voluntary basis so far, by this directive enhances the commitments as well as the responsibilities through designation of competent bodies and specific procedures which Member States must prepare, lay down and implement."
"The need of Member States aligning their legislation to this Directive raises the requirement for full-scale co-operation in its implementation among states and shipowners, as well as for the achievement of strong control and co-ordination."
"I would note two things: the need of more in-depth coverage of interaction with third countries, and the formulation of a clear port policy, because our seas are open and this is very important."
"Investigating incidents and their causes and effects is obviously of substantial importance."
"This is related to clarifying a number of incidents and, above all, to taking preventive measures."
"Several incidents, with lives lost and damage to property and the environment, have occurred in my country in recent years."
"This is exceedingly important, and I congratulate the rapporteur on this subject."
"(LT) The safety of sea transport, prompt response to accidents and the efficiency of accident investigations are of vital importance to the countries of the Baltic Region."
"The Baltic Sea is secluded and shallow; its water changes only once every 30 years, which makes it very vulnerable."
"With the constant increase in sea transport in the Baltic Sea, thanks to Lithuania's experience we are aware of accidents at sea being followed by disagreements and mess, which reveals a real lack of relevant rules."
"I therefore commend the rapporteur on the very important work carried out."
"We should not agree with the Council's proposal that safety investigations be carried out only in the event of a major incident."
"It is not only major incidents that have a disastrous impact on countries' economies and environment as well as their welfare."
"The attempt to minimise the number of bureaucratic mechanisms should not hinder the quality of investigations."
"Moreover, it is very important that the same methods of investigating incidents are employed in all the Member States."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have drawn a great deal of encouragement from your speeches."
"As almost all of you have said, agreement should soon be reached on the first six texts."
"Of course, I am slightly disappointed that we have entered the conciliation procedure, but I am encouraged to continue our dialogue and to bring it to completion."
"I have taken your messages on board: you are keen on the liability of states, on the need to be able to conduct investigations in a large number of cases, on the ratification of the IMO conventions especially, and you have strongly reiterated that the package cannot be broken down or chopped up."
"I have heard this and I will pass it on to the Council at our meeting on 9 October."
"You know that the discussions will be complex, but you have also pointed out that it has taken too long to get where we are today."
"However, I can confirm that our determination is strong and it is intact."
"I hope that together we can establish a comprehensive, coherent system that ensures the responsibility of each actor within it."
"I think that is the price of maritime safety in Europe."
"It therefore requires progress on the last two proposals."
"As you know, we will be working on it right up to the last moment of our Presidency."
"In the words of a compatriot of the Commissioner, Mr Tajani, the chairman, Mr Costa, and Antonio Gramsci, in these discussions we are seeking to balance the pessimism of our intelligence with the optimism of our will."
"Whatever the case, I thank Parliament in advance for everything it can do to fuel this optimism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to Mr Bussereau for the commitment that he continues to show."
"I would like to go into the substance of the various reports and the various amendments that have been tabled."
"With regard to the first vote, Mr Sterckx's report on the monitoring of maritime traffic, I am very pleased with Parliament's broad support for the objectives set out in the Commission's proposal."
"The most important provisions in the proposal are those relating to places of refuge."
"I fully back Parliament's attempts to maintain the principle of independence in the decision-making process for accommodating a vessel in distress in a place of refuge."
"The amendments, however, that take over the substance of the proposal for a directive relating to Mr KohlÃ­Äek's report, civil liability and the financial guarantees of shipowners, can be endorsed without reservation, except for the two that refer to the establishment of a Community Office for the management of financial-guarantee certificates."
"My staff have doubts about the effects of this proposal on the administrative and financial levels, and we will have to examine it more thoroughly."
"On the other hand, having read the report by Mr KohlÃ­Äek, I am satisfied that Parliament's support for the proposal on investigations following accidents is not failing."
"At times, however, the best is the enemy of the good, and the Commission has shown itself sensitive to the argument that emerged during debate in the Council, namely that in order to guarantee the quality of investigations it is better not to unnecessarily multiply them: what matters is that in addition to cases of very serious accidents, an investigation is carried out in order to draw out useful lessons for the future through an understanding of the accident's causes."
"This aim, which in any case corresponds to the approach adopted by the IMO, is met by the common position, and I am therefore not able to back amendments such as Amendments 7, 13 or 14."
"Finally, three amendments - 18, 19 and 20 - are designed to add to the directive a mechanism to resolve any disagreement between Member States regarding a single investigation."
"While it is true that the Commission's proposal, and the common position, in fact, require the Member States to avoid conducting parallel investigations, it is also true that they do not deny the Member States involved the right to carry out their own investigations."
"In any event, it cannot be the Commission's task to act as a mediator between Member States, which are each convinced that they have a vital interest in carrying out an investigation."
"What matters, in this case, is to ensure that the investigating bodies are independent."
"With regard to the compensation of passengers in the event of accidents in the report by Mr Costa, you know that the Commission is determined to see the rights of travellers strengthened in all transport sectors, throughout Europe."
"When presenting this proposal three months ago, the Commission started with an observation: if an accident takes place in Europe on board a vessel on the sea or on a river, the victims will not be properly compensated in so far as the applicable rules differ too much from one Member State to another and in fact also appear to be in the main out of date."
"In fact, they make no provision for compulsory insurance, the compensation ceilings are inadequate and the liability systems stipulate that it is the victim who must provide proof that the carrier is at fault and, moreover, this is difficult to prove in the case of the shipwreck of a vessel."
"In the face of this observation, the Commission saw just one solution: to seek harmonisation."
"This means implementing the Athens Convention; the negotiations are under the aegis of the IMO, and it means applying it in full to guarantee that all victims receive compensation under the terms set out in the Convention and on the basis of the maximum amounts fixed in it."
"The Council has shown that it takes the same view."
"All the amendments tabled by the European Parliament aim to improve the future regulation; we therefore endorse them without any reservation."
"With regard to the scope, which ought to be as wide as possible, the difficulties of certain operators of national or river transport cannot, however, be denied."
"It would therefore be legitimate to stagger over time the implementation of the regulation in order to allow the necessary adjustments."
"I therefore support the relevant amendments."
"As things stand currently, the maximum compensation amounts depend on the size of the vessel and the number of victims, and this is unacceptable."
"We need to put this right, and one way of doing this is by helping the insurance sector by setting a single maximum compensation amount that will apply Europe-wide."
"This is the aim of Amendments 12, 13 and 14, (first part), which the Commission endorses."
"I am taking a long time, Mr President, because I believe that it is right to give an opinion on the various amendments tabled, and so, if you will permit me, I will take another two minutes."
"With regard to the Vlasto report, on port State control, I would like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for their support for this proposal, which will lead to the implementation of an ambitious new inspection system for Europe."
"I would like to make two points on two vital aspects: the first relates to the mechanisms through which to establish in which conditions ship inspections cannot be carried out."
"On the one hand, there is the issue of flexibility, which has correctly been said to be justified for operational reasons and already provided for in the directive in force, and therefore in our view this ought to be maintained."
"For this reason, I cannot accept Amendments 19 or 23."
"The most important aspect in political terms is that of banning, dealt with in Amendments 31 and 32."
"While the Commission can accept the point of view of the Council, which introduces a less strict system for ships on the grey list, I am nonetheless pleased that Parliament supports the Commission on the issue of a permanent ban."
"On the report by Mr de Grandes Pascual on classification societies, I am happy that Parliament accepts the division of the act into a directive and a regulation, as the Council wished."
"This approach seems to me to be both fair and rigorous in legal terms."
"With regard to the amendments, I would say that Amendments 27 and 28 make changes to the civil liability regime of the recognised bodies, and these seem to us to be inconsistent in practice."
"In any event, under the directive, death caused by a negligent act should continue, to be covered by a minimum liability."
"With regard to Amendment 1, which seeks to delete recital 3 added by the Council to the draft regulation, we can accept this."
"This recital seems to us superfluous and dangerous; I would not want our inspectors to encounter difficulties in carrying out their work on its account."
"Finally, as I have already said, I can accept the amendments that seek to incorporate into the draft directive some elements from the 'flag State' proposal."
"I apologise for having spoken at length, Mr President, but there were a large number of amendments and I believed it was right to make the Commission's view known to Parliament."
"Madam President, allow me to begin by saying a few words to my Spanish fellow Members about their reservations concerning ports of refuge."
"If a competent authority in a Member State takes a decision, there can indeed be a problem with the compensation of ports of refuge to which ships may possibly be taken."
"Indeed, this is discussed in my report and, incidentally, is a problem that the Council and Parliament have thus far been unable to resolve between them: one of the difficult problems."
"How can it be solved?"
"I had a relatively simple solution to this, namely placing financial responsibility on the Member State in that case."
"The Council is not in agreement, and we shall have to come up with something."
"It is not that we have failed to consider this problem or take account of it, therefore - I just wanted to say that to avoid any misunderstanding."
"We are now going to conciliation and, President-in-Office, both the Council and Parliament have the task of ensuring that this conciliation is successful."
"We cannot afford to fail."
"I must thank you once again - you and your colleagues - for the fact that 90% of the work is already behind us, particularly on my report."
"The vote tomorrow will not reflect this, but, as far as I am concerned, you can rest assured that, for my part, what we have agreed will remain on paper, and that we shall deal with the outstanding points and achieve a result very quickly."
"The problem during conciliation will lie with the two missing reports, the two missing texts, and I should like to emphasise once more that 'nous sommes avec vous, nous devons travailler ensemble, le Parlement est avec le Conseil et Ã§a ne se passe pas tous les jours!'"
"rapporteur. - (CS) Let me please try to summarise why the maritime package should be discussed as a single entity and not as a set of reports from which the Council and the Commission can pick and choose, push some forward, set some aside and wait for the next presidency or the one after that."
"First of all, it is essential to establish in the same way, in all cases, in all these reports, to which ships all the proposals apply."
"There were differences in the initial reports."
"I should like to draw your attention to this once more."
"Secondly, safety is indivisible and therefore it is vital to strengthen the responsibility of the flag state."
"This responsibility must be clearly defined because, without responsibility on the part of the flag state, it will be impossible to take this package forward."
"Thirdly, the fair treatment of seafarers on ships running into difficulties must be generally accepted."
"Whether someone has adopted the IMO guidelines or not is immaterial."
"Fourthly, the environment is so important that discussion as to who is responsible for maritime transport in the event of problems with one ship or another must cease, and buck-passing must be sidelined."
"There will be just one person in each state who decides where a ship in difficulties can go."
"Fifthly, if there is an accident, it must be made clear within the timeframe laid down who is going to conduct the technical investigation, which state is responsible, where the final report is to be sent and what the structure of the report is to be, otherwise we are simply playing games."
"The independence of the investigative body is an obvious requirement."
"Sixthly, if I could ask you, Commissioner and Mr Bussereau, to listen to the wishes not only of the European Parliament, but also of the citizens of the Union and look at the maritime package as a single entity."
"Madam President, Mr Bussereau, ladies and gentlemen, please accept a small suggestion drawn from the experience that I have accumulated over this period, although it has not been very long."
"I assure you that you need have no fear of conciliation: conciliation is a creative stage that makes it possible to overcome even problems that seem insoluble."
"I guarantee you that we will come to agreement even on the limited overall liability that all shipowners would like to have, faced with the need for each passenger to be treated in the same way."
"Today it seems impossible, but some effort of imagination that all of us together make will definitely be able to make things work."
"In brief, apart from the optimism of will that I shall certainly, with Gramscian memory, instil, I also ask you to adopt the suggestion of the anonymous Frenchman of 1968 - with a little power to the imagination, we will reach some sort of definitive solution."
"I must say I am less happy about certain remarks by some of my fellow Members regarding their resistance, which seems to me incomprehensible, to extending the protection of passengers to internal waters too."
"I must say, it upsets me to have to openly state the fact - the fact that a child and his father who died on the Seine should receive different protection from what would apply if they had died on the open seas."
"This seems to me truly unacceptable, and I cannot believe that Mr Rack, Mrs Wortmann-Kool and Mr Blokland truly meant to make out that the protection of small interests - because what is involved is very small insurance costs for events that, because they are highly improbable, have very low insurance costs - that the small interests of some small operator can undermine a position which I am happy to have heard confirmed by the Commission too, and which it would also do Parliament credit to espouse."
"(NL) Madam President, I should like to voice my strong objection to Mr Costa's suggestion of a link between people who have died on the Seine and the fact that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is refusing to support his proposals."
"This is a link that Mr Costa should not be making, and so I wish to register a strong protest."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, in closing, I can say I have found that this debate today has revealed a common desire to achieve a result."
"I think this is very important."
"A lot of work has been done, particularly under the French Presidency, and we can be pleased with this. I hope that after the Transport Council meeting on 9 October, President-in-Office, we will find a solution that everyone supports, without letting anything fall by the wayside."
"Parliament is united in support of the package, and I hope we will be successful in ensuring that the package is adopted in plenary."
"I would like once again to thank the French Presidency, which has not only showed will, but has also proven its intelligence."
"Let us hope that, through its firmness, which has also been set in motion, some governments will not be deaf but will listen to this intelligence, French intelligence, and will cooperate in a measured way in order to achieve the objectives that they and we are committed to achieving."
"With regard to the Commission, the Vice-President is aware that we have held some informal trialogues, but that, undoubtedly, what he called incoherence is natural, due to the timing and parliamentary formulas, but it is perfectly rectifiable."
"From these trialogues we have reached the goal, in terms of the reports for which I am responsible, of recognised organisations, and there is no doubt that we can reach a consensus on solutions."
"Finally, Mr Sterckx made a recommendation to us as Spanish people: for us to have the sensitivity to take on board his proposals."
"I ask you to accept that there are deep-seated reasons for our differing positions, but also that this position is not irredeemable and that in conciliation, there will undoubtedly be formulas that we agree on, and that we will be able to accept a formula that everyone can understand that provides a solution not only for the countries that have vessels, but also those of us who suffer because we have coastlines."
"(EL) The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - It is important to have common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for relevant activities of maritime administration."
"On the other hand, it is important for the European Union to increase the number of ships registered with its Member States."
"The ship registers of Malta, Cyprus and Greece have enabled the European Union to remain one of the major global players as far as ship registration is concerned."
"Through this the European Union is able to raise standards and maintain a certain scrutiny of their vessels."
"Without compromising on safety the European Union has to make sure that the vessels on its members' books do not migrate to other states, especially those known states which enable ships to fly 'flags of convenience'."
"It must be appreciated that shipping is one of the cleanest ways of transportation."
"It is also one of the cheapest."
"We must be careful not to overburden this important industry."
"All measures taken have to bear this in mind."
"Transportation by shipping has to be encouraged and this has to be taken into consideration when regulating on the industry without making any compromises on security, health and safety."
"Sea piracy (debate)"
"(EL) The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on sea piracy."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday 14 September - so just a few days ago - a French tuna fishing boat was chased by pirates 420 miles from the coast of Somalia."
"This was not an isolated incident."
"Since the beginning of July 10 vessels have been captured and 250 seamen have been taken hostage."
"Consequently, fishing vessels - and you can understand their reasons - are reluctant to operate, and the 50 or so French and Spanish tuna vessels that used to fish off the Seychelles and Somalia have decided to go back to the Seychelles archipelago."
"Apart from the fact that these acts of piracy are on the increase, it seems clear that they are no longer happening just along the coast but are tending to extend further out, to international waters, disrupting not only the activities of fishing and cargo vessels in transit, but also - and this is very serious - of vessels operating within the framework of humanitarian programmes, particularly the World Food Programme, which supplies essential aid to the very many displaced populations in Somalia."
"This phenomenon has become a cause for concern at global level."
"The French President, Mr Sarkozy, recently said that these were no longer isolated cases but a criminal industry challenging one of the fundamental freedoms, the freedom to circulate, as well as the freedom to conduct international trade."
"The French President finished by saying: 'the world cannot accept this!'"
"Against this background, in May and June the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolutions 1814 and 1816."
"In response to the worsening of this issue, it is currently working on a new resolution aimed at mobilising the international community to apply existing instruments of repression and prevention more effectively within the framework of the Law of the Sea and Security Council resolutions."
"For their part, the EU Member States have already set out to do this and on 26 May expressed their determination to work together to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia."
"A crisis management concept was approved by the Council on 5 August."
"More recently, at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 15 September, the Council adopted a strategic military option with a view to a possible naval operation under the European Security and Defence Policy."
"I would like to remind you formally that the launch of a naval operation is clearly envisaged, as the French Presidency said last Tuesday to Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, at the end of the aforementioned Council meeting."
"Until an operation takes place, because of the urgency of action, a first step was taken by the Council with the formation of a naval coordination cell."
"It is directed by a Spanish senior officer and consists of four maritime experts whose role is to facilitate the exchange of information between merchant navies and any naval vessels in the area, on a regular or occasional basis."
"The Cell, located in Brussels, will be responsible for supporting surveillance and protection actions conducted by the Member States off the coast of Somalia."
"This initiative should be in three sections: the accompanying of certain vulnerable vessels in transit through the Gulf of Aden, the protection of World Food Programme humanitarian convoys destined for Somalia, and the surveillance of fishing areas off the southern coast of Somalia."
"Member States with naval units operating off the Somali coast are invited to inform the Cell of this, in particular to improve the chances of protecting the most vulnerable merchant vessels."
"In parallel, Madam President, the European Union will continue preparations for a possible naval operation under the European Security and Defence Policy."
"An information-gathering mission, consisting of European experts from the Military Staff of the European Union and the Secretariat-General of the Council, is currently in the region, refining a strategic plan."
"It is due to deliver its conclusions on 29 September."
"You will see, ladies and gentlemen, that the European Union is not only showing its determination to act, but is also affirming its position as a prime mover on the international scene in the fight against piracy."
"We must give ourselves the resources to act quickly and in a coordinated manner, for the benefit, of course, of commercial interests, but also in the interest of freedom of circulation, which is a global principle, and finally for the benefit of our humanitarian objectives."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission firmly condemns the criminal acts regularly committed in some regions of the world against the interests of the EU Member States, both sea piracy and armed robbery against ships in waters subject to the jurisdiction of a state."
"Acts of this kind affect not only maritime transport, but also fishing on the high seas and maritime tourism."
"Besides, these acts make living conditions yet more dangerous for sailors who already have to do their work under difficult conditions."
"Therefore, because we must not only condemn such acts, but must also take action, we must realise that there is a risk of regressing by hundreds of years to a situation of an organised presence of criminal networks and pirates operating in four main areas: the South China Sea, the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, the Gulf of Guinea and the Horn of Africa."
"The majority of crimes are committed in these areas, and the intensity and seriousness of the offences are constantly changing."
"Furthermore, there is still a concern about developments and even about the expansion of piracy to other areas of the world, demonstrating, in fact, that these are not merely occasional incidents, but we are convinced that there is an organised network of criminals who wish to carry out scientific attacks on cargo ships, tourist vessels and passenger vessels."
"Given that the European Community is a member of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, the European Commission has always undertaken to promote freedom of navigation in all its aspects and the development of appropriate instruments to prevent illegal acts against ships."
"In this context, the Commission has systematically backed the attempts by the Member States and the international community as a whole to draw up legislative instruments of high quality within the framework of the United Nations and its specialised body in the sector of maritime transport, which is the International Maritime Organization."
"After the work last June in the UN Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, which dealt in particular with the issue of the legal treatment of pirates when caught, efforts still continue with the current review of the IMO's three legal instruments on the prevention of piracy and armed robbery against ships."
"The review is expected to be completed in December 2008."
"Availing itself of its legislation on the safety of ships and port facilities, which incorporated into Community law the ISPS code, which is an IMO instrument, the European Community favours the promotion of these maritime safety standards by its international partners, and in particular by the Euro-Mediterranean partners through the Safemed II programme."
"In the same way, a high-level seminar on the issue is being prepared as part of the ASEAN Regional Forum under the co-presidency of the European Union and Indonesia."
"Cooperation with countries outside Europe is thus becoming particularly important."
"In a similar conceptual sphere, the Commission is studying the possibility of using the stability instrument to support existing regional initiatives or ones that are being drawn up, backed by the International Maritime Organization, both in the area of the Straits of Malacca and in the Horn of Africa area, to promote the safety of maritime navigation in those areas that are of strategic significance for European interests and supplies."
"I should also emphasise the continuing support for development granted by the European Community to countries neighbouring these at-risk areas, to improve their standard of living, which is an essential precondition for compliance with the rules of law."
"It is thus also vital in seeking to remove the workforce from criminal organisations, which can focus on the conditions of extreme poverty experienced by certain groups of people."
"With regard to the repression of acts of piracy on the seas and of armed robbery against ships, the Commission is delighted at the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1816 on the repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, as well, of course, at the important step taken by the European Council, which adopted a detailed action plan at its meeting of 15 September 2008."
"Mr Bussereau has stressed what these initiatives are, and what commitments are being made by the European Union and the Member States, and we share and endorse these commitments."
"There is another question that is raised regarding this constant growth in piracy: do acts of piracy serve to fund international terrorism?"
"This is a question that we must ask ourselves, and that we must seek to answer, even if today there is no proof that terrorism is funded through the payment of ransoms; there is nothing that would allow us to establish a priori that this is not a possibility."
"Thus, we are doubtful about rejecting the hypothesis, particularly in the light of the obvious links that exist between certain countries that provide refuge for pirates and the existence of concealed bases for terrorist groups."
"The Commission will, however, launch an investigation into this subject, in order to improve its understanding of the financial flows linked to the phenomenon of piracy on the seas."
"We must never lower our guard in the fight against terrorism and therefore every suspicion, even if we cannot make a priori judgments, must be carefully assessed and we must take all appropriate steps to prevent terrorism from benefiting from the assistance and organisational and economic support of criminal organisations."
"This is why we will continue to work in harmony with all the Member States, with the Council and also with countries outside Europe that are particularly involved in combating piracy."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission Vice-President, I completely agree with the Vice-President's statements."
"We have to differentiate between the straits where there are responsible countries with whom we can cooperate on cracking down on piracy, and the maritime operations where there is no responsible country, for example in Somalia, where we have to do something ourselves."
"President-in-Office, I thought what you said was, in all honesty, rather too little."
"Setting up and deploying a crisis unit is always a good thing to do, but it does nothing to help."
"The crisis unit is here in Brussels or somewhere else."
"What we need is a concerted maritime operation locally, with the ships from the EU Member States that are already there."
"We have to appeal to the Member States who do not yet have any ships there to take part in a joint marine operation."
"We cannot allow a situation where two pirate mother ships sail happily along on these waters attacking our fishing and merchant vessels and we are for ever having to run round after them and watch to see how we can bring this under control."
"I am waiting to hear what my general has to say, who will be here in a short while, but we need a clear strategic and tactical assessment of the situation here, and we need enough manpower capable of controlling piracy, as appeals simply do nothing to help."
"We have to hunt down the pirates, we have to catch them, otherwise it will not work."
"Ninety per cent of Europe's imports, on which we depend, arrive via maritime routes."
"We have a high level of responsibility for seafarers, for fishermen fishing off foreign coasts, in accordance with jointly agreed treaties, and we have to protect these fishermen and seafarers, and also tourists."
"Unfortunately, in areas where there is no governmental authority, this only works if we develop our own European activities on the basis of UN resolutions."
"In this respect, President-in-Office, it is good to set up a crisis unit, but we are expecting to see a well-defined operations base and well-defined operations during the next stage."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we urgently need to tackle this problem."
"My figures, which I do have, are even worse than those that Mr Bussereau has just given us: there are reportedly currently 13 vessels and 300 sailors under the power of pirates."
"And what is clear is that, if this phenomenon is not stopped, it will continue in crescendo as it has done so far, and of course it is not going to stop or improve."
"The tenacity of the French and Spanish Governments, among others, and also the tenacity of this Parliament have borne fruit."
"In a short time we have secured a UN resolution on this phenomenon, which extends the right to prosecution, and also a cell has been created to coordinate operations at European level."
"However, you should be aware that it is essential that first of all we work to achieve an extension of the UN mandate, because it is only valid for three months and, if it is not extended, our brand-new coordination cell will have to close in early December."
"With regard to the second part of the Ministers' decision, the strategic military option, we need this operation to come to fruition and a large number of Member States to show as soon as possible that they are prepared to participate in it, and I support what Mr Jarzembowski said."
"It would be the first European military naval operation of the European security and defence policy, ladies and gentlemen, and an important sign of visibility for Europe."
"The circumstances demand it."
"Piracy in the Indian Ocean is currently an extremely profitable business, which is growing day by day."
"Someone said to me today that the profession of pirate was, however incredible it might seem, growing in status in some of the countries bordering the Indian Ocean."
"We need to stop this spiral, we need to protect vulnerable vessels, whether they are merchant or pleasure vessels, and the numerous fishing boats that fish in the area."
"We also need to provide protection and escorts for the World Food Programme vessels, because on 27 September Canada will be finishing its mandate and we still do not have a country to take over."
"Madam President, would the increase in acts of sea piracy not be a chance for the European Union to use the means to defend its values and interests, if necessary and wherever necessary?"
"In any case, do not tell our fisherman, who had to take refuge in the port of MahÃ© in the Seychelles last week, or the crews of our merchant and cruise ships who are being threatened further and further by Somalia's territorial waters, that it is none of Europe's business!"
"That would be to forget what European citizens expect of Europe: primarily safety, and particularly safety at sea."
"That is why, Commissioner, the Commission's initiatives to implement a European policy of the sea and oceans were so widely welcomed."
"That is why I suspect, President-in-Office, that there is a large majority in this Parliament that will approve the measures you propose at the end of the consultation, which I understand is still going on."
"Today, people are saying it is not that easy, that it might be better to consult our allies throughout the world first and to think about legality as regards international law."
"What was done for the recent release of the hostages on the Ponant and the CarrÃ© d'as shows that we have the means for effective action, provided that the will is there."
"If only this will, President-in-Office, could be the subject of a broad consensus in the Council!"
"(ES) The coast of Somalia is obviously one of the most dangerous coastlines in the world, as the figures show, in particular the fact that, last year alone, at least 25 vessels were victims of all sorts of acts of piracy."
"The case of the Playa de Bakio is perhaps one of the best known, at least in Spain, but it is obviously not the only one."
"Today it is also obvious that the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia does not have the resources or the means to establish peace and security in the country and therefore is much less capable of guaranteeing safety in its waters or in areas close to them, therefore international support is needed to do this, in line with what was laid down by the United Nations in June, as the previous speakers said."
"Personally I am also concerned by something else, which I would like to mention: the reports that we sometimes receive of foreign boats, some of which are perhaps European, that are taking advantage of this situation of lack of control in order to fish unlawfully in one of the richest fishing grounds in the area, or even to use it as a dumping ground for hazardous substances, which the Federal Government is also not in a position to control."
"Therefore I think that it is a priority - and I stress this - to guarantee the safety of the vessels that are legitimately operating in the area in line with international legislation, but it is also a priority, or even more so, that we commit ourselves to resolving the conflict that is devastating that country, so that ultimately responsibility for safeguarding the security of the area can be taken over by independent, legitimate, recognised Somali institutions."
"(ES) I am not going to repeat the facts that have been set out here."
"I want to describe them: they are scandalous, they cause social alarm among our citizens, who are undoubtedly perceiving a degree of defencelessness."
"Not to mention the feelings of our fishermen, who are experiencing an understandable fear about their jobs and even their physical safety, given that the pirates are not making empty threats, and workers are not required to risk their lives for their jobs."
"In addition, shipowners suffer serious economic damage that their insurance does not always cover, because the circumstances are extraordinary and tend not to be covered by insurance policies."
"What can we do about the pirates?"
"Of course, anything apart from the amateur spirit that prevailed in the Council of Foreign Ministers on 15 September."
"Against piracy we need conclusive action on two levels: in the area of diplomacy, supporting African countries, which suffer from the presence of genuine mafias on their territory, who use extortion and kidnapping in order to blackmail fishermen and merchants from one part of the world; in the area of legitimate use of force, using it as a dissuasive tool, which is perhaps the only language that pirates understand."
"Having said this, where should we act and at what level?"
"At national, European or international level?"
"I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we need to act initially at national level, as France has done in an exemplary manner, with the protection of international law and in an effective way, which was exemplary."
"I regret that the Spanish/French proposals were not adopted by the Council, as what was ultimately agreed was insufficient."
"I think that we need to give a vote of confidence to the French Presidency so that it proposes European action that is capable of defending our interests, and I hope that, when the time comes, the offer that NATO is making of global and international coverage can operate in this context."
"However, let us act as we always do, let us move forward, let us take decisions and then wait for others to help us."
"Let us not continue to be defenceless, with citizens feeling that we are not capable of defending ourselves."
"(FR) Madam President, I would first like to thank the Council and the Commission for agreeing to Parliament's request for a debate on this issue: a very topical issue that is of concern to us."
"We have talked about it in particular in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where we were visited by Mr De Rossa, who gave us an idea of the extent of the problem."
"I would like to say that we should congratulate ourselves on the rapidity of the reaction by the Member States concerned - I am talking about France and Spain - and on what has already been done in the UN and the Council."
"I think that is quite a quick response."
"I think we need to avoid several things."
"Firstly, demands by civil vessels for weapons."
"I can see this happening and I think we need to watch out because we know this would only make the situation more dangerous."
"Secondly, we need to make sure we do not neglect the situation and let it drift into terrorism."
"I mean that we should prevent political groups from getting involved because it would then assume completely different proportions."
"Thirdly, we need to avoid a situation where Member States are acting separately."
"In this regard, I was just thinking about the Stability Pact."
"Obviously we demand that certain Member States do not have a deficit, but these are the same Member States who are always asked to provide protection because they have the means to do so."
"I therefore believe we need to show a bit more solidarity there at EU level, and that those who do not have the means to be protected are protected by those who have the military means."
"In this case, let us draw any conclusions we might like to draw at any level."
"I would also like to say that, although it is a matter of great urgency that we provide a deterrent, through the measures taken by the French Government, for example, and on the Ponant and the CarrÃ© d'as, we know very well that crime is part of human nature but its legitimacy feeds on people's despair."
"It is therefore very important to take diplomatic action towards these countries and find ways of helping them from the point of view of both security and development."
"Then they will not have to endlessly look on with an empty stomach as plates of plenty go by."
"(ES) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, European citizens cannot understand why, in the age of technology, telecommunications, satellites, etc., we are experiencing incidents of piracy that appear to be transporting us back four or five centuries in our history."
"I cannot accept what others have been saying in terms of being satisfied with the response."
"For several years I have been saying here in the European Parliament that the situation in the Indian Ocean, the situation off the coast of Somalia for European fishermen and for vessels that operate and work there is unsustainable, and there has not been a great deal of response."
"I do indeed welcome the fact that finally the Council has taken a first step, which I think is an insufficient one, by creating this cell in Brussels that is going to be responsible for accompanying fishermen, protecting humanitarian aid, which is so necessary in Somalia, and also securing agreements on fishing grounds."
"I think that with what has been created and agreed so far, it is not going to be possible to achieve all of these ambitious objectives."
"The sea is very big, as is the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and we need the contribution and cooperation of all European countries, because the question is not whether the fishermen or vessels are French, Basque, Spanish, or Dutch; the question is that they are European and that we all need to contribute to this together."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the protection of seafarers is a heartfelt concern for all of us, but I am nevertheless taking the liberty of asking how we can best guarantee this."
"I take issue expressly with the commendation of the French Presidency, as politically and technically it has bungled the job, from start to finish."
"I should like to explain why."
"We have been conducting this debate as part of the Green Paper on maritime policy."
"We have pointed out that piracy is a problem and that we need a long-term strategy to be able to combat this phenomenon."
"I am also taking the liberty of pointing out that the phenomenon has existed since the sixth century B.C. Then Mr Sarkozy comes along, knocks it all on the head and talks about naval deployments."
"German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung is already having the guns polished on his naval ships, and there is an ESDP mission that has not even been discussed in the relevant committees yet - the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence - but only in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"What kind of game is this?"
"It is not the business at all!"
"I have the impression that we are trying to react in an ad hoc frantic manner in order to legitimise something that will have very, very long-term international ramifications."
"If we deploy naval forces to protect seafarers, we have to talk about the consequences."
"What do we want?"
"Gunboat policy?"
"Do we want a shot across the bows?"
"Do we want to sink ships?"
"If this is indeed connected with international terrorism, where is the long-term strategy there?"
"I say this only as a warning."
"We shall be analysing this keenly, and in the second week in October we shall hopefully reach a rather more businesslike conclusion more helpful to people in the region."
"(ES) I have just attended a meeting of the Long Distance Fleet Regional Advisory Council, and I could see the enormous concern for the fate of 51 vessels and around 1 500 crew of the Community tuna fleet that fishes in the Indian Ocean."
"For years the fleet has been reporting incidents of piracy in the area adjoining Somalia, but not even the capture of the Spanish tuna boat Playa de Bakio in April caused some governments to react in time, including my own, unfortunately, until, in recent days, the fleet had to withdraw to the port of Victoria, and from that point, the measures taken have been highly inadequate."
"We need to understand that fishermen live in an especially dangerous situation as, while all the vessels passing through the area are cause for concern, the merchant vessels tend to have established routes, which provides greater opportunity to monitor them as they pass through."
"Those 51 fishing boats, however, are scattered, following the migrations of tuna, over an area of more than 3 200 square miles, which is five days' sailing, and they are therefore much more vulnerable, so a naval operation is essential and urgent."
"In addition to what has been said about the Strait of Malacca, in addition to Somalia, we are now receiving reports from the fishing fleet about piracy in the Mozambique Channel and in areas of India and the Caribbean."
"We cannot, therefore, remain inactive, and we need to react, in addition to the reactions that may come from our governments and the Council."
"All the Community institutions are involved in creating a coordinated strategy to combat international piracy."
"I have therefore proposed to my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, an amendment to the budget in order to allocate one million euros to studying a viability plan for implementing this strategy, and I ask Parliament to give it the green light, so that all Community citizens, wherever they are, receive the message that the European Union is supporting them and, above all, protecting them."
"(FR) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months we have seen an increase in acts of piracy, particularly off the coast of Somalia."
"These attacks use much more sophisticated means and are therefore a reflection of a powerful mafia."
"I share the concern of all my fellow Members for European fishermen, who are extremely vulnerable."
"However, the European Union has established the means to respond to these attacks."
"The meeting of European Foreign Affairs Ministers on 15 September produced results that I felt were quite significant."
"On the one hand, the 27 Member States approved the creation of a Coordination Cell and on the other, the ministers adopted a strategic military option, opening the way for a possible EU naval operation."
"The use of private protection agencies has sometimes been mentioned."
"This does not seem like the right solution to me."
"The only long-term solution, as Mr Savary said, is both diplomatic and political."
"Piracy prospers thanks to the weakness of governments."
"It is by helping the countries concerned to stop the illegal activities, by helping them to achieve political stability and escape from poverty, that we will end this scourge."
"That is how the Malacca Strait got rid of pirates a few years ago."
"Obviously the European Union cannot act alone, as Mr Sarkozy said."
"The international community must be mobilised, otherwise it will be impossible to guarantee the protection of shipping, particularly because sea piracy is rife not only off the coast of Somalia."
"The European Union has taken the initiative of a concerted response."
"It is now up to the entire international community to assume its share of the responsibility."
"(ES) President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that we are having this debate."
"Since 2005 Parliament has been warning both the Commission and the Council of the dangers involved in navigating the waters around Somalia, even the international waters."
"Following various hijackings of boats and armed robberies, the European Union has just created a 'coordination cell'."
"It is very welcome; at least it is finally being recognised that there is a problem."
"However, I fear that even with this cell, the problem will continue to exist."
"Until we have real cooperation and a genuine Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Member Sates whose interests are affected will continue to be forced to protect themselves and defend their legitimate national interests."
"France has clearly understood this, and I congratulate it on its decisiveness, courage and efficiency."
"Spain has also reacted by planning to send a reconnaissance plane, in other words, an unarmed plane to dissuade armed pirates."
"It is a shame that this plane will not be enough to adequately defend and protect our fishermen if there is an armed boarding of our fleet."
"We need to ask for and secure more cooperation between the Member States that are affected, we need to take advantage of the French Presidency of the Council and allocate more resources so that legal fishing in international waters is not, as it is there, a high risk activity, due to acts of piracy that are inconceivable in international society in the 21st century."
"Mr President, I address my remarks particularly to the presidency of the Council."
"I am all in favour of robust international action to deal with piracy on the high seas."
"I congratulate the French Government on the action by French commandos earlier this month."
"You may recall that in the days when Britain truly had an ethical foreign policy the Royal Navy swept the oceans clear of pirates."
"It blew them out of the water and we got rid of the slave trade as well."
"Now we seem helpless."
"Our navies have been run down and we are frightened to act lest we fall foul of some aspect of human rights legislation, or become embroiled in lengthy judicial procedures."
"The EU response is to try and invent another military operation by setting up a committee, a so-called EU coordination cell, which says it will coordinate military operations in the seas off the Horn of Africa."
"But, there is already a military operation in those waters."
"It is Combined Task Force 150, involving the US Fifth Fleet and warships from other NATO navies, led by a Dane at the moment."
"I have a question to the Council presidency."
"Why is the EU getting involved?"
"This is a job for NATO and, more to the point, what are European allies in NATO going to do to ensure that more warships are provided for this task?"
"They have rules of engagement that make them effective, and there is international law in place at UN level to deal with captured pirates without inflicting them on our own countries."
"(DE) Mr President, we have here the Commissioner for Transport and the French President-in-Office of the Council with responsibility for transport."
"Yet we are talking here about very tangible military deployment."
"Information was given very late to the relevant committee, the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, even though press reports on this EU mission to combat piracy have been in circulation since back in August."
"This is unacceptable."
"We need to have basic information in good time and then we can take a proper decision."
"According to information from the BBC, France wanted a power of attorney of general, worldwide scope, not just for Somalia, but was fortunately unable to win through on this."
"For the first time we are talking about a curtailing of maritime sovereignty here, and we are also talking about a palpable breach of international law."
"We ought to be specifying this very clearly."
"We are talking about direct support for the so-called government in Somalia, which is supported by Ethiopia and the United States."
"There is direct cooperation with Operation Enduring Freedom, which is unacceptable, and funding is to be channelled through Athena."
"We do not have any information of any kind on this either."
"We ought to be informed directly."
"What this is about is the protection by military forces of access to raw materials, which cannot be done like this."
"What we need is a way of dealing with this other than by military means."
"(EL) Mr President, in this very important discussion let me focus on two points that I think are significant."
"One of them concerns the legal aspect."
"I think it is time for an update of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, so that we can improve the legal basis for implementing various methods of combating the problem."
"The second point is the operational side of things."
"The maritime aspect of the issue is important, but not sufficiently so."
"An operational plan is needed; sea and air forces must be used in order to allow effective action."
"Lastly, there is a series of interrelated matters."
"Commissioner Tajani said that the link between piracy and terrorism is being investigated, and I must add a further dimension: the interconnection between piracy and organised crime should be investigated."
"(EL) Mr President, I have listened carefully to all the speakers."
"Everything they have said is correct, but here we are faced with an issue that requires immediate action."
"We cannot wait for the new maritime code or turn a blind eye on this situation."
"Let me point out that ÎÎÎ¤Î is stepping in and playing the part of an international policeman and busybody."
"Could it not at least intervene here, with our backing, to form a unit from all Member States, with sea and air forces?"
"Now if we Europeans, who have no common defence policy, wait until we can create such a unit, I think we shall be too late."
"Since NATÎ plays the policeman where it is inconvenient for us, let us call on it to do so to suit our needs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like thank you for this debate of a very high standard."
"I sincerely believe that piracy is a form of terrorism and it is taking on uncontrolled proportions."
"The truth is that if nothing is done, the freedom of circulation for shipping in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia may well disappear entirely, with the massive consequences that would of course ensue."
"I am delighted that the European Union is the first to have taken responsibility for this."
"I would add that, as you know, there are other areas of the world where piracy also poses a problem, particularly in the Malacca Strait and around Singapore."
"This is an equally important and difficult question for Europe."
"We should be able to make a decision on whether to continue planning a naval operation under the European Security and Defence Policy in early October."
"The role of NATO was mentioned in several speeches."
"Dealing with piracy is not within NATO's remit."
"It does have a mandate for terrorism."
"They may look similar, but they are not the same thing."
"Until October, the Coordination Cell will continue to play its supporting role towards the Member States to try to improve the security conditions in the area."
"Mr Savary mentioned poverty in Somalia and I would stress that we have to get cargo vessels for the World Food Programme through there."
"Somalia and its population really need them."
"In parallel, we will need to take action to set up a joint legal framework for the whole of the international community so that these acts of piracy can be brought to justice more effectively."
"There are pirates who have been arrested and brought to European prisons."
"Obviously we now need to look at the judicial aspect and the legal framework for all of this."
"I would like to say that, unlike one Member who spoke earlier, I am pleased about the concrete action that has been taken by a number of Member States."
"This concrete action sends a very strong signal that could save lives, because there could be not only ransom demands but also killings."
"Some fishing vessels were fired on a few days ago."
"The situation is therefore dangerous, so a military response is appropriate."
"Finally, I will appropriate the lovely phrase that your fellow Member Mr Morillon used: it is about protecting our interests and values."
"Protecting our values is a strong and proper action for Europe!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that this debate has been very useful, because it has certainly demonstrated the wishes of Parliament, the Commission and the Council to take action together to tackle a phenomenon that is becoming ever more worrying, namely piracy, and to give a response to European citizens on this issue."
"I endorse the analysis that has emerged from the debate: it is not enough merely to take military action, which is a fundamental point, but it must also be taken swiftly, and I do not believe that we should dwell over-long on issues of competence, whether it ought to be the European Union or NATO - we must not waste time."
"I believe that we must step up coordination, but we have a duty to intervene, to prevent pirate organisations from strengthening their positions."
"At the same time, it is important to take action to prevent and eradicate the possible causes of the growth of the phenomenon and of the recruitment of pirates."
"Someone said during course of the debate that it is becoming very profitable to carry out piracy, and in areas where poverty is at very high levels it is clear that it is easy for pirate organisations to recruit people, especially the young, who are prepared to do anything and prepared to enlist in these paramilitary organisations."
"That is why, at the same time as taking measures directed at control and repression, which must be taken by the EU countries, and I am pleased about what has already been done, we must act - and here the Commission has a significant role to play - to help certain developing countries to grow in economic terms, to prevent poverty from becoming a tool that facilitates piracy."
"Of course, we must then also work to understand - and here again the Commission can play a very important role - what lies behind piracy, what the links are with fundamentalism and with terrorism; what the points of strength are, what the reasons are."
"The Commission can give significant help here to the other European institutions."
"We can certainly not stand by, we can certainly not wait, and certainly, too, with the strong action by Parliament pushing the Council and the Commission to act, we must guarantee safety for sea workers, and we must guarantee safety for goods coming from outside the European Union to supply the European Union."
"We must guarantee the issue not only - it is right to deal with it not only in the seas closest to the European Union - where there are also fishermen operating and Mrs Fraga told us, with concern, about events that are taking place even closer to us."
"We must also look at what is happening in other parts of the world because piracy also affects ships flying the flags of EU countries in very remote seas."
"That is why we must not waste any more time, but it seems to me that the wish of the European Union has been clearly shown today, and particularly that of the Council, with the support of the Commission, to intervene and to continue to take firm action to prevent and, I also believe, through strategic projects to prevent any increase in terrorist action."
"That is why the Council will receive support from the Commission on all initiatives to combat terrorism and also to prevent it; we want to prevent and to combat terrorism, let us say, that is linked to piracy."
"Thus, with the vigilant eye of Parliament, I believe that this cooperation can lead us to a positive result."
"On defence, I also endorse the view of Mr Bussereau on the words of our friend General Morillon: it is a matter of defending not just the interests but also the values of the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will not take place until the October session."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.50 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)"
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0462/2008)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Council."
"Subject: Importance given to road transport policy"
"Parliament has expressed its position at first reading on the 'road transport package', consisting of proposals for the modification of three regulations on, respectively: access to the occupation of road transport operator; access to the market in the carriage of goods by road; and access to the market in the carriage of passengers by coach and bus (recast -."
"These regulations concern and affect the activity of more than 800 000 transport operators in Europe, as well as some 4.5 m jobs."
"It is vital that there should be a clear legislative framework making it possible to promote business and development strategies"
"Given that the new version of the regulation on access to the occupation of road transport operator will come into force on 1 June 2009, and that by 1 January 2012 the Member States should have interconnected their national electronic registers as defined by that regulation, can the Council state what degree of priority is being given to the 'road transport package' for the next five months, and what timetable is proposed to enable the new modified regulations to be adopted by 1 June 2009?"
"Mr President, first I want to express my sympathy following the shooting of 10 people at a Finnish school in Kauhajoki."
"My sincere condolences go to the families of the victims and to Finnish MEPs either here in this Chamber or detained by their work."
"To answer Mrs Å¢icÄu's question, I just wanted to say that in its session on 13 June 2008 the Council reached a political agreement on the three proposals in the road transport package."
"The purpose of these new texts is to harmonise national regulations, which can differ and are therefore a source of legal uncertainty for road transport operators."
"The principal amendments that have been made are basically as follows: there is a more precise definition of the concept of 'cabotage', a standardised presentation of the Community licence, certified copies and driver certificates, strengthening of the provisions forcing a Member State to take measures when a transport operator commits an infringement in another Member State and, finally, better interconnection of national registers of infringements so that there can be better monitoring of road transport operators across Europe."
"The European Parliament adopted the reports on this package at First Reading during the session on 20 May."
"Work should now be focused on securing a compromise between the Council and Parliament."
"Taking account of translation times, the work on preparing the texts of the respective Common Positions could not start until the end of August but the Council is hoping to be able to adopt the Common Positions on the three proposals in the next few weeks and present them to the European Parliament as soon as possible."
"(FR) I just wanted to say that we have still not received the Common Position from the Council and I wanted to highlight the fact that the date of entry into force of the Regulation, as far as access to the occupation of road transport operator is concerned, is 1 June 2009."
"There are 4.5 million employees and also nearly 800 000 businesses involved here."
"This is therefore a very important matter and we are hoping that the Council's political agreement will give us the time necessary for its Second Reading."
"Mrs Å¢icÄu, I am well aware of the urgency you mention."
"I can assure you the Council will do its utmost to ensure that the Common Position is defined and sent to Parliament as soon as possible, in view of the urgency you mentioned, which is quite legitimate."
"Subject: European immigration pact"
"Can the Council explain the likely consequences of the recently adopted European immigration pact for the future of the Union's immigration policy?"
"Mr Ortega, the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum aims to express at the highest political level the common principles that should guide migration policy at national and Community level, and the strategic orientations to be pursued to give them substance."
"The proposed text was positively received by the Council and the Commission."
"The final version should be approved by the European Council in October."
"As you know, the aim of the Pact is to lay the foundations of a strengthened common policy, based on two principles at the heart of the European project: on the one hand, responsibility, and on the other, solidarity."
"It is based on three dimensions of the overall approach to immigration."
"The first is better organisation of legal immigration; in particular, this involves taking more account of the needs and reception capacities of the Member States, but also encouraging integration."
"The next is a more effective fight against illegal immigration, particularly by ensuring that illegal migrants return under conditions of dignity; we also want to protect the EU better by improving the effectiveness of controls at external borders, particularly within the framework of the Schengen enlargement."
"Lastly, there is the promotion of a close partnership between the countries of origin, transit and destination of immigrants, for the benefit of our partners' development; this is the concept of co-development."
"Finally, as the Vice-President of the Commission said again today, we hope the Pact will enable us to mark out a common asylum policy and a Europe of asylum."
"We know that national traditions differ, but we still want to make progress in this area."
"As you know, the French Presidency has consulted the European Parliament informally throughout the preparation of this Pact."
"There have been many discussions within the Parliament framework."
"Parliament's political support for this initiative is essential."
"We have no doubt that the Pact will deliver to European citizens the concrete results they have the right to expect and will show that Europe is taking concrete action to deal with the problems they may be experiencing."
"(ES) I am satisfied with the way in which the Presidency of the Council has answered my question, and I think that the Immigration Pact is an important step."
"In what we could call the second part of my question, I am talking, above all, about the influence that this pact could have on the development of the European Union's policy on immigration."
"In other words, can we expect to make progress?"
"As the President-in-Office of the Council is aware, at the moment we have, on the one hand, a feeling of alarm in the European Union and, on the other hand, the need for immigration and the need to have adequate regulation, which means that often the information is highly deficient."
"Can we expect that this will be followed by legislation and specific provisions that will resolve this problem?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Yes, I do believe, as Mr Ortega has quite rightly pointed out, that there is a need for immigration in Europe, and we are not denying that."
"That is why, as I pointed out, we need to lay down conditions for reception and integration as well as conditions for adapting migratory flows to Europe's economic and social situations."
"We need to look at immigration needs within this framework."
"We often have a tendency to reduce these needs to skilled immigration."
"However, this is not appropriate, because in Europe we also need unskilled immigration, and the discussions in the Council are on exactly that - how to better manage these immigration needs and how to find the best solutions in terms of employment, qualification and reception in schools and universities."
"That is where we are at, and we will have a better picture after the European Council on 15 October, when the orientations will be defined."
"It is on these bases that the legislative measures Mr Ortega referred to, which are indeed necessary, will be translated."
"Subject: Anti-corruption tools"
"What anti-corruption tools does the Council have in place to ensure that EU aid is being delivered directly and effectively to those most in need in developing countries?"
"Mr Ryan, the question you raise is important because it concerns the effectiveness of development aid."
"It is important to maintain a significant volume of development aid, and I will come back to that, but you are quite right to point out in your question that this aid must be effective."
"For aid to be effective, and to be able to combat fraud and the improper allocation of development aid funds, we particularly need better coordination and complementarity between donors."
"That is why we are working on joint multiannual programming based on strategies to combat poverty, which give us a better picture of how funds are targeted and according to what objectives, and which also enable us to control this allocation better."
"This is why we have set up common implementation mechanisms, including joint analyses."
"In particular, there are some large-scale joint missions, financed by both donors and beneficiaries, so that co-financing mechanisms are in place."
"These issues were on the agenda of the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in Accra last week."
"We debated this here at the last session at the beginning of this month."
"At the Forum in Accra in early September, a plan of action was adopted."
"It largely meets our expectations as regards the European Union."
"The principal commitments made by the donors are as follows: better planning, three to five years in advance, of the aid countries hope to provide; the use of administrations and organisations in partner countries; switching from political conditions imposed by third countries to conditions based on targets set by the developing countries themselves."
"As regards monitoring the supply of aid, the Council, like the European Parliament, gets the chance to evaluate how the EU's external aid has been used each year."
"This evaluation is performed through the Annual Report on the European Community's Development Policy and the Implementation of External Assistance, which the Commission generally presents towards the end of June - which must have been done in June, if I am to believe the information I have here."
"I would add that the development cooperation instrument provides tools to protect the Community's financial interests, particularly as regards fraud and irregularities, as Mr Ryan hopes."
"There are therefore evaluation mechanisms, control mechanisms, mechanisms that aim to ensure better coordination between donors and beneficiaries; but at the end of the day, the real objective is to ensure that these policies are appropriated by the beneficiary countries, to continue to stress good governance and ensure there is a greater sense of responsibility, particularly on the part of the beneficiaries of this aid as regards the allocation of our support."
"That is what I wanted to say."
"Mr President, by sheer coincidence, Transparency International, the anti-corruption watchdog, released its annual corruption perception index today."
"It estimates that levels of corruption are adding about USD 50 billion to the cost of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which is an absolutely staggering amount of money."
"It is approximately half of the annual global aid outlay."
"Even if that figure is exaggerated - even if it is half what they say - it is still a staggering amount of money."
"President-in-Office of the Council, do you not think that more needs to be done to try to tackle this?"
"Whatever we need, one thing we do not need is for the general public in Europe to feel that the money they give to aid programmes is in some way being mislaid or abused."
"I think it is very important that a figure as staggering as this needs to be addressed in a more coherent way."
"I would like to reiterate what I said earlier."
"Mr Ryan is right."
"It is true that one of the problems for public opinion in Europe is, on the one hand, that the volume of development aid remains high."
"In this respect, as you know, the European Union is the biggest donor of development aid."
"On the other hand, it is essential that the mechanisms of good governance and effective control are in place."
"There must also be better information for the public about aid and the appropriation of aid by beneficiary countries and, to be honest, monitoring of governance - a certain conditionality, if you like - must be at the heart of development policy."
"You are all right, corruption is a scourge."
"I do not know whether Transparency International's figures are accurate, as you yourself acknowledged, but in any case the point you made was correct."
"Consequently, there cannot be an increase in development aid except through a reinforcement of control mechanisms, anti-fraud mechanisms, anti-corruption mechanisms, and each time this should be one of the objectives of the agreements."
"This is also what the Council concluded on 27 May in terms of its development policy objectives."
"There must be better control mechanisms and conditionality to protect financial interests, but more importantly, as you pointed out, Mr Ryan, to combat corruption."
"Subject: Rising food prices"
"Among the Council priorities for the French Presidency is sustainable development in the agriculture and fisheries sectors."
"In the current economic climate, when Europe and the wider world are affected by rising food prices, what can and will the Council do to ensure that the urgent short-term needs of food supply are met without compromising the sustainability of future development in agriculture and fisheries?"
"Mr President, Mr Ã Neachtain, the Council is fully aware of the need to look for adequate and effective solutions to the problem of rising food prices."
"This is a complex issue, which the Commission thankfully analysed in detail in its Communication of 23 May 2008."
"It was on this basis that the European Council of 19 and 20 June adopted its decisions."
"In the agriculture sector, the EU has already acted: we have sold intervention stocks, reduced export refunds, abolished the need for set-aside in 2008, increased milk quotas and suspended import duty on cereals."
"This has enabled us to improve supply and has helped stabilise the agricultural markets."
"However, this is not enough."
"We need to continue the reform of the common agricultural policy; we must make it more market-oriented while encouraging sustainable agriculture throughout the EU and assuring adequate supply."
"Agriculture ministers are discussing this - in fact they may even still be discussing it today - at the informal meeting in Annecy and will report back to the 'Agriculture' Council on 17 and 18 November."
"In this context, the French Presidency is determined to strengthen the crisis management instruments in an increasingly uncertain international context and to maintain all market regulation instruments to prevent the volatility that you quite rightly mention."
"The question of food prices is not just linked to agriculture; other mechanisms are at work."
"I am thinking for example of the fisheries policy, which has to cope with the consequences of the increase in diesel prices."
"On 15 July the Council adopted a series of emergency measures to encourage the restructuring of the fleets that have been hit hardest by the crisis."
"There is also regulation of the retail sector: the Commission is due to submit a report to the European Council next December."
"There are also policies concerning biofuels, which must take economic and environmental constraints into account and ensure that there is a cap on the prices of these new fuels."
"As you can see, these diverse issues, not to mention those that we have already raised - in other words, development policies and procurement policies with regard to food imports - cover a wide range of policies and are high on the Council's agenda."
"The European Council will examine this in October and December, and of course I will be delighted to take on the task of informing you of the results."
"(GA) Mr President, thank you for your response."
"I would like to inquire of the President-in-Office of the Council if he believes that it is more important than ever that Europe's agricultural policy, that is Europe's policy on food supply, continues after 2013 due to the current crises in the global policy on food supply so that food suppliers in Europe have some sense of certainty?"
"What I wanted to say is that, as Mr Ã Neachtain knows, we want to make sure that the Health Check ends with a reflection on the future of the common agricultural policy."
"This was the aim - the main aim, in fact - of the discussions taking place today and yesterday between agriculture ministers in Annecy."
"Mr Ã Neachtain knows that he can count on the determination of the French Presidency in this respect."
"Subject: White Paper on Sport"
"Can the Council outline what elements of the EU White Paper on Sport it will seek to implement and promote during the French Presidency of the EU?"
"This is a subject that interests me a great deal, so I will try to keep it brief."
"I will try not to confine myself to the legal aspects, although such aspects do exist."
"The EU has no specific competence in sport."
"I would like to point out to Mr Aylward that, for its part, the Lisbon Treaty offers a legal basis for real sports policies."
"We are aware of this and for that reason, as well as for many others, we are waiting for the Treaty to be implemented."
"We would like to ensure that Europe is aware of the various dimensions of sport and the influence that it has on people of all ages, especially young people, but above all its social and educational aspects."
"As current holders of the EU Presidency, we attach a great deal of importance to cooperation between Member States on this subject."
"Before there can be new legal bases under the Lisbon Treaty, I think we need to recognise the specificity of sport in our society."
"At an informal meeting of ministers in charge of European affairs, which I convened in Brest on 12 July, we addressed this issue in the context of the European Union."
"We raised the question of the conditions of recognition of this specificity within a legal framework which should be clear with regard to Community law and the need to improve the governance of sport at European level."
"We have had discussions, particularly with UEFA President Michel Platini, which were based on the White Paper on Sport, the Pierre de Coubertin Action Plan, which was unveiled by the Commission last July."
"These discussions will continue between sports ministers in Biarritz on 27 and 28 November."
"There will also be a European forum on sport."
"The Presidency will invite ministers to look at a number of subjects that seem to me to be extremely important for the cohesion of our society and for the educational value of sport, particularly health and sport, anti-doping, and also the fact that we need to maintain sport at grass-roots level, ensuring that clubs are given feedback about the players they train and the issues of a dual career, of dual training."
"As you can see, we are extremely committed to highlighting the role of sport in the European Union and giving it its rightful place in Europe."
"We have set ourselves three goals: to recognise the specificity of the role of sport in society; to take account of the place occupied by physical activities and sport in economic development; and finally to guarantee, in an increasingly complex society, good governance of sport, of all sports."
"President-in-Office, I welcome the fact that you referred to the different dimensions of sport."
"Nowadays, we hear about professional sport all the time but I am particularly concerned about volunteerism in sport and the 'Sport for all' concept."
"I would like an assurance from you that the EU will support voluntary groups and volunteerism, and in particular the 'Sport for all' concept."
"It is vitally important at a time when all the emphasis in the media and elsewhere is on professional sport."
"Mr President, Mr Aylward is absolutely right."
"We would like to ensure that there is a better balance between amateur and professional sport, we would like there to be supervision, in some cases, of professional sport and we would effectively like to support and encourage the thousands of voluntary associations that are involved in sport across Europe."
"It is here that we effectively need to ensure that the European Union provides incentives."
"It is crucial that we know at this stage which associations are involved in backing sport within the European Union."
"We need to have a detailed study on voluntary work in the EU, and particularly voluntary work in sport, and if Mr Aylward would like to take part in the study we propose, then he will obviously be most welcome."
"In any case, this is an important dimension that we would like to take into account."
"In this respect, I would like to point out that we are also going to meet in Paris on 5 October with all the European athletes who took part in the Olympic Games."
"There are, in fact, still a number of amateur athletes who compete in the Olympics."
"Subject: Objectives of European Conference on Alzheimer's"
"I welcome the French Presidency programme highlighting the promotion of better care for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their families."
"Fostering the exchange and sharing of national experience and cooperation on best practice between Member States on health is what the EU is all about."
"Increased exchanging of information and best practices between Member States on all health matters will hugely benefit our medical professions and more importantly our citizens."
"I am aware that a large European conference will be held in October on the subject of Alzheimer's disease. Can you outline the set objectives of this conference and what the French Presidency would like to achieve?"
"This is an extremely serious issue."
"The French Presidency of the Council attaches the utmost importance to Alzheimer's disease and to other neurodegenerative diseases."
"This is an issue that affects every family in Europe at some point."
"We must tackle the issue head-on, unless we want to be overtaken by the ageing European population."
"As announced on 1 July by President Barroso and President Sarkozy, together we must prepare a European plan to tackle Alzheimer's disease based on three pillars: research, patient care and quality of life, and ethics and legal aspects, particularly with regard to those involved in treating this disease."
"It is in this context that the French Presidency will hold a ministerial conference in Paris on 30 and 31 October entitled 'Europe against Alzheimer's Disease'."
"This conference will focus on the disease, but will also tackle other related diseases such as Pick disease, Binswanger's disease and Lewy body disease."
"We will cover all of these diseases so that we can look at how to reconcile the care given to patients with social support, how to tailor professions and skills according to patients' needs, how to expand our knowledge - in other words, everything to do with research and medical expertise - and how to ensure better coordination of research programmes in various European countries, as well as how to find out about the latest scientific results concerning this disease and the development of new drugs."
"There is no question that the European dimension can and must provide a significant impetus for the various campaigns to tackle these diseases."
"The results of the ministerial conference will help provide a basis for the conclusions of the European Council next December, although we are fully aware that this is a work in progress."
"This will be a long-term project and it is vital that subsequent presidencies, starting with the Czech and Swedish Presidencies, continue the good work."
"Knowing how sensitive the European Parliament is, I know that we can count on your support, as well as on the commitment of the European Commission, to provide the continuity that is needed."
"Let me compliment the French presidency on holding this conference 'Europe Against Alzheimer's' and the proactive role that it has adopted."
"I notice, however, that you have not mentioned the issue of dementia specifically and, as you know, Alzheimer's associations are clamouring for increased awareness and education on the condition."
"Can you tell me, Minister, if the conference will address the issue promoting awareness of the condition in order to decrease the stigma associated with it?"
"(SK) In the European Union and in my country, Slovakia, Alzheimer's disease and the care of people suffering from this are still being given insufficient attention."
"Experts estimate that, in the next 40 years, Alzheimer's disease may affect up to four times more people than today, but early and accurate diagnosis may help to slow the development of the disease."
"Will the French Presidency not prepare a special information campaign or give new encouragement to the Commission to prepare programmes to cofinance the activity of citizens' associations aimed at helping people with memory disorders and Alzheimer's disease?"
"Mr Aylward is right: the conference must study all aspects of prevention and education, as Mrs PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡ and Mr Aylward both point out."
"We must fully take into account the different aspects of dementia, as well as aspects linked to Lewy body syndrome, as I think I underlined in my speech."
"This is a natural process, since Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative condition; in other words a condition in which neurons deteriorate and die."
"The disappearance of these neurons, which are used to plan sequences of actions, are debilitating."
"Although we associate Alzheimer's disease with loss of memory, other parts of the brain are also affected."
"Clearly this can also be accompanied by types of dementia, which is something we must take preventive action against."
"From this point of view, I can assure Mr Aylward that the conference will fully address these issues."
"In terms of the question from Mrs PleÅ¡tinskÃ¡, I believe that some marginalisation does exist."
"You mentioned the rise in Alzheimer's in your country."
"Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case in Europe."
"Here, too, we need to focus on the issue of earlier diagnosis."
"We need to share information; we need better coordination between specialists in these issues at European level."
"However, early diagnosis is particularly important to prevent patients from being marginalised and gradually falling victim to the disease without others noticing."
"Subject: Agricultural policy and the French Presidency"
"The Presidency of the Council states in its work programme that it 'will review the legislative proposals on the assessment of the Common Agricultural Policy, with the aim of adopting new provisions by the end of 2008."
"To do this, it will work closely with the European Parliament... the Presidency will [also] propose to its partners that they take a broader view of the issues and the objectives that European agriculture and agricultural policy will have to meet in the future'."
"Given this, can the Presidency of the Council update Parliament on the informal meeting of agriculture ministers scheduled to take place in Annecy on 21-23 September 2008?"
"In particular can the Presidency report to Parliament on the progress made with regard to the CAP 'Health Check' and the animal health strategy?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle for allowing me the opportunity to inform Parliament of the recent developments concerning the common agricultural policy."
"The Council is working intensively and constructively on the Health Check - as I have already said - with a view to achieving a political consensus as soon as the European Parliament has given its opinion, which it is expected to do by November 2008."
"We are keen to work closely with Parliament based on the report that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is due to submit on 7 October."
"The Council is, in turn, due to discuss this at the end of the month, on 27 and 28 October."
"As I mentioned, the Council is continuing to examine the Commission's legislative proposals on matters relating to the modulation of aid, market management mechanisms, milk quota management and conditionality."
"These were discussed by ministers of agriculture in Annecy yesterday and today."
"Ministers have raised issues concerning both the CAP Health Check and the future of the CAP, distinguishing between internal and external aspects."
"As far as internal aspects are concerned, it is important that a higher proportion of CAP appropriations are allocated to the most vulnerable people, especially in view of the price increases we have seen."
"External aspects must include the introduction of an emergency EU food programme."
"As for the concern expressed by Mrs Doyle on the subject of the animal welfare strategy, following the unveiling in September 2007 of the Commission Communication on the Community Animal Health Policy and its strategy over the period 2007-2013, on 17 December 2007 the Council adopted conclusions on the strategy, inviting the Commission to present an action plan."
"This action plan was adopted by the Commission on 10 September and it is on the basis of this document that the French Presidency is determined to continue working."
"We would particularly like to strengthen Community procedures for epizootic control, both in the Community and regarding imports, and to review legislation on biosafety and compensation."
"(GA) Mr President, when we speak of agriculture we speak of food."
"It is my understanding that the Commission recommended that the European Union have a policy on food labelling where foods of European origin would be clearly indicated on our supermarket shelves - I make this remark especially in reference to meat."
"It has been said, however, that the Council will not accept this policy."
"I would like to inquire of the President-in-Office of the Council why that is?"
"Listen, I share the concerns of Mr Higgins, so I am going to see what the Council is prepared to accept."
"What seems very clear, Mr Higgins, is that, as holders of the Presidency, we share your concerns regarding guaranteeing food safety for citizens and ensuring the traceability of foodstuffs."
"It is therefore crucial that we satisfy the demand for food quality and diversity."
"Consumers are going to be even more critical when it comes to food safety."
"We will ensure that we improve consumer information on the public health issues linked with a balanced diet and the origin and quality of products."
"You should know that this is one of the Presidency's concerns, and that during the various summit meetings we will try to ensure that concrete expression is given to this objective, which is important to us all, Mr Higgins."
"Questions Nos 8 and 9 were not deemed admissible."
"Subject: Irish rejection of the Lisbon Treaty"
"Does the rejection by the Irish electorate of the Lisbon Reform Treaty have implications for EU enlargement and will the Council spell out precisely what these implications are?"
"Mr President, Mr Higgins, as you know, the European Council has acknowledged the results of the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It has also acknowledged that the ratification process is ongoing and has issued an explicit reminder that the aim of the Lisbon Treaty is to help the enlarged Union act more efficiently and more democratically."
"Heads of State or Government will address this issue at the October Council."
"We must all reflect on the consequences of the current institutional situation for all policies, including enlargement, and on the institutions themselves."
"The Treaty of Nice, in political terms, was designed for a Europe of 27 members."
"However, what I want to be clear about is that during its Presidency, France has acted impartially in continuing the negotiations under way with Croatia and Turkey, in view of the progress made by the candidate countries in satisfying their obligations."
"With regard to Croatia, 21 of the 35 chapters are still open, while 3 have been provisionally closed."
"Two intergovernmental conferences are planned under the French Presidency."
"We have already opened the chapter on the free movement of goods."
"In terms of Turkey, we had a troika last week during the meeting of EU foreign ministers."
"At the present time 8 of the 35 chapters are open, 1 chapter has been provisionally closed, and if the conditions are met, we hope to be able to open 2 or 3 more chapters with Turkey by the end of the year."
"Minister, is it not clear that, by 31 December, all 26 Member States except Ireland will have adopted the Lisbon Treaty, and that there is no question of renegotiation?"
"You cannot go back to the text."
"But, apart from Ireland and Lisbon, you take France and the Netherlands in relation to the Constitution: we have a major problem in that there is a huge disconnect between the ordinary citizen and the European project."
"Would the Minister consider that an idea would be for us to have a Europe Day - not just a Schuman Day, where we just have Brussels and Belgium closed - a Europe Day, a public holiday, where all the citizens of Europe, in all the 27 Member States, would collectively celebrate our common European citizenship and identity?"
"I understand that the Council has been supplied with the results of a survey carried out by the Irish Government."
"Can I just say that I think that this sort of window dressing is what got us where we are."
"They did not survey the 47% who voted 'yes'."
"The reason that the referendum was not carried in Ireland was a failure of leadership, and secondly because - leaving aside the original vote on the Treaty of Rome - we went to the people six times in referendum: in the Single European Act, Amsterdam, Maastricht, twice on the Nice Treaty, and then on Lisbon."
"And then we hand the people an entire Treaty and say: what do you think of that?"
"Was it not a recipe for disaster, when there was no leadership?"
"The question is: will there be leadership now?"
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office if he would indicate what the implications will be if Ireland does not ratify either now, or if it continues to vote 'no' in the future."
"Give us an indication of where Europe is going."
"Mr Higgins and Mr Mitchell have raised important questions."
"I will leave Mr Mitchell to answer for his comments."
"Personally I cannot comment on his remarks, and he will understand this, in view of my responsibilities before this Assembly."
"There are numerous causes."
"I believe that the report that was produced after the Irish voted 'no' to the referendum highlights a number of issues: it raises questions of leadership, thematic questions, and highlights the lack of understanding of what the Lisbon Treaty actually is."
"The French Presidency will do its utmost to find a solution to this major institutional problem."
"We need the Lisbon Treaty and, in agreement with our Irish friends, we will look at all possible options from now until the end of the French Presidency."
"To answer Mr Higgins, I think he is right."
"There is no doubt that the referendums have shown that there is a disconnect between the European project and public opinion."
"This is why we need to look at what the fundamental issues are, as well as examine the communication issues."
"This morning the Commission, representatives from your Assembly - Vice-President Vidal-Quadras and the committee chairman Mr Leinen - and I tried to define an interinstitutional architecture, a political declaration aimed at improving communication between the three institutions."
"For the Council - and I speak objectively here - this has required effort and has not been particularly easy."
"As for your suggestion, I can only speak personally, but I must say that the idea of a 'Europe Day' celebrated across Europe seems to me effectively to be a symbol of more shared citizenship, of a Europe that is better understood."
"However, this is an idea that you and I and the most ardent Europe supporters must promote."
"Personally, though, I think it is a good idea."
"(FR) Thank you for clarifying these matters."
"I would also like you to clarify a more specific point."
"We have talked at length about Ireland, but four other Member States have still not ratified the Treaty, as you know: Poland, the Czech Republic, Sweden - we do not even know what stage Sweden is at with the ratification process - and Germany."
"In terms of the latter, I would like to remind you that everything hangs on a ruling by the Karlsruhe Constitutional Court."
"The president of the court has said that she does not intend to hurry and will not decide until early next year."
"Consequently, I would be grateful if you could also explain the next steps to us."
"I thought that this Treaty, which was signed in December last year, had to come into force in a few months' time."
"Where exactly are we with this?"
"I have always agreed with the strict assessments of Mr CoÃ»teaux."
"We have intellectual differences, which is not surprising, but I recognise that his assessments are thorough."
"What I wanted to make very clear is that we need to treat Germany as a separate case."
"We will see what happens, but I am not overly concerned, with all due respect for the Constitutional Court of Karlsruhe."
"I do not have any further information on this subject."
"With regard to Poland, we are in contact with the Polish authorities."
"There is also cohabitation in Poland, although I believe that the Polish Government is committed to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"As for Sweden, there is nothing to suggest that the process will be blocked."
"I believe that ratification will take place in November."
"With regard to the Czech Republic, as you know, we need to wait for the court's decision."
"Senate elections are currently taking place and an important conference of the majority party will take place in early December."
"This seems to me to be the most likely scenario."
"I do not share the deduction made by Mr CoÃ»teaux;"
"I do not share his pessimism."
"There is no doubt that this will take time and that we need to give it time, but political will must be allowed to speak and the French Presidency, for its part, has decided to show voluntarism in this respect."
"Subject: Iran and the development of a nuclear capacity"
"Will the Council comment on its position towards Iran and the potential nuclear threat it represents since it decided to abandon the containment and surveillance measures of the 1997 Additional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency limiting the intrusive powers of the inspectors and putting a halt to snap inspections?"
"Mr President, to answer Mr Mitchell on this serious issue, the EU still has serious concerns over Iran's nuclear programme and the country's lack of interest in responding fully to the concerns raised by the possible military dimension of this programme."
"In December 2007 the European Council declared that it would be unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear military capability."
"In this respect, the Council has on numerous occasions condemned the fact that Iran has not fulfilled its international obligations, which are laid down in Resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747 and 1803 of the United Nations Security Council, specifically the obligation to suspend all activity linked to uranium enrichment, which is crucial if we are to have the necessary framework to begin negotiations and move towards a long-term solution."
"The EU has always supported Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and if Iran wants to rebuild the confidence of the international community in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, it must suspend sensitive activities involving the nuclear fuel cycle."
"The proposals made by Mr Solana in June 2006, repeated in June 2008 on behalf of the six most closely involved countries, still apply and must be used to break the current deadlock."
"The EU strongly regrets the fact that Iran suspended the provisional application of the Additional Protocol in February 2006."
"As a result of this - as underlined by the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - the IAEA knows less about certain aspects of the Iranian nuclear programme."
"In addition, as we were recently reminded once again by the Director General of the IAEA in his report of 15 September, Iran is still refusing to answer specific questions that the IAEA has put to it about activities linked to the design and production of nuclear weapons."
"As the IAEA Director General said - and I cannot draw a different conclusion - this situation is a source of grave concern for the EU and the international community."
"I thank the Minister for his reply."
"I would like to ask the Minister - since this is clearly of grave concern to the international community and to the European Union - the following question."
"Sanctions, to date, have not worked."
"We do not want to get to the stage where military intervention is necessary, so can the Minister tell this House what other sanctions or what other plans the Council has to be proactive to try to bring the Iranian administration to its senses?"
"Are there alternative sanctions?"
"Do you have a list of alternative sanctions, and what are the future steps to be taken?"
"At times it is very hard to see in this game of cat and mouse just who is the cat and who is the mouse."
"We have not reached the point of military action."
"I am saying this again here very clearly."
"The six countries have confirmed their support for the dual approach, which must combine dialogue and sanctions in order to reach a negotiated solution that satisfies the concerns of the international community."
"As far as sanctions go, these vary in nature."
"They must be targeted and must include the economic and financial sector."
"Subject: European agreement on migration and asylum arrangements"
"The formulation of a European agreement on migration and asylum arrangements proposed by the French Presidency seeks to achieve an active political commitment on the part of the EU and the Member States concerning common principles for the formulation of migration policies in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility."
"In this connection, what binding agreements with countries situated on the EU's borders and in particular applicant countries (Turkey, Croatia, FYROM) concerning immigrants from third countries does the Council intend to propose with a view to making Europe an area of security, justice and freedom?"
"What I wanted to say is that the most effective weapon that we have in the fight against illegal immigration is the readmission agreements with third countries that share borders with the EU."
"The Community has signed agreements with 11 third countries. This is the case with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, where the agreement came into force on 1 January 2008."
"All of these agreements contain provisions relating to third-country nationals in transit through the territory."
"With regard to Turkey, formal negotiations began in 2005."
"For Croatia, there is no mandate for negotiating a readmission agreement and the Council wanted there to be swift progress in the negotiations for this country."
"The agreement that will be discussed and, we hope, ratified by the European Council on 15 October will cast the political spotlight on the importance of readmission agreements in the fight against illegal immigration."
"(FR) I would just like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer."
"Mrs Panayotopoulos offers her apologies because she had to leave owing to a prior engagement."
"She asked me to thank you for your answer, President-in-Office."
"Subject: Reform of French public-sector television"
"French President Nicolas Sarkozy has undertaken to implement a major reform of public-sector television in France."
"The reform, which would bring to an end all commercial advertising, is facing major resistance from workers in the sector and, in a broader context, from public opinion, with fears that public-service television would soon cease to exist as it would not be able to compete with private channels if it no longer received income from advertisements."
"From here it is but a short step to believing, as many people do, that France has decided to kill off public-sector television to the benefit of the private sector, which stands to gain much from the procedure."
"Is this an isolated case, or is the initiative likely to spread to all Member States?"
"I would also like to know the Council's position on this issue and whether this kind of reform conforms to European legislation?"
"Mr President, it is a pleasure."
"Thank you for this final question, which is a joy to receive."
"I will of course answer as representative of the Council Presidency and it will come as no surprise to Mr Hutchinson - we know each other well - when I say that funding for state television comes under the remit of the Member States, that the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union on state broadcasting in Member States is unequivocal and that therefore it is up to each Member State to decide how state television companies are funded."
"This is what I wanted to say to Mr Hutchinson."
"(FR) Minister, thank you for your answer."
"This is what I thought you would say."
"I would simply like to say that I am one of those non-French French-speakers - and there are many of us out there - who are devoted viewers and listeners of French state television and radio stations, and that we are concerned about the future of state television and radio stations following the decisions taken by the French Government and announced by its President, who, by chance, also happens to be the current President of the European Council."
"I would also like to say that Mrs Reding, Commissioner for Information Society and Media, to whom I put the same question in a recent interview, admitted that she had not been convinced by the French President's proposed reforms unveiled in January."
"She also lamented the President's decision to tax Internet service providers to finance state television."
"I would like to know where you stand on this."
"First of all, in my own country, as far as I know, different political parties, regardless of their sympathies, asked that there be an end to the ratings tyranny and the way in which this threatens quality and multicultural programming."
"This much I do know."
"Secondly, you have singled out the reform of existing advertising resources and public funding."
"Funding should continue to meet the needs of the public service and we should have sufficient funding to cover these needs."
"This is a fact and is not disputed."
"Thirdly, as usual, France has no intention of imposing any particular model and, as I said, this remains the preserve of each Member State."
"Having said that, everyone here is keen to see that a high-quality public audiovisual service is maintained."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Migration to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) - Migration to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Carlos Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on migration to the second generation Schengen Information System (decision) (12059/1/2008 - C6-0188/2008 -, and"
"the report by Carlos Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on migration to the second generation Schengen Information System (regulation) (11925/2/2008 - C6-0189/2008 -."
"(PT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are examining two instruments: a regulation and a decision on migration from SISone4ALL to SIS II, including a comprehensive test that will assess whether the level of performance of SIS II is equivalent to that of the current system."
"These proposals are the result of a change in the migration strategy."
"Four points: firstly, the initial plan was to have a migration of 15 Member States in a process lasting around 8 hours."
"In the meantime, the number of Member States increased to 25, which made the process much more complex and difficult."
"Secondly, an interim technical architecture will have to be created that will allow SIS1+ and SIS II to operate in parallel for a limited transitional period."
"This is a wise solution that we should agree to and it will enable us to have a fallback in the event of something going wrong."
"Thirdly, a technical tool - a converter - will be made available during this interim period that will connect the SIS I central system to the SIS II central system, enabling both to process the same information and ensuring that all Member States stay on the same level."
"Lastly, the mandate given to the Commission in 2001 expires at the end of this year."
"We raised four concerns."
"Firstly, the need for the European Commission to continue to have a mandate to develop SIS II until it is operational."
"We are opposed to the idea, which was considered, of the Commission's mandate finishing when work on the C-SIS central system is concluded."
"Secondly, for there to be a clear definition of the European Commission's competences and of those of the Member States."
"Thirdly, that all the conditions laid down in No 2 establishing the legal basis for SIS should be fulfilled before the migration of the data takes place."
"Lastly, that this migration should be carried out in a single, one-shot phase, processed by all Member States."
"The proposals we received on 3 September, on the same day that they were approved in Coreper, make major changes to the initial proposals."
"Normally Parliament should be consulted again when the texts presented involve substantial changes."
"However, once again, we are up against a tight schedule; the Commission's mandate expires at the end of 2008 and it is essential that the Council approve these proposals at the end of October."
"Once again Parliament is showing it is living up to its responsibilities and it is not our fault that the process is delayed."
"As a matter of fact, the changes that have been made do answer most of the concerns outlined in my draft reports, especially in terms of clarifying the Commission's responsibilities and those of the Member States and that the Commission will continue to have a mandate to develop SIS II until it is operational."
"In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the French Presidency on the excellent work it has put into achieving a good agreement between the Commission and the Member States, which had looked as if it was going to be difficult."
"The European Parliament wants to contribute to avoiding further delays and to having SIS II operational by the new date set: 30 September 2009."
"We are, however, concerned, as various experts have said informally that it is more than likely that this date will once again not be respected."
"There are two essential points that the European Parliament considers as key and that all the political groups support."
"Firstly, that the European Parliament should be updated on a six-monthly basis on the development of the project and, secondly, that the mandate given to the new Commission should not be an open-ended mandate and that a rule be included whereby the European Parliament has to be consulted again if there is a delay of more than one year."
"We sincerely hope that this time the project will be concluded in a timely fashion and that SIS II can start operating on the scheduled date."
"We will now hear from the Council."
"Mr Jouyet, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you for being here all day."
"I believe that your attentiveness before this Assembly is a reflection of your commitment to Europe."
"Mr President, thank you for your kind words."
"Obviously I return the compliment in terms of commitment to Europe, and to the Vice-President of the Commission, Jacques Barrot."
"Mr Coelho, ladies and gentlemen, redesigning the Schengen system is necessary to develop the new functions that crime prevention and border control will demand in future."
"The 'SISone4ALL' system, Minister, developed on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a happy compromise that allowed the Member States that joined in 2004 to be included and, more importantly, led to the removal of controls at internal land borders, in December, and then at air borders, in March."
"We all felt emotional seeing the last iron curtain come down, seeing Slovak and Austrian ministers symbolically cut down the wooden barrier at the Berg-PetrÅ¾alka crossing point to the east of Vienna."
"I think that this is a proud moment for any staunch European supporter, knowing that we have an area of free movement of 3.6 million km2."
"This is the largest area in the world, although - as you know - the necessary corollary of this great freedom is an electronic system that allows us to identify suspected criminals and to follow the trail of false papers and stolen passports, while applying stringent data protection rules to guarantee individual freedoms."
"I would like to emphasise this point."
"However, as you quite rightly said, the current system does not allow the use of modern technology, even if this complies with the fundamental principles of data protection and especially the principle of proportionality."
"How can the police be efficient with a central database that does not currently allow them to look at digital photographs of wanted criminals, to identify them with any certainty?"
"This is why the aim of the Schengen II or SIS II information system must be maintained; as you clearly explained, this is the real issue in our debate."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Council, I would like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Barrot, who, under a new mandate, has agreed to continue overseeing the development of the new SIS central database, in addition to the connection with national databases."
"I would like to thank him for being personally involved in this project."
"The draft texts that you will be asked to vote on tomorrow set out a clearer division of responsibilities between the Member States and the Commission during each phase, whether in terms of project development, final tests, the interim phase, with the converter, or the final migration of one system to another, in the interests of establishing an overall balance between the obligations of Member States and the responsibilities of the European Commission."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Coelho, who has worked swiftly, effectively and imaginatively on this important project, together with his colleagues from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I would also ask him to pass on my thanks to the committee chairman, Mr Deprez."
"Mr Coelho has encouraged support for the texts needed for today's plenary, and these texts incorporate the proposals that you made, Mr Coelho."
"Parliament's support today allows us to embark on a new phase in the transition to SIS II, in time for the expiry of the Commission's current mandate - an ad hoc mandate, I should point out - which is due to expire on 31 December."
"I would just like to reassure the Vice-President on this point."
"Of course, the launch of the new system represents an enormous technological challenge, and one that was no doubt underestimated at first."
"In fact, the transfer of 22 million records involving more than 24 parties whose national databases are in different formats is, as you can imagine, no mean feat."
"However, the efforts that have been made in this project are, I think, up to the task."
"In view of these technical and financial efforts, the European Parliament deserves to be kept fully informed of the progress and of the difficulties that exist in the transition to the new system."
"A deadline should be set - as you said, Mr Coelho - to test the new system and check that it will be fully operational - as we all hope - in September next year, as agreed during the Justice and Home Affairs Council Meeting on 6 June."
"We realise that we have set ourselves a tight deadline."
"The technical experts realise this."
"We can only meet this deadline if everyone is wholeheartedly committed to the SIS II project and shoulders their responsibilities."
"With this report, the European Parliament is sending out a positive signal this evening by asking perfectly legitimate questions."
"This is why the Council proposes to unconditionally approve the amendments tabled, which, I should point out, have received the support of all political groups within the European Parliament. Thank you so much for all your hard work."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the Presidency and Mr Jouyet for agreeing just now with Mr Coelho's report, since I truly believe that progress needs to be made in this crucial area now, without delay."
"I would also like to thank Mr Coelho for his report and for his personal commitment to the success of SIS II."
"If SIS II ever sees the light of day, then we will owe much to you, Mr Coehlo."
"Your report again highlights the level of interest and ongoing support within the European Parliament for plans to develop the second generation Schengen Information System."
"Evidently, SIS II will be a key tool in the Common Space of Freedom, Security and Justice and, to that end, it is clearly essential that this system should be operational as soon as possible."
"I am pleased, therefore, that an agreement has been reached on legal instruments relating to the migration of SIS I to SIS II."
"This agreement is acceptable because it respects the following three key principles:"
"a clear delimitation of the tasks and responsibilities of those involved (Member States, Commission, Council);"
"effective and unambiguous decision-making processes;"
"the setting of compulsory milestones."
"The adoption of this legal framework by October will help ensure that the work necessary for SIS II continues in 2009."
"It is true, as Mr Jouyet pointed out - you pointed this out, President-in-Office - that 30 September 2009, a date now recognised in the proposed legal instruments on migration, is an ambitious deadline."
"Even this summer we actually had to suspend some tests with Member States following an informal expert consultation."
"The contractor now has a period of 20 days in which to correct the existing problems."
"However, there is no doubt that we need to keep a close eye on all of the potential problems that might arise and prevent us from keeping to the timetable for SIS II."
"We are currently in discussion with Member States on the best way of finishing the work on SIS II."
"We also need to find the right balance between the political priority attached to this system and, at the same time, the guarantee of excellence of the service rendered to the national authorities that will use it."
"In any event, the proposed adaptation mechanisms give us some flexibility and oblige us to adopt the necessary transparency with regard to the development plan."
"Therefore, Mr Coehlo, we are in full agreement with your amendments; that goes without saying."
"On the one hand, setting an expiry date for legislative acts on migration for the end of June 2010 will give us sufficient room for manoeuvre in the event of problems with finalising the development of SIS II or with migration."
"This date will also ensure that SIS II is fully operational by mid-2010."
"On the other hand, the twice-yearly presentation by the Commission of reports relating to the development and migration of SIS I to SIS II will ensure that work on SIS II is transparent for the European Parliament."
"For my part, Mr President, I would like to emphasise - like Mr Jouyet, speaking on behalf of the Presidency - that for Schengen to truly be a complete success - which it already is - we need SIS II."
"This is a real technological achievement, illustrating what Europe can do when it decides to use new technology. It is also absolutely essential."
"This is why I am extremely grateful to Parliament, which, almost without opposition, has accepted all of these aspects and has approved Mr Coehlo's report."
"on behalf of PPE-DE. - (RO) I endorse the rapporteur's proposal of setting the deadline for this new legislative package for 30 June 2010; this is important in order to prevent any possible delays in the implementation of the second generation of the Schengen Information System, SIS II."
"The removal of border controls on land and at sea, which started on 21 December 2007, as well as in the air (March 2008) is a relevant step for nine of the ten Member States."
"The Council decided that border control in the three outstanding states, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, would cease when the operability of the Schengen System has been guaranteed following an evaluation."
"However, the working of the Schengen System in the three states depends on the working of SIS II in the current Schengen countries."
"As is known, SIS II was initially scheduled to start operating in May 2007, then it was delayed for December 2008, and now it has been postponed again to September 2009."
"This rescheduling may trigger delays in the three Member States."
"We should not forget that all of these three Member States are border states of the European Union and that they have both land and maritime borders."
"The first two measures in the Schengen acquis are the removal of border control, its movement to external borders, and common procedures for the control of persons crossing external borders."
"These measures in the acquis are undermined by the fact that countries such as Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus depend on the delayed implementation of SIS II in countries which are part of the Schengen Area."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission and the French Presidency to solve the problem of managing SIS II and to negotiate with the contractor, so as to avoid the imposition of a new timeline for the implementation of SIS II."
"Mr President, I wanted to say that Mrs Roure is the shadow rapporteur for this report."
"She could not be here today and so I am speaking on her behalf and on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"I share the comments made by the rapporteur, whom I thank for his work."
"This situation is in fact totally unacceptable."
"The launch of SIS II is considerably behind schedule."
"We have already had to extend the Commission's mandate once until the end of December 2008 to carry out the migration."
"The Commission has again fallen way behind schedule and is now asking for an unlimited extension of its mandate to carry out the migration."
"This seems unacceptable to me, as any future consultation of the European Parliament on this issue would then be impossible."
"However, we do not want the migration of SIS to SIS II to be rushed, since this would impact on the quality and security of the data and of the system as a whole."
"Consequently, every precaution must be taken to ensure that data is protected and that the system is secure."
"This is why we could agree to moving the calendar back and extending the Commission's mandate to carry out the migration properly."
"However, there is no way that this process can continue without democratic scrutiny by the European Parliament."
"This is why the PSE Group supports the rapporteur, in order to safeguard the powers of the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would also like to extend my recognition to the rapporteur of his very good work."
"The Schengen Information System is the largest common European database which operates as a joint information system for the Member States."
"This information can be used by the police and the judiciary when cooperating on criminal matters, as well as for checking individuals at external frontiers or on national territories, and also for issuing visas and residence permits."
"The decision to create the second generation of the SIS - SIS II - took account of the need to introduce biometric data and new types of alerts, for instance because of the European arrest warrant."
"SIS II is also needed to bring on board the new Member States, as we have heard."
"The new system was originally scheduled to begin operating in March 2007."
"We know there have been many delays, and a new timetable was announced providing for it to become operational by the end of this year."
"And, thanks to the transitional solution presented by the Portuguese Government and also mentioned here by Minister Jouyet, the so-called 'SIS One 4 All', it is now fully operational and it has allowed nine of the new Member Sates to be connected to the SIS."
"Nevertheless, as underlined by Commissioner Barrot, in this enlarged Schengen area, the reinforcement of security requirements has become even more urgent and can only be fully achieved by a full transition to the next generation of a system."
"A must for this transition is that SIS II meets all the legally-defined technical and functional requirements, as well as other requirements such as robustness, response capacity and performance."
"Parliament is now asked to give its opinion on the two current proposals aiming to establish the legal framework governing the transition."
"As the ALDE shadow rapporteur, I fully support the line taken by the rapporteur, notably that the Commission shall submit by the end of June 2009, and then by the end of every six-month period, a progress report to the Council and to Parliament concerning the development of SIS II and also concerning the migration from the Schengen Information System to the SIS I+ to the second generation SIS II."
"It has been extremely disappointing to face the fact that SIS II is not yet operational."
"With this new mandate and the rigorous testing that will take place, I hope that SIS II is finally on track to a successful launch by September 2009."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like first of all to thank Mr Coelho for his customary productive work on the reports concerning transition to SIS II."
"The reports cover mainly technical things, but I would like to look at SIS II from a broader perspective."
"Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the Portuguese presidency provided an opportunity for the 10 new Member States to join the old version of SIS."
"Otherwise, the new Member States, including my own, would have had to wait at least until September 2009 - in other words, almost two more years."
"On the other hand, 'late' does not necessarily mean 'bad'."
"SIS II will operate under two pillars."
"Nevertheless, we still do not have a legally binding framework decision on data protection within the third pillar."
"As SIS II introduces the processing of biometric data, the issue of data protection remains largely unresolved."
"I would like to stress that my political group is extremely cautious where biometrics is concerned."
"Maybe we really have to wait for a solid legal background for data protection before we start using SIS II."
"Another field where the operation of SIS might be useful is the entry bans introduced by the Member States for third-country nationals."
"According to the Schengen Convention, national law is applicable when a person seeks the deletion of an alert concerning him or her."
"In this respect, the regulation on SIS II provides for better procedural guarantees at European level."
"To sum up, in some fields SIS II gives us a better Europe."
"Nevertheless, we will have to continue working on various significant flaws."
"If we have to wait in order to get more guarantees, perhaps we should be prepared to wait."
"As various organisations that follow the process of communitarisation of justice and home affairs, areas at the very core of States' sovereignty, have emphasised, with the 'migration' of the Schengen Information System to its second version, the characteristics of this information system and database have been extended with the inclusion of new types of alerts, such as the European arrest warrant, the addition of new data categories, such as biometric data, and access being given to new entities."
"New characteristics and functionalities have also been developed that interlink alerts and connect the system to the visa information system."
"It is also worth mentioning the worrying possibility that records may be kept, where necessary, for a long period of time, yet I wonder who will decide when this is necessary."
"Clarification is also needed on the all too vague area of the possible exchange of data with third countries."
"It is our belief that this extension compared to the previous system brings with it risks as regards safeguarding citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees by adding new elements to a database which will be more accessible and which will mean a greater degree of information sharing."
"Basically, much more than responding to the enlargement to new countries, there is an attempt to adapt SIS to the dangerous preoccupation with security that is part of the increasing communitarisation of home affairs in the European Union, which we reject."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, the subject we are now debating is of much greater importance than others that are regularly debated in this Chamber."
"We are discussing something as fundamental as the mobility of people within the so-called Schengen area."
"There is no doubt that this system eases travel for many individuals, but the downside of the system, it has to be said, overshadows its positive aspects."
"I am referring to the fact that Schengen also results in the mobility of huge numbers of people being restricted because of social systems. Schengen is a further step towards the creation of a superstate, Fortress Europe."
"The creation of a society of control with immense powers. I do not wish to contribute to that."
"There is indeed no doubt that cross-border crime is one of the greatest problems we are faced with today."
"Hence there is a need for cross-border solutions."
"However, I do not believe that Schengen, or the EU for that matter, is the right forum for the purpose."
"There is already Interpol, an excellent and efficient international police body in which sovereign states throughout the world participate."
"Instead of building up parallel systems, more should be done to strengthen Interpol."
"We know that criminality is not limited to our continent, but consists of worldwide networks."
"These were a few points of a general nature; now for the more specific ones."
"One aspect, which in my opinion is treated all too lightly when it comes to the Schengen information systems, is the question of confidentiality."
"The personal data which will be processed and stored are of a highly sensitive nature."
"One of the most important tasks for the State is to provide its citizens with full safeguards against unauthorised access to personal data."
"Hence I see this as a national matter, since it is my firm opinion that the EU is in no position to provide the safeguards required."
"Besides, I consider it unnecessary and costly to establish new structures."
"After all, it is taxpayers' money which has to finance the system."
"I have long been of the opinion that the development of the EU, or European integration as some like to call it, can be compared to the growth of tyranny by small steps."
"Frighteningly enough, the steps are no longer particularly small."
"Instead we are witnessing large, determined and rapid strides towards the creation of an EU State."
"No true Europhile should accept that."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, we are once again discussing the Schengen Information System (SIS) which is the main tool for the application of the Schengen principles."
"It is undoubtedly the backbone of a 'borderless' Europe and the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice and therefore it is essential that SIS II should begin to operate."
"At the present time, the SISone4ALL system is fully operational as a transitional technical solution, allowing the nine new Member States to be connected to the SIS and of course, through accession to the Schengen area, to become full members of the Union."
"The date of 21 December 2007 was a great day in the history of my country, Slovakia, and of the entire EU."
"It marked the real fall of the iron curtain."
"This is why I should like to thank Carlos Coelho for producing this report and for the tremendous efforts he has made."
"I am convinced that, but for him, the Schengen area would not have nine new members today."
"I believe that the new generation SIS will also manage to operate equally quickly and without any problems."
"Thank you very much to all of the speakers for an excellent debate and for the wide support for the principle of the new mandate, as well as the position of the rapporteur, expressed by various speakers."
"Mr Marinescu, I have praised the excellent work of the Portuguese Presidency, which has allowed new Member States to join the system."
"I have made a note that Romania wants to join the system as soon as possible under the supervision of the Commission, subject to any technical adjustments that might be necessary in this regard."
"Concerning the observations made by Mrs LefranÃ§ois and Mr Lax, the Council can only apologise for the delay, but we all recognise the efforts made by the Commission, the personal pledge from Vice-President Barrot to get things back on track and the strict measures imposed on the contractor."
"The Council will also remain vigilant alongside the Commission and all the Member States, who will remain strongly committed to completing the project, as planned, by ensuring that it is both technically feasible and effective, as well as guaranteeing citizens' freedoms, of course."
"In answer to Mrs Å½danoka and Mr Guerreiro, I understand - and Mrs LefranÃ§ois underlined this - that several of you would like a further discussion on incorporating new functions into the system, but it is vital that we complete SIS II before we allow these."
"Therefore, I believe that it would be natural for there to be a political debate on what these new functions should be. However, as several of you have pointed out, this should not hinder the launch of the new system."
"In fact, it would be unacceptable to abandon these functions for the sole reason that an obsolete system - in this case SIS I - could not accommodate them."
"First of all, before we have this debate, it is essential that we have the system and that the technological development is completed."
"In terms of the other speeches, which were mainly concerned with data protection, I would like to point out - as the President did, and we took part in this morning's debate on personal data protection with Commissioner Barrot - that we effectively want to continue the work undertaken at European level, and that we believe that the guarantees you requested, in terms of protecting this data and sharing information with third countries, must be in place."
"Without returning to the general debate that we had this morning, I would just like to say that, in terms of the protection of this data, it was agreed that we would follow the recommendations of the European Data Protection Supervisor so that these concerns are taken into account."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank all of the speakers and the rapporteur once again."
"To follow up on what Mr Jouyet said, I would also like to remind everyone that we are very mindful of compliance with data protection rules."
"As you said, President-in-Office, the services are in regular contact with those of the European Data Protection Supervisor to ensure that these rules are properly integrated into the development and management of SIS II."
"A visit to Strasbourg by the European Data Protection Supervisor is planned in the first half of 2009, before the migration takes place, to ensure that data protection is secure."
"The converter, which is in the process of being developed, will also enable secure data transfer from SIS I to SIS II."
"Mrs LefranÃ§ois quite rightly said that this migration should not be rushed, and she is right."
"We need to be very careful."
"In any case, the legal instruments contain specific provisions aimed at ensuring compliance with the principles of data protection."
"That is all I can say about data protection, bearing in mind that we need to pay close attention to ensuring that this system is consistent with what we are trying to achieve elsewhere in Europe in terms of data protection."
"Now, going back to the matter of the delay: I completely understand Mr Marinescu, Mr Lax and Mrs LefranÃ§ois, who clearly expressed their concern following the series of delays that we have had."
"As for SIS II preparations at central level, we are keeping a close watch on progress, we have introduced measures that will help us monitor things closely and the Commission's services will specifically see to it that there are enough resources to follow up on the work of contractors."
"Evidently, if necessary we can resort to the penalties provided for in the contracts, as my predecessor did by imposing a fine of more than EUR 1 million on one of the contractors."
"However, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rather than resort to penalties, I would prefer to see contractors working efficiently and keeping to our timetable."
"Nevertheless, the implementation of SIS II does not just concern the central SIS II."
"Clearly we also need a considerable effort from the Member States."
"I am glad that the French Presidency is here today, because I know how committed it is to this."
"To assist the Member States in their preparations at national level, the Friends of SIS II, established by the Slovenian Presidency and recognised by the French Presidency, is extremely useful."
"This high-level group, in which the Commission is actively involved, has the task of monitoring the implementation of SIS II in the Member States."
"It is only through solid cooperation that we will succeed in overcoming the problem."
"I would just like to say that we are not trying to turn Europe into a fortress with SIS III; we are simply trying to make sure that the removal of internal borders does not mean a greater risk of uncertainty, violence and terrorism for the European Union and for European citizens."
"Therefore, I cannot allow it to be said that by creating SIS II we are closing the doors to Europe."
"It is not a question of that."
"It is simply a case of ensuring that, having removed our internal borders, we can offer European citizens a space - yes, I will say it - a space of security and freedom."
"That is all, Mr President."
"In any case, I would like to thank the European Parliament and Mr Coehlo personally for investing so much in the construction of SIS II, which again is key to the success of Schengen."
"Mr President, I am taking the risk of making my final comments in French in response to the courteous remarks made by Mr Jouyet and Vice-President Barrot."
"Therefore, I am now going to thank you in your own language."
"It has not been easy to reach a consensus within the Council, but you have succeeded."
"For us, two things are truly important: a clear division of competences between the Commission and the Member States, and the issue of the Commission's mandate."
"The Commission's mandate cannot end until SIS II is working properly."
"I would also like to thank the Council, the Commission and all political groups in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their work on drafting the amendments that we will vote on tomorrow."
"For us, the transparency clause is crucial: citizens have the right to be kept informed about Schengen and SIS II."
"As for the question of the Commission's mandate, an unlimited mandate is unacceptable."
"However, we have managed to address that problem."
"To finish, Mr President, I would like to explain why we like SIS II to those who have spoken rather negatively about the system."
"We like SIS II because we like freedom of movement in Europe."
"However, for there to be freedom of movement in Europe, we have to be sure that our external borders are secure."
"The security of our external borders is a condition of the freedom of European citizens, and that is why we urgently need SIS II."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006 - International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006 (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Caroline Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006 (11964/2007 - C6-0326/2007 -, and"
"the oral question - B6-0458/2008) to the Commission on the International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006, by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, let me start by thanking all of my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade and in the Committee on Legal Affairs for their excellent cooperation on my report on the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) 2006."
"The wide political consensus we found is very reassuring, given the extreme importance of the issue of forests, timber and trade."
"You may note that almost a year has elapsed between the referral of this agreement to Parliament and this debate this evening."
"That definitely does not represent any underestimate on the part of the Committee on International Trade as to the importance of this issue; rather it stems from our view that the agreement requires parliamentary assent rather than simple consultation, not least because we have some strong and specific views on the agreement which we believe should be taken into account."
"The chairman of the Trade Committee, Mr Markov, will explain further the detailed procedural efforts we made to get a greater role for Parliament on this file and he will also, I am sure, outline the very disappointing response we had from the Council in terms of delay and ultimate refusal."
"I said that Parliament has some strong and specific views on the agreement."
"Without doubt it does represent an improvement on the older ITTA agreement of 20 years ago which, although it was billed as an agreement promoting both trade and sustainability, is in reality very much about trade and not very much about sustainability."
"Maybe that explains why one of the key signatories to the agreement, Indonesia, has irrevocably lost about three quarters of its forests and why half of all logging in regions like the Amazon, the Congo Basin, South-East Asia, is still done illegally."
"So, while the new agreement is an improvement on the former one, and we therefore offer support to the Community's ratification of it, this should be understood as very much a reluctant endorsement of an unsatisfactory agreement."
"ITTA 2006 falls well short of what is required to address the problem of the loss of tropical forests."
"For example, it still defines as its objective the promotion of the expansion of international trade, before moving on to speak in just a few words about sustainability."
"Again, if you look at the voting structure of the organisation behind the agreement, it gives more votes to producer countries that export more timber, and awards more votes to import-heavy consumer countries."
"In other words, for all the rhetoric about sustainability, the system is still designed to give greatest influence to those who trade the most."
"So our report calls on the Commission to begin already to prepare for the next round of ITTA negotiations to secure a greatly improved successor agreement."
"Parliament's assent to any future agreement will depend on a radical change in the underlying objectives of the agreement towards the protection and sustainable management of tropical forests, with trade in tropical timber taking place only to the extent that it is consistent with that objective."
"That means that the Commission should propose appropriate financing mechanisms for countries that are willing to limit their timber exports, as well as proposing a major reorganisation of the ITTA voting system."
"But we also have another demand to make of the Commission, and that is to do with the long-awaited legislative proposal on further measures to combat illegal logging."
"We absolutely have to see this without delay."
"It was under preparation at the start of the year, it was supposed to have been voted on by the Commission in May and has been repeatedly delayed due, we understand, to industry pressure."
"This is despite numerous expressions of wide political support from Parliament for the proposal."
"The last information we have is that the proposal is to be voted by the college of Commissioners on 15 October - I would be grateful for any confirmation of that - and I would call very strongly on our Commissioners to take their responsibilities very seriously, because this issue of deforestation is a massively important one; it is one that concerns the whole Parliament."
"I look forward to a very strong and optimistic response from the Commission today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that today we have the opportunity of discussing the International Tropical Timber Agreement."
"Protection and sustainable management of tropical forests is becoming increasingly important in view of the need to fight climate change, maintain biodiversity and protect the rights of indigenous populations."
"Accordingly, there is broad support in the Committee on International Trade for the concept of an international agreement."
"Nevertheless, as our rapporteur Mrs Lucas has already said - and I should like to thank her very warmly at this point for her wonderful report - there is some doubt as to whether this agreement will indeed be sufficient to tackle the problem of deforestation seriously."
"Thirteen million hectares of tropical forest are disappearing every year owing to logging, and approximately 20% of greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to this."
"The reason that virtually a whole year has elapsed between the referral of the text to Parliament and today's discussion on the agreement in plenary is by no means that the Committee on International Trade wanted to delay this debate or failed to attach sufficient importance to the problem."
"Instead, the reason was that, in our opinion, or rather the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs in particular, this agreement requires Parliament's assent and not just that of a consultation procedure."
"At this point I should like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, and the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, for their clear and rapid legal advice regarding the legal basis."
"In the light of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, President PÃ¶ttering wrote to the Secretary-General of the Council in January and explained that, in our view, this agreement establishes a specific institutional framework and therefore requires Parliament's assent under Article 300(3)(2) of the EC Treaty."
"Regrettably, the Council did not reply to this letter until 23 May 2008."
"The reply - four whole paragraphs - did not contain any kind of legal argument or any other grounds for rejecting Parliament's request."
"It was in this context that the Committee on International Trade adopted the report by Mrs Lucas, the present oral question and the corresponding resolution we are debating here."
"I should therefore like to highlight not only the significance of the agreement itself and of the fight against climate change, but also the issue of Parliament's rights and prerogatives."
"The current Treaties grant scarcely any major competences to Parliament in the area of international trade agreements, with the exception of those agreements falling under Article 300(3)(2)."
"The establishment of a specific institutional framework such as this is the most frequent basis for application of this Treaty provision, and it also provides the justification for applying the assent procedure when concluding Economic Partnership Agreements between the EU and the ACP countries and possible agreements with Korea or India and South-East Asia - which, in turn, is of particular importance in the fight against deforestation."
"Why is the application of the assent procedure so important to us?"
"What we are concerned with is conducting parliamentary discussion and carrying out scrutiny on behalf of the citizens of Europe and thereby conferring greater legitimacy and public recognition on agreements."
"Indeed, it is thus also in the interest of the Council and the Commission to include Parliament as co-legislator in this."
"In the light of the public interest in the preservation of biodiversity and in fighting climate change, I hope that the Commission will now at least comply with our request to present annual reports on the implementation of the International Tropical Timber Agreement and on its interaction with bilateral agreements."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me first of all to thank Mrs Lucas for her report, which draws attention to the overwhelming need to face up to the problem of the destruction of tropical forests."
"Despite its imperfections, the agreement signed in 2006 is an important step in this direction and its entry into force can only further the cause that you quite rightly defend in your report."
"This agreement has a much greater environmental and social bias than its 1994 predecessor."
"It is clear that the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) cannot put an end to over-exploitation and illegal logging on its own, since the main reasons for these often come from outside the forestry sector."
"For example, these might be the permanent or temporary replacement of forests by farmland, the relatively low profitability of forest maintenance compared with other land use and, quite simply, poverty."
"In this difficult context, this organisation has become one of the major players taking practical measures aimed at improving the sustainable management of tropical forests."
"It therefore deserves the attention and support of the Community."
"In terms of the legal basis for this agreement, the Commission has conducted an analysis of the issue and has arrived at the conclusion, supported by the Council and Member States, that it should maintain its original proposal."
"The priority today is to finalise the procedure for the entry into force of the new International Tropical Timber Agreement in 2009."
"Rather than repeat the legal arguments underpinning this decision, I think that it would be more useful to address the other issues raised in your report and to answer the related oral question from Mr Markov."
"I would just like to say that there is no formal link between the International Tropical Timber Agreement and other agreements such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) bilateral agreements."
"In fact, these agreements are very different in terms of their signatories, content, scope and organisation."
"The interaction between these different agreements is based on the extent to which the developments achieved as part of this process fuel the debates and initiatives that are taking place elsewhere, as well as the ability of the various processes to generate synergy."
"Within the framework of all of these agreements, the European Union is pursuing its main objective of capitalising on the enormous contribution that trade can make to sustainable development: for example by ensuring support for multilateral agreements and national legislation on the environment."
"The Commission is of course ready to report to the Council and Parliament on the activities of the ITTO, but I would still like to draw your attention to the fact that this organisation publishes its own annual reports."
"Therefore, we can consult these, and the Commission is prepared, if necessary, to provide additional information."
"As for the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), the Council regulation already stipulates that the Commission must present an annual report on the functioning of the licence system."
"This is all the information I can give you."
"Since Commissioner Michel is away and could not be with us this evening, despite members of his staff being here, I am personally authorised to forward any comments and observations resulting from this interesting debate to him, at a time when we are pondering the development of a number of countries, particularly African countries."
"Therefore, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the House and to Mrs Lucas and Mr Markov for all their hard work."
"I will now listen carefully to the comments from the various speakers."
"Mr President, the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, Mr Markov, referred to the legal aspects of the matter we are discussing when standing in for Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou and speaking on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"As you know, at the sitting on 19 December 2007, the committee in question gave its opinion on the legal basis of the motion for a Council resolution."
"This resolution was taken on behalf of the European Community with regard to the conclusion of the 2006 International Tropical Timber Agreement, tabled by the Commission."
"The proposed legal basis comprises Articles 133 and 175 in conjunction with the first subparagraph of Article 300(2), and the first subparagraph of Article 300(3) of the EC Treaty."
"The European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs decided to propose a change to the legal basis, so that a reference would be made to the second subparagraph of Article 300(3)."
"This requires the assent of the European Parliament rather than simple consultation."
"The Commission responded differently and is continuing with the legal basis that it proposed."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs justifies the decision to change to the legal basis."
"This is a case of an international agreement creating a special institutional framework through the organisation of procedures for cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, timber is a valuable building material; it is healthy, practical, perhaps a bit lacking in fire resistance, but increasingly sought-after."
"In brief, it is a sought-after and attractive commodity, and often a country's main export product."
"Tropical wood - that is, wood that is restricted to a narrow geographic band - is even more attractive and is the subject of trade that is often illegal and destructive to forests and to the entire ecosystem."
"We are, then, faced with a dilemma: on the one hand we need timber, we have a need for building materials, while on the other hand we need to protect the tropical forests."
"If exploitation is no longer under good and rational control, this will end not only in environmental disaster, but also in demographic disaster."
"Without forests there will be no other vegetation, no animals and no people there."
"International agreements are needed, but an awareness of rational timber management probably takes priority here."
"If such rationality does not prevail, we will destroy an important element of the irreplaceable natural world."
"We will be destroyers instead of wise managers."
"To sum up, then, I support the extension of the agreement (bearing in mind the possibility of continuing to improve it), which, albeit only partially, regulates free and just - or 'fair' - trade in such timber and may at the same time be a model for the exploitation of timber from other regions - from Siberia, Commissioner, about which we hear so little these days, from the Amazon, about which we hear a little more, and from other vulnerable regions of the world."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, let me say at the very start of this debate that the Socialist Group congratulates Caroline Lucas on her report, truly supports it and will vote for all the amendments that she proposes in her report."
"I welcome the fact that the revised International Tropical Timber Agreement places a greater emphasis on sustainable management - for example by tackling illegal logging - and on the restoration and conservation of degraded forests."
"As others have said, the preservation of tropical forests is vital in maintaining biodiversity and in our fight against climate change because, as we now know very well, tropical forests play a central role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere."
"Currently the felling of these forests is responsible for 20% of global carbon emissions."
"I share Caroline Lucas's objective in trying to ensure that the revised agreement does in reality give priority to social and environmental issues rather than solely focusing on increasing trade in tropical timber."
"Of course, developing countries must have the resources to protect, restore and sustainably manage the forests."
"The agreement makes a provision for funding based on thematic programmes, in addition to project funding."
"I hope that the thematic programmes can focus on issues such as governance and poverty reduction, and that Member States can contribute generously to these programmes."
"I share the disappointment that both Caroline and Helmuth Markov have expressed regarding the fact that Parliament has not been granted the assent procedure on this agreement, and I share the view that we should have been given that procedure."
"I hope that we can count on the Commission to submit to Parliament an annual report analysing - and 'analysing' is the key word - the implementation of the agreement."
"I understand what the Commission has told us tonight, that the International Tropical Timber Organisation publishes its own annual report, but we want to hear the Commission's response to that document."
"On the subject of bilateral agreements, earlier this month the EU signed an agreement with Ghana to prevent the import of illegal timber into EU markets."
"This agreement will in theory ensure that the basic rules of forest conservation, such as sound monitoring by government of timber felling, are respected - and at present, we have to note, the Ghanaian forests are being felled at an annual rate of almost 2%."
"If this bilateral agreement works, it can bring benefits to both parties."
"In Ghana, where illegal logging has reduced the rainforest by up to 25% of its original size in under 50 years, the agreement will help to secure the future of its timber industry - its fourth most profitable industry."
"In the European Union, where consumers are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious, we can ensure that the timber we import from Ghana is fully certified as clean."
"Although this deal may take a few years yet to become fully operational, I think it is a promising start, and I support the Commission's plans to reach similar agreements with other African countries, such as Gabon, Cameroon and Liberia."
"Finally, I want to reiterate a point made by Caroline: this agreement is a modest start; it is better than nothing, but it does not go far enough, and we need further proposals from the Commission and from the international community."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the conclusions of her report, which I fully endorse."
"After more than 20 years of tropical timber agreements, their impact on the sustainable management of tropical forests seems limited."
"The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that between 2000 and 2005 alone, tropical deforestation rates increased by 8.5% when compared to the 1990 levels."
"It is a pity that parliamentarians and civil society are not more involved in the design of such agreements, in order to balance trade interests and push for a more sustainable management of tropical forests."
"But, however effective it may be, an agreement has to be part of a more general approach, where every region acknowledges its responsibility and takes firm action to stop forest devastation."
"In Europe we might think that we have effective mechanisms to protect biodiversity and the consumer, but reality proves us wrong."
"Large volumes of illegal timber and timber products arrive in EU ports every day."
"Once the illegal timber has penetrated the market of one Member State it can easily be sold in any of the other 26 Member States without any further control of its legality."
"In this way, European consumers buying, in good faith, furniture or construction materials from supposedly legal sources, instead become unwitting accomplices to forest crimes."
"As a main importer and consumer of wood and having committed itself to halving deforestation as part of its plans to fight climate change, the EU has a responsibility in combating illegal logging and trade in illegally harvested timber products."
"If we really want to get serious about tackling deforestation and illegal logging, we should first sharpen up our act back home by enforcing European legislation that prevents the marketing of illegal timber and timber products in the EU."
"Regrettably, a legislative proposal in this sense has constantly been delayed, despite the EU resolution in July 2006 and the announcement made by the Commission work programme in October 2007."
"On the occasion of this debate, I would like to invite the Commission to clarify the reasons that led to the postponement of the publication of the forest package."
"Furthermore, I urge the Commission to present, without further delay, legislation which requires that only legally harvested timber and timber products are placed on the EU market."
"I am afraid too much time has been wasted already."
"At this point I call on the Commission to speed up the procedure to put forward this important piece of legislation, so as to allow a first reading before the end of this parliamentary term."
"We need to ensure that we are sending the right messages and that we are sending them on time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the conclusion of an International Tropical Timber Agreement is certainly a very significant step towards protecting tropical forests and making trade in certain species of timber more civilised."
"Procedural matters, however, should not blind us to our fundamental objectives."
"It may be important to establish a legal basis, it may be important whether this is a consultation or an assent procedure, but will this enable us to protect the tropical forests and to go further?"
"Every day thousands of hectares of forests, and not just tropical forests, die irretrievably."
"The land that remains turns into swamp or desert."
"Deforestation cannot be averted by new planting, at least not in the short term."
"The poor countries of Africa, America and Asia do not have the means to control excessive exploitation of the forests, to prevent it or to carry out rational management."
"This is also true of the Siberian forests."
"We do not protect trees and we have no respect for timber."
"The poorer the country, the more this is true."
"During the Cultural Revolution in China many square kilometres of forest were cut down."
"Timber is utilised as a primary source of energy."
"This is why the International Tropical Timber Organization has such an important part to play."
"Let us remember that technical progress and modern machines for felling and skidding trees are accelerating this process, and cheaper timber originating from illegal felling is attractive to traders."
"Every closed loophole in trade, every obstacle, certificates of origin and control will be another success."
"I hope that this agreement fulfils its role as soon as possible."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Lucas for an excellent report."
"We have established, and there is agreement all round, that the trade in tropical timber in the EU is a disgrace."
"As has also been said repeatedly this evening, we are tired of seeing only solemn declarations and no action."
"I hope that the Commission hears how many people are calling for it to take action to try to change things, so that the future will be a little brighter."
"Illegal timber is pouring into the EU, and this in itself is completely absurd."
"If it was any other product we would call it handling of stolen goods."
"Voluntary labelling schemes are a rather odd step."
"Unlawful acts should be prohibited, including in the EU; they should be curtailed not by means of labelling but by actual prohibition."
"I believe it will come as a surprise to most people that it is at all legal to buy illegal timber in the EU."
"Naturally, labelling is better than nothing."
"The extent of the control of large logging firms - some of the worst of which come from my own country, Denmark - over EU legislation, or lack of such legislation, is also grotesque."
"Therefore, I support the rapporteur's call for the Commissioner to now set about revising the international agreement, and we must also set to work at EU level."
"We badly need to introduce efficiency."
"Even if bad governance and corruption in timber-producing countries plays a significant role, we cannot ignore demand, as has also been said many times, because that is the most important factor."
"The EU must assume its responsibility as one of the world's largest timber importers."
"We need effective legislation that ensures that all timber products sold within the Community - including processed products - are both legal and sustainable."
"We can get started straight away with public procurement."
"Anything else would be inconceivable."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Mr President, the destruction of tropical forests continues unabated."
"Thirteen million hectares per year or one football pitch per second - that is the area of forest which is disappearing from the world each year."
"This is happening despite the fact that the first timber agreement came into being as long as 20 years ago."
"In 2006, the International Tropical Timber Agreement was signed."
"Although the agreement is general in its scope and leaves something to be desired, at least it provides a tool for us to tackle the problem."
"Mrs Lucas has drawn attention to this, and her much-needed amendments will give us a better means of protecting tropical forests."
"I would like to put a question directly to the Commission."
"Mrs Lucas said in her introduction that the entire European Parliament is waiting for legislation from the Commission to combat illegal logging."
"When shall we get this legislation on illegal logging?"
"Is it true that the Commission already voted on this matter in May this year?"
"Why then have we not got to see anything?"
"You did not touch on this in your speech, but we in Parliament want to know about it."
"What has happened to the legislative proposal?"
"Please give us an explanation."
"Otherwise I thank Mrs Lucas for highlighting the whole problem of trade in timber."
"Is it really reasonable that so much forest has to be cut down and the produce exported?"
"My own country, Sweden, is the EU's most densely forested country."
"At the same time we import one sixth of all the timber we consume."
"Why?"
"Obviously because it is very cheap to buy timber on the world market."
"Mrs Lucas wants to do something about this and asks the EU to support countries which adopt strategies to protect their tropical forests."
"Quite right, a very good proposal."
"Another measure which Mrs Lucas touched upon is to attach conditions to trade agreements and ensure that both European businesses and producers in the south have a responsibility to live up to, and that international conventions and agreements are observed."
"The idea is that international trade should be put to use - as a tool to promote sustainability and development throughout the world."
"Another dimension of deforestation which is too little debated is the meat industry."
"A large part of the meat and animal feed consumed in the world comes from land that was previously covered by forest."
"Meat production is one of the main causes of forest destruction in Amazonas."
"The Chairman of the United Nations Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri, recently called for a reduction in meat consumption."
"He is quite right in doing so."
"Here then is another question for the Commission: when will there be a strategy for reduced meat consumption?"
"As I mentioned earlier, Mrs Lucas is also right in most of what she says in her report."
"The European United Left Group therefore supports this excellent report."
"(PL) Mr President, the existing international agreements relating to tropical dendroflora are very clearly inadequate."
"The genetic resources of tropical forests are shrinking at an alarming rate through their excessive exploitation by man."
"There are two reasons for this."
"The most interesting species of tropical timber still have a market in wealthy countries."
"They are ever more efficiently sought out and felled."
"Meanwhile, the potential for farming them under managed forestry conditions is limited by the lack of nursery methods enabling them to be farmed. Seeds are usually non-dormant."
"In other words, they are not suited to storage and transportation."
"They sprout as soon as they have fallen from the tree."
"Special studies on these dying species are therefore needed in seed production, plant breeding and nursery management."
"People trading in such timber should be taxed to support such studies."
"A second reason is the excessive exploitation of tree cover, including bushes, by local people, who use them for firewood and to prepare food."
"This devastation cannot be halted without organising supplies of some other fuel for these people."
"(EL) Mr President, the conclusion of the 2006 International Tropical Timber Agreement is an extremely positive development."
"Furthermore, it reflects the consensus of 180 producer and consumer state governments and international organisations."
"There is no doubt, then, about the importance of the objectives set out in the agreement."
"We need only think of the harmful effects of illegal felling and deforestation, especially their contribution towards the greenhouse effect."
"It is therefore essential to back the national policies of the producer countries for the sustainable use and exploitation of tropical forests, and to strengthen their ability to implement forest legislation and effectively combat illegal felling."
"The matter of adequate funding to achieve the aims of the new agreement is of course crucial."
"We in the EU are called on to ensure that only lawfully felled tropical timber is imported and distributed on the European market."
"We must promote actions to inform and raise awareness among consumers."
"Let us, however, consider whether voluntary programmes are enough, or whether legally binding rules and specifications need to be enacted in respect of lawful trade in tropical timber."
"This objective must be pursued not only at international level, but also at the level of bilateral agreements covered by the FLEGT programme and the trade agreements under negotiation; in other words, free-trade agreements."
"The EU-Ghana Agreement is an example that points the way to bilateral cooperation."
"(PT) Mr President, this specific case is a clear instance in which concern about liberalising international trade should take second place to more important objectives, in this case of an environmental and social nature."
"The preservation of tropical forests is essential for maintaining the planet's ecological balance and we can state, without exaggeration, that, as such, tropical forests really are the heritage of mankind and that we all bear a responsibility for the conservation of tropical forests."
"The more developed and wealthiest countries in particular have responsibilities that they cannot shirk."
"These forests are located in countries that are in most cases poor countries, countries facing enormous difficulties, and whatever rhetoric we come up with here will be absolutely useless if we are not able to promote development actions directed at those countries."
"It is crucial that we help those countries and it is of the utmost necessity that the world's main consumers and most developed areas, as is clearly the case with the European Union, commit themselves to ensuring on the one hand that there are thorough control mechanisms for how these forests are used, but at the same time it is vital that those countries commit themselves to guaranteeing support for producer countries."
"Those countries depend on tropical forests and their economies are to a great extent linked to forests."
"Rapid deforestation will end up having dramatic consequences from all points of view - for us on a more global level, from an environmental point of view, but for them at a more tangible level, from an economic and social perspective and will even put their very survival on the line - and, therefore, everything that can de done has to start there."
"We have to lend support and we must have measures that encourage development and the transformation of the production structure in those countries, so that they may have a relationship with their forests, with their resources, that is better tailored to their interests and more in line with the global interests of humanity."
"This is a responsibility of the European Union."
"This agreement is heading in the right direction: it is still not enough but the report clearly points out these shortcomings, yet offers us some hope for the future."
"(FR) Mr President, tropical timber tonight, the financial crisis this week, major pandemics, migration, the food crisis... it all leads us to the same conclusion: the major political issues of today are global and require a global political response."
"Of course, in principle no one is contesting the permanent sovereignty of Indonesia over its tropical forests and its right to plant palm trees to produce palm oil, just as Brazil has the right to replace its forest with cattle, just like Gabon."
"However, it appears that the exercise of territorial sovereignty has negative consequences outside the sovereign territory."
"Deforestation, poverty, the threatened extinction of fauna and flora and cheap timber all cause damage on a global scale."
"Therefore, it is not a question of saying, 'people who harm others must make amends for the problems they cause.'"
"It is a question of addressing these issues at a legal level."
"How do we tackle this problem?"
"Where do we start?"
"In Europe, by labelling timber, certifying it as a sort of 'fair-trade' timber, in the same way as we do with fair-trade coffee, with bilateral trade agreements?"
"No doubt this is an essential first step, but the solution must be global."
"We need much more than a multilateral agreement on timber because people in the Communities, because Africans, Latinos and Asians, are also entitled to be rewarded for the various functions that they perform."
"This is why, Mr President, we need to look at these problems politically, at a global level, and find concepts and models to enable life on our planet to continue."
"Thank you for your transnational plea, Mr Martinez."
"(NL) Mr President, I too should like to thank Mrs Lucas and also Mr Zaleski sincerely for their efforts in bringing about this resolution."
"After all, regrettably, trade in illegally or unsustainably harvested timber is still taking place on a large scale in Europe."
"The European Commission's 2003 FLEGT Action Plan, specifically intended to prevent trading in illegally harvested timber in Europe, has had only a very limited effect."
"For this reason, it is regrettable that the European Commission has yet to present the new proposals."
"After all, misconduct on the part of importers still seems to pay, as action is hardly ever taken against the illegal trade and there are no sanctions."
"Responsibly minded timber importers therefore pay a high price, both literally and figuratively, for compliance with environmental and safety standards, since trade in the much cheaper illegal timber is still taking place on a large scale."
"The timber industry itself has already undertaken some sound initiatives, such as certification."
"We must underpin these with binding legislation, in accordance with the WTO framework."
"For this reason, I also advocate the recognition of existing certification systems that have been set up partly by the sector itself and partly by NGOs."
"What Mrs Lucas wants, namely the creation of a new European body too, would entail a great deal of red tape and is in our view unnecessary."
"Of course, measures must be taken locally in the regions to combat illegal logging, but we also expect the European Commission to present a proposal for the introduction of sanctions, which should also have a preventive effect on timber importers."
"After all, if we do not impose sanctions on businesses engaging in illegal trade, the danger is that this illegal behaviour will continue to pay, and that is what we must eliminate."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate rapporteur Lucas and all her colleagues for their work on this report."
"I believe that the International Agreement on Tropical Timber will contribute to the sustainable management of world forests, even if 80% of them have already been destroyed or damaged."
"We all know that forests are a haven for the preservation of biodiversity and that they play a crucial role in the fight against climate change."
"Low-priced timber and furniture imports done by virtue of voluntary agreements cause imbalances in the world market as well as the loss of employment both in the exporting and in the importing countries."
"Therefore, I would like to stress once again the need for legislative measures to protect tropical forests and other forests as well, and to prevent illegal timber."
"I welcome the revised agreement, and I rely on the Commission to forward an annual report on the evolution of this agreement."
"(HU) We can only stop climate change if we also stop deforestation."
"Our European endeavours to protect the environment will remain ineffective if we tolerate the destruction of the environment in other parts of the world."
"The liberalisation of international trade and globalisation stimulate destruction of the environment that spans the continents."
"The WTO's rules must be supplemented by stringent provisions on protecting the environment, otherwise further liberalisation will lead to even more destruction of the environment."
"Now it is not enough to ban illegal trade in wood: the importing of products and furniture manufactured from illegally lumbered wood must also be banned."
"Do people really think that importing cheap Chinese furniture has nothing to do with deforestation?"
"This report is a step in the right direction, but even more radical measures are needed because the state of our planet demands it of us."
"Until more stringent rules come into being, we must call on the big international furniture dealers like IKEA to use transparent restraint, and not to deal in furniture manufactured from illegal wood."
"Finally, deforestation stimulates not only trade in wood and furniture but also increases in agricultural prices and in demand for biofuels."
"If we allow trade in biofuels produced through deforestation, then we have to be aware that, every single time we fill our cars with such fuels, we have also contributed to the felling of a few square metres of rainforest."
"(CS) Mr President, the state of the tropical rain forests has been alarming for some years now and it is impossible to turn a blind eye to the unscrupulous plundering of this key component of our planet's biosphere."
"It is sad that legislation to combat illegal logging of tropical timber has come up against serious obstacles in Europe, while every year 13 million hectares of ancient forest are said to be lost, which of course contributes greatly to the increase in CO2 emissions."
"I fully support the call for environmental protection requirements to be included in the European Union's common trade policy."
"I am very pleased that Mrs Lucas's report also places emphasis on the dissemination of information on the catastrophic consequences of deforestation."
"This type of agreement should be ratified by Parliament and it is important that we discuss the Commission's report on the implementation of this international agreement and the state of deforestation every year here on the floor of the European Parliament."
"Unfortunately, we are too late to avert or stop climate change, but it is our responsibility at least to put a brake on it."
"This agreement, although not enough, is a step in the right direction."
"(PL) Despite its addiction to environmental protection slogans, the united Europe appears to be ignoring the growing problem of the disappearance of primary forests, the main reason for which is rapacious forest management to meet the demands of the tropical timber trade."
"Almost 80% of the total area of such forests has so far fallen victim to deforestation."
"The EU must increase the financial assistance it gives to producer states in order to prevent illegal felling and to promote sustainable forest management."
"Another positively good idea is to introduce timber certification for the European market."
"According to official statistics, timber imports into the EU constitute a small percentage of total production, but let us not forget, meanwhile, the enormous amounts of timber imported into Europe in processed form."
"The battle to maintain what is left of our primary forests is de facto a battle for the future for succeeding generations."
"Mr President, thank you to those members who have spoken."
"First of all, I would just like to remind everyone that the 2006 agreement aims to promote the expansion of international trade in tropical timber from forests that are sustainably managed and exploited legally and to encourage sustainable management of timber-producing tropical forests."
"I would also like to say that this is the only multilateral international instrument that places forests, particularly tropical forests, in a legally approved framework."
"This agreement also affects other forests indirectly, although this is less evident and more marginal."
"What is interesting is that the agreement establishes a framework of cooperation combining all forestry initiatives."
"Naturally the Commission intends to be an active participant in this agreement, with the Community contributing towards the administrative budget, and we would also like to finance large-scale measures through thematic programmes."
"However, this should not replace the bilateral agreements under the FLEGT programme - indeed quite the reverse."
"You were right to underline this."
"In these bilateral agreements, which will increasingly adopt a more global approach, we are introducing the concept of respect for tropical timber."
"It is true that the agreement that we have discussed tonight is a modest start - to quote someone here - but this should be the starting point for a much more effective strategy than in the past."
"In principle, the texts on illegal logging and the implementing regulation for FLEGT are planned for October."
"I believe that with these, the Commission may be able to satisfy the expectations that you have expressed here."
"Therefore, I would again like to thank Mrs Lucas, and of course I would like to thank the author of the question, Mr Markov."
"I will be sure to pass on all Parliament's comments and sensibilities to this problem, which, in fact, is a major issue, as each of you has pointed out."
"This is a crucial human legacy for the future."
"I loved the expression 'the cradle of biodiversity'."
"It is clear that our forests are cradles of diversity."
"The protection of our forests is a truly major initiative that concerns the future of the entire planet."
"I would like therefore to thank the European Parliament for being truly committed to this and I hope that, with the Commission, we can gradually meet everyone's expectations, having witnessed today how important and acute these are."
"I would again like to thank all members, and particularly your rapporteur."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues for their comments and support, but I do want to have a few words with Commissioner Barrot in particular."
"I hope you have heard the impatience and the frustration that has been expressed right across this House tonight about the endless delays to this long-awaited legislative proposal on measures to combat illegal logging."
"Please take back to your colleagues the fact that this Parliament believes that it is utterly unacceptable that that legislative proposal is constantly delayed."
"I am very sorry that you have not been able to answer a question that has been put to you at least three times by people here tonight about when we might expect that proposal."
"I think it plays very badly with the public as well."
"I think it looks very bad that the EU is unable to get its own house in order."
"We like to talk about the political leadership that we like to think that we have in the world."
"If that political leadership means anything, then it should mean that we stop the sale and the import of illegal timber into the EU, and we want to see much more urgent action to achieve that."
"While I have the floor, I would just like to raise one other issue."
"Many colleagues have mentioned the link between deforestation and climate change, and I would like to add a final point about the climate package that colleagues will be voting on in the coming weeks."
"You will know that deforestation is a key issue when it comes to the emissions trading system, and I want to urge colleagues not to be persuaded by arguments in favour of including so-called 'sink credits' in the emissions trading system."
"We held a lunchtime debate about this today in which we underlined why putting deforestation into the emissions trading system is a bad idea for a host of reasons, not least that it would swamp the whole emissions trading system."
"There are big problems around the verification, monitoring, reporting and liability regimes."
"We certainly do need to tackle deforestation as part of the climate package, but we are arguing that that should be done by using the auctioning revenues to properly invest in those countries that have that issue."
"Commissioner, please make autumn the moment when the EU really starts to get credible on forestry."
"Please assure us that you will bring forward that proposal as soon as possible."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Perhaps Mrs Lucas did not hear me."
"I thought that I had given a clear answer."
"I announced a text for October."
"Is it the interpretation?"
"Was I not clear enough?"
"I would like to clarify this."
"I am used to listening to Parliament."
"At the risk of repeating myself and incurring the wrath of the House, I did mention October just a few minutes ago."
"Right."
"October, that's next week, so a meeting next week then. Thank you."
"To conclude the debate, I have received a motion for a resolution on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) Nobody can any longer be in doubt that the clearance and destruction of forests has an impact on climate change and biodiversity."
"To be precise, deforestation now affects 13 million hectares worldwide and is the third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions."
"Illegal wood production causes erosion, undermines the subsistence of local communities and constitutes a loss of EUR 10-15 billion a year for wood-producing countries."
"I naturally welcome the creation of an international agreement on tropical timber, but even with this we are still nowhere near the target."
"We will get there if we manage to adopt a more comprehensive approach to forests in temperate zones, at least within the European Union; an approach that ensures both that wood products are manufactured in an honest way and also the traceability of the entire selling chain."
"Only such an agreement could make a real contribution to protecting forests and to the sustainable use of timber."
"Of course, I am under no illusions, especially since the statement that several of my colleagues and I wrote during spring and summer this year has been signed by a quarter of all MEPs."
"I trust that, sooner or later, the issue of tropical forests might turn attention to us, to Europe."
"Maybe, thanks to an agreement on tropical forests, the Commission will come forward with legislation stipulating that only wood and wood products that have been produced legally may be imported into the European Union."
"Proceedings before the Court of Justice (Amendment of Rule 121) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Costas Botopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of Rule 121 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, the draft report we are discussing today concerns the amendment to Rule 121 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament regarding proceedings before the European Court of Justice."
"As the Rule stands, it regulates such proceedings only in cases where the European Parliament brings an action before the Court."
"However, the text does not tell us what happens when Parliament decides to state its views through its representative, the President, by submitting observations or intervening in prejudicial proceedings."
"These proceedings serve to contest the validity of a legislative act that the European Parliament itself has approved within the framework of the co-decision procedure."
"A question has therefore been put by the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank for his help in preparing this report."
"He asks whether this procedure of intervention and submission of comments is covered by Rule 121, and if not, what we should do."
"The first answer I give in my report is that one procedure cannot be considered to be included in the other; that the word 'action', used in Rule 121, cannot be considered to include the qualitatively different case of submission of comments or intervention in Court."
"On this basis, the first answer is that we cannot proceed merely on the basis of interpretation."
"Can we stick to the Parliamentary practice whereby the decision in such cases lies with the President of Parliament, as our head and representative in court cases?"
"Once again, I think the answer is no."
"A more reliable course of action is to work out a new procedure in detail."
"Why, though, is this really so?"
"Because there have in practice been occasions when the President of Parliament has decided not to follow the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"This is when it is a matter of defending the validity of a prior decision of Parliament before the Court."
"This has happened twice in Parliament's recent history."
"We have grounds for saying that we should work out the procedure from scratch."
"What solution is proposed?"
"Following a recommendation by the Committee on Legal Affairs, the President, if he agrees, submits his comments."
"If he does not agree, he settles the matter after discussion in the Conference of Presidents."
"Why the Conference of Presidents?"
"Because it is a collective body that can reach decisions with due regard to the pros and cons in each case."
"Only in cases where the Conference of Presidents decides that, for exceptional reasons (revision of the Treaties, for example), Parliament should not protect its previous position, only in such cases is the matter referred to Plenary, because Plenary alone is in a position to amend a previous decision it has reached."
"Mr President, as rapporteur - of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that is - I wish to say that tonight we are discussing an issue that concerns the organisational autonomy and sovereignty of the European Parliament."
"The Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament form a regulatory nexus based on the long-term validity of individual provisions."
"By this, I do not mean provisions that are applicable pending an amendment, but those with regulatory durability and robustness."
"I shall not mention the more specific aspects of the dispute settlement procedure described in the text of the amendment - Mr Botopoulos has in any case covered this aspect accurately and thoroughly."
"The text of the amendment proposed by the rapporteur is the outcome of conciliation between the PPE-DE Group and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"The paragraph added to the existing text of Rule 121 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament deals with a potential difference of opinion between the President of Parliament and the Committee on Legal Affairs on a decision concerning submitting comments and interventions by Parliament during proceedings before the Court of Justice."
"Until now, there has not been a clear, explicit provision on such cases in the Rules of Procedure, and the amendment we are discussing serves to close this legal loophole and this regulatory gap in the internal workings of Parliament."
"(PT) Mr President, the European Parliament is represented before the Court by its President and, in controversial cases, the President first consults the plenary."
"This is what happens with proceedings."
"The new report extends this system to other procedural acts where the President represents Parliament and, in controversial situations, consults the plenary."
"Yet there is something new in the report in the way it brings in the Conference of Presidents as an intermediary decision-making body between the President and the plenary."
"This solution is not problematic in itself, yet it would be good to take this opportunity to stress that the European Parliament must never lose sight of the traditional parliamentary principle of concentrating all final decision-making power in the plenary."
"The plenary is sovereign in all things, as it embodies the legitimacy arising from the ethics of representation."
"It is true that institutions that govern complex and broad areas, as the European Parliament does, often cannot avoid the temptation to surround their own democratic power with red tape."
"This temptation is often impossible to avoid, yet the fact remains that we have to steer clear of wrapping democracy in too much red tape, as the efficacy of good governance must never mean losing the space for politics, still less abdicating space for politics to quasi-administrative forms such as committees and, sometimes, conferences."
"This is because, to borrow Mirabeau's expression, these are not a real 'cross-section of the population'."
"(CS) The amendment of the Rules of Procedure may appear to be just a technical matter, but in reality it involves strengthening or weakening their democratic legitimacy."
"The two precedents, in which the Presidents did not have to follow the recommendations of Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs, have revealed a gap in our Rules."
"I will support the amended version of Rule 121, which will ensure that in such cases the President shall submit the matter to the Conference of Presidents and then to plenary."
"However, I believe that the President should present and defend his position before the Committee on Legal Affairs rather than before the chairmen of the other committees."
"It is a pity that there is no mention in the amendment of the possibility of a group of Members suggesting a third alternative to plenary, or whether plenary only has the choice of accepting or rejecting the alternative submission by the President or the Conference of Presidents."
"We are dealing here with a new precedent, which will only be tested in the future."
"I do not think that this is about bureaucracy, but about democracy."
"(ES) Normally, when the opposing parliamentary group comes to the aid of the rapporteur, who is from another group, the rapporteur should be concerned."
"This is the night of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Four members of the PPE-DE Group speaking in the debate on the Botopoulos report!"
"What is most surprising, Mr President, is that we are here to applaud the proposal made by Mr Botopoulos, because we think that it is a good proposal, a consensus proposal, a proposal which, I can announce, will have the approval and political support of my Group."
"Parliamentary life is an expression of life in general, it is a life that changes, a life that we need to react to."
"Therefore, in response to an interpretation of the Rules of Procedure as to whether a specific article included the possibility of Parliament making observations in proceedings, Mr Botopoulos has clarified the issue by making a positive proposal, which is what life requires."
"Therefore, Mr President, my congratulations to this young MEP, for whom I predict great success in Parliament, and the support of my group, Mr President, for this reform."
"Mr President, may I first of all thank the speakers, and please allow me also to thank my fellow Members who helped me a great deal in this, my first report, which, as Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo said, will hopefully not be the last."
"I have some very brief comments on what has been said."
"Mr Papastamkos is right to say that the report is the outcome of conciliation, because that is what actually happened."
"However, it is the outcome of conciliation between political groups in the best sense of the term."
"In other words, it is not the lowest common denominator, but represents the common ground we have been able to agree on and what I think are more reasonable and democratic solutions."
"I believe this resolution is democratic precisely because it allows proceedings to develop in the most appropriate way."
"Mrs Esteves has quite rightly said that we should not make excessive use of plenary sittings."
"How true!"
"For this reason the logic here is that we should go to plenary only when absolutely necessary; in other words, only when it is necessary to amend a decision already taken by Parliament."
"Mrs RoithovÃ¡ also quite rightly pointed out that the role of the Committee on Legal Affairs is important; it is exercised in accordance with the way the regulation is formulated."
"In other words, the Committee on Legal Affairs is heard at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of proceedings."
"Let me say here, and I did not do so the first time, that when in exceptional cases the Committee on Legal Affairs does not have time to give an opinion, the President alone may reach a decision."
"However, in this case too, it is expressly stated, with an explanation, that the Committee on Legal Affairs should be allowed to submit its decision in whatever way it thinks fit. Thank you all very much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Decisions concerning certain documents: see Minutes"

"Statement by the President"
"It is with great sadness that we have learned of the dramatic events in Kauhajoki in the west of Finland, where 11 people have lost their lives in a very tragic incident at a school."
"A number of people were also seriously injured by the perpetrator, who then turned his gun on himself."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the families and all the relatives of the victims."
"All the victims were innocent young students at a vocational training school, where they were studying for careers in the service sector."
"This tragedy occurred less than one year after a similar appalling killing spree at Jokela High School."
"As we all know, Finland is regarded as one of the most peaceful and safest countries in Europe, so we can understand that the people of Finland are speechless with shock, and we share their distress."
"Unfortunately, we often see similar patterns repeated in these acts of bloodshed."
"In this instance, although the perpetrator posted threatening videos on the Internet before the killing spree, it was not possible to avert the tragedy."
"As responsible politicians in Europe and in all the Member States, we must do our utmost to ensure that such acts of violence are detected and prevented in time."
