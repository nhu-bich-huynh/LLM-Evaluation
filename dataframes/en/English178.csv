"I asked to speak because naturally enough I find it extremely dissatisfactory not to have my question answered."
"But, on a point of order, what I really want to be sure of is that I will be the recipient of the response."
"My name is not Kirsten Jensen."
"My name is Lis Jensen."
"I would like to appeal to the administration to make this change when sending me the written response."
"I cannot blame the administration for this mistake, because half of Denmark is actually called Jensen, but I find it unsatisfactory not to be able to receive a response today, because the actual question of the regulation on restraint of trade is of great interest to us in Denmark, not least in the run-up to the referendum coming up on 28 May."
"I find this extremely dissatisfactory and I feel the President is being inflexible here."
"Mrs Lis Jensen, I am sorry your question could not be answered but I have no control over the clock."
"I am its slave, just like you and the rest of the honourable Members."
"As regards your name, I have noted your comment, but I should point out that Parliament's services have already made the correction."
"So you can rest assured that if I had allowed anyone to speak it would have been Mrs Lis Jensen."
"Mr McMahon, you have the floor on a point of order."
"Mr McMahon, ladies and gentlemen, I would warn you all that spending time on points of order means there is less time left for questions to the Commission."
"You have your rights, but it is my duty to remind you of that."
"I should also point out to you all that Question Time is governed by rules, and when the clock shows that time is up, the President is obliged to go on to the next section of questions. It is not possible to change what has already been established."
"I apologize to Mrs Bonino for our having interrupted her interesting remarks."
"I also apologize to Mrs Flemming, but please understand that I am governed by the Rules of Procedure."
"You now have the floor for a supplementary question."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I am sure that the two previous speakers have just as much interest in the welfare of animals as I and that their points of order do not portray indifference to the well-being of animals."
"Directive 95/29 on the transport of animals lays down rules for the provision of food, water and rest-breaks when transporting different categories of livestock, and these regulations came into force on 1 January 1998."
"In addition, all Member States are committed to the setting-up of officially approved stopping places which comply with the requirements of the directive."
"The question which I would now like to ask you, Madam Commissioner, is this: can the Commission tell us here and now how many of these stopping places actually exist at this moment in time and whether veterinary inspectors - and I learn to my astonishment that you have 46 of them - are also actually checking that these establishments are being properly run, which is part of their function?"
"As I said to the honourable Member, every Member State has been inspected at least once and the results are available."
"We have discovered that some of the rules in the directive, which was implemented on 1 January 1998, are far from satisfactory."
"Problems have been found at the following sites: livestock markets of national importance, border inspection posts, ports where animals are transferred from lorries to vessels, slaughterhouses and so on."
"I can provide more details in writing."
"I would like to tell the honourable Member that I have two inspectors out of forty-six."
"There are emergencies such as BSE and classical swine fever and hygiene deficiencies in meat plants."
"There are also legal obligations arising from other directives such as third countries requesting approval for exporting fisheries or for exporting fresh meat to the European Union."
"I can make available to Members in writing all the obligations, emergencies, what we have done on animal welfare, what we have found and why the Commission itself is not satisfied with the situation."
"I am pleased to note that the Commissioner is not satisfied with the existing situation and I am grateful to her for being so honest and open with Parliament about the unsatisfactory nature of the current situation."
"I would like to put one further point to her."
"Another role of the veterinary inspectors is to monitor the export of trade of live cattle to third countries under the export refund scheme."
"Could the Commissioner say what instructions have been given to the team of inspectors regarding monitoring duties when cattle arrive in third countries?"
"Will any liaison be established with those animal welfare organizations which so far, apparently, are the only ones to have exposed the cruelty of this trade?"
"It is a serious point and some of the Commission's problems could be helped a little by closer collaboration with animal welfare organizations working in this area who, I am sure, would be only too grateful to assist."
"This is an exercise we are trying to conduct in an informal way."
"As you can imagine, the Commission can only have official relations with Member States authorities."
"On top of that, many third countries - even the groups you are referring to - are not very strong."
"So, we are faced with these two problems: firstly, the animal welfare groups are not very strong and, secondly, our formal counterparts are the Member States alone."
"Nevertheless, I hope that the organizations dealing with animal welfare in the European Union will forge closer links with their counterparts in third countries so that we can establish another form of contact between the people who have to implement the law."
"Mr President, Mrs Bonino, I should like to ask you a question, though admittedly you have answered most of it already: what is the situation in the countries of central and eastern Europe, particularly in Poland, where conditions are still pretty dreadful?"
"Is the Commission engaged in direct negotiations with these countries with a view to achieving a commitment that what they are exporting is treated as we would like to see it treated?"
"If this process does not work there from the start, then it may well not work for us either."
"I have already partly answered the question."
"In the larger process of negotiation and enlargement due to the acquis communautaire , evidently this rule will be taken care of."
"Of course, it is a long way ahead, so we need to find a quicker way of ensuring that the directive is implemented."
"Question No 46 by Robin Teverson (H-0281/98)"
"Subject: MAGP IV: Beam trawler length"
"The Commission has allowed the Dutch MAGP IV implementation plan some credit for complying with a change to the Dutch national regulations."
"A 1986 rule required that the maximum aggregate length of beams should be reduced."
"Priority under MAGP IV is for those Member States, like the Dutch, who failed to meet MAGP III targets, to remove the overhang from the previous programme by the end of 1998 and allowance for this change to the rules would make a significant contribution to the Dutch MAGP position."
"Does this mean that the Commission believes that technical conservation measures should be allowed to contribute to MAGP IV compliance, and have other Member States' fleets been similarly credited for national conservation measures?"
"This is a very technical question but I think it has a political more than a technical meaning."
"I think Mr Teverson wanted to know if technical measures have to be counted in the MAGP."
"I must be very clear."
"A reduction in beam lengths reduces efficiency rather than increasing selectivity, and, as such, would not be considered as a technical measure."
"I can confirm that technical measures cannot be taken into account for the achievement of the MAGP IV objectives, as their effects on fishing efforts are considered to be additional to those of the MAGP."
"No credit was given in terms of capacity for the reduction in beam length in the Dutch fleet."
"It was accepted that the reduction in beam length resulted in a decrease in the efficiency of the vessel."
"But it was noted that there was an increase in activity during the previous MAGPs, which compensated for any reduction in efficiency."
"I hope that is clear."
"Since this compensatory effect was recognized and calculated, account was taken of the reduction in beam length by reassessing the appropriate base-line level of activity for the MAGP for this part of the Dutch fishing fleet."
"There was then no net increase in the fishing efforts base line for MAGP IV."
"No Member State has therefore benefited from national compensation measures in the context of MAGPs."
"We understand that it decreased efficiency but they increased their activities, so the result was equal."
"For this reason, there was no compensation, and the technical measures cannot be taken into account for the calculation of MAGPs."
"I thank the Commissioner for that reply and although, as she says, it is a technical subject, it is more a question of the interpretation of how we fulfil MAGP requirements."
"I take it from that - although not necessarily agree with the point - that when technical measures mean selectivity they cannot be used towards MAGP targets."
"That is understood."
"However, from her reply it seems that somehow, even if it is a counter-compensation, measures that might be technical in nature, though not technical measures that reduce efficiency, could and therefore do have an effect on effort, and would actually then be seen as contributing towards MAGP targets."
"That seems to me what actually happened."
"The Commissioner mentioned that there was a trade-off in the Dutch fleet on beam length which was used as a compensation against increase in effort, which is within the MAGP target."
"That seems to suggest to me that we can use decrease in efficiency methods or physical methods to actually achieve MAGP targets."
"Is that true?"
"Maybe I was not clear."
"I must confirm that there are only three elements to calculate MAGP which have to reduce overcapacity as a first target."
"The three elements that are taken into account are activity, tonnage and power."
"The special case that you are referring to, because it was compensated was not in fact taken into account."
"They have to reduce the activity, in any case."
"This is the result of what I am saying."
"They reduced the length of the beam but they increased their activity."
"For us it was a non-starter."
"Our request is that they reduce their activities."
"Is that clear now?"
"Technical measures are additional but cannot be included in the calculation of MAGP IV."
"Question No 47 by Carmen Fraga Estévez (H-0286/98)"
"Subject: New Argentinean fisheries law"
"On 12 January 1998, Argentina adopted a new fisheries law which will come into effect three months after that date."
"Pursuant to various articles of that law (Article 4 et seq.), Argentina has assumed the right to regulate fishing outside its EEZ, which is clearly a breach of general international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. It also represents a further serious precedent in the wake of the 1994 Canadian fisheries law and that country's new draft law on the same subject, which is currently going through Parliament."
"What legal or other action is the Commission preparing in response to the threat which that law poses to international law and to the legitimate activities of sovereign states in international waters?"
"At the meetings held recently between the Commission and the Argentinean authorities, both before and after the adoption of the new fisheries law in that country, the Commission raised the points mentioned in the Member's query as points of great concern."
"The Commission also expressed its concern that several provisions of the new law, particularly those relating to the measures the Argentinean authorities can take with regard to transzonal stocks in the sector adjoining the economic area, are contrary to international law, and the Commission pointed out that, in particular, they are contrary to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"According to the Commission, conservation measures applicable to international waters, such as those provided for by the new law, can only be taken within the scope of regional or international organizations."
"The new Argentinean law on fisheries, as the Member knows, is now being considered by the Council, but at the same time the Commission has received the mandate to negotiate the creation of a regional conference or a regional area for the South Atlantic, if necessary, because the type of conservation measure proposed cannot be applied unilaterally."
"This is the Commission's formal interpretation of the UN Convention."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for her answer but I would like to ask a couple of specific questions."
"This question of the fisheries law is related to the notorious law on baselines for maritime zones, which gave rise to protest in its day."
"As you know, that law contravenes the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"A few months ago Argentina made an amendment, and I would like to know whether or not that amendment is in accordance with the UN Convention."
"My second question refers to something you mentioned: the famous South Atlantic Fisheries Organization."
"Mr Provan is here, and he produced a report on this subject some time ago. I would like to know what stage that project is at, and what Argentina's position is."
"I understand that since the fisheries law that country has displayed opposition to this international organization, the so-called SAFO."
"With regard to defining the borders of the area, the Commission is studying the first documents forwarded by Argentina on the establishment of those borders."
"It remains understood, however, that any amendment, accepted by the Commission or otherwise, should be communicated to the United Nations, which, in the cases, or at least in one case we are aware of, was not applied."
"So in answer to the first question, I can say that the Commission is studying the new definition of borders and may in the short term say whether the definition is consistent or not."
"With regard to the second question, the Council has just given us the mandate to negotiate and we are exploring Argentina's true intentions to determine how the new fisheries law could fall under the terms of this new mandate."
"Finally, I have to say that we have worked towards this negotiating mandate for a whole year, because the idea goes back to August 1995."
"I think the time has come to confirm the actual availability and the actual willingness of the Argentinean authorities."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fraga Estévez' question marks the end of the time allotted to this block of questions, so Questions Nos 48 to 52 will be dealt with in writing."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you often cannot help expressing your feelings but, as I said earlier, the clock is in charge here, not me."
"Question No 53 by Jens-Peter Bonde, which has been taken over by Mrs Lis Jensen (H-0276/98)"
"Subject: National compliance with social directives"
"Will the Commission guarantee that the Member States may comply with directives in the social field by transposing them as collective agreements, even where trade union representation is below 50 %?"
"Article 2(4) of the agreement on social policy provides that a Member State may entrust management and labour, at their joint request, with the implementation of directives adopted under the agreement."
"In such a case the Member State must ensure that no later than the date on which the directive must be transposed in accordance with Article 189 of the Treaty, management and labour have introduced the necessary measures by agreement."
"This is done in accordance with national law and practice, with the Member State concerned being required to take any necessary measures enabling it at any time to be in a position to guarantee the results imposed by the directive."
"This provision is similar to those already incorporated into several directives in the social field and, furthermore, this principle was already acknowledged in the case law of the European Court of Justice prior to the adoption of the social protocol to the Treaty."
"As a positive example of how the social partners have been associated with the implementation of directives, I would like to refer the honourable Member of Parliament to the agreement on the implementation measures concluded between the social partners' organizations in Denmark."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Flynn a slightly more specific question, if he would kindly expand on the response he has already given."
"A survey carried out by the School of Economics and Business Administration in Denmark shows that 50-60 % of employees in the private sector labour market have collective agreements."
"The question applies equally to conditions for those in a situation where no collective agreement has been drawn up between the parties to the labour market."
"How can implementation be assured for this remaining segment?"
"Unfortunately, the answer is not quite straightforward."
"According to the notification we have received in a specific instance in so far as the Danish authorities are concerned, the working time directive has been implemented by a combination of both statutory provisions and collective agreements."
"The services of the Commission are currently undertaking an examination of the implementation measures in the light of the detailed implementation of the directive under both headings."
"So we are talking about a global implementation report."
"We cannot do that just yet because six Member States have yet to notify us of the implementation measures."
"As soon as they do so the Commission will be able to proceed."
"The matter is delayed for that reason."
"Thank you for the information."
"The working time directive is precisely what the question is aimed at since, as the Commissioner points out, the situation is such that the Danish government has announced that a relatively large segment of private sector employees are not covered by any agreement and, thus, the working time directive is not in effect for approximately 40 % of private sector employees in the Danish labour market."
"The Commission has been informed of this, and although what the Commissioner states is obviously correct about no notification yet having been received from a number of other countries, it should nonetheless be possible for the Commission to take a stance on the issue and confirm that this level of implementation is not acceptable."
"These questions are of enormous fundamental importance in Denmark, where many of us believe conditions in the labour market should be regulated by means of collective agreements, but on the other hand we do not believe that the current level of implementation can be considered adequate when the Danish government has announced that approximately 40 % of private sector employees are not included in any agreement whatsoever and are therefore simply not covered."
"I would like the Commissioner to confirm that this level of implementation is inadequate."
"I think it must be underlined that different directives sometimes have different aims."
"That being said, some of them fall within the sole competence of the social partners, while others are regulating issues and would be the exclusive competence of public authorities."
"In other words you have to be quite careful how you analyse the context of the particular directive that is involved."
"We cannot take a decision until we have all the information available as to implementation."
"Unfortunately we do not have it yet, but I would like to think that if the Member States comply with what we seek from them and we get the information, we will have the implementing report early next year, at which time we will be able to give you a complete answer to the basic point you have raised."
"Thank you very much, Mr Flynn."
"As the author is not present, Question No 54 lapses."
"Question No 55 by Brian Simpson (H-0296/98)"
"Subject: ""Star' Alliance"
"Does the current ""Star' Alliance within the aviation sector fall within the scope of the European Works Council Directives?"
"If so, what action does the Commission intend to take?"
"If not, why not?"
"The 'Star' Alliance is essentially a marketing arrangement whereby the members of the alliance have agreed to promote the services of their alliance partners through code-sharing deals."
"Code-sharing enables an airline to market seats on a flight operated by the partner airline."
"The alliance does not involve any exchange of ownership or control between the members of the alliance."
"They continue to act as independent companies."
"The alliance therefore falls outside of the scope of the Works Council Directive."
"Some or all of the companies which are members of this alliance may themselves fall under the scope of the European Works Council Directive if they meet the relevant requirements."
"If this is the case, it is up to the individual company and its employees to develop the information and consultation mechanisms provided for them therein."
"The Commission has neither the power nor the wish to interfere in the way that the concerned parties define these mechanisms or apply them to particular situations within the context of the Works Council Directive."
"As a supplementary, I should like to ask the Commissioner if he is saying that, basically, if this 'Star' Alliance starts to diminish the working conditions and contracts within that particular alliance the Commission will not act?"
"I am particularly concerned about those members of the 'Star' Alliance from the Far East who seem to have lower conditions of pay and service compared to their partners in the EU."
"At this stage, the 'Star' Alliance comprises only the pooling of the frequent-flyer programmes - you probably know that - i.e. common use of some lounges, check-in facilities and a better scheduling coordination."
"The agreement is not binding and, in any case, it does not fall under Regulation 397/87 which applies to international transport outside the EU."
"If the matter changes, perhaps you might wish to come back to the question at a later date."
"Thank you very much, Mr Flynn."
"As the author is not present, Question No 56 lapses."
"Question No 57 by Bernd Posselt (H-0319/98)"
"Subject: Strengthening the family"
"In the light of the EU's latest demographic report and the alarming facts it contains, how does the Commission propose to strengthen the family as the basis of all effective social policy, and does it feel adequately supported in these endeavours by the Council and the Member States?"
"The Commission is aware of current demographic trends and what they indicate about changes in family structures."
"However, the European Commission has a limited competence in the area of policies on the family."
"Our actions are based on the conclusions of the Council of Ministers responsible for family matters that took place in September 1989."
"Since then the Commission has been active in promoting exchanges of information on family matters, monitoring measures taken for families in the Member States and financially supporting the promotion of family-friendly initiatives."
"The exchange of information between the Member States is done through a group of national senior officials responsible for family matters, meeting several times a year at the Commission's invitation."
"The next meeting will take place on 16 and 17 April."
"The monitoring of measures for families in the Member States is conducted by the European Observatory on National Family Policies that the Commission set up in 1989."
"A European network on family at work established by the Commission in 1994 has also been engaged in promoting family-friendly employment policies."
"Innovative projects, studies and networks in relation to family-friendly policies have received support from the Structural Funds, mainly under the NOW initiative and from the action programmes on equal opportunities."
"In the field of employment policy, all Member States have recognized the need for a substantially increased participation by women in the labour market and the 1998 employment guidelines state that Member States should translate their decision to promote equality of opportunity into increased employment rates for women."
"At the same time it is explicitly recognized that this must be accompanied by family-friendly policies for reconciling work and family life and policies facilitating the return to paid work after an absence."
"I would like to refer to the 1992 directive on pregnant workers, the 1996 directive on parental leave and the 1997 directive on part-time work in particular."
"They are the main elements of the legal framework at European level which reconciles family and working life."
"Parliament has been particularly supportive in its upholding of budget line B3-4108, that is measures in favour of family and children."
"Although it is quite modest, the budget line enables the Commission to cofinance the promotion of familyfriendly practices and measures as well as comparative studies between the Member States."
"Within the budget line's remit, the Commission performs demographic research analysis such as the demographic report which allows us to link demographic evolution and changing family patterns."
"Finally, the Commission's intention is to continue the analysis of demographic trends and deepen the debate on their implications."
"We are going to have a major European symposium on demographic change under the Austrian presidency."
"We will do that in the latter part of the year."
"Mr Commissioner, thank you for your detailed answer."
"I should just like to put two short questions to you."
"You spoke primarily of working women."
"I just wanted to ask if there were any studies or programmes - though particularly studies - which relate to the financial support of women or men, though it will mainly be the women who decide to devote themselves to raising children?"
"My second question is this: are there any studies or programmes which deal with the provision of old-age pensions for this particular group?"
"Briefly, some work has been done on that matter."
"Mostly it is done by national authorities but there is a certain element of coordination between what they do and what we are doing at Commission level."
"Perhaps there is a need to go a little further in establishing the points you have made."
"Thank you very much, Mr Flynn."
"Mr Posselt's question rounds off the time allocated to this series of questions."
"Questions Nos 58 to 62 will therefore be dealt with in writing."
"Question No 63 by Mark Watts (H-0033/98)"
"Subject: Proposed abolition of duty-free concessions in 1999"
"Is the Commission aware that the proposed abolition of duty-free sales in 1999 is estimated to result in the loss of 9 000 jobs in Kent in the United Kingdom, and a total loss of 140 000 jobs across the EU?"
"In the light of these independent forecasts, will it at least agree to a full study being carried out urgently to examine the social and economic impact that ending duty-free would cause?"
"Could it also elaborate on its proposals to cushion the impact of abolition?"
"In recent months, I have set out the Commission's position on duty-free sales within the Community on numerous occasions."
"In particular, I was able to explain this position at the public hearing held on 27 October 1997 and at the sitting in November 1997."
"Today, I am taking the opportunity given to me by Mr Watts to confirm that the position has not changed."
"The deadline agreed back in 1991 by the Council for all those involved in the duty-free sales sector to adapt to the requirements of the single market was an exceptional measure."
"This unanimous decision took financial concerns into account, which certain Members had expressed at the time."
"As things stand, the Commission has also stated very clearly that it has no intention of undertaking a study into the social and economic consequences the expiry of the transitional regulations agreed by the Council could entail, thereby establishing the definitive nature of its decision."
"I thank the Commissioner for his answer, but unfortunately he did not address the particular point regarding the proposals to ameliorate the impact of abolition which he put to the public hearing that he earlier referred to earlier."
"Perhaps he could answer that particular point."
"Secondly, as regards preparing for abolition, perhaps he could come to my constituency, speak to the company P&O Stena and suggest which particular members of staff they lay off and which ships they suspend from service."
"That would be particularly helpful."
"Thirdly, on the study, would Mr Monti confirm that, if ECOFIN vote for a study in May, as is possible and I think likely, he will enthusiastically implement that decision."
"If I can start with the last point, I have every reason to expect that the ECOFIN Council will not ask for the Commission to conduct a study."
"As a matter of fact, the issue did come up at the ECOFIN Council on two occasions, in November 1996 and again in March 1998, and as the President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council, Mr Gordon Brown, said publicly on a recent occasion, there is no evidence of an emerging consensus within ECOFIN for any reconsideration of the decision taken unanimously in 1991."
"In relation to the other two points, I can say that if we compare the solution and the problems sometimes aired by the categories concerned to the solutions provided for other professions affected by internal market legislation, customs freight forwarders, for example, did receive funds for reconversion of about ECU 30 million."
"A seven year period allowing for an annual turnover of about ECU 6.5 billion does not appear, if I may say so, to be disadvantageous treatment."
"Finally, I have repeatedly stated that, while the Commission is certainly not prepared to propose to the Council that the 1991 decision should be reconsidered, if there were to be proven and specific problems in certain regions or on certain transportation routes connected with the abolition of duty-free, then it will be possible for Member States, in a transparent way, to consider forms of state aid, which would of course have to be proposed by the Member States and in line with Community norms."
"Thank you very much, Mr Monti."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is now 7.00 p.m., the time at which Question Time was supposed to finish. However, in view of the fact that we lost several minutes on points of order, I have asked Parliament's services if they would be kind enough to allow us to extend Question Time by ten minutes."
"So we will finish at 7.10 p.m.."
"Mr Monti, I have two supplementary questions on the question we have just heard."
"The first is from Mr Corbett, who may speak for one minute."
"Does the Commissioner agree that a study might be useful for a purpose other than that for which many have been asking it for, namely, to reassure the public that some of the wilder claims of job losses that will result from the loss of dutyfree are in fact perhaps an exaggeration?"
"A study would certainly help to clarify that."
"A study might also identity the areas of specific problems that the Commissioner mentioned in his answer to the previous question."
"Whereas I agree with him entirely that it is very unlikely that the Council, even if the Commission put forward such a proposal, would wish to reverse a decision taken many years ago and introduce a further tax break for the alcohol and tobacco industries - a tax break that is conditional on it being sold to international travellers, which seems preposterous - nonetheless a study would be a useful weapon in furthering this debate."
"A study would be counterproductive."
"I believe this very sincerely because it might well give false expectations and delay further the adjustments that might well be needed."
"In fact, a very long period was given for adjustments, and it would be rather paradoxical and counterproductive if, when less than 15 months are left to the date of expiry of duty-free on intra-Eu travel, we were to engage in a study."
"It is for Member States to indicate to the Commission whether they consider, on the basis of studies or any other elements that they might have available, that there is a need for a specific intervention."
"Finally, it does not take a study to understand what is increasingly being perceived by public opinion, namely that duty-free is, in fact, a hidden, regressive subsidy, favouring the consumption of alcohol and tobacco to a large extent."
"It is hidden because it is passed on to the general taxpayer, who is hardly aware that he is subsidizing duty-free consumption by others."
"It is regressive because the ordinary taxpayer is normally less well-off than those benefiting from duty-free purchases; and, to a large extent, it sustains artificially and in a non-transparent manner the consumption of alcohol and tobacco."
"In view of his last answer, would the Commissioner close down the duty-free shop in the Commission for Commission staff such as himself?"
"Seriously though, my question is: what confidence will European citizens have in the Commission, given that Commissioner Scrivener promised away back in 1991 to carry out a study?"
"As the Commission has reneged on its promise, what confidence is this going to give the European Union in the Commission's honesty, integrity and determination to listen to elected representatives of the European population?"
"I understand Mr McMahon's question but I would submit to you that the Commission and the Council, following the Commission proposal in 1991, gave much more than a study."
"It gave a more than seven-year adjustment period, something particularly long in terms of any adjustment."
"I hardly dare touch on the subject of the confidence of European citizens in the Commission but I am sure that European citizens would hardly increase their confidence in a Commission that was to propose the continuation of a sort of hidden regressive subsidy at the expense of the general taxpayers in Europe going to a large extent into subsidizing forms of consumption that Community policies, if anything, tend to discourage."
"Question No 64 by Bernie Malone (H-0228/98)"
"Subject: Abolition of duty-free sales in 1999"
"Mr Michel Vanden Abeele, the Director-General of DG XXI recently commented, in a letter to one of my constituents, that the Commission's policy of liberalization within the single market had promoted the increased competition that low cost carriers bring to the market."
"An independent study by Symonds Travers Morgan has revealed that the abolition of tax- and duty-free sales will damage an otherwise healthy single market in air transport, causing a 20 % reduction in the number of routes that could otherwise expect the entry of low cost airlines by 2003, a reduction of 5 million in expected passenger levels, as well as massive job losses."
"How can the Commission reconcile its professed concern for the competitive participation of low cost carriers within the single market at the same time as it presses forward with legislation which will obviously cripple these carriers, costing approximately 3000 jobs?"
"The expansion of the air transport sector has certainly favoured the development of cut-price flights and, like all others, these flights will feel the effects of the abolition of the duty-free concessions as from 1 July 1999."
"In any case, the tax benefit deriving from these sales is relatively small if it is compared with other data."
"One aspect that should be pointed out, in fact, is that air passenger transport has seen an increase of around 7 % and this increase certainly cannot be attributed to duty-free sales, but to other causes such as the liberalization of air transport as from 1 April 1997."
"It is therefore presumed that this increase in passenger transport will continue and may give rise to broad compensation after the abolition of duty-free sales."
"In other words, we want to have and we have got the benefits of the creation of a single market and, in this case, that of air transport, and it is difficult to try and gain the benefits of the single market and maintain archaic structures, which are totally incompatible with the single market, as are duty-free sales."
"We also need to bear in mind that, at the moment, air transport benefits from an extremely favourable tax system, in terms of which the duty-free benefits are marginal."
"In fact, total VAT exemption applies to all aircraft and the relevant equipment and intra-Community passenger transport is not yet taxed; moreover, supplies on board are currently tax-free and, unlike other means of transport, aircraft fuel and kerosene are not subject to either VAT or excise."
"To conclude on this point, the Commission is aware of the fact that air transport is the means of transport which is growing fastest, and in which duty-free sales play a very marginal role."
"Any restructuring of the sector should therefore be considered within the framework of the strategies for achieving ever greater efficiency and profits and not just as a result of duty-free sales."
"I accused the Commissioner of being obstinate and arrogant at the public hearing which Parliament held."
"Today, I have to tell you, Commissioner, that I find you are totally out of touch with people."
"In your answer to me you say that the fiscal advantage to the air traveller will be very small."
"A study that was carried out in Ireland just recently and published yesterday by SIPTU, a trade union organization, and by IBEC, representing business interests, shows quite clearly that between £15 and £17 will be added on to the cost of an airline ticket for the average traveller."
"To an ordinary person that is a lot of money."
"In the same letter I received from my constituent, your office said that there are a range of measures that the Commission has at its disposal to deal with any threat to employment."
"Could you please define these measures, provide an estimate of the total cost of them, specify how they could be applied and outline the criteria for the allocation of these yet undefined measures?"
"After what Mary O'Rourke our Transport Minister has achieved in the Transport Council, you should be more optimistic about the outcome of the Ecofin meeting."
"With the pressure on the various Member States from ordinary citizens, the Commission will just have to concede that a study will have to be done in this case."
"I wish to thank Mrs Malone for her supplementary question."
"I am not sure that the Commission is out of touch with the population."
"Of course it holds a view that is different from that maintained by the duty-free lobbies but there are, of course, numerous positions taken recently by - may I say - broader representative institutions and the last one I have here is that of"
"COFACE, the Confederation of Family Organizations in the European Communities, notes that the current system is of virtually no interest for consumers."
"Only a small percentage of consumers have the possibility of regularly buying from duty-free stores."
"Furthermore, with the exception possibly of tobacco products, the advantages in price terms are often only apparent, as the competitive advantages of exemption are not always passed on to the final consumer."
"(EN) And to the extent that the present duty-free system contains an element of subsidy that enables transport fares to be lower than they would be otherwise, that is the best proof that the present duty-free system implies a subsidy which is hidden and regressive, as I hinted."
"In the case of transportation, as my colleague, Commissioner Kinnock, recently stated in response to one of the many letters on this point, no Member State subsidy in the form of continued tax-free sales would be possible."
"He went on to say that Community rules provide Member States with the means to pursue legitimate public service goals in cases where no commercial operator will be able to meet these goals without public assistance."
"This was the case in the Community guidelines on state aid to maritime transport."
"I believe this would also be valid for other forms of transportation."
"Finally, I stress that the Commission is certainly not insensitive to problems that might materialize from the abolition of duty-free on intra-EU travel, but it will insist that the appropriate instruments be used to tackle any such problems without re-opening an issue which, as I have stressed several times, simply implies having ordinary citizens bear the burden."
"Commissioner, it appears that you have set your face against the retention of duty-free sales."
"It is interesting that in Brussels airport, at the moment, they are constructing a totally new duty-free shop in the middle of the airport."
"I wonder why?"
"Respecting your request, I understand that the Commission is undertaking a report on commercial and retail activities in US airports."
"I find it very difficult to understand when the Commission has consistently refused to undertake a similar assessment of EU airports."
"Will you therefore make available to us the study done about the US airports?"
"I am picking up Mr Cushnahan's question here because, unfortunately, he had to leave."
"I would be grateful if I could have an answer to this supplementary."
"There is no such study."
"The Commission is looking at the situation in Europe and elsewhere."
"We are interested in the shopping malls at US airports although there is of course no duty-free on domestic flights in the US."
"We can look at those without any particular studies because they do open up encouraging possibilities for the former duty-free industry in Europe."
"Although there will no longer be a duty- and tax-free system there will be captive customers around the airports and on other means of transportation and therefore a substantial demand."
"Research by consumer organisations has confirmed that the duty-free prices for many goods are no more advantageous than in other shops."
"There is a large captive market, even apart from the duty-free element and it is there to stay."
"I have no particular axe to grind."
"I have nothing against duty-free but I have a duty to implement the single market."
"When we are working hard, with the support of this Parliament, to try and eliminate tax havens around Europe and promote employment, it would be illogical for me to crusade against tax havens and at the same time propose -or even consider - the continuation of localised tax havens connected with particular forms of transportation within the single market."
"Thank you very much, Mr Monti."
"Since the time allocated to questions to the Commission has now expired, Questions Nos 65 to 106 will be dealt with in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Mrs Hardstaff wishes to speak on a point of order."
"I would ask you if you could look into the procedure by which the questions are put into the order they are on the order paper."
"For example, every question in the first part of this session was tabled after my own question, which is being dealt with much later."
"This is even allowing for the fact that it was actually tabled at the beginning of February and got lost."
"The same is true of Council questions: at least nine questions which were tabled after my question are ahead of it."
"I think there is quite a lot of resentment among Members on this issue and I would ask that this be sorted out, so that questions appear in the order in which they are submitted and there is some fairness."
"Thank you very much indeed."
"Mrs Hardstaff, I will make sure your comment is taken into consideration."
"However, I can tell you now that the first five questions are chosen by the President of Parliament, with priority being given to those considered to be most important. In other words, the choice is of a discretional nature."
"The remaining questions should follow in order, as long as they relate to the specific Commissioners due to attend Question Time."
"In any case, Mrs Hardstaff, I will give your comment some thought and let you know in due course."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.22 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Shipbuilding (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the report (A4-0101/98) by Mr Sindal, on aid to shipbuilding and a new policy on shipbuilding."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after 9.00 p.m. in the evening, I am almost inclined to greet everybody individually."
"I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and have no wish to conceal the fact that I am, of course, also a Member who comes from East Germany. I still remember with gratitude the vote in this Parliament and the proposals by the Commission aimed at rectifying the problems neglected by the East German shipyards and in this respect I shall express myself in very moderate terms about the proposal."
"I think the Commission's proposal is very good."
"We live in an age when we must consider whether industrial policy can be ruled by means of subsidies alone."
"Nevertheless, I have also made it known to my group that I - and subsequent speakers will no doubt go into this - have my difficulties with some of the amendments tabled by Parliament and the committee."
"Basically it has to be said that productivity in the European shipyards has increased in recent years."
"Of course it must also be pointed out that this was often due to numerous closures, lay-offs and reductions in capacity."
"Unfortunately the OECD agreement was neither signed nor ratified, and I have the impression that some Member States are not angry about it at all."
"In view of the crisis in Asia and the devaluation of the currencies there, the shipbuilding industry will come under increased pressure."
"This has to be withstood and the Commission has submitted proposals which reduce the extent and amount of subsidies, albeit a moderate reduction."
"To that extent, this is a reaction to the progress sought in productivity."
"I have difficulties with some of the amendments tabled."
"I am specifically concerned that in so-called Objective 1 regions, the local shipyards should not be disadvantaged in comparison with other industrial sectors in the Objective 1 regions."
"We are strenuously pursuing this matter."
"It is not an honour for any Objective 1 region to be labelled as underdeveloped, but more help and some regulations are still needed in order to extricate ourselves from this situation."
"In this respect, I consider the proposal which has been submitted to be a good one."
"All Members should examine critically the amendments tabled by the committees and other Members."
"I nevertheless request that some consideration be given to the fact that our East German shipbuilding industry still has difficulties, and my colleague, García Arias, will certainly also bring up the subject of Spanish industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we still share your hope, Commissioner, that the OECD agreement of 1994 will still come into force."
"We also appeal to the Commission and to the Member States to try again to exert pressure on the USA, so that this agreement is ratified."
"Even if we succeed in this we have a further difficulty."
"We really must insist that the new shipbuilding nations, such as the People's Republic of China and Poland, endorse the OECD agreement, as it is no use having only some of the countries sign up to the OECD agreement, whilst the People's Republic of China and Poland continue with their own shipbuilding policies."
"We must probably now say, however, that the prospects for the OECD agreement coming into force are very slim and it is somewhat questionable whether the new shipbuilding nations will sign up to comparable regulations."
"We therefore need, as the Commission proposes, a new shipbuilding policy."
"But it is very important to have a shipbuilding policy which is both inward and outward looking."
"I myself come from a shipbuilding city."
"It is the very last time, as the Commission says, that there will be a special five-year arrangement for shipbuilding."
"After that, the shipbuilding industry can no longer say ""another five years and another five years' ; that cannot go on indefinitely."
"It is right to propose one more special arrangement now."
"We also share the view that order-related subsidies should be abolished by 31 December 2000, even if some amendments tabled in this House still seek to shake our conviction through more and more new studies."
"We know what the situation is, Commissioner; we do not need any more studies."
"If we look at the shipbuilding programme, there are still subsidies for lay-offs and restructuring, for innovation and environmental protection; that is enough subsidies to apply over five years. And, I should like to say to the previous speaker, you in Mecklenburg really have no need to complain at all that your subsidies are too low."
"I say to you and also to my Spanish colleagues, and I mean it very seriously: it is time for change."
"Therefore, we also support the original proposal from Mr Sindal - and I hope Niels can listen and will not be diverted by the women again."
"So, Niels, listen! Commissioner, we in the Christian-Democratic Group support his proposal to delete paragraph 7."
"There must no longer be a loophole for additional subsidies, because it is so difficult in the regions."
"It is a sector-orientated policy which we are deciding upon and there can be no new distortion of competition within the European Community."
"We regard that as very important, and I hope that tomorrow there will be a majority in this House for it."
"Commissioner, I believe we need a clear external shipbuilding policy, because unfortunately there is no guarantee that the other countries will end their subsidies."
"At present we are in agreement, and I hope the Commissioner will say something to us on this matter. The whole House is of the opinion that, if the European Member States now help the Asian countries in overcoming their financial crisis, those countries must not be allowed to abuse this in order to create advantages for their shipyards over ours, by ridding themselves of their shipyard debts and through other protectionist measures, especially when it is our taxpayers' contributions which are helping them to overcome their financial crisis."
"We cannot allow that."
"We must, however, also consider - and Commissioner, I should be very interested to hear your view on this subject - whether we might use the WTO or the instruments of the Union's trade policy to bolster our own position slightly, and add to our ammunition. We cannot indefinitely allow the unfair competition practices of other states to put our shipyards out of business."
"I believe - in fact I insist, Mr President - that in this area of the Union's foreign policy we need a new concept, and I hope that the Commissioner will say something to us on this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reflect on a few points."
"After the difficult situation and painful reorganization of the 1970s, today I have the impression that we believe that the European shipbuilding industry, which today accounts for 21 % of world employment, is, at first sight, well positioned in the world."
"In reality, in my opinion, the situation is not as bright as we might think, which is clear to those living in shipbuilding cities."
"The European shipbuilding industry is experiencing a revival with a great increase in demand and has at least a couple of years' work ahead. However, if we in fact analyse the actual information on the sector and the medium-term projections, we realize that the sector is characterized by surplus supply and by surplus production capacity, owing in particular to the irresponsible doubling of plant engineering capacity in the last four or five years by the Koreans."
"The fact that supply exceeds demand is shown indisputably by the fact that the prices of the new constructions have fallen or, when things are going well, stagnated in all sectors."
"In current dollars, a new ship today fetches the same price as it did seven or eight years ago."
"Along with this worrying situation of structural imbalance, there is the currency storm that has affected many Asian countries, particularly South Korea."
"The 50 % devaluation of the Korean won has led to a situation that risks having particularly serious consequences for the Community shipyards and for employment in Europe."
"In fact, it has been calculated that the Koreans could reduce the prices of their ships to 30 %, with their current internal margins remaining unchanged."
"In this context, I believe it essential for the EU to apply a policy that enables the European shipbuilding industry, which is appreciated throughout the world for its high technological content, to be able to compete with the same weapons with the industries of the other countries in a system of transparent and balanced competition with the same rules for everyone and without any distorting intervention by the states."
"Consequently, before the OECD agreement comes into force, before deciding to end the aid, the Commission should check the state and prospects of the sector in 1999, taking appropriate measures, if necessary, to protect the sector so that the European shipbuilding industry can face up to the threats that could undermine its survival."
"To conclude, the loan granted to Korea by the IMF should be negotiated with the condition that Korea undertakes to limit its ship production and operate within a system of fair and transparent competition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating shipbuilding policy. This is a real hot potato, because everyone has an opinion on it."
"It is almost as bad as agricultural policy. If you get five farmers in a room, there will be seven different opinions."
"I think it is important to realize that we must strive towards the adoption of an OECD agreement."
"I am also aware that we in Europe are working hard to achieve this."
"Until such times as it has been adopted, I welcome the Commission's proposal to establish some ground-rules for a transition period in the run-up to the OECD agreement."
"We must remember that state aid to shipbuilding is an exception, and we must ensure that we allow the minimum acceptable level of aid, just enough to put our shipyards on an even playing field with shipyards outside Europe."
"That is the balance we must strive to achieve."
"Thus, we have to examine the Commission's proposal to see whether it fulfils this, and it does."
"I am in agreement with the Commission on many points."
"What really matters to the Liberal group is point 1, namely the need for monitoring to ensure that the rules are adhered to."
"That is of the utmost importance."
"Point 2 basically outlines the need for transparency with regard to where aid is being given, and reference could once again be made to the report we debated this afternoon - the Berès report - when we also touched on the question of transparency."
"That is an extremely important aspect of state aid."
"A third aspect is also crucial to the Liberal group and that is the question of combining the various types of aid, which actually results in a very high ceiling for support."
"I am concerned about the need to prevent shipyards from gaining aid through regional areas."
"Thus, I would very much like us to support Amendment No 29 in order to avoid unfair competition within Europe so that shipyards will not in future be located only in areas that are eligible for regional aid."
"Mr President, the Commission's new policy on shipyards is not in fact all that new."
"It operates within a framework we are already familiar with, and which has had dramatic impacts on Europe's ship repairing industry."
"The Commission proposes to place yet more restrictions on the production capacity of European shipyards, with the consequent loss of still more jobs, the complete abolition of operating aid in 2000, but allowing aid to be given for closures and to facilitate the further concentration of production in the few, powerful shipyards that are left."
"All this is proposed while ignoring the fact that demand in coming years is forecast to be high and that the European Union's international competitors are continually increasing their production capacity and adopting support measures."
"For countries like Greece, such a policy means abandoning and selling off a strategically important branch which has already sustained irreparable damage with incalculable consequences for the fabric of society and for the country's economy."
"The European Union has learned nothing, either from the dramatic consequences of its policy or from the stance of the United States, which reserve for themselves the right to use only ships built in the USA for internal schedules."
"Unfortunately, the rapporteur too is proposing that aid should be restricted still further, competition should be intensified to extreme levels, and essentially, that shipyards should continue to wither away."
"Ultimately, what do competition and the existence of a shipyard industry and jobs mean for us? We cannot accept these proposals, whose implementation would complete the destruction that began long ago."
"On the contrary, we call on the Commission to adopt measures to support the European industry, if necessary even ignoring the OECD agreement, so that shipyards can survive the annihilating and unfair competition from third countries."
"We ask it to undertake specific initiatives at international level for the adoption of measures which will compel renewal of the ageing fleet - an essential prerequisite for improving shipping safety and bringing recovery to the shipyards - and to have ships checked by the state in which the port is located. It should also ban the entry of low-specification vessels into its ports as a way to bring about their withdrawal, and tackle the problems of taxation and social dumping in the field."
"Mr President, we realize that these subsidies are necessary to create a level playing field on the world market."
"They can, however, only be accepted if such aid is also transparent."
"For this purpose the Commission must, in our view, procure its own right of verification."
"It can be seen that there is worldwide over-capacity in the shipbuilding industry and it would therefore be absurd to further subsidise these existing capacities."
"It would be much more sensible to subsidise innovative projects in this field, to give more intensive support to research and development and in this way to create an opportunity for genuine future markets in shipbuilding."
"I should like to give an example from a very poor region in Sachsen-Anhalt, where a small shipyard, Roszlau on Elbe, had no chance of further contracts."
"It initiated a crucial innovation, namely the building of flat-bottomed boats, which do not require rivers to be widened for their use."
"The environment creates jobs - that is all I can say - and in this case it succeeded!"
"We are talking about a new market which is urgently needed throughout Europe, which needs to be provided for, which will also be of global interest and which, at the same time, can secure jobs which had already been written off."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is the context in which we are considering the Sindal Report?"
"As has been emphasized by our colleague André Sainjon in his opinion, the OECD agreement whose aim was to eliminate direct aid to shipbuilding was stillborn."
"In effect, it had to be so, as the United States Congress did not ratify it. This was only to be expected, as the American authorities have no reluctance whatsoever in subsidising their own shipyards."
"At the same time, South Korea, which is going through the economic turbulence that we all know about, is preparing for a future as an even more formidable competitor."
"The 'Challenges' newspaper this month emphasizes however that the financial crisis is temporary."
"The country should soon return to normal, thanks to IMF funds."
"The shipyards will work hard to catch up on lost time, and their sales people will once again be going around the globe to put spokes in the wheels of the Japanese and Europeans."
"This is the context in which the Commission is apparently persisting stubbornly in doing away with direct aid in Europe, and strangely enough is sticking to the line which was defended at the time of negotiations on the OECD agreement, although these negotiations foundered."
"The position is all the more astonishing since the aid from the IMF, in the final analysis, does in fact boil down to a subsidy paid by Japan, the United States and Europe to begin a high risk economic policy."
"We therefore completely agree with the general comments made by André Sainjon and the amendments proposed by the Commission on External Economic Relations."
"We believe indeed that it is extremely dangerous to commit to a date to end aid to orders, without prior analysis of the market situation and of whether or not there are non-competitive practices afoot."
"Similarly, we are in favour of eliminating any regional aid which would risk introducing unacceptable distortions in competition."
"In conclusion, once more, the Commission appears show either an strangely naive commitment to free trade, or an overwhelming ideological blindness."
"Industrial policy and commercial policy, on the contrary, require realism and pragmatism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Sindal for his splendid report."
"I agree with its main message that the shipbuilding industry should be left to recover in the longer term without state aid."
"Mr Sindal's report, however, is turning into something that is unfortunately dividing the southern and northern European states."
"Many of our friends in Spain, for example, have been very concerned about possible cuts to aid, and that is quite understandable."
"We in the Nordic countries have already cut shipyard aid though, and we have noticed that the shipyards have actually been coping better since the cuts were introduced."
"We have lost some, but the sturdier ones have remained, and they are competitive."
"The policy of support had actually been distorting the picture in this sector."
"I agree with Mr Sindal that the prompt implementation of the OECD agreement is especially important for the normalization of world ship markets."
"The Commission, in its estimation, however, is rather gratuitously optimistic."
"The USA, as you know, does not seem very willing to ratify the agreement."
"The Commission should put more pressure on the USA as, if the agreement is not ratified, we will have to produce yet another directive on shipbuilding when the old 7th Directive comes to an end at the end of the year."
"The present jungle of aid to shipbuilding has led to unfair competitive advantages between one European shipyard and another."
"The EU must therefore aim to guarantee similar benefits to the industry both in Europe and overseas."
"In this we must obviously be prepared for competition from countries where production costs are low."
"Aid that differs from country to country and region to region, like regional aid and aid for structural change, is now making the status of the different European shipyards a variable factor."
"I myself proposed an amendment to this report, in which I suggested the checking of the overlapping of aid and variable aid systems for the years 1999-2000."
"The Commission has not itemized its aid programme meticulously enough for the years to come and this might lead to overlap instead of cuts."
"My proposal for an amendment did not, however, get any response, even from my own group, and thus I did not consider it wise to present it to you here."
"I assume that modern vessels are very intelligent."
"They thus call for much technological development."
"They are high-tech products, and that is what we Europeans have to face up to."
"Shipbuilding contracts have to be made in the knowledge that the industry in the Community is being assured of reasonable and uniform conditions for competition."
"The ultimate aim of the EU should be that the shipbuilding industry in the longer term recovers without aid."
"That would be consistent with the OECD agreement."
"Mr President, for a long time shipbuilding has been subject to strong commercial pressure from third countries - such as South Korea, China and others - which are causing serious complications to the market due to, among other things, the competitive devaluations of their currencies, with the passive consent of the International Monetary Fund."
"Furthermore, there already is a suitable framework designed to realign the market, born of consensus and backed by the OECD."
"Of course, it would be better if the United States and China were to sign it, but as a framework it is good."
"In that context, we Spanish Members of the People's Party believe we should oppose any regulation which directly or indirectly might allow a reduction in the current system of aid to shipyards."
"In the current market situation, we think it would be irresponsible to commit to withdrawing contract-related aid from shipyards from the year 2000."
"We also disagree with the Sindal report's criticisms of any regional aid which the shipyards might currently be receiving."
"Everybody knows that if a shipyard closes in a depressed area with a high unemployment level, the consequences for the workers are far worse than when a shipyard closes in the prosperous countries of the north, where there are jobs."
"In addition, the Maastricht Treaty states that all the Union's policies should take their inspiration from the principle of economic cohesion."
"Those arguments, and others, lead us to oppose the Sindal report."
"We cannot support the proposed reduction in aid to shipbuilding, especially in the international context we have just been describing."
"The OECD agreement should form the framework for regulating our aid in the future."
"Moreover, every time a shipbuilding job is destroyed in Europe, another one is created in South Korea."
"This is not the time to commit to any reduction in aid, unless in the context of the OECD agreement, which is good for Europe and good for all shipyards."
"So it makes no sense for us to want to be more demanding than the established framework. We will vote against a possible toughening up of the 7th Directive, and we think it would be a very good thing if it were prolonged."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on several occasions the Parliament has drawn attention to the vital importance of adopting common standards for the shipbuilding market which is, after all, the ultimate objective of the OECD agreement."
"We share this view and agree that the European Union should not submit proposals that might jeopardize the agreement's ratification."
"On the contrary, every effort should be made to ensure that it enters into force."
"Meanwhile, since it is impossible to achieve that objective, principally on account of the United States' protectionist measures, we welcome the Commission's proposal to extend the 7th Directive and to draw up a new shipbuilding policy."
"We would, however, like to make two comments in this respect."
"We consider the 31 December 2000 deadline for operating aid to be inappropriate and premature, particularly if competition is further distorted, for instance, by dumping or by the Far East crisis."
"Before a decision is taken to eliminate aid, the most thorough possible analysis should be made of the situation of Community shipyards."
"Our second point, briefly, relates to the rigorous compliance, application and monitoring of the new legislative framework."
"The regulation should contribute to ensuring that the existing inequalities in competition between European shipyards do not increase."
"Professionals in this sector frequently state that the playing field is not level, on account of local subsidies and aid which infringe the rules of competition."
"We feel that the Commission has an important role to play in this respect."
"Mr President, over the last twenty years, the number of employees in European Union shipyards has fallen from 280 000 to less than 80 000."
"In France, the number of employees has fallen from 32 000 to less than 5 000, and many yards have closed."
"This situation, which is already catastrophic, would have been aggravated still further if the OECD agreement of July 1994 had been applied, as its aim was to eliminate aid while maintaining the American protectionist legislation arising from the Jones Act and reserving a monopoly to the American merchant fleet shipbuilders."
"The proposal for a regulation from the Commission aimed at banning operating aid from 31 December 2000 anticipates the OECD agreement, which has still not been ratified by the United States."
"Our group favours neither the early application of the OECD agreement, nor the fixing of a date to get rid of aid."
"Rather, it would be necessary to renegotiate the OECD agreement by taking into account changes in the world market, and more particularly the Asian crisis, which very much looks like leading to more dumping by Far Eastern shipbuilders."
"Quite the contrary of what has been planned, we ask that measures be taken to promote the shipbuilding and maritime business in the Member States. We should give them a boost, by putting right the unfair competitive practices at global level, by maintaining the system of State aid, and introducing Community preference for shipbuilding, in order to promote the purchase of ships built in European yards."
"Mr President, shipbuilding is a global industry and should be approached as such."
"It should not be viewed from a regional or national perspective."
"The relevant market is the global market."
"The Commission's proposal unfortunately does not take this sufficiently into account."
"Moreover, it goes against agreements which have been made on cutting back subsidies for shipyards whilst reducing capacity."
"The sector has been going through a process of reorganization for years."
"This proposal increases the risk that capacity might creep up with the aid of government support."
"This would wipe out in one fell swoop the organizational achievements which have already been made."
"The Commission document does not mesh with European competition policy."
"It even flagrantly contravenes the principles of the internal market; one yard may get 3 to 9 % in aid, whereas another may get 60 to 70 %."
"Paragraph 7 regarding regional aid should therefore be deleted."
"The restructuring aid is also completely superfluous."
"With these proposals the European Commission is killing off the best European shipyards, whilst lesser yards are maintained artificially."
"A recent study by Ernst and Young highlights this conclusion."
"The strategic importance of the European shipbuilding industry is evident."
"We want to continue to be able to build our own ships, even if we are forced to help the sector."
"But let us not create a mess with all kinds of obscure regulations within the European Union, and squander tax revenue."
"It will not be of any help to the sector itself. The ultimate goal must still be the abolition of all types of government support, so that every yard gets the price it deserves."
"Mr President, the report on aid to shipbuilding which we are debating tonight refers to matters of great importance for the European Union and particularly for certain regions."
"One such region is Andalusia, especially the provinces of Cadiz and Seville, where shipbuilding is virtually the only heavy industry still in existence, although it is experiencing enormous difficulties."
"The shipbuilding sector is in crisis, as the honourable Members are well aware. Furthermore, it is a sector which is greatly exposed to competition, especially from Asia, as has been underlined several times this evening."
"The production capacity and actual production of South Korea alone are greater than for the whole of the Community."
"Furthermore, as has also been stressed tonight, that ability to compete is reinforced by the strong devaluation of the Korean won, caused by monetary instability in Asia."
"For that reason it is important to call on the Commission to exert pressure on the US Congress, to get them finally to ratify the OECD agreement on competition conditions in the shipbuilding sector."
"And not just in the context of the OECD agreement, either: there is also the World Trade Organization, where the Commission should make its voice heard in order to achieve fair competition conditions for the world market."
"In its regulation, the Commission proposes that contract-related aid should cease on 31 December 2000, but the recitals of the same regulation introduce a safeguard clause to cover that eventuality."
"It specifically says: ""Whereas, one year before that date the Commission will monitor the market situation and appraise whether European yards are affected by anti-competitive practices."
"Well, Commissioner, we are very worried that if this study were carried out, the conclusion would be that in fact anti-competitive practices are still being used in the world market. If that were the case, we hope the Commission would be up to the situation, and come up with suitable measures to solve this extremely serious problem."
"So we are surprised that the safeguard clause I quoted from the recitals nevertheless fails to be reflected in the actual text of the regulation, and we are strongly in favour of it being formally incorporated into it."
"We are also in favour of retaining Article 7 in the regulation. Several speakers this evening have said that this article distorts competition, but it does nothing of the sort."
"It is founded on the principles of regional policy so it could be said that, even without being specifically mentioned in the body of the regulation, aid arising out of regional policy would still be applicable."
"Lastly, Mr President, I listened carefully to the words of my compatriot Mr Pomés Ruiz of the Group of the European People's Party, who expressed clear views on this regulation."
"It just remains for me to say one thing: the Spanish People's Party, to which Mr Pomés Ruiz belongs, currently has a seat in the Council of Ministers."
"Let us Spaniards hope that the stance taken within the Council by the Spanish Ministry of Industry is as firm as the one we have heard tonight."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the House is today discussing the creation of a new Community legislative framework for the granting of aid to the European shipbuilding industry."
"The objective here is to fulfill the principles enshrined in the Treaty by providing the shipbuilding sector with fair and uniform conditions of competition within the Community so that, subsequently, the sector may survive without state aid, in compliance with market rules and conditions."
"In this connection, the agreement signed in 1994 between the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Norway and the United States, under the auspices of the OECD, which should have entered into force on 1 January 1996, may today be said to be a dead letter in that, under constant pressure from US shipyards, the US Congress has failed to ratify the agreement."
"This position may be understood in the light of the fact that, over and above the many millions of dollars allocated in aid to the opening of a shipyard in Philadelphia, the US authorities wish to add a new payment with which the US Navy may openly finance the construction of non-military vessels."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, shipbuilding today is undeniably a global industry and the European shipbuilding industry should enjoy the same conditions as its international competitors."
"Therefore, steps should be taken to extend the standards in force within the European Union to a global level, preventing any distortion of competition."
"It is essential to incorporate the existing instruments of economic policy, together with those to be created in the future, within a policy which seeks to achieve a uniform international shipbuilding market without distortions of competition and without dumping of any kind."
"The United States' protectionist measures, China's total freedom to ignore commitments of this type, together with the crossed subsidy mechanisms made possible by the vertical and horizontal composition of the Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders undermine the objectives of achieving uniformity."
"South Korea's position, which combines its 25 % market share, which it clearly aims to increase, with a devaluation of the won in excess of 50 %, has had and continues to have disastrous effects on the world market."
"For instance, the increase in the number of jobs in Korean shipyards in the last decade is equal to the number of jobs lost in my country's shipbuilding and repair yards."
"It is therefore urgent to force countries like South Korea to correct the imprudent industrial policy they have pursued and force them to eliminate their excess capacity."
"Thus, the 7th Directive should be extended."
"The Commission should maintain the 31 December 2000 deadline for eliminating subsidies if it ascertains that anti-competition practises do not exist."
"If that is not the case, then it should be extended, until at least 31 December 2003, the date on which this regulation expires."
"Mr President, I am glad to see we are joined tonight by the two Commissioners dealing with this matter, in the contexts of industrial policy and competition policy."
"It would have been nice if Sir Leon Brittan had also been here, because of the international importance of the subject."
"I am not going to repeat here what everybody has been saying about the international situation."
"What I want to do is put the following question to the Commissioners: what aspect of the world situation has changed, for there to be this change in attitude in the Community strategy towards defending the shipbuilding sector?"
"So far we have been prolonging the directive while waiting to see what happened with the international agreement."
"Also, there has been the crisis in Asia, and all the current phenomena we have just been talking about here."
"The Commission now realizes, as we all know from the newspapers, that European companies have lost international contracts or tenders because obviously those devaluations, that excess capacity, and perhaps that indirect aid being diverted from the IMF aid, are having an effect."
"So, what has happened to make us change our strategy?"
"Is it because the Nordic countries have joined?"
"That is what can be deduced from what we are hearing here in Parliament."
"Is that the international change which has taken place?"
"In the debate on this question, Parliament's position is that we should not set a date for the prolongation of the directives, because as soon as we set a date we are adopting and announcing unilateral policies."
"And now it turns out that we have here the regulation which announces that unilateral disarmament on the part of the European Union."
"Mr President, in view of what we have been hearing I would like to say two things."
"I go a little further than what has been said by my colleague Mr Pérez Royo and the Spanish People's Party."
"I would like to hear the Minister declare publicly that he is defending that position at the Industry Council."
"I think it would be very interesting and very important for the shipyards and the Spanish regions to know that that position is being defended because, as we are hearing, that does not seem to be the case."
"However, at this time of night I do not wish to go any deeper into the question."
"I would prefer it if the two Commissioners here - and I wish Sir Leon were here too - would tell us what change has occurred for us now to find ourselves with a proposal for our unilateral disarmament."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, after having as is customary, thanked and congratulated Mr Sindal and the draftsmen of the opinions, and our two Commissioners for their presence here, I wish to begin my speech on the future of aid to shipbuilding by making three observations."
"Firstly, in the course of the past five years, every time a job has been lost in the European shipbuilding industry, another job has been created in the Korean shipbuilding industry, and our sacrifices have therefore been perfectly useless."
"Secondly, in Korea, it is neither low wages nor industrial organization which has made Korea dominant, but the cross guarantees of the conglomerates, supported by the Korean government, making actual financial backing unnecessary."
"Thirdly, in Europe, every time aid is given to a shipyard in difficulty, the European Commission demands a reduction in capacity, whereas of course in Korea, Japan and the United States nothing of the sort happens."
"The result of all this can be summarised in four points."
"Firstly, Europe has imposed on itself measures which its competitors did not."
"Secondly, tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed with all that ensues in terms of social difficulties and misery."
"Thirdly, Europe has lost a substantial market share."
"Fourthly, contrary to what occurred in other industrial sector, in particular the steel industry, there is no guarantee that what is left of our production capacity will actually last."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a few months ago, we nearly hit rock bottom in this area, as aid under the 7th Directive was about to disappear on behalf of an OECD agreement that our competitors had not even ratified."
"For once, we all together were able to say no."
"Today it is being proposed to us that the European Union should unilaterally apply, to itself, the principles set out in the OECD agreement, although it is not ratified."
"And here I say once again that we must be more pragmatic."
"If in the year 2000, we see the market is sufficiently healthy for us to be able to do without aid, I will doubtless agree to it being done away with."
"But today, who could say as much?"
"The Commission itself acknowledges the need for appropriate measures although it cannot say what these are."
"So now, I beg of you, do not shut the doors. But if we are to shut the doors, let us at least keep the keys, and between now and then we shall be able to study exactly the changes in the market before fixing final dates and taking definitive measures."
"Shipbuilding is not an industry like any other."
"That is why I call on our Parliament to be cautious, and I call on the Commission to accept the amendments which I hope will be voted through and which will allow us between now and the end of the year 2000 enough margin for manoeuvre."
"Once and for all, in this sector, as in many other sectors, we should, Mr President, stop being masochistic."
". Mr President, as I listened to all these speeches, and this time there were many of them, you will have surely been aware, if you listened to one another, of the difficulties with which we are confronted, because the arguments go from A to Z. Some of you wish to stop aid immediately, and in particular operating aid, and a number of governments defend this point of view even today."
"Others would like aid to be continued, using the same arguments as have been raised for the last fifteen years."
"Everyone seems to forget that the only industrial sector, and I repeat the only industrial sector which has for a very long time benefited from operating aid is shipbuilding."
"This is no longer the case for the steel industry, nor for other sectors; shipbuilding is the only one left."
"Taking the figures from 1990 to 1995, did you know that in the European Union, more than ECU 5 billion of state aid was allocated to operating aid, and more than ECU 3 billion for restructuring? That is a total of ECU 8 billion."
"So those who claim that this sector has been let down are completely wrong."
"In spite of this aid, which is at times massive, I knew of cases where the public authorities were paying one third and even more for ships - when I say the public authority, of course I mean the tax payer - often in order to be able to compete with shipyards within the Union itself."
"Sometimes even more than one third of the aid was provided."
"That was the situation."
"So in effect, the question has now been with us for many years: can we continue like this?"
"Increasingly, more governments are saying no."
"We have tried to find a solution through the OECD agreement, at a global level, and we have not disarmed on a unilateral basis."
"We have tried to find an agreement which everyone would respect, and provided this agreement was ratified, we were ready to immediately put an end to the 7th Directive."
"Unfortunately, the Americans did not ratify the agreement."
"The problem is not that the Americans are major competitors, because I am not aware that American ships are causing great difficulties to our own shipyards."
"The Americans are protectionist, that is true, but in terms of global competition, the problem is not really there."
"Our problem is that, as ships are becoming increasingly sophisticated, we need to act to ensure that we are at the cutting edge of technological development and of the development of modern ships."
"I shall return to Korea in a minute, but I believe it is useful to go over the global context again."
"Once again, more and more governments cannot or do not wish to continue giving operating aid."
"Sometimes, from some of the speeches, my understanding was that it is no longer a question of giving aid."
"That is wrong, as even in the framework of the OECD agreement, aid for research and development, for the environment and for social support measures and export finance arrangements continue to be provided for."
"The OECD agreement allows all this to continue."
"Our proposal allows more: it offers aid for the restructuring of companies and aid for innovation."
"That is new, certainly, but that is precisely the reason why we have to try and innovate more to remain competitive."
"That being the case, I do not understand why we are being criticised for including that in our proposal."
"That is where the future lies."
"We did this for the automobile industry; why not do the same for shipbuilding?"
"Let us now come to a highly controversial point, particularly among yourselves, which is aid to investment in eligible regions."
"This is the logic of our regime."
"Let us take the automobile industry, Mr Jarzembowski."
"We can give aid to eligible regions, to compensate for the disadvantage that these regions have compared to non-eligible regions."
"That is why a great deal of aid can be allocated to Saxony, as you know."
"Not as much as Mr Biedenkopf would wish, but, even so, it is a substantial amount, whereas in other places, nothing can be given, not even a penny to Vilworde."
"That is the logic of our regional policy."
"Do you wish to keep this policy or not?"
"The Commission believes that we should."
"Where your argument does bite, is knowing whether the degree of aid that can be allowed for the eligible regions, be it region A or region C, would also be acceptable in the logic of shipbuilding."
"I have just mentioned the automobile industry where aid can only be given for investment in order to make up for disadvantages."
"But here I am ready, and I emphasize this, to consider along with the Council of Ministers how to limit regional aid, possibly even by combining it with certain other measures."
"However, I believe we should in principle maintain the overall approach in terms of regional policy."
"Of course, this investment must not be used to increase capacity."
"It may be used to modernize, to increase productivity, but not to enlarge capacity."
"From this point of view, this rule can be maintained and rightly so, I believe."
"We shall see what the Council of Ministers decides."
"I am not sure that it will follow this logic, but I maintain that it is right."
"It is consistent with what the Commission does within the European Union in terms of regional policy."
"Now I will look at Korea."
"Of course many other comments have been made, but my time is limited, and clearly I have to speak on the question of Korea."
"Furthermore, Martin Bangemann is here, and he may talk more about the report which was drawn up under his responsibility, in an attempt to contribute to the modernization of our shipbuilding industry."
"Who can believe for a moment that the Commission is not in fact concerned about this?"
"It only wants the sector to be able to support itself, as far as possible, through its own resources, receiving aid of course for research and development and for the environment."
"All these instruments remain available, but we must, after a certain period, eliminate operating aid, that is, by the end of the year 2000, as we have proposed."
"Here too, we shall see what the Council decides."
"However, before even the crisis in Korea, Martin and myself included in our proposal a clause stating that if something were to happen at a global level, somewhere in an industrialized country which was developing an aggressive dumping policy with regard to our shipyards, the Commission would reserve the right to come back on this."
"We undertook, one year before the end of operating aid, to review this matter in order to make an assessment and present it to you and to the Council of Ministers, with a view to determining whether we should take new measures or develop other elements of our policy."
"This door was not only halfopen in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, but was open before it, because that is what had been agreed."
"In this light, I have no difficulty in accepting some of the suggestions which were made, with a view to studying extremely closely, as Martin does, as the Commission will do and as the Council will do, the consequences of the events in South Korea, where there is in fact a considerable degree of competition."
"Contrary to what many of you have said, the crisis does make it possible for us to intervene."
"Before, in practice, we could not."
"Before the crisis, the Koreans would not accept a reduction in capacity."
"Now, with the crisis, with the operation of IMF aid, we will also have our bit to say."
"Although precautions have been taken, we will naturally need to ensure that they are complied with."
"It so happens that in the wake of the Industry Council which is due to take place on 7 May, there will be a high-level meeting between Korea and the European Union, and believe you me, we will take stock of the situation there."
"In fact, over and above the problem of the shipbuilding sector, South Korea and a number of other countries are facing a far more serious crisis, which also affects their industrial structures and massive aid systems."
"Hence, at a time when those countries are in the throes of crisis, nobody is going to try and sell us a policy based on the South Korean model."
"Let us take advantage of the situation to try and make some adjustments, since we were not able to do so with the OECD agreement, which provided no commitments from Korea to reduce its capacity."
"On the contrary, South Korea continued to increase its capacity."
"Now we have at least a possibility of saying to the Koreans that we want to enter into serious discussions about this matter."
"Furthermore, the European Union is not the only one to act; the Member States are also able to act through the IMF."
"In my view, if anything it is a matter of good fortune that we can now get into a serious discussion with the Koreans and reassess the matter, instead of being in the situation as it was before."
"I therefore yet again, make a commitment on behalf of the Commission to come back to this aspect, as well as to others, one year before the end of the regime, in other words, one year before the end of operating aid."
"Specifically, this means that we shall continue to discuss among ourselves, but we must find a solution for the future, as the 7th directive comes to an end at the end of the year."
"Last time, we were able to extend it for a limited period only, and barely gained a qualified majority to do this."
"But now this will no longer be possible."
"A blocking minority will certainly oppose the continuation of this regime."
"We therefore need to find another way forward, another policy, and I believe that the if it is possible to discuss one element or another and the Commission itself is prepared to consider certain amendments here or there, that in this way an agreement will be possible within the Council of Ministers."
"With that, ladies and gentlemen, I will conclude."
"I have spoken at length, but I know how interested you are in this sector, which is still very sensitive, and as I look at some of you, I can immediately see behind you the region and shipyards in question."
"I know this because I understand that because very often the regions are already facing difficulties."
"When we speak about the difficulties in the shipyards, thousands of people are affected, and the situation is showing itself to be dramatic."
"I therefore fully understand what you have said. But on the other hand, I think that our proposal is fairly balanced, and also aims to ensure that, in the next century, we will have a competitive shipbuilding industry, which will not only be a major industry at European level, but also at global level."
"If I could have your attention, Mr van Miert - thank you for your reply and for contributing positively this evening."
"This is a consultation procedure, and I think this process is in fact intended to help expose the problems facing not only the Commission, but also the citizens of Europe, and I believe we can all sympathise with one another."
"However, I do also look forward to the Commission and the Council coming up with a workable solution."
"That was one point I wanted to make."
"I am actually speaking in response to criticism from some Members before the break to the effect that the procedure prevents the various opinions from those committees asked to give an opinion from reaching the corresponding committees in time, thus preventing them from being heard."
"As rapporteur of this proposal, I would like to say that I have endeavoured to get this put back a little, but the fact is that British Presidency wants the matter settled in May, and the Commission did not want it to be postponed."
"I am saying this with regard to the protocol."
"At some point, we must learn to deal with matters in their correct order."
"This is my response to criticism from my two colleagues this afternoon."
"Mr President, I wish simply to make good an unpardonable omission."
"I did not even congratulate Mr Sindal on his excellent report."
"I deeply regret this, as I know how hard he has worked, and I hope that my omission now has been made good."
"I was so keen to give a quick response to the comments of substance, that I forgot to congratulate you, but I do so, believe me, with all my heart and with conviction."
"Our congratulations echo yours, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Passenger vehicles"
"The next item is the report (A4-0113/98) by Mr Murphy, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and amending Council Directive 70/156/CEE (COM(97)0276 - C4-0545/97-97/0176(COD))."
"I welcome Mr Bangemann, who joined us during the previous debate."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by putting on record my thanks to Parliament services for assisting with this very complicated dossier, the Commission for its assistance and, in particular, the bus builders of Europe, the bus operators of Europe and those people who use the buses of Europe, for their great assistance in drawing up this report."
"Yet again Parliament is making one of its traditional errors."
"We spent the whole of this morning contemplating our own budgetary navel."
"That is important to us but here we are this evening, as a Parliament, talking about ship-building and buses and coaches which are very relevant to the citizens of Europe."
"I know which reports my constituents in towns like Wolverhampton and Dudley would like to see us talking about in front of the media and not here in front of a few interpreters and a few hardy souls such as ourselves."
"I welcome the Commission's proposals."
"They are an important step forward towards the completion of the single market."
"They protect national and regional preferences in vehicles and in this respect, from the United Kingdom's point of view, I am pleased that our traditional double-decker buses - and in London the Routemaster buses - are under no threat whatsoever from Europe."
"I am pleased to be able to say that."
"Also, very importantly, I welcome the mandatory provision for disabled accessibility to class I vehicles. This is very important."
"As the rapporteur I have spoken widely to various interest groups, as I said at the beginning of my speech. Not all are going to be happy with my proposals but I can assure you that I did my best to meet all their main aspirations in a realistic, technical and cost-effective way."
"There are a few key points from my report that I would like to bring to the Commission's attention and to invite their support."
"Firstly, we are widening the single market here."
"But I would ask that instead of adopting a derogation approach to vehicles which are not typical throughout the European Union, such as double-decker buses and midi-buses - which are used in certain parts of the European Union, I think we ought to allow type approval for them all, provided they are safe and not a hazard to citizens."
"We should grant them type approval."
"Nobody has to actually use them but why separate them out?"
"Why not have a complete market in buses and coaches?"
"I would urge the Commission to look at my Amendments Nos 4, 5, 28, 29 and 41 in that respect."
"Secondly, we ought to widen the accessibility provisions to include class II vehicles."
"The Commission is currently involved in a study looking at the technical feasibility of accessibility for class II vehicles."
"It is my prediction that Commission study will report in favour of mandatory accessibility provisions for those vehicles before the Council has even adopted its first common position."
"We, as a Parliament, ought to be looking at class I and class II vehicles because this is technically feasible."
"I have seen the vehicles, I have been on them."
"Included in that we ought to start a study into class III vehicles, coaches and class A vehicles and minibuses."
"The key challenge to this House is to accept that we have a duty here to widen accessibility as far as is technically and affordably possible."
"I say to my colleagues in the EPP group on this: please accept this challenge; what I am saying is reasonable and achievable."
"I am not coming forward with some super-fantastic idea here."
"I would say to the EPP and the UPE groups: please, let us put this in at first reading; let us test the waters."
"I believe that by the time we get to our second reading, the Commission will be backing us on class II vehicles."
"I would not want to waste what is a golden opportunity."
"I myself know how difficult it is to get on and off buses if you have a slight disability."
"I had a broken ankle a couple of years ago."
"It is impossible to get on and off vehicles with high steps."
"A friend of mine told me about a woman at a bus depot in Wolverhampton who had a child in a push-chair."
"She had to wait for different vehicles to pass until the right one came along, with a low floor, so that she could actually get on that vehicle."
"I am saying here, this evening: let us take this opportunity to widen the single market, to increase the accessibility provisions from class I to class II, with the various bits and pieces of technical amendments we require."
"There has been a lot of fuss made about my report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"That has been based largely on a series of misunderstandings."
"As far as I am concerned, this is an important piece of single market legislation; it is an important report for the citizens of Europe."
"But what is more, I can assure you it is technically feasible, undoubtedly affordable, and eminently achievable."
"I think it is a good response to a good Commission proposal."
"I ask the House to support it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the directive on the regulation of vehicles with more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat - generally known as buses - is aimed at standardizing the type approval system in the context of the Single Market and at the same time improving safety."
"The whole report is very technical; nevertheless, these technical details have considerable repercussions for the people."
"The Commission has fortunately taken into account accessibility for people with restricted mobility, but it is the fine details which are causing the problems."
"I have therefore mainly addressed this problem area in my opinion."
"I thank the rapporteur for having incorporated to a large extent the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism in his report."
"In its proposals on accessibility, the Commission concerns itself solely with wheelchair-bound persons with strong arm muscles."
"We intend to extend the concept of ""persons with reduced mobility' to include not only all disabled persons, but also elderly people and those who, for various reasons, have difficulty in boarding; for example, passengers with heavy luggage, passengers with pushchairs or bicycles and even pregnant women."
"This new definition of the term will entail a whole series of technical changes which will, however, make it possible and/or easier for people to use public transport."
"The second fundamental change which I propose is to stipulate accessibility for persons with reduced mobility for all types of vehicle."
"We want to have this accessibility not only for local but also for long-distance buses."
"Boarding aids should be available for at least one door."
"We are not satisfied with a promise from the Commission that it will submit a proposal on this subject in the near future, because it does not want to make a decision at present as to the best technical solution."
"We have waited years for this directive and have repeatedly demanded mandatory obstacle-free design."
"We do not want to be put off any longer."
"In non-binding declarations, demands for the integration of people with disabilities are made repeatedly."
"With the acceptance of the amendments tabled, we have an opportunity to make a start on integration, at least in the field of transport."
"About 10 % of the population lives with some form of disability."
"A large proportion of these people have difficulty in using the roads."
"They are reliant on public transport."
"Because of their reduced mobility it is important for them to be able to get out and about, to be able to lead an independent life."
"Public transport must be designed in such a way that it does not constitute an obstacle for this group of people, so that they can reach their place of work, but also so that they can participate in leisure activities, reach holiday destinations or keep up family or social contacts."
"Alongside people with disabilities, there are approximately 100 million elderly people in the EU, and this figure - as we know from demographic statistics - is set to climb even higher."
"Elderly people are particularly reliant upon public transport."
"It is estimated that about 50 % of these people do not have a private car at their disposal."
"It must be made possible for all of them to gain easy access to public transport, thereby saving them from the threat of isolation."
"However, it also makes sense, from the economic point of view, to invest in the additional costs of removing the various obstacles."
"The assertion that this is too expensive is simply wrong."
"According to the most recent calculations, it does not even amount to 10 % of the total investment."
"Offset against this is a large number of potential new users, if obstacle-free design enables them to use the service."
"I appeal to all Members to vote for the amendments to the report, in order to make integration something which is there for all to see and experience."
"Mr President, I add my congratulations and approval of this report and I praise Simon Murphy for the assiduous and sensible way in which he has crafted this proposal."
"At the same time I acknowledge the work the Commissioner has played in it too."
"The details contained in the report, as has already been said, are the result of extensive consultation with all the key interest bodies."
"The report has gained approval from very diverse organizations: from manufacturers and industry, trade union representatives as well as consumer and disability groups."
"During the passage of this report through EMAC the depth of the research into detail that Simon Murphy had carried out was evident to all of us."
"It is a proposal for a Council directive which takes a positive step towards the completion of the single market and at the same time provides a framework for the harmonization of construction standards between all Member States which in itself will engender and encourage trade between them."
"Important though these aspects are, the prime reason why the citizens of Europe will recommend the Murphy report is the emphasis it rightly places on safety and accessibility for everyone."
"Getting on and off buses is the point at which most accidents happen, especially to those who are vulnerable."
"Alongside the recommendations of low-floor buses, buses which in effect kneel at the kerbside to give easier access, many other safety features are contained in this report."
"All of these will make all of our travel, on coach or bus safer and more risk free."
"Let me underline once again that this directive will only apply to new buses and will not threaten double-decker buses or Routemaster buses."
"Tomorrow we vote in this House and I hope we will keep the integrity of the Murphy report with its focus on helping passengers with reduced mobility, disabled people, the elderly, small people, parents with children and pushchairs and - dare I say, Commissioner - nimble grannies-to-be who, in the very near future, could be the beneficiaries of this report and be grateful to it."
"Finally, and unsurprisingly, need I remind the Commissioner that very similar transport modes already exist in my constituency of Northamptonshire and Blaby where buses have been pioneered with great success which do just what the Murphy report recommends: low-floor buses which kneel to let people on and off are already a feature of our local travel and much welcomed by the users."
"The Murphy report is splendid and prepares the way for better and safer public transport in the future."
"Parliament would be well-advised to give it splendid and resounding support tomorrow and I am confident it will."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I am very impressed by Mr Murphy's work."
"He is dealing with an extremely complicated directive, but he has clearly mastered it down to the smallest detail."
"I also appreciate the rapporteur's clear main thrust for amendments, which is to make it easier for disabled people to have access to public transport."
"However, I would still question whether this type of directive should really be dealt with in such a detailed way in this Parliament."
"It is still an extremely complicated directive with a lot of diagrams and formulas which are extremely difficult to understand for people other than experts."
"I wonder whether the best solution for any similar reports in future would not be to make a statement of principle and then leave it to the experts to work out the details."
"I may be wrong, but allow me just as an amateur in this area to point out some things which surprise me a little."
"These include, for example, Amendment No 54 from Mr Murphy."
"It discusses the fact that the text on buses showing the destination should be white or yellow on a black background and at least 12 cm high."
"It is possible that this is the most readable at the moment, but it is quite conceivable that a technology may be developed tomorrow which makes it best for the visually impaired to have a black text on a white background."
"I wonder if it would not be better just to say that people should use the best available technology."
"The same amendment also says that the destination should be announced by recorded voice, inside and outside the bus, when the bus stops at bus stations etcetera."
"In the bus I can understand, but should the destination also be announced by a loudspeaker outside the bus too?"
"I think that would lead to a terrible racket in many towns where there are a lot of buses."
"In addition, it says that the voice should be recorded."
"In Sweden we have buses which travel perhaps 300-400 kilometres and may stop only two or three times on the route because we have such large distances between towns and villages."
"In that case it might be simpler for the driver to do as he does today, which is to say that we have now arrived at Burträsk or wherever it may be."
"Another matter which does not relate to any amendment, but which is part of the directive itself and is mentioned in Amendment No 87, concerns the fact that when buses have a wheelchair lift they should have three flashing lights and an audible signal when the lift is in operation."
"With current technology such wheelchair lifts cannot be controlled remotely from the driver's seat because it is too dangerous."
"That means that the driver must go out and stand by the wheelchair when it is raised."
"I therefore wonder again whether it is necessary to introduce a requirement for an audible signal when this happens."
"Lights may be appropriate, but audible signals are perhaps a bit doubtful."
"As I said before, I am an amateur on the question of such technical matters. They were just a few comments."
"I would like to return to my initial point which is that I think that, given the difficult material, Mr Murphy has done an excellent job."
"Mr President, it is now two years since we in this Parliament passed the lift directive which was setting a precedent that legislation for Europe's single market could and must be used to enable access for disabled people."
"That precedent was then enshrined by agreements within the Treaty of Amsterdam, the draft Treaty of European Union."
"Tonight we face our next test in addressing the buses and coaches directive and addressing too an issue which is most campaigned about amongst Europe's 35 million disabled people - the right to accessible public transport."
"I congratulate Simon Murphy on this report and the amendments which he has tabled."
"These are important amendments which everyone in this Parliament should support."
"The amendments ensure that the definition of disability is not just one for wheelchair users but for all disabled people, including blind people and deaf people, and, as my colleague Mrs Schmidbauer has said, for pregnant women, people with children, people with heavy shopping, older people and others."
"There are many people who will benefit from that amendment."
"I call for support for the amendments which recognize specifically the needs of blind and partially-sighted people, including internal lighting and colour contrasts within buses and, for deaf people, to ensure visual displays for their information needs."
"I support Simon Murphy's amendment to extend the provision from Class 1 to Class 2 buses so that double-decker buses and tourist coaches also enable disability access."
"Even if the Commission tonight opposes the extension of this directive to inter-urban services, it should give us a clear commitment in advance to implement the study which it has launched."
"I hope the Commissioner will respond directly to this point tonight."
"I call on Parliament to support our amendments to reduce the initial step height to 24 cm or to ensure a boarding aid."
"These are the only standards which genuinely ensure access for disabled people."
"After all, this is only consistent with the findings of the research on low-floor buses which was published by the Commission itself as long ago as 1995."
"I would appeal to the right of the Parliament, the Group of the European People's Party, to join us in supporting the amendment but I look in vain for its presence here tonight and for its contribution to this debate."
"Instead, I send a simple message to disabled people in Europe."
"This proposal has been delayed in Brussels because of the long fight which has been engaged to ensure that all new buses in our towns and cities from the year 2001 will offer full rights of access for disabled people."
"It is a very significant victory and one that I commend to the House tonight."
"Mr President, many years ago the European Community introduced pan-European standards for tractor seats."
"We are still waiting for a solution for the electric plug."
"We have gathered a great deal of experience in the field of standardization, and we have also been punished very severely for a great deal of our standardization, for example the angle of curvature of bananas."
"Today we are talking about standardization in the case of vehicles for the carriage of passengers."
"This is a very important area."
"At this point, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Murphy, for his impressive commitment and his understanding of the detailed solutions mentioned."
"The Group of the European People's Party largely supports these results, particularly as regards persons with reduced mobility."
"I myself have proposed in committee that the definition of disabled should be made more specific and that it should be extended."
"We are in favour of the use of boarding aids even for Class II vehicles, appropriate forms of handrails, entrances, luggage racks and special destination displays, in order to make the use of buses both possible and practical for disabled persons."
"Our concerns lie in a different direction, however."
"From today we are no longer regulating just tractor seats."
"The European Parliament is about to design the perfect bus."
"More than 100 amendments on technical details have been tabled."
"There is mention of a radius of between 2.5 mm and 5 mm for corners, of retractable steps, of obvious markings on edges and even of hot drink vending machines and cooking equipment."
"In our view, we must, however, distinguish between political initiatives and questions of technical standardization."
"The latter should be dealt with by appropriate committees of experts, such as standards institutions - for example, the CEN - in other words, by specialists who build and/or use the buses."
"We are therefore also convinced that some important political points must be addressed."
"In this area, a SLIM initiative should also be implemented, which concentrates on the essential political aspects."
"We believe that, above all, the proposals concerning the safety of vehicles and/or the accessibility of vehicles for the disabled, in Appendix 7, which go beyond those of the Commission, are sensible."
"However, we should have a debate where it makes sense to do so; namely, in a technical committee."
"That is also the reason why the Group of the European People's Party will tomorrow propose that it should be referred back to the relevant committee."
"We believe that the extent of the debate should be clearly reduced, but should be all the more specific, so that it can contribute further to a proper standardization of this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we speak today about a new bus directive which contains special regulations for the carriage of passengers with reduced mobility, we should bear in mind, particularly in view of the recent debate about increasing road safety - after all, 1.6 million people suffer often permanent injuries in accidents - that we could in fact ourselves be one of them tomorrow. We too would then have to cope with living as a disabled person."
"At present there are about 37 million disabled people living in the European Union."
"But it is not only they who often have problems with the use of public transport."
"We must think of everybody: of elderly people with mobility problems, of small children, or of those in particular situations, such as, for example, pregnant women or passengers carrying luggage or pushchairs."
"To that extent, I support the social aim of the directive."
"It deals with the right aspect, namely that of safety, but in respect of certain detailed solutions goes much too far in its regulation."
"We must not absolve companies from their own responsibilities to seek the best solutions."
"Such solutions could be of a technical, but also of a logistical nature. Bus manufacturers already demonstrate in fact their great capability in respect of safety."
"I am at all times very happy to support demands for equality of opportunity for people with reduced mobility."
"However, I reject nonsensical and exaggerated regulations on detail."
"The responsibilities which lie with the European Committee for Standardization, business and, in terms of subsidiarity, even with local authorities, should not be brought together by us under the umbrella of the EU Commission."
"I therefore consider demands for 4 metre ramps at the entrance and exit of buses to be completely ill-considered."
"Political demands and objectives which call upon both manufacturers and operators of buses alike to seek, in equal measure, innovative solutions, seem to me to be more suitable for doing something for the disadvantaged than rigid European standards which apply from Finland to Sicily."
"Although the problems of disabled people across the European Union are comparable, the Member States must take into account climatic, territorial, traditional and other specific conditions in their efforts to procure a real place in their midst for disabled people."
"Mr President, I do not wish to make the same mistake as my friend Karel van Miert and I should therefore like to thank Mr Murphy very sincerely for his work, right at the start."
"It has already been said during the discussion that this is a difficult report because it deals with a whole series of technical questions and an attempt had to be made to find a compromise in many respects."
"I should, therefore, like to concern myself particularly with the questions which were directed at the Commission and from which it can be seen that a number of demands are being made."
"First, I should like to refer to the fact that there are two different starting points for this directive."
"One proposal is to create the Single Market by means of a type approval system."
"For this we need precise regulations, because only such precise regulations can lead to the approval of a type."
"Nothing can be allowed to remain unclear in such type approvals."
"We need standardization of the technical regulations at Community level."
"With undertakings like this a certain complexity sometimes cannot be avoided."
"I am quite sure that our proposal is already being seized upon in the press as another example of over-zealous bureaucracy."
"If we were to adopt all the amendments tabled - and I believe there are 120 - we would be at even greater risk."
"In this I must agree with some of the speakers."
"We can, of course, overdo this sort of specialization and attention to detail and then still not achieve what we actually set out to do."
"A certain willingness to compromise is necessary here."
"However, we also want to solve the safety problems."
"Not only do we want to aim for the highest possible level of safety for vehicles in general, but we also want to guarantee that disabled people - however one wants to define this term, that is, persons whose mobility is reduced - can use these vehicles safely."
"These are our aims."
"If we now look at the amendments tabled, they can be roughly divided into three groups: firstly, there are the amendments which correct mistakes made by the Commission or propose better technical regulations."
"That is, as ever, very desirable and we are pleased that we can adopt all 22 amendments here, without reservation."
"I do not wish to read out the numbers of the amendments now."
"We have them here; if it interests you, you can look at them afterwards."
"Then we have a group, which make alterations or additions to the proposed technical requirements and finally a third group, which proposes fundamental alterations in respect of sensitive points."
"Here we may quote as an example the derogation provided for by the Commission for the special situation in the United Kingdom and Ireland."
"I should like to thank those British colleagues who praised us for taking this exceptional situation into account. And what is more, against all expectations, according to those well-known serious British newspapers where alarm reports were published, after an attempt to ban fish and chips, we also wanted to ban double-deck buses."
"We did not do so."
"I hope that we shall be appropriately praised by this press."
"However, I draw attention to the fact that this is also a compromise between a national tradition and safety requirements, regardless of how much I can appreciate the pleasure of our British colleagues."
"Anyone would probably concede that a doubledeck bus is not exactly the safest kind of bus, and it is clear that this type of bus can only be accessed with great difficulty by disabled persons."
"It is evident from this that with all these problems, we are always moving in a direction which represents a compromise."
"We have in fact done so."
"We did not go as far as Mr Murphy's request, that we should, to a certain extent, recognise it as a type."
"We therefore also provided for the possibility that other Member States might not permit this type of bus, which is approved in another Member State, in their sovereign territory, because they do not have this tradition."
"We would like to continue to regard this as a derogation."
"We then have two further amendments which we can adopt in part, and two amendments where we can adopt the substance."
"What we cannot accept - and I want to say this here very clearly - are other technical proposals or an extension to other categories, as it is our opinion that what we have created here can hopefully go through in the Council."
"We are not quite sure about that; in other words, we are still talking amongst ourselves here."
"I fully understand if Parliament says that at the moment, it should like to assess another position but does not wish to adopt this one."
"Whether or not it is very wise to reject this proposal, I leave to the wisdom of this House, in which I have boundless trust, of course."
"I should like however to note that we have already come a long way and what is more, after a very long time."
"That has also been said."
"If maybe the Commission's proposal, apart from the amendments which we can accept, is approved without too many more additions, we shall make even more progress."
"On the aspect of safety we have also reached a compromise, as a difference must be made between buses which are used predominantly on short routes, where rapid boarding and alighting is necessary for the bus to make reasonable headway, and other buses."
"These buses stop very frequently, because of which accessibility is very much more to the forefront than with a bus which, for example, travels long distances, is mainly fitted with seats and does not stop very often."
"Boarding this kind of bus may well require more time."
"We want, however, to examine this class too."
"I can confirm that we have already put this investigation in hand, so that we can perhaps deal with these further demands."
"I would ask you to understand that in our case a role was played by our efforts to avoid imposing financial burdens, arising from excessive demands on the operating companies, particularly those in the public sector."
"We must remember that we are not usually dealing with private companies here, but with towns or regions which have to use public means of finance and cannot therefore avoid cost pressures."
"We are convinced that with this multi-level concept, we have proposed a solution which is acceptable."
"We assume that it is realistic to prescribe access for persons with reduced mobility for all vehicles of Class I from the time the directive comes into force."
"Without standardized regulations, there is an acute danger for the Single Market, as some Member States have already begun to put together their own regulations."
"As far as the other classes of vehicle are concerned, we shall, as already mentioned, submit a proposal on the basis of the ongoing investigation as soon as possible to the European Parliament and the Council. The proposal based on this study also amends the directive, with technical requirements for Class II vehicles, which are used for both urban and scheduled long-distance transport."
"That is our position."
"I know that it does not meet all the requirements which have been expressed here."
"I do not know what Parliament will decide tomorrow, but we are in the first phase here and we should really do what we always do."
"If you believe, with a majority, that you have to adopt a different position, you can do so, but do not shoot the pianists, in other words, us."
"We have to play this tune to the Council and hope for its applause."
"I do hope, however, that we can then arrive at improvements during subsequent proceedings, which perhaps go more along your lines."
"In any case, it should not founder in the Commission."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his comments and I note in particular his comments on double-decker buses being less safe or less accessible."
"If he has a couple of hours to spare he could come with me to Birmingham, which has the busiest route for buses and coaches anywhere in Europe, and join me on the only two low floor double-decker buses actually in operation in Europe which would meet these standards and more."
"So if you have a couple of hours I will take you on a journey to the West Midlands."
"Of course I accept your invitation."
"My only point was that, if the situation is as you say, why are you asking for an exception to be made for these buses?"
"Why can they not fall under the general rules?"
"Mr President, I must just correct in that case."
"Under my proposals the derogation would actually be removed and those vehicles would be treated just the same as any other because I happen to believe they are as safe and secure for passengers as other types of vehicle."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Trading of goods"
"The next item is the report (A4-0102/98) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) amending I. Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States (COM(97)0252 - C4-0248/97-97/0155(COD)) andII."
"Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, with specific reference to the nomenclature of products, SLIM and Intrastat (COM(97)0275 - C4-0257/97-97/0162(COD))."
"Mr President, we all know here that statistics are somewhat unpopular, particularly in the eyes of those who have to supply the data."
"In 1993, when the Single Market came into force and border controls were abolished, the consequence was the elimination of the corresponding VAT declarations and of the statistics whose reliability was assured by the customs departments."
"Intrastat was created."
"Its main objective, for all those involved, namely the national and Community administration companies, is to supply, at least cost, reliable and up-to-date statistics on the transfer of intra-Community goods."
"Companies, particularly small and medium-sized companies, were not enamoured with this."
"The introduction of Intrastat gave rise to a consideration of the way in which the suppliers' task could be simplified, of how to reduce costs for those on whom the burden of statistical information falls, as the smaller the company, the higher the relative cost of the administrative burden."
"As regards reliability, it must unfortunately be said, five years on, that the operation of Intrastat is not satisfactory, in spite of the fact that the total annual cost for the 450 000 companies making declarations is estimated at ECU 500 million to which is added ECU 100 million for operations by national collectors."
"This lack of reliability is illustrated by what in technical jargon is known as ""mirror statistics' , which comes from the high inconsistency of the results."
"Thus, this simulation exercise, which involves replacing the incoming goods for each Member State with the amounts of outgoing shipments to the fourteen others, proved, that for 1996 for example, imports for Germany must be increased by ECU 19 billion, and for France by ECU 11 billion."
"For Germany, this means that the balance of trade surplus is reduced to zero, and for France, its deficit increases from ECU 7 billion to ECU 18 billion."
"We have before us, Mr President, two proposals which arise from the SLIM initiative."
"Unfortunately, they do not represent all the proposals of the SLIM team, which is why it is all the more astonishing that these proposals were favourably welcomed by the Commission and the Council."
"Furthermore, the Member States do not even seem to be ready to follow these proposals, which are less extensive in comparison to the SLIM results."
"Throughout the drafting of my report I was approached by the lobbies of the major industrial federations who are concerned that the small step towards simplification proposed in the field of nomenclature might result in the loss of information which they believe to be indispensable for their commercial policy, and which they could only procure through a great many costly surveys."
"I wanted to highlight these divergent, and even antagonistic interests of the various players. In other words, there is, on the one hand, the small and medium-sized companies who want significant relief in terms of the burden of making declarations, and on the other, the users of the statistics who want detailed and high quality information on intra-Community trade to be made available."
"However, things being as they are, and after organizing in committee a hearing on these antagonists, I have proposed amendments aimed at reconciling their interests, amendments which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs accepted, Commissioner, as a block and on a unanimous basis."
"We wish to avoid completely the situation whereby these regulations end up having less of an impact in terms of simplification as compared to the Commission's initial proposal."
"On the other hand, we do have a great deal of sympathy for the federations and industries whose concern is that the simplification of the nomenclature might end up with a depletion of statistics which will no longer allow an analysis of the markets."
"You know that I am very interested in viticulture, Mr Martin."
"A reduction in the suppositions from 8 to 6 would no longer effectively give the necessary detailed information, namely the type of wine, red or white, or the region of origin."
"What is important for this product, is not the same for others."
"For example, for the centrifugal pumps, it is not absolutely necessary to know whether they are intended for aircraft, or whether they are submersible, single-stage or multi-stage pumps, and so on."
"Our proposal therefore is to limit the burden of declaration by eliminating unnecessary data, such as the means of transport, and optional data, to limit the number of small and medium-sized companies required to supply detailed statistical data, and to simplify the use of the combined nomenclature, while preserving a single nomenclature for intra-Community trade and trade with third countries. We also propose establishing a partnership with national administrations and the representatives at European level of the suppliers and users of statistical information, as well as preserving, within the framework of this partnership, a sufficient time limit for the provision of information, in order to meet the special requirements of certain sectors, such as the wine sector which I illustrated."
"We also clearly accept the need to preserve the level of information on intra-Community trade, and our action is satisfactory in the eyes of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"We know that all this is not a true reform of the system."
"It is a first step, Mr President, a first package of measures to be implemented pending more radical simplification."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for all of the companies and administrations in the Member States of the European Union, the entry into force of the single market has meant an upheaval for the administrative practices involving the trade in goods between Member States."
"VAT declarations and statistics, which were previously dealt with by customs services have been changed. However, of course, the need for such information has not thereby disappeared."
"In this report, Mrs Lulling points out that it is essential for the data to be reliable."
"Hence the export figures of one Member State should normally equal the sum of exports from the other Member States to the Member State in question."
"However, the total discrepancy is in the order of 4.6 %."
"Depending on which figure you use, the French trade deficit of ECU 6.4 billion would be more than doubled."
"However, given the need to simplify the administrative burden on companies, the Commission is presenting us with two proposals, which enable us to simplify these declarations."
"With this goal in mind, we must certainly welcome the Commission's initiative."
"The amendments proposed by the rapporteur all go in this direction, and I support them."
"However, along with several of my colleagues, I wanted to table a further amendment."
"In fact, modifying the nomenclature must not reduce the information which is required, both for companies and professional organizations."
"Changing the number of figures in the nomenclature from eight to six could lead to the elimination of an essential element."
"In the case of wine, as Mrs Lulling reminded us a moment ago, it would no longer be possible to dissociate intraCommunity trade from one Member State to another Member State, be it Bordeaux, Burgundy, vins de pays, Champagne, etcetera."
"The purport of my amendment is therefore to call on the Commission to ensure that these amendments do not lead to any such loss of information."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, I first want to congratulate Mrs Lulling on her constant work in the area of statistics which, as we know, is a fairly thankless task."
"But those of us who follow her efforts are bound to appreciate them, because they provide something which will obviously be needed with the new economic and monetary dimension being adopted by the European Union."
"As we have discussed in other reports on statistical matters, we obviously need to have reliable information in order to orientate activities and economic and monetary policies."
"Mrs Lulling has the unanimous support of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy for the amendments she makes to the Commission's proposals. Her report deals with a situation which she knows how to balance perfectly: eliminating excessive burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises; maintaining the reliability of the necessary figures, so as not to lose the proper information; and maintaining the other information we have at present - also referred to in her report -, namely the regional aspect of statistics."
"In other words, as when we were talking about the wine sector, for example, we have to take account of the various grape and wine-growing regions of the European Union - and I could, for example, add Penedés to the list we heard earlier. In those regions, knowledge of the exchanges within the EU markets is obviously extremely valuable, not just in order to establish the appropriate EU trade policies, but also so that companies can decide on their commercial strategies."
"So I repeat our support for the amendments tabled by Mrs Lulling, and congratulate her once again on her work."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.00 p.m)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Tuesday, 31 March 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to refer to pages 20 and 21 of the English version concerning Question Time and the conduct of Question Time."
"In particular, I would like to hear your views on this latest edict that has been passed down from on high regarding the rules governing Question Time."
"It seems to me to be excessively bureaucratic; it seems to me to be excessively undemocratic; and it seems to me that it is imposing censorship on Members and their questions."
"So I would like to know what was the rationale behind it, given that political groups have not discussed this; and I am asking you, as the person in charge of the organization here, to make a clear and categorical statement of why you arrived at this decision and whether it will be kept under review."
"It is very clear, Mr McMahon."
"On the proposal of the Vice-President who chairs Question Time some rules - not new rules, but measures to organize Question Time better - were adopted by the Bureau."
"The aim is simply to avoid questions being put months in advance, because then they lose their topicality."
"The period fixed in the rules runs from the end of one partsession's Question Time to some hours before the next part-session; and we simply remind you that this is the period fixed, not some months in advance."
"These are not new rules."
"If anyone thinks there has been a change in the rules, which of course is not the case, I will submit the question to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"It is very simple: the intention of the Bureau was not at all to change the rules, it was simply to have better ways of dealing with Question Time, on the proposal of the Vice-President in charge, namely Mr Gutiérrez."
"Mr Wijsenbeek, you are an expert on the rules: you ought to know that it is not the Bureau which places the reports on the agenda, but the Conference of Presidents."
"There were many reports from the Rules Committee and two of them have been put on the agenda of this session specially to make up this delay which is due to the many items this House has to deal with. So your report will come up as soon as the Conference of Presidents can find a place for it on the agenda."
"There is no discrimination against any report, and this afternoon I will be seeing the chairman of the committee at his request, precisely to consider the best time for its inclusion on the agenda by the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, I was interested in your reply to Mr McMahon when you said that if there was any alteration to the rules or the procedures you would obviously refer them to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"Given my interest in the voting in this Parliament during lunchtime, perhaps it is too late for that matter to be referred to the Rules Committee."
"However, given that this is the last month that this will take place, can you give me and this House an assurance that any changes which are to take place regarding Members' interests will be put to the Members of this House the way the change in the Members' voting procedure should have been put to this House in January?"
"Of course, if there is any doubt you may be assured that we will refer it to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities and we will await its decision before introducing any changes."
"Mr President, I rise on another matter but it does concern the role of the Conference of Presidents."
"This concerns the Pex report on information policy, which we tried to put on the agenda for this part-session and which was then going to be on the agenda for the part-session at the end of next month."
"However, I understand that you, as President, have taken that off the agenda and have refused to have this circulated for translation so that Members can read what the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media has decided."
"We in the Committee on Budgets are concerned because we need this report to release funds to enable the information policy to continue to operate."
"I would like your guidance on what is going on, because, once again, it seems to be a suppression of the interests of the Members of this House."
"Mr Elles, you have been wrongly informed."
"I have not taken anything off the agenda because I cannot do so."
"Simply, this report, like any other report, when it is drafted is examined by the services of the House."
"As there was some doubt about its admissibility - taking into account that it was submitted rather late - the Conference of Presidents, the body empowered to take a decision, took the decision to wait until next month, May, so that it could examine it to see whether it was admissible or not."
"My view is that this report goes against the rules of the House and the Treaties."
"The Conference of Presidents will examine it tomorrow and take what decision it feels appropriate."
"You know that no report is circulated until it is put on the agenda."
"Until questions on admissibility are settled, reports are not circulated."
"So this report has not been treated differently."
"Mr President, out of respect for you I have kept quiet this week about this matter, but now that it is being raised I would like to make some comments, otherwise you might think I agree with you."
"Firstly, this report was discussed openly; a number of people from your services attended the discussions."
"It is therefore extremely strange that its admissibility was not examined until a few days before this part-session."
"Secondly, your Secretary-General told me on the telephone last week that the report presents no difficulties."
"This was before the Conference of Presidents had their meeting."
"Thirdly, I take exception to the fact that it was you who blocked the report, so that I was not able to defend myself as rapporteur."
"If you are now saying in this sitting that the report goes against the Treaties, then I would like Members to be able to read the report, so that they can see for themselves what, according to you, is questionable."
"Blocking my report makes it impossible for me to defend myself, and I do not think this is a procedure which befits a democratic organization."
"I consider this censorship, Mr President."
"Finally, the issue here is communication."
"I have noted that the Bureau's external communications are extremely poor."
"My report therefore deals with improving this situation."
"Some will find this very hard to take, but I have to say that I find the internal communications even worse, because everything you have just said I only hear from you today."
"Nobody in your services consulted me over the past two weeks, and I find that deplorable."
"Mr Pex, I can state categorically that I myself, in the presence of other people, warned you about this several months ago."
"You carried on with your report without taking account of either the Rules of Procedure or the Treaties."
"Furthermore, I do not need to tell you about the Treaties."
"Just like any other Member of this House, you should know them, and the Rules of Procedure too."
"However, this is not a question for me to decide on, Mr Pex."
"It is a matter for the Conference of Presidents, and they will decide on it tomorrow."
"This is not my problem."
"All I have to do is advise the Conference of Presidents that, in my opinion, this is an infringement of the Treaties and the Rules of Procedure."
"We shall see, that is all."
"Your report has been dealt with, Mr Pex, and I am not going to continue this discussion because it is not a matter for the House to decide on at the moment, since it is not on the agenda."
"Your report has been treated in exactly the same way as other reports - no more, no less."
"No report is granted any privileges, whether it comes from your committee or from any other."
"Every report is examined, and if there are problems relating to the rules they are studied and resolved by the appropriate body, which is not the President but the Conference of Presidents. Then, if there is a discrepancy, it is referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"That is all."
"If you do not think it is good enough, then present the Rules Committee with a proposal to amend our Rules of Procedure."
"You can do that, just like anybody else."
"Mr Pex, I am going to let you speak because I do not want it said that I insisted on having the last word on this matter."
"Thank you for your explanation, Mr President."
"I would like to make one comment on what you have said."
"You told me about your objections a few months ago."
"I did take these into account."
"The text we had, and discussed at the time, is nowhere to be found."
"I changed the report, and subsequently 126 amendments were tabled."
"That is why it so regrettable that the text is not public, because the report before us now is a completely different text to the one we discussed a few months ago."
"So reproaching me for not having listened to you is not right."
"Mr Pex, I am not reproaching you about anything."
"I do not reproach any Member of this House who acts in accordance with their convictions."
"I am simply trying to determine whether your report is admissible or not."
"If it is, it will be published."
"If not, it will be sent to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities so they can report on the matter."
"In any case, the honourable Members can quite easily find out which of the amendments to your report have and have not been accepted."
"Mr President, I wanted to comment regarding the vote on Mrs Theato's report."
"A large majority, virtually all of the House, voted for the report under what were perfectly satisfactory conditions and thus there is not the slightest question of challenging what has already been voted for."
"However, it should be noted that the conditions under which this vote took place may raise questions regarding its future interpretation."
"As there was some dispute regarding corrections of a linguistic nature, the President of the sitting, Mr Cot, understandably wanted to put those corrections to a vote as he considered they could pose a fundamental problem."
"There was undoubtedly a fundamental problem and it would have consequently been preferable to have an oral amendment enabling harmonization of the different linguistic versions."
"However, the corrections were put to the vote and rejected, with the result that there is now a significant difference between many of the translations on a point which, although certainly not crucial, is not negligible either."
"The President did not use the powers bestowed upon him by Article 102 of the Rules of Procedure."
"In the case of differences between linguistic versions, it is within his powers to determine which version should be considered adopted, either the original language version - in this case German - or one of the other versions."
"We will therefore be faced with a problem in the future."
"I would like to request two things, Mr President."
"Firstly, that the question of whether the President of a sitting can or cannot put linguistic corrections of a technical nature to the vote be submitted to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"Secondly, that the Committee on the Rules of Procedure be asked to clarify which linguistic version prevails when there are linguistic differences between the texts."
"We cannot take texts to the outside world when they exist in different versions."
"Mr Bourlanges, it says in the Minutes, and I quote, ""the rapporteur withdrew the corrigendum' ."
"Thus if the rapporteur withdrew the corrigendum, there is absolutely no reason to consult the Committee on the Rules of Procedure since we did not take a vote on it."
"Mr President, I think you have covered the point I was going to raise but Mr Bourlanges is being deliberately, or otherwise, disingenuous in the point of order he has raised."
"I was the person who raised an objection to dealing with a matter of substance by way of a corrigendum."
"To change the words 'European Public Prosecutor' to 'European judicial authority' is not just a technicality, and I am sure you, Mr President, as a jurist understand the significance of those changes."
"If the words were incoherent in all languages other than German, it shows how ill-prepared the debate was in committee because we have debated all the way through on the use of those words 'European Public Prosecutor' ."
"But then, on the matter of substance, Mr Bourlanges is also wrong because it is in the recollection of everybody who followed it that Mrs Theato withdrew the corrigendum."
"This incident is closed."
"I am not going to give more time to it."
"We have a heavy agenda, and I am not continuing something which was closed yesterday by the President in the Chair."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Topical and urgent debate (objections)"
"Mr President, I am only commenting as a matter of interest, given that the vote has taken place, but I was surprised that the code of conduct for arms exports was included within the issue of human rights."
"It is not a question of human rights."
"It could have been a supplementary point within the framework of a topical debate, but certainly not a point connected with human rights."
"In the future, I would therefore like us to make sure that only questions truly relating to human rights violations are included in the category of ""human rights' ."
"Thank you very much, Mr Pasty."
"Development policy - Cooperation Agreements with ACP countries - Decentralized cooperation"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following documents:"
"Statement by the Council on development and cooperation policy; -Report (A4-0085/98) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission on guidelines for the negotiation of new cooperation agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries (COM(97)0537 - C4-0581/97); -Recommendation for second reading (A4-0096/98), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Regulation on decentralized cooperation [C4-0008/98-95/0159(SYN)] (Rapporteur: Mr Vecchi)."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to report on behalf of the Presidency on progress in international development policy."
"I met the Committee on Development and Cooperation for a discussion in January and hope to meet it again to report on the outcome of the Development Council which will be meeting shortly."
"One of the major priorities for our Presidency is settling the mandate for the Lomé renegotiation."
"As you all know, Lomé is one of the major foreign policy instruments of the European Union."
"It is the basis for the trade, development and political relationship between the Union and 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"The current convention expires in the year 2000 and the renegotiation is due to start in September 1998."
"There has been a process of considerable and very useful consultation which has started to build growing agreement about what the next phase of Lomé should be about."
"The Commission produced some very useful proposals at the end of January."
"The General Affairs Council has twice discussed the Lomé renegotiation and has agreed that there is a need to strengthen and revitalize the relationship, that there should be - and this is uncontentious - a new concentration on systematic poverty eradication."
"There is a need to strengthen and revitalize the political relationship to work to create a new spirit of partnership, and a need to simplify the agreement and not have so many complex sources of funding but be able to programme resources, give priority to very poor countries and reward successful developments."
"This is needed to simplify what is currently a very complex agreement."
"There is also agreement that there needs to be more support for good progress on human rights, good governance and more emphasis on conflict prevention and resolution."
"Most of that is broadly agreed across all the Member States."
"Trade, as Parliament will know, is the most complex area and the area in which it is more difficult to reach agreement."
"However, at the General Affairs Council on Monday of this week it was agreed by all Member States that we all wanted to help integrate the ACP countries into the globalizing world economy so that the benefits of globalization would be shared across the planet."
"There was also agreement that we must at least maintain the current access of the ACP countries to the European market and that the agreement should seek to be World Trade Organization - compatible, that further work is needed on reciprocal free trade agreements on either a regional or a country basis, but we will also consider the possibility of enhanced GSP access for those countries that cannot or do not want to agree reciprocal free trade agreements."
"It is also agreed that the least developed countries' access must be improved in the way that the Council had previously agreed."
"As Parliament will know, there are a range of opinions among Member States but, hopefully, we now have a broad agreement that will bring significant trade benefits to the ACP countries."
"The next stage of these discussions will be at the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in April and my deputy, George Foulkes, will represent the Presidency there."
"In May there is the ACP-EU Council and I will be there to represent the Presidency and have discussions with the ministers representing the ACP countries."
"I reminded the General Affairs Council on Monday that the mandate is simply a basis for negotiations and that we need to take account of the ACP countries' views before finalizing the mandate."
"The second major priority of our Presidency is to seek to persuade the Union to shape our development strategy around the international poverty eradication strategy."
"Members will know that, as an outcome of the great UN conferences of the past fifteen years, there are now internationally agreed targets and strategies for making very significant and measured progress on poverty eradication, the overall target being to halve the number of people living in absolute poverty by 2015."
"It is agreed by everyone that this is affordable and achievable if we can mobilize enough international political will to make significant progress."
"Obviously, if the European Union embraces this strategy firmly, the possibility of mobilizing that international political will becomes much greater."
"We held a seminar jointly chaired by Commissioner Pinheiro and myself on 17 March which was attended also by Commissioner Marín, ministers or high-level representatives from most countries, and we reached conclusions which will be brought to the next meeting of the Development Council that will push forward agreement on that framework to shape the efforts of the European Union in development cooperation."
"Our third priority concerns the resolutions that have been passed previously on making the eradication of poverty and promotion of equality of women central to the European Union's development efforts."
"On both issues, both of which are absolutely key to progress in development, there is good policy and the problem is implementation."
"In the next meeting of the Development Council we shall be reviewing progress on implementation."
"Preparations are in hand for that."
"Obviously, as you all know, getting the policy right is one thing, but if we do not follow through on implementation we will fail to make progress."
"Beyond that, on humanitarian aid, a joint conference is being organized by Commissioner Bonino and the Overseas Development Institute in London, at which I shall be speaking about the ethics underpinning our humanitarian aid."
"You will all know that following Bosnia and Rwanda, we need to look carefully at the ethical principles when we distribute humanitarian aid."
"Otherwise, further errors will be made."
"On micro-finance, I know that there are very strong views and support in Parliament."
"Under the Luxembourg Presidency the Development Council set a path for further work and detailed work is taking place in the working party."
"I hope there will be internal guidelines soon that will enable progress to be made on that issue."
"In conclusion, the other theme for important work in the Development Council for our Presidency is to strengthen evaluation of the European Union's development efforts."
"Without strong evaluation one cannot get quality programmes."
"We are also carrying forward that work."
"I am optimistic that we will make major progress and that under our Presidency we will agree a useful mandate for the Lomé renegotiation and have broad agreement across the Member States and within the Commission for making the international poverty eradication strategy the framework for all our development efforts."
"That will enable us to improve the quality both in terms of prioritizing poverty eradication and improving the implementation of those priorities in practice."
"Mr Rocard, in future it would be a good idea to ask your group for a little speaking time as well."
"Mr President, as you know, I am presenting this report, standing in for Mr Vecchi, who has had to leave for family reasons."
"We have had to wait two years for the Council to establish its common position on the proposal for a regulation to provide a legal basis for the budget line with regard to support measures for decentralized cooperation, which was established in 1992, at Parliament's request."
"Despite all this, the Council has not reached any positive conclusions. It has expressed a narrower view of the function of decentralized cooperation and has substantially worsened the proposal for a regulation, put forward by the Commission and partially amended by Parliament at first reading."
"This is why the Committee on Cooperation and Development has unanimously adopted a package of 17 amendments which we are proposing to the House, in order to fully restore the position on which Parliament gave its opinion more than two years ago."
"In accordance with what the European Parliament and Mr Rocard have confirmed, decentralized cooperation is not, and should not be considered to be, simply one more measure in the field of development cooperation."
"Decentralized cooperation is a new vision of cooperation as a whole."
"We want to involve more people in cooperation and the object is to involve those who are not part of the central governments so that the measures taken are closer to the local populations and contribute towards strengthening the structures of civil society."
"This is the fundamental point."
"It is a contribution towards cultural dialogue, in various situations, and also to the processes of democratization."
"Owing to its characteristics, decentralized cooperation is very different from the usual methods of providing state aid for development, and yet the insufficient results obtained in this field have led us to consider new forms of cooperation."
"It must be said that the Council does not seem to have accepted this strategic challenge."
"It is in fact a question of moving the focus away from individual projects and towards those involved, in order to allow an adequate development of the human resources and the organizational capacity in developing countries."
"It would be better to achieve the objectives of cooperation based on the pursuit of human development, participation and sustainability."
"Achieving such cooperation includes the full involvement of those involved in decentralized development, such as the local authorities, people's organizations, community groups, non-governmental organizations, etcetera."
"This should lead to the development of an effective and widespread partnership between those in the North and the South."
"We are thinking, in particular, of cooperation between cities and regions, but also of the development of relations concerning technology transfer, between business associations, cooperatives and centres providing business services."
"To conclude, decentralized cooperation seems to be a privileged means of meeting the new challenges of development, particularly the fight against poverty and the development of the private sector, but also the protection of human and civil rights, which is so important."
"Contrary to what the Council seems to maintain, it is a sufficiently tested approach."
"We therefore believe that we need to move on from a marginal and experimental decentralized cooperation to its development as a priority, be it within the framework of external cooperation - Lomé Convention, MEDA Programme, and so on - or in the direct actions of the European Union."
"In this connection, I believe it highly important for the MED programmes to be relaunched if we also want to contribute towards the relaunch of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"These are the considerations which have given rise to the amendments tabled, which are aimed at giving decentralized cooperation a central position in development strategy."
"This is the reasoning behind this report and the amendments tabled."
"- (NL) Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights has noted with satisfaction that the Commission's understanding of issues can develop quickly."
"Whereas the Green Paper on relations between the European Union and the ACP countries only makes an oblique reference to the issue of gender, the communication which we are now discussing says that gender issues must be incorporated into all macro-economic, sectoral and project assistance."
"The Commission recognizes that there is a direct link between improving the position of women and the fight against poverty, that sustainable economic and social development cannot be realized without equality between men and women and that human rights are also women's rights."
"But the intention to incorporate gender issues into all policy areas is sadly not being realized."
"In those areas which are given most priority in the Green Paper, namely economic, financial and technical cooperation, not a single word is said about gender."
"This is unacceptable, and even a step backwards from the Council Resolution on Gender and Development adopted in December 1995 which used ""mainstreaming' as a starting point."
"The new development cooperation agreements must promote equality between men and women in all areas, not only political and social, but also economic."
"It must be clear to everyone that economic equality will exert influence over social structures and the balance of power within a country."
"A fairer partnership should therefore not only deal with the relations between the European Union and the ACP countries, but also with the distribution of power within a particular society."
"This means that we should have a coordinated and consistent policy of promoting equality between men and women, which is why the Committee on Women's Rights has argued for the ACP Assembly to establish a standing ""Women in Development' Committee."
"Mr President, may I first of all welcome the Secretary of State and thank her for her excellent overview and also, of course, thank Michel Rocard for his report."
"There are very serious and clear messages in this report."
"Although the political guidelines proposed by the Commission for negotiating the new cooperation agreements with the ACP provide a starting point for discussions on the renewal of our relationship, in too many areas I am afraid they are not much more than that."
"I hope that the Commission and the Council will note in particular the serious reservations expressed in this report about the trade proposal as it currently stands."
"We have used very strong words, ' is concerned that the Commission's proposal to negotiate regional free trade economic partnership agreements may be premature, impractical and lead to increased poverty and social tension in the ACP states' ."
"These reservations are expressed by the ACP themselves."
"I fear that the critical poverty targets clearly identified by the Secretary of State could be undermined by the weaknesses of the current trade proposal."
"Poverty eradication must, she says, be the overriding goal and should of course run through the entire agreement, including the trade section."
"We cannot afford to forget that trade liberalization and economic growth alone are not sufficient to reduce poverty."
"It is essential, therefore, that our commitment to poverty eradication, gender mainstreaming and conflict prevention should be fully integrated into the trade proposals, particularly in the context of the middle income countries."
"It is all very well for us to argue as we do for integration into the world economy."
"Of course we agree that this should happen, but we should also recognize that the preferred means of achieving this, namely WTO-compatible FTAs will carry with it very significant adjustment costs in what are, of course, extremely poor and vulnerable countries and economies."
"It is just not good enough in my view to argue that FTAs will eventually stimulate economic growth."
"Poor people live in the short term, in a day-today struggle to put food on the table."
"We must not therefore promote a solution which puts their livelihoods in danger."
"If by doing so we will be standing by the so-called commitment, we will not be standing by our commitments to attack poverty, to prevent conflict, as Michel Rocard says, and to promote gender equity."
"That is why I have consistently proposed the idea of a ten-year waiver to cover the current trade arrangements, so I am very pleased that the Rocard report has taken up this point."
"Mr Rocard also makes it very clear that the best solution is for the options currently on offer to be improved so that the ACP can be provided with real choices when any WTO waiver covering the current trade options expires."
"I urge the Council and the Commission to take on board the issues raised in the Rocard report."
"May I remind Parliament that today is 1 April, and as the Bureau has already received some very strange documents, may I ask Members not to start raising points of order concerning texts which, clearly, are traditional April Fool pranks."
"Mr President, this very long and detailed report follows on from the Martens report."
"For the first time the Commission communication allows Parliament to state its views on the guidelines put forward by the Commission for the negotiation of new cooperation agreements with the ACP."
"Much praise is due to Mr Rocard for this superb and detailed report."
"Even more pleasing is the fact that Parliament's views are closely aligned with the Commission's thoughts."
"Parliament has to consider two major questions: should ACP-EU cooperation continue after 2000 and, if so, in what form?"
"The answer to the first is a resounding 'yes' ."
"There should be a new and different relationship which adapts to the new world challenges and is based on a proper partnership."
"A number of areas have to be considered."
"Firstly, the Council agreed that the political scope for the ACP-EU partnership should be enhanced."
"This highlighted the fact that the development of ACP countries was first and foremost the responsibility of the peoples in those countries."
"This should be based on human development sustainability with sound macro-economic policies, social justice and the rule of law."
"The political consensus which has been reached on both sides is an understandable political choice in the face of the worldwide challenges of the 21st century."
"Increasingly rapid globalization will steadily reinforce economic, political and cultural dependencies but at the same time there will be a move towards regional cooperation and integration, particularly on the African continent."
"This in itself should lead to new forms of economic partnership."
"Poverty alleviation, popular economy, micro-credits and gender matters: all lead to conflict prevention within the regions."
"It is up to the ACP countries themselves to decide on the speed of change and their criteria for that change."
"One of the original features of the Lomé Convention was, on the one hand, including trade and, on the other, upholding provisions in this area designed to encourage the diversification and development of the ACP countries."
"The rules of the WTO were drawn up with complete disregard for the needs of developing countries, particularly the poorest, and this must be seriously addressed by both sides in the negotiations."
"Sadly, efforts to improve trade have not been successful and many developing countries have much reduced export trade compared with ten years ago."
"Regional cooperation should give them the strength to improve this situation."
"I am delighted to see that the Joint Assembly is now to be called the Parliamentary Joint Assembly as this will strengthen democracy, and my group fully supports this report."
"I wish to begin by welcoming this report by Mr Rocard."
"Apart from the normal aspirations, however, it brings us no closer to the future of Lomé after 2000."
"I support a strong political dimension to the new cooperation agreements with ACP countries, especially in the areas of human rights, good governance and the rule of law."
"I am entirely in favour of the struggle against poverty being the central theme of post-Lomé IV arrangements."
"I also support the mainstreaming of gender and the environment in all negotiations as a matter of course."
"Ireland has consistently emphasized the importance of the semi-integration of the ACP countries into the world economy and the compatibility of new trade arrangements with the World Trade Organization."
"Ireland considers market access to be of particular importance and will, for example, support the removal of remaining tariff barriers to the fullest possible extent."
"When negotiating EU-ACP agreements it is essential to stress the need for simplification and rationalization of aid instruments with a view to gradual evolution towards direct budgetary support for ACP countries."
"There is one extremely important issue that must be tackled in the framework of the new cooperation agreements and that is the issue of arms sales."
"In the European Union there is free movement of goods, services, persons and capital with full regulation and, indeed, competition checks."
"Compare this with the lack of European regulation or competition checks on arms movements from the EU to third countries."
"There appears to me and to many other people in my country to be a conspiracy of silence on this issue."
"A European Union arms export control agency should be set up in order to protect the human rights of the citizens of the ACP countries."
"We must recognize economic development, social development, environmental protection and human rights as mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development."
"I regret that the issue of arms exports has not been seriously addressed in the Rocard report."
"Mr President, the Rocard report before us is a good report on the orientation guidelines of future cooperation agreements."
"It is more than a report about the ACP."
"It refers to the post-Lomé period, and I think that here we should support a ten-year transition period."
"This is basically a report about the new framework for forming a new South-North policy."
"Mr Martens made a start on this in his report."
"Mr Pinheiro has introduced something new here, something very good, I think, by instituting a broad dialogue in the Member States in the run-up to the Green Paper."
"If a good policy is to come from this good report, I hope that we can convince the Council together with the Commission that its content must be put into effect politically."
"Mrs Short, this is a major task for you."
"However, in development policy, a basic contradiction can be identified in the European Union and also in this House."
"On the one hand we try to integrate ourselves and the ACP countries into the world market."
"We have accepted this with the WTO formula."
"We see the consequences at this moment in the discussion on bananas."
"On the other hand, we want to take account of the regional situation and drive development forward here."
"The regional situation is in the foreground in this report too, and I think that is right and important."
"Bilateral free zones are not what we must support."
"I therefore consider that paragraphs 59 and 77 of the motion for a resolution are important."
"The proposal in paragraph 59 is that the extension of the exceptional regulations for the ACP states is necessary, because development cannot happen otherwise in these countries, the poorest of the poor. We should put this proposal into effect."
"Paragraph 77 deals with the aims of development policy, the aims of development, about which we must jointly inform the WTO."
"I do not regard the WTO as a democratic institution."
"Consistency in trade relationships is necessary and appropriate."
"We should take note of that in respect of our fisheries policy, ecology and human rights."
"We and the ACP states should note that."
"Regionalization is an important starting point."
"It is a question of developing new instruments."
"I believe that support for the process of African unity is important."
"But we are creating our own contradictions there as well, in the MEDA programme for instance."
"Here too there is a need for consistency."
"I am glad that the amendments have been included in this proposal, that the Joint Assembly is explicitly mentioned, and I think that it must also be maintained to form the political process."
"Much too little is said about armaments policy, restriction of weapons sales and the effective control of the weapons trade."
"The Commission has made specific proposals here."
"That is to be welcomed."
"Making a link between the targets of armaments restriction and development in the health and education fields is something very important."
"The credibility of countries must be measured by this too."
"In view of the imminent failure of the code of conduct, I would like to point out that in Amendment No 18 we put forward many specific proposals, and I ask you to support this amendment, and also Amendment No 17, which concerns the prohibition of antipersonnel mines."
"It is a view expressed by this House and belongs in the Treaty."
"My colleague Mrs van Dijk has pointed out the problem of women, the role of women in the development process."
"There is much more to be added here too. There is more in it than in the Green Paper."
"The role of women must be more precisely defined, because they contribute to the development process."
"Partnership is an important precondition, including partnership with NGOs."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize again that we have always supported the budgetization of the European Development Fund."
"That should also be put into effect."
"I would like to have a reply from Mrs Short, on behalf of the Council about whether she will take the initiative, at the latest..."
"(The President made the speaker stand down.)"
"Mr President, at this stage in the debate I do not want to waste time repeating the content of the Vecchi and Rocard reports, which are both clearly excellent since the Committee on Development and Cooperation voted unanimously for them."
"I would merely like to refer to one aspect of Mr Rocard's report in order to highlight the interest the Group of the European Radical Alliance has regarding point 25 of the motion for a resolution."
"It relates to the possibility of countries who are recipients of aid themselves proposing the criteria relating to democracy and human rights which would need to be respected to avoid a suspension of European Union aid."
"We think that this innovative suggestion is particularly pertinent."
"On the one hand because it is in keeping with all our principles of intervention and, secondly, because it should prove to be more effective than the current measures."
"We can see that the partnership we have today between the Union and the ACP countries does not fully escape accusations of neo-colonialism since the practical rules and democratic conditions are still by and large formulated unilaterally by the European countries."
"The Rocard report proposes a break with this logic and we fully approve of this."
"But the idea of handing over responsibility for defining the partnership's minimum level of democratic content to the ACP countries is clever in that it should improve the effectiveness of the rules."
"Today European donors are naturally wary of punishing violations precisely because they do not want to lay themselves open to accusations of neo-colonialism."
"As a result you see relative democracy flourishing."
"Such a principle would be correct on this side of the Mediterranean but an error beyond it."
"From the ACP countries' point of view the advantage is equally important."
"Indeed, what happens at the moment?"
"An ACP country breaks the rules of democratic conditionality and immediately gets tacit support, I would even call it experienced complicity, from most of the other ACP countries."
"All in all they keep their heads down and wait for European disapproval to fade into general indifference."
"If the democratic criteria for aid are from now on defined by our partners, they themselves will be obliged to denounce violations and to apply sanctions."
"From now on it will be up to them."
"Perhaps this will be the occasion to deepen the dialogue on values mentioned in point 29 of the motion, from the basis of a respect for our differences."
"It is because we consider that some of these values are of a universal nature that the Radicals unreservedly support Mr Rocard's report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it cannot be denied that the results of the cooperation policy between the ACP countries and the European Union measure up neither to the frequently reaffirmed ambitions nor, above all, to the sums of money spent."
"You could be forgiven for wondering whether the eighth EDF, which is ECU 13 billion over the period 1995/2000, that is FF 85 billion, is or will be put to better use than the seven preceding ones. This financial aid has been rendered largely useless for three reasons."
"Firstly, the socialist model of development, which has been adopted by the majority of ACP countries, based on land collectivization and excessive industrialization. Secondly, corruption of leaders and nomenklatura, which have taken over control of a large part of aid funding."
"Thirdly, complexes amongst the European leaders, which render them incapable of commenting on these issues for fear of being branded neo-colonialists. But Michel Rocard himself, far from considering these three points and learning lessons from them, and whilst remaining faithful - let us recognize this - to his socialist ideology, proposes a policy which will be detrimental to the nations of Europe as well as to the people of the ACP countries."
"If he will excuse me, I will overlook the commonplace, the popularity-seeking proposals and pious wishes which fill his report for, what concerns us most in this expressed desire to renounce a development policy which remains under the control of Member States, is the substance."
"What does the honourable Member want?"
"The budgetization of the European Development Fund, which would thus no longer be under the control of our nations."
"Diplomatic and political links between supra-national bodies such as the European Union, on the one hand, and the African Economic Community, established in 1994, on the other."
"The importance given to nongovernmental organizations, about which a great deal could, however, be said and the integration of our overseas departments and territories into regional groupings, thus preparing the way for a separation of these territories from their mother country."
"We note that Michel Rocard is rightly concerned with the fateful logic that a free trade policy would have on the economic future of the ACP countries."
"But, in reality, he only proposes tinkering with the internationalist logic."
"His only positive point is the proposal for a productive return of immigrants who have come from the ACP countries, which is completely in line with our own position."
"To recap, in general, the Rocard report has unfortunately abandoned, to Brussels' advantage, a development policy which, although not perfect, enabled the Member States to continue to play a major role."
"But it is not through continually wanting to establish relations between blocs, it is not through globalization, it is not through bureaucratization that anything will be improved."
"The tragedy is that, despite all the failures, Mr Rocard never wearies of his utopia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rocard and Vecchi reports should be approved with firm conviction."
"Allow me to explain a few points."
"The aim in Article 130 u of the Treaty of Maastricht is global."
"Development cooperation should promote sustained development, particularly in the poorest countries, for the fight against poverty and a harmonious, step by step inclusion in the world economy."
"The emphasis here is on step by step."
"The Rocard report therefore points out that trade liberalization and economic growth alone are not enough to relieve poverty; there must also be access to resources and participation in decision processes."
"That applies particularly to the participation of women, but I am happy to be able to say that we women no longer have to emphasize this point, because it has in the meantime become the common property of this House."
"I would like to emphasize that in the course of the Lomé cooperation something like a Lomé culture has been formed, consisting of partnership, equal rights, maintenance of dialogue, mutual contractual relationships and accountability, and this means much more than efficiency aspects on the cost-benefit model."
"It is a mark of the Lomé culture that conditions are not just imposed on the contractual partners, but that efforts are made to ensure that the measures proposed are supported by the country concerned, in agreement with the governments and the population."
"Certainly participation on the part of civil society still leaves something to be desired."
"Above all, the equal right of women to have a say is lacking, as has been mentioned. The correct course has nevertheless been set."
"That is all the more important when not just economic but political reforms are concerned, and they must or should be in harmony with each other."
"Now, in a mature relationship it must be possible to say critical things, and if necessary to make use of sanctions, including the suspension of cooperation."
"The Lomé agreements include this possibility, but for good reasons it is only used with restraint, because it is always better to keep talking than to break off relations."
"I think that one particular aspect of cooperation within the agreement must be extended in future: close cooperation with nongovernmental organizations, particularly those which are active in the ACP countries, and not just with our organizations in the Member States."
"A cooperation strategy which is tailor-made for each situation must be developed, to pick out the special features of individual regions, regardless of whether their support is national, private or public."
"To a greater extent than was previously the case, the supporters of development policy can be part of a concept for the future which promises success."
"One of the special features of Lomé cooperation is regional cooperation, which has long been geared to supra-regional development."
"The same is true of the demand for the dynamic development of the private sector, to which increasing efforts have been applied in recent years."
"I would like to close with a quotation from my general report at the last ACP Assembly, which was accepted with a very large majority: ' By common efforts, development plans which are specific, social, staggered in time, adapted to the current state of development and the problem situation, regionally differentiated and consistent, must be established, with the answers which result for Lomé cooperation arising from the subjects of the big UN conferences.'"
"This should be our aim."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first, sincere thanks to both the rapporteurs."
"I regret that we cannot address them to Mr Vecchi in person."
"At last we have a debate about development cooperation, and we all know that does not happen often."
"In the case of the Vecchi report, it is rather a nuisance that it comes practically at the end of the process, and since the Treaty of Amsterdam has not yet been ratified, we have no possibility of ensuring that a series of proposals which have not yet been accepted will be included after all."
"Madam President-in-Office, I welcome very much your firm emphasis on the fight against poverty but I would ask you to include as an essential pillar, so to speak, of your deliberations, the question of a health policy with particular reference to the health of mothers and children."
"Year after year - we can almost say day after day - for thousands of women in developing countries, pregnancy is equivalent to a death sentence, because there is no way of combatting avoidable risks. This must not be allowed to happen."
"Here in this Parliament, we have a cross-party working party for reproductive health."
"So for us this is a special concern."
"A further point of which we must certainly be aware is the question of stable currencies."
"There is a special passage about it in the Rocard report."
"Commissioner, my special plea would be that we ensure with the appropriate structures that increasingly stable and above all convertible currencies are created in the developing countries."
"In this connection, I also draw your attention to the question of the CFA zone in the context of European Monetary Union."
"A minor error concerning this matter has crept into the report, and I ask the services to correct it."
"Paragraph 69 does not fit the context in which it appears. It ought to be inserted after paragraph 80."
"That is its proper place."
"This is my final point."
"Mr President, may I begin by congratulating Mr Rocard for the high quality of his report, and Mr Vecchi likewise."
"We wish to take this opportunity, as we did in connection with the Martens report, and with the 8th EDF, to restate our commitment to partnership between the ACP countries and the European Union."
"Indeed, as we approach the 21st century, we consider that a new, exemplary model should be laid down for this privileged relationship to which the countries of Europe have been committed since the outset of European construction."
"The Union for Europe Group considers that the overall thrust of the Commission's approach is correct."
"I say overall, because we do not consider the proposals relating to trade to be satisfactory."
"The UPE Group is of the opinion that the process of adapting and integrating regional markets must be monitored, for which reason it earlier suggested to the Committee on Development and Cooperation, which agreed, that the current trade regime should be maintained throughout a transition period to end no later than the year 2010. The Committee on Development and Cooperation agreed."
"The Commission has already agreed to extend the period from 3 to 5 years."
"We hope that, vis--vis the Council and the WTO, it will defend an extension of the transition period to 2010."
"In addition, our Group supports the Commission's guidelines and, like the rapporteur, welcomes the importance attributed to the regional and sub-regional integration process, provided that the integrity and unity of the ACP as a group is not affected."
"In that connection, we direct attention to our group's proposals that the overseas countries and territories and the ultra-peripheral regions should be involved."
"We welcome the objective of combatting poverty, which we consider to be a healthy and timely endeavour."
"We believe that the time has come to emerge from a rationale of strict conditionality and to concentrate on a more fruitful dialogue, with a view to assessing governments' endeavours in the areas of human rights, democracy and good governance."
"I will end, Mr President, by expressing the hope that the Joint Assembly, which is the prime instrument of political dialogue between the European Union and the ACP, will be strengthened."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to compliment Mr Rocard and Mr Vecchi on their reports, and the Commission on its guidelines for the negotiation of the new cooperation agreements."
"It is good news indeed that we have been able to confirm in no uncertain terms that we wish to pursue agreements with the countries concerned, and it is good news that we have got some of the key discussions under way on reforms - reforms that will be necessary if we are to get away from the post-colonial relationship of dependency between donor and recipient countries, if the position of women is to be improved, and so on. It is also excellent news that discussions are taking place on this agreement in the various Member States."
"However, I do deplore the fact that we have not managed to revise the list of countries covered by the Lomé Convention."
"The needs of countries, not their geographical placement or their historical affiliations with Member States of the Union, should be the governing factor in the amount of support they receive from the EU."
"The European Parliament should guarantee that in future, poor nations will be competing on a level playing-field as regards the distribution of EU support and access to EU markets."
"This should preferably be achieved through revision of the list of countries covered by the Lomé Convention, but could if necessary be achieved by assuring countries not covered by Lomé V that they will benefit from the same conditions in relation to EU support and equal access to EU markets, regardless."
"Mr President, could I welcome the President-in-Office here?"
"We are very pleased to see her as a frequent visitor to Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"We appreciate her commitment."
"She started her address by saying that we had to mobilize international political will."
"I think that is precisely the task that faces us because there is a lot of easy talk and yet we need to mobilize that political will."
"I commend in particular the cause of Jubilee 2000 which I think has caught the imagination of many people and which says, with a new millennium, let us cancel the debt of the poorest countries."
"This point is tucked away in paragraph 74 of Mr Rocard's excellent report but should be right up there in lights as one of the essentials in the alleviation of poverty to which his report is largely devoted."
"This is an excellent report by Mr Rocard, as there are so many aspects to it, any one of which could make a substantial difference to areas of policy and areas of the world."
"For instance, we have paragraph 45 on monoculture, one of the really crushing problems for the Caribbean islands, for example, with their historic dependence on bananas."
"We have the problem of the small island states, not just in the Caribbean but in the Pacific, which are totally at the mercy of global warming."
"That is a very important commitment that we reiterate."
"There is an excellent paragraph on landmines which are such a scourge for Africa and other parts of the world."
"Arms sales are mentioned, again an extremely important ingredient in development policy."
"Paragraph 77 talks about the need to develop fisheries agreements with a development component instead of a purely commercial one."
"If we could achieve that, this again would make a huge difference to the coastal countries off which this Union fishes."
"Last but not least, there is the 0.7 % UN target of aid; if we could achieve that for every single Member State instead of just for one or two noble exceptions, then we would be doing something noble."
"I would commend the report and perhaps I can finish by saying that 'Nous sommes tous des rocardiens maintenant' , we are all Rocardians now."
"Mr President, research into and the implementation of effective measures to combat poverty will constitute the EU's greatest undertaking in its future relations with the ACP countries."
"Following the Committee on Development and Cooperation's discussions in Brussels, the overall strategy proposed by the Commission within the framework of negotiations for the renewal of the cooperation agreements with the ACP countries, will be submitted next month, during the course of the Joint Assembly planned in the Mauritius Islands."
"Alongside decisive support for a micro-economic approach, which is intended to encourage the poorer countries to invest in the development of micro-credit, the Union hopes to maintain preferential trade with the poorer countries and those which are more vulnerable economically."
"As already negotiated within the scope of the Lomé agreements, preferential trade agreements have been renewed for a ten-year period and are incorporated into a clearly political perspective encouraging geographical differentiation, to emphasize regional differences."
"The principle of respect for human rights and democracy will be an essential requirement in the philosophy of the cooperation agreements."
"Consequently, through the regional authorities responsible for monitoring ethnic, economic, social and religious tensions, the EU should maintain peace and prevent crises and conflicts."
"Mr President, on the basis of the work of Mr Rocard and Mr Vecchi, the Group of the Party of European Socialists has undertaken a commitment that has lasted for more than a year: it consists of a working group set up with the representatives of the ACP countries, which has studied this matter and discussed its proposals in Africa with the African leaders."
"This is a new way of preparing for the review of these agreements, which must not be called into question."
"This special relationship is important and should continue, but should be renewed broadly."
"There are many reasons in the Rocard and Vecchi reports for renewing these agreements. It is a new and global concept that deals with all the issues, from democracy and human rights to conflict prevention, all important subjects on which I will not dwell."
"An effort is being made to define cooperation and partnership more effectively, by reviewing the way of working but also looking at the mistakes and inadequacies so far, by looking critically at the disguised plundering by the large European companies, by looking to replace huge projects which are not always useful with a vision that is closer to the work and life of the people and the democratic development of society, by looking at new fields of intervention such as women, civil society, health, education and, as I said, by using more penetrating and effective ways of working."
"In short, this approach is an attempt to propose a European alternative to the model Clinton has proposed for Africa, which does not seem to have pleased Mandela too much, precisely because it is a model of liberalization at all costs, when everyone is now questioning the role of the IMF - which has also brought disaster - and wondering how to deal with enormous problems such as the debt crisis with new mechanisms and objectives."
"The EU therefore has to find an alternative."
"With regard to the composition of the ACP countries, that is, the list of participants, the best plan is to review the possible entry of new countries, given the new problems, for example, in South Africa, within the scope of the current regional areas, maintaining the unity of this long-lasting relationship, which is of great political value in itself but which should be made more effective and reformed in depth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation by the European Union with the ACP states must be reformed."
"There is much that is positive in this cooperation, but there is also much which does not work."
"Simply continuing the status quo is certainly not a model for the next millennium."
"The present rules are above all discriminatory."
"Countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bolivia and Nicaragua are excluded, although these are developing countries which need our help just as much as the present ACP states."
"I consider that it is rather schizophrenic that in March Parliament adopted an urgent motion on Nicaragua's debt and pointed out the terrible situation of people in Nicaragua, but the accession of Nicaragua to the Lomé Convention was not even seriously discussed."
"At its Congress in Toulouse last year, the Group of the European People's Party demanded that future cooperation should no longer be based so much on colonial links, but on income per head and its distribution, and above all on the willingness of those in government to contribute genuinely to the development of people in their country."
"I expressly welcome what Mrs Dybkjær said about the expansion of the ACP states and the acceptance of new members."
"It would be schizophrenic to restrict the acceptance of new members to Cuba of all countries."
"The pre-conditions have not really been fulfilled there."
"Commissioner Pinheiro, your mandate for action is a tentative step in the right direction, to make cooperation effective in the future."
"Keep at it!"
"We should support this step and encourage you to take further steps."
"Do not be led astray by the protectionists of all countries, but go into the new millennium with a new concept!"
"Mr President, I briefly want to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Rocard and Mr Vecchi."
"Development cooperation is undoubtedly the focus of a number of important issues at the moment."
"I do not have a lot of time, but I would like to make a few points."
"Mr Vecchi has pointed out the importance of decentralized cooperation because it means moving the focus from individual projects to those involved in the projects."
"But this transition, which is very important, also needs to be demonstrated from another point of view."
"The EU has the task of making countries who want to cooperate with us aware of their own resources. Often we do not talk enough about the environmental and cultural wealth of these countries, which could be important resources for them, because, if they are aware of them, they can then understand how to use them to improve their economy in terms of tourism, and we too can offer them important support."
"Culture, cultural and environmental wealth with the knowledge and awareness of what they have to give us."
"What is important and fundamental is that, when we talk about development cooperation, we should not forget foreign policy and humanitarian aid."
"Just one development cooperation measure, if not in line with humanitarian aid measures and with foreign policy, could undoubtedly produce negative results that we do not want."
"The EU should thus have a foreign policy on common security, that will enable dialogue in a field where we can really make substantial impact and a significant economic contribution."
"We are still lacking in this, unfortunately."
"However, I wish to thank Commissioner Pinheiro for the effort he is making for development and real cooperation, especially bearing in mind the need for the necessary financial means."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two or three years ago we were quite sceptical s to the future of the Lomé agreements, for many reasons."
"A decline in the geo-strategic interest of the ACP countries after the end of the Cold War, the need for the European Union to contribute to the economic development and democratic strengthening of central and eastern European countries, the wave of ultra-liberalism created by the WTO along with, of course, a decline in the financial capacities of a Union sharply touched by crisis, can all be given as examples."
"All of these factors came together to overshadow the horizon which, at last, seems to be clearing."
"We are delighted to note an increased awareness within the European Union regarding a growing interdependence with the ACP countries, particularly with the African continent, an interdependence which concerns economic development, security, democracy and the influx of immigrants."
"The Commission's Green Paper is clearly the source of this awareness, but we can be proud of the European Parliament's active contribution, and especially that of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, in reflections on the renewal of the Lomé agreements."
"The Martens and Rocard reports, which have both been rightly praised, have drawn up a framework and defined the ambitions of a renewed and deepened cooperation, emphasizing the necessary political dimension of the agreements, the promotion of democratic values and the support for a process of regional integration."
"I am personally extremely pleased at the importance which has been given to decentralized cooperation - indeed the Vecchi report was dedicated to this - because it responds directly to the needs and aspirations of the populations of the ACP countries and because, through local government and associations, it involves the citizens themselves in the process of cooperation."
"Decentralized cooperation brings greater effectiveness and democracy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the game is not yet won with regard to the Lomé agreements for the year 2000, but we will from now on have, thanks in particular to the Rocard report, intellectual instruments which will ensure that we do not miss this great opportunity."
"We also have to fight to gain the necessary financial means."
"Much will depend on the political will that Parliament shows."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a change is necessary in the way in which we pursue cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries, with a view to establishing a renewed, real and fairer partnership."
"The post-colonial period should be brought to a close."
"We must shake off the old donor-recipient relationships and cease to cast the recipient in the role of a child."
"The rationale of conditionality must be replaced by contract-based cooperation."
"The main feature of this new partnership should be that populations themselves take their place in cooperation, while its main aim should be to eradicate poverty, prevent conflict, defend human rights and promote good governance."
"This new partnership should therefore be given a strong political dimension, extending cooperation to include economic, financial and technical partnership, which should be decentralized to include new protagonists, in addition to governments."
"We should remember, at this time, that democratization and good governance are, first and foremost, the product of a way of thinking that takes time to become firmly rooted."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere support for Commissioner Pinheiro for the intelligence he has shown in presenting and developing the new strategic approach which he proposes for such a very important issue."
"May I also offer my warmest congratulations to Mr Rocard and Mr Vecchi for their outstanding reports."
"Mr President, I will be very brief, because I fully agree with Mr Rocard's report, and I also greatly appreciate his input."
"There is one point I would like to draw your attention to, and this is similar to the one Mr Liese just mentioned."
"What I am concerned with is the relationship between the ACP countries and the overseas countries and territories, the so-called OCAT."
"In addition to over 70 ACP countries, there are 20 overseas countries and territories, many of which are located in the Third World, often amongst ACP countries."
"Their position in relation to the European Union changes frequently, is extremely unclear, and is partly dependent on specific relationships with specific Member States they may be part of."
"As we know, this relationship changes from country to country."
"In 1957, the Treaty of Rome promised them that they would be treated equally with the Member States themselves."
"But this never actually happened."
"The far-reaching equal status they were granted in 1991 has meanwhile been reversed."
"Mr President, what should happen now?"
"Together with the new Lomé Convention a clear agreement should be drawn up for the OCAT."
"This would be fair and honest towards the developing regions it concerns."
"It would also be good if the links between the OCAT and the ACP Assembly were strengthened, by giving the OCAT a place in the Assembly as observer."
"I am delighted that Mr Rocard has included this in his report."
"Mr President, I would like the Commission to tell us when it thinks it will have a new OCAT agreement, and perhaps the President-in-Office can add something to this."
"I am extremely pleased that the Committee on Development and Cooperation is to draft an own-initiative report to underline this issue."
"Mr President, this is what I wanted to add to the debate. I would like to offer my full support to Mr Rocard's report."
"Mr President, in the limited time that I have at my disposal, all I can offer is a few words."
"The proposal amounts to keeping the general structure, the foundation of the Convention, upright."
"This is the unique and only relationship we have with our southern neighbours in particular."
"As far as trade is concerned, I believe the integration of the trade regime into the WTO should be gradual, whereby a transitional regime is developed for precarious markets which are still developing."
"The question is whether five years is not far too short."
"We really need an impact study on this."
"Trade barriers, such as the rules of the place of origin, must be abolished."
"We therefore need a parallel policy for trade measures."
"In addition we should ask ourselves whether the proposed free trade zones do not constitute a threat to the ACP and, in fact, merely provide convenient access to markets for European products."
"We should be very conscious of this threat."
"To conclude, Mr President, I would like to mention something which has not been discussed yet in this debate, and which I consider to be an omission, namely the little attention paid to complicated procedures."
"The Green Paper goes into it at length, and I think this is right."
"But I think we should make much more of it."
"If we want to make the funds accessible to civil society, then it would demonstrate courage if the Commission and the Council were to look at a proposal, made at an earlier Parliamentary ACP-EU Meeting, to set up a kind of ombudsman initiative in the Pacific and in the Caribbean, initially in a French and an English-speaking country. This would at least allow women's organizations and environmental organizations, trade unions, the press and the Chamber of Commerce access to EU legislation."
"It is imperative that such a scheme is set up, but hitherto no one has taken up our proposal."
"That is all I wanted to say for the moment."
"Mr President, I wish to devote my contribution to this morning's debate to the report on decentralized cooperation drawn up by its excellent rapporteur, Mr Vecchi."
"Our contention is that EU development cooperation should be based on the same principles of partnership, subsidiarity and decentralization which we have put at the heart of the way we organize ourselves within the European Union and which, we therefore argue, must inform our relations with the developing world."
"It fits squarely within the approach outlined by the UK Secretary of State this morning in that the biggest stimulus to achieving quality of aid, to which she pledges herself, is the participation by recipients themselves in the planning, implementation and evaluation of development projects with which we seek to benefit them."
"It is decentralized civil society organizations within developing countries which have the ability to adapt cooperation policy to local conditions."
"It is decentralization which makes our aid more visible, thereby improving accountability."
"It is decentralization which leads to better identification of need and support for smaller projects, with quicker funding availability than is possible in traditional programmes."
"It is decentralization which encourages cooperation rather than competition between actors and equitable agreement at local level on the proper responsibilities of NGOs, vis-à-vis local and cental government."
"It is decentralization which builds the capacity of civil society to monitor and assure norms of democracy, thereby promoting principles of good governance and respect for human rights."
"Today's report seeks to agree a legal base for decentralized cooperation for the budget heading specifically created by Parliament as far back as 1992."
"Yet I say to the Secretary of State that the Council's position represents two steps back rather than one step forward."
"The Council seeks to restrict rather than encourage this approach by proposing a regulation which will remain in force for just three years."
"It seeks to subject programmes to the bureaucracy of the restrictive II(b) commitology committee and to limit the finance available to just ECU 18 million over the three-year period."
"In retabling our amendments at second reading, we therefore call on the Council radically to review its position."
"Parliament wants the legal base for pilot initiatives on decentralized cooperation to be a strong - not a weak - instrument and one which is a starting point for mainstreaming this philosophy as a defining element in all of the EU's development cooperation efforts."
"For all my political career, I have been a decentralizer, whether it has been in UK local government or in seeking to open up the workings of the European Union."
"I believe the President-in-Office shares this conviction and hope she will do so once again today."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Pinheiro, I welcome this excellent report by Michel Rocard on a new cooperation agreement to replace Lomé 4."
"The EU and ACP must reaffirm their partnership by strengthening democracy and respect for human rights, especially the rights of women."
"The fight against poverty and illiteracy must form the basis of any new arrangements and the acquis communautaire must be built upon in political economic and financial terms."
"In order to ensure maximum development in the ACP regions it is essential to take on board the question of peace and security."
"The sale and distribution of dangerous weapons including, in particular, landmines must cease."
"Peace is a prerequisite for development; without peace all effort is wasted."
"It is also vitally important that developing countries be allowed fair access to the world market place within the WTO, thus helping them to achieve their ultimate goal which is the eradication of misery and poverty in these regions."
"GATT and the WTO have done little or nothing so far to make increased trade a reality for these very poor economies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several people have already pointed out the value of Mr Rocard's report regarding the Commission communication on guidelines for negotiating a new cooperation agreement with Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific."
"Many valuable points, such as the desire to continue with cooperation or the emphasis placed on women's rights, have already been made."
"This also justifies the unusual length of the text of this resolution, but greater conciseness in the details might have led to a more correct emphasis on the principles guiding the new partnership agreements between these countries and the EU."
"However, since we are emphasizing values, there are several points which, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, should be partly changed."
"I am referring in particular to paragraphs 18 and 25."
"Paragraph 18 of the text affirms the desire to use contracts instead of applying too many conditions."
"We are asking for a clause to be included to ensure that the countries concerned observe democratic principles and human rights."
"I do not think we can disregard this fundamental point, which forms a part of our cultural heritage."
"The same applies to paragraph 25, where it is proposed that the ACP countries themselves should lay down the criteria for arranging partnership agreements, based on Commission proposals."
"We think it would be better to establish a completely equal relationship between the Commission and these countries and we are proposing our amendment to that effect."
"Mr President, I would like to say that I think this is an excellent report."
"The Commission's proposal and this report represent an important step forwards."
"I also think it is good that clear emphasis is placed on increased regionalization and thus also decentralization, since it is clearly difficult to see how else we could achieve effective cooperation between ourselves and 70 states as different as those we have in the ACP agreement."
"I think it is good to focus on poverty, the environment and women, amongst other things."
"Personally, I think it is also essential for us to pay more attention to the issue of population, which is a very important one."
"Whether or not we can solve the problem of rapid population growth depends on issues such as reproductive health and the living conditions of women, but it also depends on the ability of states as a whole to develop in the future."
"What I miss in the report, however, and what I would like to have seen included, is a clearer indication of the fact that in the long term we are prepared to adapt the trade preferences which currently exist in the Lomé Convention to the WTO's rules."
"I think this is the only sustainable solution in the long term."
"I also think that long term protection of European agriculture is not a durable solution."
"We must have the same standards for trade and agricultural policy as we have for aid policy in general."
"Mr President, like Commissioner Pinheiro, I think what is most impressive about this debate is the amount of shared thinking there is across the Commission, the Council and Parliament - and right around Parliament."
"Of course, there are some nuances of difference which we need to discuss further and to resolve."
"This is a very powerful alliance and it bodes well for the next phase of Lomé that there has been some very careful thinking and there is a lot of agreement about the direction in which we need to travel."
"Mr Rocard is to be congratulated on his report, and it has drawn praise and respect from all quarters of Parliament."
"A lot of the thinking in the report coincides with Council thinking."
"There are some details we need to discuss further - for example the best way to deal with AIDS in some of the poorest countries in the world - but we can come back to that."
"I would agree with the stress on all sides on support for good governance and human rights as a precondition for eradicating poverty."
"We only have to look at the Asian crisis to know that is right; you cannot promote and sustain development without democracy and human rights."
"The Asian crisis shows that and, therefore, it is not an optional extra; it is part of sustainable development."
"I am sure we all regret the fact that Mr Vecchi cannot be here, and we send our best regards to his family and hope all goes well."
"I want to make it very clear that there is absolute agreement on the desirability of decentralization in cooperation."
"The disagreement is about the commitology, but not about that principle."
"So at least we agree about the direction of travel, even if we do not completely agree on everything."
"I should like to say to Mrs Van Dijk that there is also now universal agreement that you cannot have development without educating girls and promoting the empowerment of women, because women and children are the overwhelming majority of the poor."
"That, again, is now agreed and not just an optional extra."
"I should like to say to Glenys Kinnock, who was very worried about the stress on regional free-trade agreements, that what we got out of the last meeting of the General Affairs Council was agreement that regional free-trade agreements are one option but an enhanced GSP is another option that must be at least as good as the existing Lomé access."
"There must be better treatment of the least-developed countries inside or outside the ACP alliance."
"Within that kind of framework - this, of course, is the area of greatest complexity and needs more discussion - there is room for different countries to choose the way in which they wish to travel."
"If we can preserve those options, then it will be possible to go forward in the way that the countries concerned wish."
"John Corrie placed a lot of emphasis on regionalization, and we all respect the work he has done on that."
"I agree that is the way in which the world is moving but it is for the ACP countries themselves to decide the speed of that movement and not to have a sort of rigid formula that requires them to move in ways that they do not wish to go."
"Mr Andrews stressed the need for simplification of the instruments, and we all agree."
"The existing structures are far too complex, the agreement is far too complex and it makes rigid the flows of development assistance, and so on. On budgetizing aid, there is no agreement."
"As you all know, the Maastricht Treaty provided for a separate EDF, and that remains the position of some of the member countries."
"So we all respect the decision of Parliament but there is not going to be immediate progress on that question."
"Mr Telkämper, for the Green Group, stressed that the World Trade Organization and WTO-compatibility are not democratic."
"In fact, the WTO is an organization of Member States with one state, one vote, and is potentially democratic."
"The problem in this area is that change is so complex that not all states are equal at the table, and what we have to do is spread the analysis and get it shared so that developing countries can come to the table of the WTO clear about what is in their interests."
"We need to work together to secure that."
"Mr Hory talked about the paragraph in Mr Rocard's report on human rights being defined by the OAU."
"I just wish to remind Parliament that all our countries have signed up to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Human rights are not regional, they are universal for all people, they cross civil, political, social and economic rights and our aspiration is to realize those rights for all people everywhere."
"Methods of implementing and strengthening the OAU is a good idea but there are not different human rights in the south compared with the north."
"Mr Antony said that some of the progress under the ACP-EU relationship in the past had not been as effective as we would hope."
"There is some truth in that, and we have to face it in order to make improvements for the future."
"He stressed that there had been too much emphasis on the role of the state in the past."
"We have been through two eras: one that gave perhaps too much emphasis to the role of the state and minimized the role of markets."
"We are coming out of an era that maximized the role of the markets and minimized the role of the state, and what we need is a new synthesis that puts both the state and markets in their rightful place to get the properly regulated, international and national arrangements that can promote sustainable economic growth."
"That is the challenge of the next era."
"Mrs Junker said that we must emphasize sustainable development."
"I just wish to stress that in the international poverty eradication strategy there is a commitment that every country should have its sustainable development plan in place so that it can promote development that does not use up its natural resources in an unsustainable way."
"Mrs Günther talked about progress on health being part of poverty eradication."
"That is absolutely right, and the stark statistics of terrible infant mortality, low-life expectancy or maternal mortality are part of the picture of gross poverty in the world."
"Again, one of the major poverty eradication targets is the provision of basic health care to all the people of the world by 2015, and access to reproductive health care for everyone and a reduction in maternal mortality and infant mortality."
"So I very much agree that is part of the process of poverty eradication."
"Mrs Dybkjær stressed that the least developed countries should have equal rights whether they are inside the ACP or outside."
"That is absolutely right."
"It was one of the commitments made in a previous General Affairs Council agreement."
"We must make sure it is implemented."
"I agree with those who say that logically the poorest countries should become part of the ACP."
"But in fact the ACP is resistant and a lot of the poorest countries are not seeking to join. What we need to ensure is that they are treated equally in terms of both trade access and development assistance."
"Then we will effectively have equal treatment, even if we do not have it in theory."
"I am grateful to Mr Macartney for his remarks."
"He raised the question of Jubilee 2000 and debts."
"The Council wholeheartedly supports the HIPC initiative."
"What we all have to do is speed up its implementation and try to make sure that every highly indebted country is on track for getting the debt to a sustainable level by the year 2000."
"Mr Amadeo said that we must give more assistance to the most vulnerable."
"That is part of the broad agreement on development assistance - that there should be differentiation between the investment needs of the very poorest and the technical cooperation needs of the middle-income countries, and more resources ploughed into investment in health, education and so on, in the very poorest countries."
"Mrs Baldi said not enough importance was currently attached to environmental resources."
"Again, I should like to refer to the commitment in the poverty eradication strategy to a sustainable development strategy, including environmental resources in every developing country."
"We need to put that in place."
"There is a strong consensus that we should strengthen the partnership."
"A partnership implies a relationship of equals and yet it was argued by one of the Members that we had to have conditionality in human rights."
"Experience with development shows that if conditionality is imposed it is never effective."
"The basis for the partnership has to be that we agree on the need to eradicate poverty and this calls for respect for democracy, human rights and good governance; within that framework we can then agree as equals on the details of implementation."
"I share Mr Howitt's aspirations towards decentralization."
"There is strong agreement in the Commission and the Council that is the way in which our efforts need to move."
"I have one reservation: we cannot have all the Member States, as well as the Commission, working with NGOs everywhere."
"We need to decentralize our efforts and then we need to decide in what areas the Member States should take the lead and in what areas the Commission should take the lead."
"We should not be tripping over each other on the details of our cooperation."
"The final point, raised by Mrs Lööw, is population growth."
"In 1945 there were 2.6 billion people, now there are 5.7 billion and by 2015 the population of the world will be at least 10 billion."
"If we eradicate poverty and improve access to health care and education it will increase to about 15 billion and then be sustainable."
"If we do not develop the world economy it will go well beyond that and start to use up the resources of the world in a way that is not sustainable."
"That is part of the challenge of development: that we hand on a sustainable world to the next generation and for that it is absolutely essential that we succeed in these endeavours."
"I am very optimistic that we are going to make progress in the effectiveness of our development collaboration."
"The consensus between Parliament, the Council and the Commission bodes very well for our future endeavours."
"Mr President, I am impressed by the breadth and clarity of the President-in-Office's answers but there is one point that I missed and that is the complexity of the procedures."
"The procedures are becoming so complex that they are a serious deterrent."
"It was one of the reasons for the underspending under Lomé and the inaccessibility of Lomé for chambers of commerce, women's groups and environmental groups in the ACP countries."
"Can you, and maybe the Commissioner as well, go into that issue?"
"May I very quickly touch on the complexity of procedures?"
"If you look at the Lomé agreement, it is enormously complex, with very complex channels of funding, and we are all agreed that they have got to be simplified."
"The administration has got to be decentralized so that it is less slow, less complex, more effective."
"There is agreement across Commission and Council that we must make those improvements."
"At the moment, as you will know, in all areas of European Union endeavour we have difficulty in disbursing the funds that we have available."
"We must improve our capacity to do so."
"That is agreed."
"Mr President, all I want to know is whether the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council plan to say something about the US President's visit now, or to the Committee on Development and Cooperation at a future date."
"Mr Robles, perhaps I could ask them to respond in writing because we are out of time for this debate."
"Members know the procedure."
"We have a debate and a separate time for questions."
"I have to move on."
"I would like to thank everybody who took part in the debate, in particular the President-in-Office."
"EU-Russia relations"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media I should like to congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her excellent report."
"The bonds that tie Russia and the European Member States are centuries old."
"Russia is also important as a bridge between Europe and Asia."
"Europe's relationship with Russia is a chance to further the principle of western democracy, which is a key element in cooperation with other nations."
"Russia, as a superpower, however, goes its own way in matters of geography, natural resources, its population and its culture."
"Progress in Russia is unpredictable, often chaotic, following no western model or timetable."
"For that reason, an understanding of Russia's special features is a key factor in a successful partnership between her and the EU."
"The Committee on Culture proposes increased reciprocal understanding and trust through a programme of education and study as well as exchange arrangements."
"People should know more about Russia's rich cultural heritage with its many vital minority groups, which are worthy of our support."
"Nevertheless, Russian cultural heritage is being threatened by economic problems and indifference."
"The EU should be helping Russia to take stock of this heritage, promote information exchange and vocational training in the area of culture, as well as encourage legislative moves in favour of ethnic cultures."
"The challenge for us is, above all, to give our support to nationwide and local democracy in Russia."
"The countries around the Baltic and Barents Sea are especially well placed to establish more opportunities for cooperation with Russia."
"The TACIS-Interreg cross-border cooperation and TACIS-PHARE programmes must be brought more into the picture."
"But proper cooperation in education cannot take place just through TACIS projects: it will require a European foundation or an entirely separate source of funding."
"In any case, resources have to be increased and cooperation has to be based on the reciprocal dealings of two equal partners."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, can I first of all say that our group welcomes Mrs Lalumière's timely report on Russia?"
"It is regrettable, however, that an additional 62 amendments were tabled for plenary after over 90 had already been considered at the committee stage."
"Nevertheless, we are at a crucial time in the development of Russia's economic and democratic reform process, and the EU's future relations with Russia can play a vital part in supporting and invigorating the push for reform in the Russian Federation."
"For many people in Russia the end of the Soviet Union and the beginning of economic transformation from command to market economy have not led to obvious improvements in their standard of living."
"It is to be hoped that the appointment of a new Prime Minister will lead to a rebalancing of the Russian Government with a clearer emphasis on the democratic and economic reform process."
"The EU and the European Parliament must exert their influence through the TACIS and democracy programme, the partnership and cooperation agreement and the newly established Parliamentary Cooperation Council."
"Human rights will always be high on the agenda, and Parliament must continue to monitor the law on religious freedom in Russia."
"Parliament must support initiatives on tackling international crime, legal reform, trafficking in women, combatting poverty and poor health and encourage the Russian Federation's membership of WTO."
"On the security front, it is important to avoid the division of Europe once more into two camps."
"Russia - building on the mutual founding act between NATO and the Russian Federation - must not be excluded from discussions on the future security architecture for Europe in the twenty-first century."
"The OSCE and the Council of Europe also have a role to play, as do improved relations between Russia and its neighbouring regions."
"The Council must play its part - and I hope Commissioner Van den Broek will endorse this - in building a new relationship with a new Russia."
"Mr President, compared with Hungary, Russia is not a model of democratic transition."
"Any such comparison would be incorrect and a political error."
"Russia was subjected to communism for 75 years, that is, three generations."
"That means that there is no memory of the brief democratic experience of 1905-1914, nor of the prodigious economic development and the spirit of enterprise of the turn of the century."
"It is a unique case in history whereby a memory has been suppressed, replaced for three quarters of a century by the sole experience of a one-party system and a state-run economy."
"What is more, Russian society has experienced an incomparable demographic tragedy."
"Since 1970 - not since 1991 as was stated - life expectancy has done nothing but fall."
"That leads a society to despair."
"It is an unprecedented phenomenon."
"It is with this in mind that the Russian efforts to build a rule of law and a market economy must be evaluated."
"The rule of law is still not perfect, but let us not forget that in spite of malicious prophecies, all elections since 1993, both general and local, have taken place on the anticipated date and, according to the experts, have been properly conducted."
"All national and regional institutions are functioning."
"Serious crises have erupted, in particular the war in Chechnya, but they are already a thing of the past."
"The market economy is coming up against serious difficulties, above all the corruption inherited from the Soviet regime, and a collapse in the economy in general. This collapse also does not date from 1991."
"Soviet experts have been analysing it since 1982, when it was noted in the Novossibirsk report."
"A reform of the economy is difficult under such circumstances. Nevertheless, the first signs of recovery are clear."
"The consequence of the reforms has been to differentiate society, but we must not reduce this phenomenon to a contrast between the impoverished masses and the fabulously wealthy mafia."
"Those who knew the Soviet Union well know that nearly everyone was poor then, with the exception of the ruling classes."
"Today, 50 % of the population are poor - it is true - but the other 50 % are experiencing a continual increase in their standard of living and there are already the beginnings of a middle class."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Russia has considerable natural resources and a very highly educated population, often better than that of our older democracies."
"This means that whatever happens, she will make up the lost ground in terms of political and economic backwardness in the near future, as she was doing at the turn of the century before the revolution put a stop to that progressive momentum."
"It is a country which has shared our history and which is today making considerable efforts to align itself with us."
"If we recognize these efforts, if we are able to measure the progress achieved in comparison with the disaster from which the country is emerging, we will be offering Europe an opportunity for cooperation which will strengthen it in terms of security, prosperity and spiritual enrichment."
"If we refuse to recognize the breadth of the transformation underway, if we do not commit ourselves fully to helping Russia, we run the distinct risk of seeing this country turn quite naturally to other countries for support."
"She will turn to the United States, or Asia, or the Muslim world, and our part of the continent will be weakened by this."
"This is the essence of Mrs Lalumière's excellent report."
"The Group of the European People's Party supports it and hopes that it will not be unduly modified."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, I would respectfully like to thank Mrs Lalumière for her report."
"The report shows just how much expert knowledge she gained in her splendid work as Secretary-General of the Council of Europe."
"Russia has a key role in EU foreign relations."
"She is still a superpower and her development and progress is vitally important for the security and well-being of the Member States."
"With enlargement, the Union already shares a very long border with Russia, and one that will grow even longer with the next round of accessions."
"Enlargement will mean the strengthening of ties between the EU and Russia."
"Enlargement to the east will be on a far larger scale than is generally realized."
"All eastern European countries, Russia included, are on the path to democracy and a market economy."
"Before long, they will all fulfil the criteria required for membership as laid down at Copenhagen."
"Despite all this, Parliament should not yet, in the opinion of the Liberal group, take a stand in any way on Russia's inclusion in the EU."
"Mrs Lalumière's excellent report originally gave the impression, and still does to some extent, that there will be a new bi-zonal Europe made up of Russia on the one hand and the rest of Europe on the other."
"To rid ourselves of this image we suggest new wording to paragraph 57 regarding the Council of Europe and the EU so that ""to act as a link between the two halves of the continent' will read as ""to promote genuine pan-European partnership.'"
"The Liberal group suggests a new paragraph should be inserted in the report, which stresses the importance of the EU Nordic dimension and provides for the start of close cooperation between Russia and the Council of Baltic states, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council and the Arctic Council."
"We hope everyone will approve this addition."
"Mr President, the European Union must support the greatest possible development of relations and cooperation with the Russian Federation."
"It will be impossible to build a stable Europe if we turn our back on that country or try to isolate it."
"The enlargement of the European Union to include the central and eastern European countries, and the enlargement of NATO to the east, should be accompanied by a proportional increase in relations with Moscow."
"The plan and proposals, presented by the Council and the Commission respectively, should aim in that direction, as of course should the proper application of the 1994 agreement signed with the Russian Federation, which has just come into effect."
"Russia is going through a difficult transition in political terms, with a democracy marked by Boris Yeltsin's presidential authoritarianism."
"Examples have included the assault on Parliament some years ago, the war in Chechnya, and the most recent government crisis, not to mention the general lack of respect for many human rights."
"Some institutions in Russia are weak as a result of that same authoritarianism."
"There is a profound economic crisis, caused by ultraliberal approaches. And of course there is an extremely serious social crisis, which manifests itself, for example, as poverty, public servants being unable to draw their salaries, and even - though it is hard to believe - a decrease in people's standard of living and life expectancy."
"It is a question of cooperating with Russia on equal terms, to help to ensure that the European Union has a democratic and socioeconomically consolidated partner."
"Such a partner is essential for security in Europe. Security and cooperation with Russia cannot just be based on the founding act signed between Moscow and NATO: bodies such as the OSCE also need to be strengthened."
"It is a question of having a reliable partner on the international scene, one which cannot be forgotten, as we saw during the most recent Iraq crisis and with the situation in Kosovo."
"I want to end by saying that I am worried that countries such as France and Germany obviously might be tempted to enter into bilateral relationships with the Russian Federation, independently of moves from the European Union."
"Lastly, I want to express our general support for Mrs Lalumière's magnificent report."
"Mr President, the sensitive reactions of the West to the risky government restructuring with which the Kremlin leader Yeltsin has startled his European neighbours in the last few days shows once again how profound the links between Western Europe and Russia are."
"There is therefore no question about it: the challenge for Europe after the fall of the Wall is the clarification and restructuring of our relationship with Russia."
"Basically, the question of European security will depend precisely on the success of the balance struck with Russia."
"In the face of that, what the Commission calls an ""action plan for the future relationship of the EU and Russia' seems to be a conglomeration of individual measures; it seems aimless, inadequate and unprofessional."
"It is another demonstration of the poverty of our common foreign policy that in respect of what is our continent's key concern, neither a decent joint strategy nor a comprehensive set of ideas can be found in it."
"I think I have made it clear: For the Green Group, there is no doubt that Russia can also become a member of the Union if it wants to."
"Anyone who does not accept this not only ignores the EU Treaty on this point, but also rejects involvement in this great restructuring task of Europe."
"Such a rejection is marked by the same spirit as the provocation which was caused by the expansion of military power systems during the Cold War."
"It does not contribute to the settlement, peace and stability of this continent."
"We need an investment in the partnership process with Russia, and that means an investment in the peace of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the members of the Italian National Alliance look favourably on the EU action plan for Russia, launched by the Council in May 1996 under the Italian Presidency."
"The plan seeks to ensure good coordination between the various actions, both bilateral and Community, aimed at supporting the transformation of Russia."
"It contemplates five major areas of cooperation: democratic reforms, economic cooperation, justice, safety and foreign policy."
"In this respect, the National Alliance notes with satisfaction the efforts made by Russia with regard to political freedoms, the development of democracy and the protection of human rights."
"It is, however, worried about a few uncertainties and a few steps backwards in this area and also hopes for marked, significant and positive developments in this respect."
"We should therefore follow developments in this area carefully, helping and supporting them in all ways possible, without forgetting that only a year ago Russia was under the yoke of a communist and totalitarian regime."
"We are asking the Russian government to pay greater attention to the control and suppression of local organized crime, which is spreading dangerously to Europe, and to give a strong commitment to environmental protection in order to avert further ecological disasters and repair the damage caused by the previous communist regimes, which were totally insensitive to these problems."
"Finally, to ensure lasting peace for Europe and the world, we hope there will be a reinforcement of the political, economic and cultural partnership with Russia, which is undoubtedly a great world power today."
"Mr President, allow me to deal particularly with the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in this debate."
"In this agreement, there is already an effective instrument for carrying on a permanent dialogue with our Russian partners about all those questions of a political and economic nature which are central to our mutual relationship."
"Let us not forget that it was the parliaments - the European Parliament and the Russian State Duma - which christened the first of the executive bodies of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which I chair with my Russian colleague, Mr Ryshkov."
"In this capacity I would like to emphasize particularly how profitable the work in this committee was last December."
"I can assure you that we address the individual problems in the relationship between the EU and Russia very openly with our Russian colleagues, and that we are frank about the difficulties."
"Continuity of contacts and regular mutual visits, which create mutual trust, are particularly important, even if the contacts on the Russian side are continually changing."
"I think that it is not too much to say that the form of cooperation which we are developing is a future model for Russian-European cooperation."
"In this way, the relationship with our Russian partners can be constructed and can be further extended without discussing Russia's EU membership."
"Neither side needs to discuss that."
"In this context, allow me to point out the importance of the TACIS programme."
"In her report, Mrs Lalumière calls on the Commission to strengthen support for these projects, and demands that the priorities in TACIS aid for the improvement of daily living conditions should start with setting up the structures necessary for the rule of law."
"I would like to underline this very explicitly."
"We know that we must improve this TACIS programme, but we also know that preparatory work is essential for our future cooperation between Russia and the European Union."
"Mr President, first I would like to congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her brilliance, because she reminded me of a colleague I once had, Mr Vergès, who was one of the best lawyers in the world, and to whom I once said: If I am ever found with a bloody knife next to a corpse, I would certainly take him as my advocate."
"Mrs Lalumière, if that happens to me again, I would willingly engage you as my lawyer, because we must remember one thing, which was not mentioned here in the discussion, and my colleague Mr González Carnero has underlined it, that we must let caution rule in our relationship with Russia."
"I would like to point out the following above all else here: Russia is today, in an era of worldwide decolonization, the last great colonial empire on earth."
"The Chechen war showed that clearly, and there will be more colonial wars."
"At any rate, I do not want any of my 18 grandchildren to die in a colonial war for the defence of Russia."
"We do not need Russia in the European Union before decolonization has taken place, afterwards yes, but not before."
"But I would like to point out the other fact, that Mr Yeltsin's last press conference has shown us how dangerous it is to leave the keys to nuclear weapons in such hands."
"We must all be clear about that, and therefore we must think more about our security."
"Obviously we do not want a war or conflict with Russia, but we must see the situation quite clearly."
"I therefore have certain reservations about an over-optimistic representation of a situation which must simply be seen as it is."
"The danger is still before us."
"Mr President, the European Union's policy on Russia is aimed at strengthening democracy, peace, trade with, and the economic development of, this large and important country of 140 million inhabitants."
"If Russia's development is successful, a natural further step should be that Russia becomes a member of our democratic union, the EU."
"On this issue, Mrs Lalumière is left quaking in her boots in her otherwise excellent report."
"The EU was founded by six states with around 200 million inhabitants."
"We now have 15 countries with 370 million inhabitants."
"When we have accepted the 12 new countries which now want to join, we will number almost half a million people."
"Surely a Union of that size which is functioning well could also open its doors one day and find room for a successful Russian democracy."
"Mr President, Russia's population is falling and poverty is spreading."
"Nuclear waste and environmental pollution are a threat to the whole of Europe."
"In the future, the EU will be dependent on Russia for her natural resources, especially gas."
"The EU should not be sending any military signals that Russia might interpret as a threat to her national security."
"A country like Finland should remain non-aligned, even if the EU were to have a common foreign and defence policy."
"Mrs Lalumière's report brings to mind Karl Marx's book on the history of nineteenth century diplomacy."
"It was never published in the Soviet Union because it brought up the question of Russia's foothold in both Europe and Asia."
"We should not, however, adopt double standards when we look at the Russian issue."
"The same criteria should apply in the West to President Yeltsin's dictatorship or the total indoctrination of the media as if that were what was taking place in our own countries."
"The Russian people need money, good health, human rights, a clean environment and hope, just as we all do."
"An equal basis for dialogue and cooperation requires the EU to look to Nordic policies."
"Mr President, I enthusiastically support Mrs Lalumière's report and I pay tribute to her ability and perceptiveness."
"On many occasions in this House I have had the opportunity of regretting that the European Union has committed itself to opening up to the west, to international high finance from across the Atlantic, and to the south, to an uncontrolled influx of immigrants, whilst I have dreaded the Union shutting itself off from the east, precisely where the European border remains to be drawn, since Russia straddles two continents."
"If enlargement of the Union to the central and eastern European countries is to be brought to a successful conclusion, it must not be done to the detriment of our sister countries of the former USSR, in case we merely rebuild a new wall of shame a little further east."
"It is probably unrealistic to envisage the accession of Russia to the enlarged European Union."
"I have, however, always attempted to put forward the idea of unifying the enlarged European Union with the twelve member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States in a structure such as a confederation."
"They would thus form the two poles of a future binomial partnership which would finally free our people from American protection."
"Only as a Europe with a continental dimension can we become winners in a global economic war in which we have already lost too many battles."
"Mr President, the report on future relations with Russia is an important one."
"I am therefore surprised and find it very regrettable that there are a number of strange deficiencies in the otherwise well thought out proposal."
"Let me begin by mentioning paragraph 54, in which the rapporteur makes it clear that Russia is neither suitable nor desirable as a member of the EU, ' in view of the dimensions of Russia and its Eurasian interests and of the deeply integrated nature of the European Union.'"
"It is quite inappropriate for the European Parliament to make prejudiced comments on Russia's possible future membership, not least in view of the fact that Russia has not actually applied for membership."
"It would be quite inappropriate to adopt paragraph 54 in its current form."
"If such a statement of principle is to be adopted for Russia, it might just as well also be applied to other countries which could think of applying for membership, such as Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey and so on."
"Regardless of whether people currently think that Russia should or should not become a member of the EU, such a point of view does not belong in the report."
"It must be more in the EU's interest to establish strong ties with Russia which can develop into a closer cooperation in order to strengthen and guarantee peace and security internationally."
"Europe's partnership for peace should clearly include the area from the Atlantic to the Urals."
"The other flaw which I would like to mention is paragraph 46, in which the rapporteur suggests that it will only be possible to develop security relations with Russia once it has been decided to incorporate the WEU into the EU."
"We must bear in mind that, according to the whole Russian establishment, NATO's enlargement is causing increased security worries for Russia."
"The Russian military are now also demanding increased investment in Russian nuclear weapons as a result of NATO enlargement."
"It is therefore very important for the EU to help reduce the worries which NATO's enlargement causes Russia rather than increase them."
"Finally, I would just like to criticize the incomprehensible wording of paragraph 1 a, namely that the EU should foster the 'emergence of a middle class to provide a firm base for democracy.'"
"This wording belongs to 19th century thinking not to that of 1998."
"Mr President, I too would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lalumière on her difficult report."
"Although I have submitted a series of amendments, I know that we fundamentally agree."
"A few days ago, the Russian human rights activist and Duma member Kovaliev expressed his concern about the anti-democratic tendencies which still exist in his country."
"He is a man who loves his country, and anyone who reads his book 'The Flight of the White Raven' will see why he was in prison for seven years."
"However, I would like to point out something which has hardly been mentioned."
"He accuses both the old and the new leading elites of contempt for democracy and law."
"These principles are conditions for the creation of a greater Europe, in which peace, freedom, the rule of law and democracy rule."
"The European Union must take note of these questions."
"It faces great challenges, because these relationships will have far-reaching consequences on the negotiations which have just begun with all countries."
"Russia has joined the Council of Europe, to which all the Member States of the European Union belong."
"It has thus said ""yes' to the rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"It has also said ""yes' to the legal community which has been developing up for decades."
"We in the European Parliament will approve the relationship with Russia, we want close cooperation, but we shall also pay close attention to, and when necessary issue a reminder about, the reform process in Russia towards a state which operates under the rule of law, respects human rights and establishes a civil society which acts democratically."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, in the discussion about this report, to say something about the developments in our cooperation within the delegation or within the joint committee which we have with the Russian State Duma and the Federal Council."
"When I consider the development in the last few years, I detect that there has been a basic improvement."
"Whereas in the joint sessions in the initial phase after 1994 we very often indulged in reciprocal statements - whereby the Russian side was sometimes quite emphatic in forcing us onto certain subjects, for example NATO membership of some east European states, subjects which really had nothing to do with the bilateral relationship between the European Union and Russia and prevented a rational dialogue - this has essentially changed."
"It is now the case that we discuss many subjects of mutual interest and thus achieve agreement on many points, or can at least have an effective exchange of experience."
"Take, for instance, the debate about TACIS, about the development of the partnership agreement, about Russian or European internal questions, such as the development of international crime, the rule of law or the tax system in Russia."
"I believe that it is the task of the European Union to encourage the development towards a stable democracy in Russia, but to observe and follow it critically."
"Russia is not yet a stable democracy, because there is still no stable combination there of the elements necessary for it."
"The clashes and movements in internal politics make this clear, as we have seen recently."
"Nevertheless I believe that Russia is on the right path, and we as Europeans should accompany her and be vigilant."
"Mr President, despite the over-optimistic tone of the report I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work."
"The most important problem with the report is the lack of examples."
"Mrs Lalumière mentions as one main goal the strengthening of security for Europe and her closest neighbours, based on equal partnership."
"What does this actually mean, though?"
"The Finnish government aims to put the Union's Nordic dimension on the agenda during her Presidency in the latter part of 1999."
"The Nordic dimension is a security project, broad in scope, which focuses, for example, on the TACIS programme, on Russia's commitment to regional cooperation in the areas of environmental concern and nuclear safety, and on the multi-faceted relationship that exists between the Baltic states."
"Cooperation with Russia can be a success only by means of a step-by-step policy that addresses one issue at a time."
"Russian stability will not be aided by grandiloquent, celebratory eulogies even in this House."
"Commissioner, thank you for battling against the noise."
"I have to say that it never ceases to amaze or depress me how ignorant this House can be when people are speaking."
"It is the same people who session after session stand up and talk about the dignity and importance of this House who treat it like a street market."
"It is quite a disgrace."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at voting time."
"Madam President, I refer to Article 48 of the Rules of Procedure."
"On 9 March we gave the starting signal."
"The European Parliament wanted to declare 1999 the European Year against Violence against Women, and to start a European campaign for this."
"The initiative from the Committee on Women's Rights exceeded the required number, 314, today."
"We have 323 votes."
"Never have things moved so fast in the history of the European Parliament."
"We managed to reach this number in only six and a half days of sittings."
"I now ask the Commission and the Council to make preparations as quickly as possible, so that the women's organizations, churches, associations can start to prepare for this European year."
"The women in our countries are waiting for support."
"Once again the European Parliament has come forward in the vanguard of women's rights."
"Sincere thanks to all my colleagues, men and women, who have signed the declaration."
"But it is still possible to sign!"
"(Applause)"
"Like you, I am extremely pleased that this resolution has been so successful."
"Madam President, I would also like to congratulate our colleague Mrs Gröner on achieving the 323 signatures."
"However, as usual I rise on the voting procedure."
"I advise you now that I will be present and voting so you will have no problems."
"However, I note that the voting list distributed to Members advises Members when there will be a roll-call vote."
"There are ten roll-call votes for this particular session."
"Two or three could be added to this making perhaps twelve to thirteen."
"Therefore, if I stay for seven roll-call votes, I could then leave having completed the 50 %."
"These rules are absurd, the way the Bureau treats them is absurd and the quicker they are removed the better."
"There are about fifteen roll-call votes, Mr Falconer. I bring this to your attention for whatever purpose it may serve."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I alerted the services to this point in advance this morning, but it was not taken even though it is relevant under Rule 19(4)."
"Last month this Parliament passed a resolution in favour of human rights in Nigeria."
"In the debate I called for safety for the detained Ogoni human rights activist Batom Mitee, brother of the acting president of their movement."
"At the time Batom's whereabouts were unknown, but a released detainee has confirmed on Tuesday of this week that Batom is held in the Delta Rubber Plantation and, after suffering torture including daily beatings, is in deep fear of his life."
"I ask you, Madam President, on behalf of Parliament to write urgently to the Nigerian authorities to press for respect for this Parliament's will consistent with human rights law and our February 1998 resolution."
"Batom Mitee continues to be refused visits from his family or any medical care and yet he is paralysed on his left side, cannot stand or eat unaided and has lived in the same soiled clothing for over three months."
"I would be grateful if you could convey to the President that I have discussed this issue with Mrs Kinnock who also wishes to express her concern."
"If the President kindly agrees to write the letter as requested, she will present it with her other colleagues at the EU-ACP Assembly due to take place next week."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"Thank you, Mr Howitt."
"I will, of course, pass on your comments and your wishes to the President."
"Madam President, regarding the document for Mrs Schaffner's report which is only available in French."
"Madam President, you promised to come back with information on how we should deal with Mrs Schaffner's report."
"I would like to have that information."
"Firstly, we verified the facts."
"It is true that the document to which Mrs Schaffner's report relates exists only in French."
"It is indeed a problem."
"One possible solution would be to have the debate but not to vote until the report has been translated into all languages."
"Mrs Schaffner is showing her approval of this proposal."
"Does anyone have any objections to this?"
"It appears not."
"Thank you, Mrs Lindholm, you have an answer to your question and, as you see, we have done what was necessary."
"Mrs Berès, do you have a procedural motion?"
"I would like to draw your attention to a letter signed by the Secretary-General, Julian Priestly, which we have received this morning."
"According to this letter ..."
"(Laughter."
"Heckling: ' April fool!' )"
"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but procedural motions are an expression of democracy."
"You know very well that every Member has a right to express himself or herself, including Mrs Berès."
"I am happy to have been a victim of the British sense of humour and I thank the House for its understanding."
"Votes"
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the noise emission by equipment used outdoors (COM(98)0046 - C4-0122/98-98/0029(COD))"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)"
"Madam President, today I do not want to ask for signatures against criminality in Brussels, although we have only until Friday to do so, but I would like to propose, in accordance with Article 129, that the Murphy report should be referred back to the responsible committee, since there are over 100 amendments, which are mainly of a purely technical nature, and to make a SLIM initiative myself."
"Two additional directives about measurements, dimensions and technical features of buses are added."
"We should therefore agree in a working party on how we intend to proceed with these three directives, in accordance with the rules."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of the committee responsible, I must first inform you that the committee decided by a small majority to bring the Murphy report in this form to a sitting of the European Parliament."
"I therefore do not speak as the committee chairman, but as a member of the Group of the European People's Party, and as such I support the proposal to refer this report back to the committee."
"Why?"
"It has been my opinion for many years that we as the European Parliament can in future no longer afford to pass technical legislation by means of hundreds of amendments."
"Since Maastricht, we have had co-decision in these matters."
"The new directives are no longer directives of the Council alone, but directives of the European Parliament and of the Council."
"As Parliament, in the case of this legislation, we can contribute to ensuring that the protection of the health and safety of citizens and of disadvantaged people is taken into account."
"That is extremely important."
"We have always done it successfully in the past."
"But what we need here are not 112 technical amendments, which none of those present understands and about which no-one knows what interests lie behind the individual amendments. We need one amendment which states that buses must be designed which are suitable for the disabled."
"The execution of this legislative instruction of the European Parliament is then the responsibility of the technical bodies."
"(Applause) This is called the legislative procedure of reference to technical standards, which I have always supported and which must always be the way in which we operate in future."
"For this reason, I personally would be happy if it was possible to discuss it again in the committee, so that we can find a sensible solution in this matter."
"I will now make a personal declaration: If this proposal is not referred back to the committee, I shall stay here, but I shall not take part in the vote."
"I ask that this should be minuted, because as a parliamentarian I am not prepared to cooperate in this nonsensical kind of legislation."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I hope not to take as much time as Mr von Wogau."
"I have some sympathy with what he says that we have been dealing with a technical matter here but I would ask the House to consider this."
"Are we saying to the citizens of Europe that we are not competent enough to actually legislate on something which will affect people's lives?"
"I put it to you, the committee had every opportunity to debate this report."
"They had every opportunity to discuss with me the amendments I was moving."
"I accept that there are a lot of amendments but many of these are absolutely necessary."
"If it is so technical for members on the other side not to have been able to understand what is going on, why were some 20 amendments actually moved by members from the other side of the House?"
"I would argue that they did understand what the issues at stake here were and I would come back to what the Commission said last night."
"Commissioner Bangemann, when this point was put to him, said he could see no reason why Parliament should not actually take a position on the report and, indeed, he gave an indication that the Commission was prepared to accept 22 of our amendments."
"So I say to Members on the other side of the House, we have had every opportunity to debate this issue, yes it is complicated, yes it is technical, but let us not abrogate our responsibilities."
"We have an important job to do here; let us get on with it."
"Mr President, I have just one question for the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy who was speaking here in person."
"There have been three or four debates, and he has had every opportunity to submit an amendment, as just noted."
"I would like to know why he did not accept that responsibility."
"Madam President, I would like to reply to that personally."
"As chairman of the committee, I asked the rapporteur to proceed, as I said, by proposing an amendment about the disabled, but to refer the rest of all of it to the technical bodies."
"It was then shown that there were difficulties in doing this."
"I therefore proposed setting up a working party to look for a sensible solution."
"I proposed this before the vote in the committee."
"We then voted on it, but the majority party in this House voted otherwise."
"The result was that the Murphy report, which in my opinion was not ready for discussion, came to the House against my will as committee chairman."
"I am therefore not now speaking as the committee chairman, but as a member of the Group of the European People's Party."
"That is my answer to what Mr Metten has said."
"(Applause and heckling)"
"Madam President, I particularly want to respond to the comments by Mr von Wogau."
"I joined this House in 1989 and under his predecessor, Mr Beumer, we dealt with a mountain of technical legislation which went through this House to complete the internal market and it is a nonsense for the Economic Committee chairman to say that we are not competent to deal with this legislation in this House."
"The reason why they do not want this on the floor today is because they voted against the amendments to help the disabled in the design of buses and coaches."
"That is why they do not want the legislation on the floor of this House."
"I tell you, disabled people around Europe now are watching to see how the Christian Democrats vote on this issue because we have passed amendments in the committee to support the disabled and they want this report off the agenda."
"(The matter was referred back to the committee responsible)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0110/98) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on democratic accountability in the third stage of EMU."
"Thank you, Mr Berthu, for drawing attention to these linguistic confusions."
"I am sure the ensuing debate will clarify any unclear points, and it is therefore my great pleasure to call upon Mrs Randzio-Plath to speak."
"President, what matters in the question of democratic accountability is the creation of transparency and credibility."
"It is not a question of the control of the future European Central Bank, because the Treaty of Maastricht establishes the independence of the future European Central Bank very clearly."
"This European Parliament, in its decisions and reports, has left no doubt that the future European Central Bank, in the conception of independence, is also a constituent part of European monetary union, which will begin on 1 January 1999."
"This leads one to the conclusion that one side of the coin is the independence of the European Central Bank, but that the other side of the coin is transparency of decisions and their context, which find expression in a duty of accountability of the European Central Bank."
"Besides, the Treaty of Maastricht and the statute of the European Central Bank already provide for a duty of the future European Central Bank to report."
"The place in which this duty to report as an expression of transparency must be fulfilled is Parliament."
"This transparency is an obligation in a democratic system for all institutions and establishments, and therefore also for the first supranational, federal European institution, the European Central Bank."
"This transparency must be expressed before the only legitimized European body, the European Parliament."
"Therefore, what is necessary today is to define in what form this European Parliament wants to see this monetary dialogue with the European Central Bank."
"We also make demands on the basis of our experience of the debates with the Boards of Governors of Central Banks, the European Monetary Institute, in the Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs, and also in the sittings of this Parliament. This experience shows the importance of regular monetary dialogue, which actually concentrates on the monetary subjects which are currently of intense topicality, does so calmly and will continue to do so."
"We must also consider the ideas of the Treaty, which says very clearly that the European Central Bank must pursue the aim of price stability and also support the economic policy of the European Union, provided that the aim of price stability is not affected."
"It is therefore important that we know all about the definition of price stability, about the decisions and the backgrounds to them, about the monetary aims and how the instruments are used."
"That is all part of the dialogue of the European Parliament with the European Central Bank, as is publishing the reports of the European Central Bank."
"This publication and this dialogue create transparency, not just in the interests of the European Parliament, the functioning of the democratic system and in the interests of the European population."
"No, I believe that this transparency is also in the interests of the European Central Bank itself, which can only gain credibility, acceptance and trust through this transparency of its decisions."
"We all know that right now in our Member States important questions are being asked about the start of monetary union."
"It will therefore be particularly important that this European Central Bank should gain trust, credibility and acceptance."
"It is therefore so important that we as the European Parliament should participate in the nomination procedure."
"We are being heard."
"I assume, and presumably this is also the view of the European Parliament, that no candidate will become a member of the Executive Board of the future European Central Bank without the approval of the European Parliament, even if this rule has not yet been written into a treaty."
"The candidates will surely gain credibility and certainly weight as a result of their competence and by giving evidence of their previous position to the European Parliament."
"This new European Central Bank gives us the possibility of entering into a dialogue with its President."
"But at the same time, in all Member States, the national parliaments will have to enter into a dialogue with their national central bank presidents."
"What matters, therefore, is that use is made of this right, so that Parliament is the place of openness, and above all so that this European Parliament is the place of that European openness, which is still lacking."
"That is in the interests of the population, and also of the markets, for as the great economist Schumpeter once said, everything a people wants, does, suffers and is, is reflected in its monetary system."
"I hope that the stable community of the European monetary union really will offer possibilities of creating the overall economic conditions within the European Union that enable the euro to contribute to the fight against unemployment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the power to mint or issue a currency is a considerable one, and history shows that those who hold this power have rarely resisted the temptation to abuse it."
"People who have been the victims of such abuses of power thus always want to put safeguards in place."
"The French, after suffering the ""assignat' bank notes issued during the French Revolution, made such a mythical rush for gold that General de Gaulle himself took out a loan."
"The Germans, traumatized by two monetary cataclysms, found maximum protection from the political control they rightly feared through the independence of the Bundesbank , which was imposed on them from outside."
"You can understand, then, why governments were keen to ensure sufficient guarantees before renouncing national monetary sovereignty in favour of a common currency."
"These they gained beyond all expectations."
"The independence of the future Central Bank will be stronger than that of any other similar institution, as I explain in the opinion which is submitted to you."
"But independence does not imply irresponsibility."
"In a democracy, all holders of power must be answerable to those who gave them that power and in whose name they exercise it, in this case the people of Europe who we here represent."
"The Randzio-Plath report, as it has been adopted, finds an acceptable balance between independence and responsibility."
"In today's world, the credibility of the future Central Bank will depend on its accuracy of analysis and its explanation of decisions."
"Mr Lamfalussy and Mr Duesenberg were the first to understand this and this is why they have lent themselves so easily to listening to, and dialoguing with Parliament, rightly considering that they would thus acquire greater legitimacy than that conferred on them by the Treaty."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Randzio-Plath on an excellent report and also thank my colleagues in the other political groups for the enormous amount of cooperation we have had in the formulation of this report."
"The EMU, as we know, is the most historic development that will take place in the European Union since the creation of the European Economic Community."
"Therefore we have to make sure that we do it right."
"We have to make sure that it is particularly friendly to the citizens."
"I want to say to my German colleagues in particular, who seem to feel that those who want accountability of the Central Bank in some way want to impede its operation, that the citizens in the rest of the European Union do not have the same confidence and warmth for the ECB that you probably have for the Bundesbank. The Bundesbank has been enormously successful."
"The European Central Bank is a new institution that has to earn the confidence of the public."
"The way to do that is to make sure it is accountable to the only democratically elected body we have among the European Union institutions."
"There is nothing incompatible in defending the independence of the bank."
"The Socialist Group will defend the independence of that bank wholeheartedly."
"But we want to make sure that the currency we are creating is a citizens' currency; something that the people in the European Union feel confident with and feel is acting on their behalf."
"This is not merely a currency for the large financial institutions and multinationals."
"It is for the 370 million people who live in the European Union."
"So we need to put in place systems that will guarantee that public confidence."
"Those of us who have had the chance to talk privately to Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy and other people who may find themselves on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank have always said that it is essential that the European Central Bank does not simply act as a collection of bookkeepers but that it acts very much as an institution of the European Union acting on behalf of its citizens."
"I say to all Members of this House, the Commission and the potential candidates for the ECB: please understand that the success of that bank, operating in Frankfurt, will depend upon its public acceptability and its public accountability."
"There is another point which is important from the point of view of accountability: we will have a centralized monetary authority but we will have a decentralized fiscal policy in the European Union."
"We have to make sure that when national parliaments are setting their national budgets there is a feeling that there is a democratic body at a European level overseeing the monetary policy that is being set in the name of the citizens of the European Union, on behalf of the whole European Union."
"We have to make sure that there is a link between the work of national parliaments and the European Parliament in ensuring that we have the democratic accountability of our Central Bank."
"If we fail in this project then I think it will impede any further development we want to see in the future of the EU."
"Mr President, after some irritation over treaty changes, a vote of no confidence and so on, the RandzioPlath report is now before us in a version on which we can agree to a large extent."
"The European Parliament today shows by a convincing majority - at least in the vote - that it is conscious of its great responsibility for the independence of the Central Bank and for the lasting stability of the euro."
"The Christian Democrats have one signal to give today. It is that we want a European currency which contributes, within Europe and globally, to ensuring that the citizens can rely on having long term political and economic stability."
"But such a signal must also be demanded from the Heads of States and Governments."
"Their task now is to appoint the President of the Central Bank as soon as possible."
"Trust in the euro and European monetary union depends on the time and progress of this decision."
"But - and I must say this openly - anyone today who, like the SPD candidate for chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, calls the euro a deformed premature birth, disqualifies himself as an interlocutor to be taken seriously."
"How will such a man carry through a long term European policy, if he gives way to moods and vague fears and, against his better judgement, deliberately denigrates the greatest project of the post-war period?"
"I appeal here to the Social Democrats in this House: put a bit more mental effort into finally teaching your own candidate for chancellor the ABC of European politics."
"Mr Schröder may manage to buy a steelworks at the taxpayers' expense and to sit on the Volkswagen Supervisory Board, but he is not up to forming a strategic monetary policy or to buying Rolls-Royce."
"That needs political heavyweights like Kohl, Waiger and Stoiber, and not SPD lightweights like Schröder and Lafontaine."
"If the Socialists in this House do not manage to help their candidate for chancellor back onto his feet in terms of European politics, they remain paper tigers, and the man from Hannover will bring them yet more horror stories about Europe."
"We, the European Christian Democrats, want to make our contribution to making the euro into the most important and most stable currency in the world, next to the dollar."
"We owe that to our citizens!"
"Mr President, as rapporteur I would like to ask that the election campaign in certain Member States should remain outside the House at a time of such an important decision for the future of European democracy and for the historical project of monetary union."
"I am outraged that this historical hour is being used in this way, that we are squandering this time, which has been provided for the important democratic debate that should really do honour to this European Parliament."
"Mr President, I ask you to ensure that it does."
"I can assure you, Mrs Randzio-Plath, that this was not an item on the agenda."
"Mr President, with regard to electoral campaigns, in France we have already given an opinion and I would prefer that we keep to the subject in hand."
"This Parliament, which represents the citizens of the Union, will naturally have a role to play within the framework of the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union, which will necessarily lead to greater powers for certain institutions."
"Clearly, the independence of the European Central Bank will be greater than that of any other national central bank and whilst we can imagine enforcing democratic control of the ECB at European level, I am not at all certain that the Bank will be able to draw its legitimacy from a control which is too nit-picking."
"This legitimacy will come rather from its success in managing the European Union's monetary policy."
"Amongst the interesting proposals in this report, I would like to mention the one inviting the President of the ECB to participate in a general debate regarding economic and monetary developments, along with the relevant Commissioner and the President of the Ecofin Council. This would be on the basis of an annual report from the ECB and the annual economic report drawn up by the Commission, which requests the ECB to give an explanation of decisions previously taken on monetary policy and requests a description of the way in which monetary policy will support the economic policies of the Union."
"I would merely like to remind you that some of the initial proposals of the rapporteur were not acceptable, nor were they in accordance with the measures of the Treaty."
"For example, the idea of requesting the ECB to publish a summary of the discussions of the Executive Board, which was in direct contradiction with paragraph 4 of Article 10 of the ESCB statutes, which anticipated that these meetings should be confidential, with the board deciding whether or not to make their deliberations public."
"It was the same for the idea of giving the European Parliament the right of censure and of joint nomination of the Executive Board, which assumed a revision of the Treaty, in particular paragraph 4 of Article 109."
"On 18 March, the initial report was substantially modified in committee and our group is extremely pleased with this."
"All of these modifications are good in that they have enabled the report to be more lucidly refocussed."
"Thus modified, Mrs Randzio-Plath's report is acceptable to us."
"Mr President, I think it is plainly dangerous that the world's most independent bank, the European Central Bank, is going to become a sort of ivory tower in Frankfurt."
"The danger is that the bank and its directors will withdraw from normal society and that exaggerated price stability will, in the end, pose a threat to peace within EU society."
"This must be prevented by the board of the ECB becoming involved in institutional dialogue with the other political bodies."
"The decisions the board takes must always be transparent."
"They must be stated publicly, and I am totally convinced that public opinion will still accept that the European Parliament has a key role to play in this matter, and in the monitoring of democracy."
"Obviously it is not a question of the ECB receiving binding instructions from political bodies."
"Rapidly dwindling capital resources simply will not sustain this sort of old-fashioned policy."
"But it is quite clear that the European Parliament should propose bold amendments to the Treaty of Rome."
"Now, unfortunately, Christa Randzio-Plath's splendid report has little left in it of this courage, and little left of the proposals she originally made."
"The Green Group supports the idea that the ECB board should be appointed by the same process as exists with the European Commission, a body to which Parliament has an important role in appointing members."
"I think it is essential that everyone should be in a position to remind the Central Bank's Executive Board of its mortality."
"This could come about in such a way that Parliament, say by a given majority, could make recommendations to the Ecofin Council in extreme cases concerning the dismissal of even the President of the Bank."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Radical Alliance fully supports the Randzio-Plath report."
"I consider it an excellent text which attempts to show what dialogue there could be between the Central Bank, which in fact will be the most independent in the world, and other institutions, especially Parliament."
"I would ask Mrs Randzio-Plath to be so good as to take on board the amendments we have presented, which move in the same direction as the report, whilst trying to strengthen it somewhat in order to encourage even greater dialogue."
"We must strengthen the possibility of the European Parliament becoming the place of dialogue with the ECB, the place for transparent and regular exchanges - at closer intervals, in my opinion - the place where the President can express himself and where, on behalf of our people, we can question him without challenging its independence."
"I think such dialogue would be extremely important to show public opinion that we are not creating an ivory tower but a body required to account for its actions before an institution such as the European Parliament."
"The proposal that I have made on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance suggests a monthly meeting for contact and dialogue with the future President."
"I leave this on the table for your consideration."
"I think this could strengthen dialogue, not only in spirit."
"I understand the President of the Federal Reserve appears before the American Congress every fortnight."
"Our other proposal is for the President designate, who will be in regular contact with Parliament, to give an opinion on the resolution that we are going to adopt tomorrow, on the basis of this report."
"These are the two proposals that I would like you to consider, and I hope that you will vote in favour of them tomorrow."
"Mr President, scarcely a month before the choice of countries to be irreversibly, according to the expression drummed endlessly into us by Commissioner de Silguy, blended together in European Monetary Union, Parliament has finally become concerned with the essential question of its democratic accountability."
"Many good people, amongst them federalists, some within this Parliament, are beginning to show serious concerns about this dangerous flaw in the European institutional system."
"But raising the problem of this democratic shortcoming is not enough, we must also look for possible remedies."
"This is what the Herman report, in particular, tried to do, by not evading the ""taboo' issues such as lack of a political mechanism to warn us of any abuse of monetary power on the part of the ECB which might be to the detriment of the general interest, or the risk of seeing day to day decisions on the external value of the euro being taken by the ECB and not the Ecofin Council, contrary to the measures of the Treaty."
"It would have been preferable to agree to put the Herman report back on the agenda for this part-session, as my colleagues Mr Berthu and Mr van Dam proposed on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, in order to give the debate its true dimensions."
"This was not done. The Randzio-Plath report is therefore the only one on the table today."
"It limits itself to a number of pertinent comments, it recognizes that the ECB will become the first supranational monetary authority in history and will thus consequently hold unprecedented power, far greater than that of the German Bundesbank or the American Federal Reserve and that, for the first time, an area in which federal political decisions are taken within the European Union will emerge."
"But whilst the report admits that this unprecedented independence calls for a similarly high level of democratic accountability, no concrete proposal is made as to how this might be achieved."
"The report makes no mention of the essential role that national parliaments have to play in this control."
"It contents itself essentially with reminding us of a few powers of consultation that are reserved for the European Parliament, which seem really quite derisory in the face of the central question raised by Mr Herman: to whom are these holders of quasi-absolute power going to be answerable?"
"Mr President, under such conditions we cannot support this report and we fear that the birth of the first truly supranational institution of the European Union may be synonymous with a decline in democracy."
"Mr President, the problem we are dealing with today is both a theological and a teleological one, that is, a question of purpose."
"Theological because it is a question of belief, of dogma."
"The independence of central banks should be a factor of efficiency."
"The Bank of England was the model for the dependent bank, along with the Bank of Japan, and everyone knows that these two countries were inefficient."
"Economic literature does not enable this problem to be solved."
"For example, France during the 90s did not have any inflation, but their central bank was nevertheless dependent."
"If we look at German history we can see there is a German desire to resolve their neuroses: Weimar, independence."
"People say that the Germans have been very prosperous and they have had an independent central bank."
"But the Germans are also blonde, yet is this a factor in their prosperity?"
"In this case, let's dye all the Spaniards' hair blonde and there will no longer be an economic problem in Spain."
"Must all Europeans give up sugar just because its German grandmother is diabetic?"
"Perhaps the German situation is explained by the fact that they have not been involved in wars in Indochina, or in Algeria?"
"Germany lost the Second World War and has put its efforts into household electronics instead of military electronics."
"Is this factor not important?"
"There are no choices but ideological ones, of the same type as that of Vincent Auriol, ""I'll close the banks and lock up all the bankers' ."
"We have come a long way since then."
"It is revealing that Mrs Randzio-Plath has talked constantly of the ECB, rather like we talk about BSE."
"First the mad cow, now the mad single currency!"
"There is a teleological question. What is the purpose?"
"Why have a monetary Europe?"
"Why have an independent central bank?"
"For monetary stability?"
"Is our aim in life, man's destiny, the independence of the Central Bank?"
"The mystery of life on earth, the single currency, are they monetary stability?"
"I believed that Europe was the little Eurasian continent, a model of democracy."
"Mr President, when a governing body receives orders from no-one and is made up of a very small number of people, what is it called?"
"Government by a few is known as an oligarchy, and there stands the tragedy of the European continent, the model of democracy, which ends up with a monetary oligarchy, or at least, a Prussian one."
"Mr President, in her report Mrs Randzio-Plath rightly quoted Joseph Schumpeter's comments in which he said that the state of a nation's monetary system reflected all aspects of the nation's intentions, actions, vicissitudes and, indeed, its very essence."
"There is therefore nothing more important than democratic accountability of monetary policy."
"It has to be noted that within our institutional framework - which has been ratified by our people, our parliaments and our authorities - the current Treaty gives the European Central Bank power and independence without democratic accountability."
"Within this overall unsatisfactory framework, the quality of Mrs Randzio-Plath's report is that it attempts to see how Parliament may make its voice heard better and how we could use the measures within the Treaty to go as far as possible, not in the sense of controlling the Central Bank, for there will be no control given that there are no sanctions, but in the sense of a dialogue with Parliament and a capacity for transparency."
"I thus approve of the proposals which have been made."
"It is in this context, above and beyond Mrs Randzio-Plath's report, that it is important for the House to encourage some readjustments in how democracy functions in Europe."
"I believe that a Central Bank - if it were independent - would need checks and balances in a number of areas."
"It is not normal that it takes its independence from a treaty alone."
"As Mrs Randzio-Plath said in her report, whether it be the American Federal Reserve or the German Bundesbank , central banks are usually controlled by parliaments because their jurisdiction is set by legislative acts which can at any given time be amended or changed."
"This is unfortunately not the case with the European Central Bank."
"It would be appropriate, in the future, to provide national parliaments, and above all the European Parliament, with the means to have an influence in this direction."
"Secondly, it is important to highlight the fact that the Ecofin Council now finds itself in a position where it has the capacity to intervene with regard to the exchange rates of currencies such as the dollar or the yen, but with limited powers."
"I have one small regret with regard to Mrs Randzio-Plath's report."
"It is that, when she rightly explains that the concept of monetary stability is a concept which must be tailored to the circumstances of the situation, she gives the Central Bank, rather than the Ecofin Council, the role of fixing the criteria for stability, which could have moved the balance back a little bit in the other direction."
"But more fundamentally, Europe needs an economic government. a political government which, a little like the case of the German government in relation to the independent central German bank today, is in a position to make other reasoning, apart from the logic of monetary stability alone, prevail."
"I am talking about employment, prosperity and social justice and it is not satisfactory to see the Euro Council be no more than a vague instrument of consultation."
"I will finish by saying that my great regret is that Amsterdam has not enabled this institutional readjustment."
"Failing this at Amsterdam, let us move quickly on to a new stage, which is essential and which Parliament desires since it wants major reforms to have taken place before enlargement."
"Mr President, should the Central Bank be accountable to this Parliament?"
"The answer is ""yes' ."
"Should the bank be corrected by this Parliament?"
"The answer is certainly not."
"I come from the Dutch tradition of an independent central bank."
"Dutch politicians, and certainly the Dutch parliament, have, as far as I know, never formally tried to exert influence over the bank."
"The European people, and this is my firm conviction, have nothing to gain from political influence over monetary policy."
"Economic research has shown that independent central banks are more successful in achieving lower inflation rates than banks which are guided by politicians."
"Politicians are reelected every four or five years."
"This entails, by definition, a markedly short term vision."
"Public confidence and faith on the part of the markets is crucial to the EMU."
"That is why it must be guarded with a long term perspective in mind."
"That is why the President of the ECB will be appointed for a term of eight years."
"As he cannot be reappointed, he does not have to please anyone."
"One of the bank's central tasks is to achieve price stability and he therefore forms an element of continuity and stability within European monetary policy."
"Of course the ECB should not operate from an ivory tower. Mr Donnelly, I would like to say to you, being independent and having a central position in society does not have to be a contradiction in terms."
"That is why a provision has been made for intensive debates between the President, the Executive Board and this Parliament on the annual report or the quarterly reports."
"The presidents of the national banks will also start a dialogue with their parliaments."
"Finally, the bank will not receive political instructions, but neither will it be blind or deaf to the needs of European society, because it will be in touch with all the important forces in society."
"If this is its position, its monetary policy will be supported."
"Mr President, as the structures of the single currency are put in place, fundamental questions are coming to light."
"Some of them cannot be satisfactorily answered without rethinking some of the measures anticipated by the current treaties."
"Today's debate on democratic accountability of the ECB is a significant example of this."
"The resolution shows that the objective of European economic and monetary policy must be to assure a high level of growth and employment."
"Indeed, this is common sense."
"It also notes that in a democracy, there must also be control of the ECB's monetary policy."
"This seems unquestionable."
"However the statutes provided for the ECB by the current treaties do not move in this direction at all."
"On the one hand, its level of independence - unsurpassed in the world - is so far removed from the citizens and their elected representatives that any effective control of its activities would seem to be illusory."
"On the other hand, the mission conferred on it by the treaties is to ensure, not a high level of employment but price stability, which is totally different."
"As the reports on convergence from the Commission, the European Monetary Institute and the Bundesbank have reminded us, this stability will be obtained by keeping salaries in check and lowering the overall cost of labour."
"From within this concept then, the ECB is more ultra-liberal than the United States Federal Reserve itself, which officially has the main objective of high employment."
"If one day we should criticize the President of the ECB for being overly concerned with a strong euro and ignoring all social considerations, he will merely reply that he is only doing his job."
"This is why I think that if you truly want a monetary institution that does not ration, but relaunches the necessary finances for employment and growth, and one which the citizens' representatives can effectively monitor in this objective, we cannot economize on the reorientation of the construction of Europe."
"By chance, the very day that we are debating this question an official report has sent out a warning regarding the levels of poverty and insecurity in France."
"It is the same throughout Europe."
"Faced with these issues, which touch on the very core of values essential to our society, we cannot let the financial markets make the rules, nor be satisfied with potential control over an all powerful ECB."
"European construction has greater ambitions!"
"Mr President, the establishment of a European central banking system is drawing near, planned for the first half of 1998, following the decision to participate in the third stage of EMU."
"The European Central Bank will have the fullest legal status and, as soon as it is set up, will take over the residual duties of the European Monetary Institute."
"As specified by the rapporteur, the European Central Bank will have the specific task of controlling price stability, which is achieved specifically by means of a cautious and impartial monetary policy, and by conducting exchange transactions, managing the foreign currency reserves of Member States, promoting the operation of payment systems and, finally, authorizing the issue of bank notes and coins."
"Price stability throughout Europe and the independence of the European Central Bank will give rise to trust on the markets and, consequently, we should achieve a fall in interest rates, particularly in the long term."
"This will be extremely favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent the highest percentage of European businesses, particularly in the economically weaker areas."
"However, I share the rapporteur's concerns when she notes that, as established in the Treaty, in exercising its powers and performing its tasks and duties, the European Central Bank is totally independent, which means that none of its bodies can accept or request instructions or orders from any government or other organization."
"As laid down by Article 7 of its statutes, it is certainly the most independent central bank in the world."
"The sovereignty it will hold should, however, ensure an impartial monetary policy for all the Member States, thereby ruling out the risk that, lacking any democratic control, the European Central Bank is free to interfere at will in any questions dealing with the monetary policy of Member States."
"I therefore believe it absolutely essential that, in view of the necessary operational independence of the European Central Bank, appropriate mechanisms are provided for consultation with the European Parliament, which is a democratically elected body."
"Mr President, the European Central Bank, which will be set up in three months time, will be more independent than any existing bank in the world."
"It would be a misconception to think that it does not have to take any notice of anybody."
"It will not be operating in a vacuum, and it will have to acquire credibility and authority."
"The ECB will find this easiest if it is able to show results, but this will take some time."
"Moreover, although the ECB will be born in an era of historically low inflation, no one knows how the monetary instruments which have proved their usefulness on a national level will work on a European level."
"During its initial phase, ECB policy will have to be characterized by a cautious, searching approach."
"It will be extremely difficult to acquire public credibility through such an approach."
"It can only be achieved in one way, namely by reporting back continuously and by explaining what the ECB does, and why."
"This is the paradox of the ECB; it will be the largest independent bank in the world, but it has the most to gain from transparency and accountability."
"This is where the interests of the ECB and the European Parliament meet, because the European Parliament is the only public forum the ECB has the duty to report to, as laid down in the Treaty."
"We therefore think it would be useful to reach agreement with the ECB on how, in the interests of both, this transparency and accountability can be effected in as meaningful a way as possible."
"It will require regular verbal or written reports about such issues as which monetary objectives are set and why, the degree to which objectives are implemented and the reason for any possible divergence and the effects of monetary policy on the economy and employment."
"The willingness of the ECB to be as transparent as possible and to be accountable in a meaningful way will be particularly crucial during the initial phase."
"Without this, it might seem that the ECB is making a false start and is unsuccessful in building up credibility and authority."
"That is why Parliament will have to ensure that belief in the principles of democracy and a willingness to be accountable are significant factors in the choice of prospective board members."
"We will not only ask those who may not win the confidence of a majority in this Parliament to withdraw their candidature, but we will also call on Member States' governments not to appoint any candidates who cannot rely on the support of this Parliament."
"In view of the ECB's extreme degree of independence, the democratic attitude of individual candidates most definitely matters, and this includes candidates for all posts."
"That is why the candidate hearings next month will not be a mere formality."
"If the ECB is to be imbued with the principles of democracy, it should be done now."
"That is what is at stake at the moment."
"Mr President, the establishment of the single currency is an unprecedented historical phenomenon."
"For the first time in the world's history, independent states and democratic societies have decided to give up a significant part of their national independence - their currency - to a common instrument, to be managed for the benefit of all."
"I therefore think the debates now taking place about transparency, about the ""absolute management' method, or the fears being expressed about whether the European Central Bank will act imperiously or in ways that do not benefit the societies it represents, are rather unnecessary."
"In democratic societies such as ours, public opinion and the democratic process are facts of life. Since central banks everywhere, and especially the European Central Bank, are supposed to be working for the good of all Europe's peoples - and that is the reason why they exist, otherwise they would not -, public opinion will compel them both to operate transparently and to deal with the issues for which they are responsible in the best possible way."
"I therefore think that the debates from time to time about lack of transparency, and the concerns expressed by one side or the other, are unnecessary and should cease as soon as possible, since the other extreme, that of complete openness, would make it impossible for the Central Bank to do its work."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath's very good report, as it has developed, proposes precisely a balance between those two factors and, I think, expresses a very correct opinion. I hope Parliament will adopt it in a way that protects the interests of Europe's peoples while at the same time enabling the new system to operate as effectively as possible."
"Mr President, the full independence of the European Central Bank is quite rightly anchored in the Treaty."
"The highest aim of its monetary policy is to ensure price stability."
"The decision on how far the European Central Bank supports the general economic policy of the Community thus depends on its assessment of a possible effect on the aim of price stability."
"Price stability at any price, even at the price of increasing unemployment!"
"That is, to come to the point, the public discourse, which in the end means one thing: monetary policy is not neutral."
"That is why it is necessary to involve the European Central Bank in a dialogue about politics."
"I do not believe that the independence of the European Central Bank on the one hand and the required democratic transparency on the other must necessarily be in contradiction to each other."
"But I am certain that monetary union needs the acceptance of citizens to be successful."
"This, however, can only be achieved by the transparency of the decisions of the European Central Bank and by their democratic legitimization."
"Mr President, Mrs Randzio-Plath's report addresses one of the most important questions facing us as we wait at the door to monetary union, the very central pillar of which will be the independence of the European Central Bank, in the terms laid down by the Treaty and the bank's statutes."
"That the issuing institute should be independent is no mere dogma or axiom of economic science, or the result of abstract reasoning. Instead, it is a working method vouched for mainly by historical experience."
"On both sides of the Atlantic, in the two best known examples, experience has shown the practical advantages of an independent monetary authority for guaranteeing price stability."
"Well, as has been said here this afternoon, independence certainly does not mean irresponsibility."
"In a democracy, every power - and the European Central Bank will be a power - even if it is independent of political power, as is the case with the European Central Bank or, in another area, the judiciary, should be able to explain to the citizens and public opinion the reasons underlying its actions and its choice of objectives, and why it chose the methods it adopted in order to achieve those objectives and goals."
"All of that should be true both a priori and a posteriori ."
"For democratic control demands, firstly, dialogue with the parliamentary institution - with this Parliament and the national parliaments - and also transparency of information."
"In both those respects, the Randzio-Plath report is realistic and balanced."
"I conclude, Mr President, by saying that we have to realize that in setting out along this road, Parliament must show that it is up to its new role as the European Central Bank's main partner for dialogue."
"At the same time, it must also be stressed that along that road we should not rule out the possibility of eventual reforms, even of the Treaty itself - as has been called for here this afternoon - in order to give greater depth to that same democratic control of the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, as has been clearly stated, the independence of the European Central Bank is a valuable asset and is therefore beyond discussion."
"In a federal system, it provides a fundamental guarantee for the participating states and also gives credibility and authority to the Bank on the financial markets."
"Accountability, which we have been talking about this afternoon, is not only a democratic requirement but also an essential requirement for maintaining the authority and credibility of the Bank."
"Firstly, therefore, it is in the interests of the ECB itself to adopt adequate methods of referral to public opinion, obviously taking into account the enormous difference between explanations given prior to action programmes, which can only be expressed in general terms, and statements after implementation on the lines followed, which should be more analytical."
"In my opinion, therefore, it is not a question of laying down rules, but rather of encouraging behaviour towards the European Parliament, a behaviour that can establish a climate of trust through transparency and availability to explain and discuss its actions, which, in the context of our debate, we are calling accountability, and which is in the interests of the authority and credibility of the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, unlike all the other people who have spoken in this debate, I come from a country where, prior to the euro, there has never been a political debate on currency."
"Luxembourg, united with Belgium in monetary union since 1922, has never truly had the right of speech within this union."
"Economic and Monetary Union will give us that right."
"With monetary union, the citizens of my country are discovering the importance of everything surrounding the issue of currency."
"This is why the purpose of dialogue between the European Parliament and the Central Bank is to raise awareness amongst the general public of the importance of monetary policy within social and economic policy in general."
"The ECB's objective has been stated as price stability."
"What will the consequences of this be on the Member States' policies?"
"Let me give you an example."
"In Luxembourg, incomes are largely indexed to price levels."
"It is an important factor in my country's policy of redistribution of income and social policy in general."
"If, for example, the ECB were to give an opinion on this, it needs to be possible to discuss this question publicly, along with the choices."
"I therefore think that public support for the ECB's monetary policy is essential for the birth of the new currency. The Bank's public presentation of its choices and interventions will also be essential."
"I would like to finish, Mr President, by congratulating Mrs Randzio-Plath on her report and above all on the work which she has achieved over the last few years, as chair of the Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs, in putting monetary union in place and getting it onto the European Parliament's agenda."
"Given the weight of the future European Central Bank, I think that the European Parliament should seriously consider creating a Monetary Committee, within the framework of which, dialogue with the Central Bank could be developed."
"Mr President, all the speakers have said we are facing the most historic event since the signing of the Treaty of Rome."
"That is true, and this Parliament - which has always been the driving force behind European integration - should do everything that can and must be done to ensure the euro is a success."
"And in order for the euro to be a success, we are all agreed that we need to guarantee price stability."
"I am not going to question that, but I am glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath's report also talks of other objectives, particularly that of job-creation."
"We are also agreed that monetary policy should be designed and implemented by a European Central Bank which is independent."
"I will not question that either, but I am also glad that the Randzio-Plath report talks about the need to coordinate monetary policy with the rest of our policies, in order to achieve the European Union's great objectives."
"I think the institutional agreement suggested by Mr Herman is a clever idea, and I think it represents a first step which we will probably have to evaluate in the future, revising the Treaties if need be."
"As noted in the report, the economic government of Europe constitutes a necessary counterweight."
"To conclude, I think it is important that the European Central Bank should not just be a bubble in the air, a sort of aristocratic Neoplatonism, and the European Parliament should play its part here."
"Mr President, in a few weeks' time the European Union will be choosing the governor of the European Central Bank and Britain's future bank manager."
"Make no mistake about it, the setting of interest rates by the ECB governor and his or her board of five governors will profoundly affect the United Kingdom's interest rates, inflation levels and the strength of the pound sterling."
"So we parliamentarians had better get it right when we help to confirm the choice of Europe's bank boss, especially when we hold the unique inquisitorial hearings in Parliament in Brussels in May."
"To scrutinize the candidates for the ECB is in no way to challenge the independence of the ECB."
"Indeed its independence, guaranteed by the Maastricht Treaty, is even more sharply defined and delineated than that of the Bundesbank, its original model."
"But Europe and its peoples do demand that we subject the ECB to legitimate, democratic accountability, that we verify that what is done in the name of the independent bank, is done for the people, of the people and is by the people; that the central objective of price stability leads to the palace of prosperity and jobs, not to the den of deflation and recession."
"Such accountability is merited, not only to satisfy Europe's democratic needs, but also and more importantly to shore up the credentials of the bank itself."
"This point was itself made to me by candidate Duisenberg last week in the European Parliament's monetary sub-committee and this committee, too, must adopt and adapt."
"Its fledgling role as banking committee for the citizens of Europe must be developed and essentially the ECB governor should present not only the bank's annual report but also offer regular, possibly quarterly, explanations of its interest rate decisions, and the minutes themselves should be published in summary form showing the decisions made plus explanatory commentary."
"Only in this way will the European Parliament perform its task of independent custodian of the independent bank as set out in the exemplary and pioneering report so finely chased and chiselled by my colleague Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath."
"Mr President, when the European Central Bank begins operations, it will have immense economic power."
"Seriously, it will take decisions on all economic policy, because, for example, the hands of financial policy will be bound by convergence criteria."
"European trade-cycles will in the long run depend on the ECB Board being able to take the right decisions and avoid making mistakes during its eight-year term of office."
"Whether or not we find an Executive Board for the bank made up of six men and women with practically supernatural abilities is the old sixty four thousand dollar question."
"Independence is a proper issue, but we also need to have Parliamentary dialogue."
"Unopposed power easily leads to its misinterpretation and abuse."
"The Board must work in close cooperation with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"It must also be able to resolve problems in monetary policy, and growth and employment policy."
"A very orthodox monetary policy might very well lead to stagnation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the euro has to create stability for Member States."
"The euro should become the third international reserve currency alongside the dollar and the yen."
"How well this is to succeed depends on the efforts of the ECB's directors."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by the Commission and the European Monetary Institute have brought us into the finishing straight for the single currency's establishment, an historical event for the building of a single Europe."
"For the single currency's management, Europe is at last getting a Central Bank equal to the task, a bank that will exercise Europe's monetary policy in a unified way that takes into account the needs and interests of all the single currency Member States and, I hope, those of the countries which are not yet members of the single currency but aspire to become so soon."
"It would be a mistake to think that there has never before been a single currency policy in Europe."
"Such policies have existed from time to time, but not with a spirit of cooperation."
"They were implemented under a spirit of imposition by one or another powerful central bank in Europe, or even by a powerful bank outside Europe."
"That will not happen in the future."
"But to be able to implement its monetary policy in a fair and balanced way, the European Central Bank must be sure of its independence."
"That independence is not threatened, but safeguarded by the provisions for democratic accountability advocated by Mrs Randzio-Plath's report."
"Responsible information of Parliament will consolidate the bank's authority among Europe's peoples, and will enable it to do its work guided only by the general interest and without being influenced by the interests of special groups."
"In the process of democratic accountability advocated by the report we are debating, Parliament will be able to point to the general interest, according to circumstances, and so create a climate which provides a framework for the Central Bank to fulfil its duties in the best possible way."
"Mr President, although from my point of view there is no question of challenging the ECB's independence, the problem of knowing how to control those who implement monetary policy, their power to do both good and evil - in the field of economics, of course, because it is not a question of preaching morality - is the decisive factor."
"It is clear that democracy demands that those in charge of monetary policy should not be allowed to operate without ever having to justify their actions."
"It is appropriate that these people should account for their policies and that such policies should be widely discussed, particularly within Parliament as this is the only elected body at European level."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath's report more or less respects the balance between independence and democratic accountability extremely well."
"The Group of the European People's Party, myself included, are generally in favour."
"Nevertheless, I would like to raise one doubt."
"It is with regard to Article 3 which points out that monetary policy has an influence on growth and employment."
"I do not question this position, but I think it lacks precision."
"Certainly, currency influences growth and employment, but it is a temporary and not a long term influence."
"To believe that currency has a long term influence on growth and employment, as was the case in the preliminary report, has devastating consequences for monetary policy."
"If this were so, there would be no reason to follow a monetary policy of price stability."
"On the contrary, it would be necessary to apply a permanent policy of reflation."
"It would only be a question of the President of the Central Bank getting into his helicopter - for I am sure he will have one - and throwing tonnes of 500 euro notes down on the heads of the astonished but delighted populations of Europe."
"It is in order to avoid this sort of misunderstanding that I thought it necessary to clarify this point, for it must not be misunderstood by the Commission, the Council or public opinion."
"Mr President, this report is fundamental to the future of the European Parliament."
"The European Central Bank is totally independent, and that is how we perceive it."
"However, the legitimacy of its operations and the possibility of monitoring it in a democratic manner are matters that have been widely discussed in all countries."
"In Portugal, one of the most controversial and widely discussed subjects is the European Central Bank's lack of democratic accountability."
"The European Parliament, which will examine the candidates to the board of the European Central Bank, is entitled to hear the President and respective board regularly."
"In our view, in the European Parliament, when we vote for and approve the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, they assume the responsibility of any elected individual to render accounts."
"While the European Parliament will not intervene in the European Central Bank's decisions, the Bank itself has everything to gain from explaining its decisions in a regular and systematic manner to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs in the manner previously practised by the heads of the European Monetary Institute."
"In Portugal, we have a saying that ""if you owe nothing you have nothing to fear' . Therefore, let the European Bank come regularly to the European Parliament to discuss its decisions with us."
"European citizens will then know that the European Central Bank will hear and render accounts to those who legitimately represent them in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate until now has shown that in this House there is a very broad majority for the independence of the European Central Bank."
"But on the other hand, something else is clear: this European Central Bank must not live in an ivory tower because the decisions which are made there will have an direct effect on the lives of many people in the European Union."
"In future anyone who wants to build a house, take out credit or buy a car on credit will be directly affected by a decision of the European Central Bank."
"Therefore, the President of the European Central Bank must justify his actions, be accountable, explain to people why he has made certain decisions in favour of monetary stability, and he must be involved in a dialogue."
"But we now have the problem that there is not yet a European public in the same way as there is a German, a French, an Italian and a British public."
"Consequently, the European Parliament is the place in which this discussion with our people must first be concentrated."
"For this reason, we demand a constructive dialogue with the President of the European Central Bank. This dialogue must take place firstly here within the European Parliament, when he presents his report once a year and explains how he intends to form the policy of the European Central Bank in future, and secondly in the standing committee, in individual discussions with the Central Bank President, in which there must be no technical talk."
"We need a broad dialogue with the Central Bank President, not just about the specialist questions of monetary policy, but also about economic policy, tax policy in the European Union, about budget policy, competition policy, to the extent that these policies have an effect of the stability of the currency."
"What we want is a broad dialogue."
"The real challenge which faces us is that of carrying on this dialogue firstly with the Central Bank President, but secondly with the European Commission, as we already do, and with the Council Presidency and the finance ministers of the Member States, who have become accustomed to reporting at regular intervals to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy about their stability programmes."
"The real challenge which faces us is the necessity, now that we have a common European monetary policy, of also formulating a common European economic policy."
"The President of the ECB needs a strong partner when he makes his decisions."
"Who should this partner be?"
"I do not believe in the idea of a European economic government, because we have European institutions."
"We have the European Commission, which must be an important interlocutor."
"We have the European Council, the Heads of States and Governments, who come together twice a year and can provide guidelines for economic policy."
"The European Council is without doubt the strongest institution of the European Union."
"We have the Ecofin Council, and we have the European Parliament, where this debate must be focused, and where the reasons for certain decisions at European level must be explained to the people."
"I believe that it is important, when we discuss today Mrs Randzio-Plath's report, which I approve in its present form, that we are clear that it is not just a question of the monetary policy of the European Union or the control of the European Central Bank, as some people say, but a question of a broad dialogue about the future monetary and economic policy of the European Union."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"It is a great pity that the many speakers who have left the House did not hear your excellent answers."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Results of the European Conference in London"
"The next item is the statement by the Council on the results of the European Conference in London."
"It is my great pleasure to welcome Mr Henderson, who will present the statement on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, progress on European enlargement has been one of the key priorities of the Presidency."
"We are determined that the European Union should seize this historic opportunity to banish for ever the divisions that have sadly scarred our continent for too many years."
"That is why I am pleased to confirm that the remit of the Luxembourg European Council on enlargement has been successfully completed."
"We opened the European Conference on 12 March."
"We secured European Union approval of the terms of the accession partnerships."
"We successfully launched the accession process on 30 March and we launched accession negotiations with the Six on 31 March."
"Each of these points represents a vital element in our efforts to secure successful enlargement."
"I would like to deal with them one by one."
"Firstly, the European Conference."
"The first meeting of the Conference on 12 March was a historic gathering."
"It was a clear demonstration that all participants are part of the European family."
"The day was full of symbolism."
"We welcomed the important contribution of President Gil-Robles on that day."
"12 March showed how conference can add value."
"The 26 countries agreed the chairman's conclusions establishing the broad framework of the Conference."
"The Conference will allow the participants to consider issues of common concern and to make their cooperation in the international community more effective."
"Discussions will focus on drugs and crime, the environment, foreign and security policy, regional cooperation and economic matters."
"The 26 countries also agreed a statement on Kosovo and they decided to set up an expert group on drugs and crime which we are taking forward urgently. The next meeting will now take place at the level of foreign ministers during the Austrian Presidency."
"We are pleased that we have established a Conference as a body which addresses the issues that have a direct impact on people's lives and which enables all the participants to consider issues on an equal footing."
"We regret but respect Turkey's decision not to attend on 12 March in London."
"But the Conference sent a clear signal that the door remains open for Turkey."
"Secondly, we were pleased that the accession partnerships could be adopted on 24 March."
"They are a crucial element of the reinforced pre-accession strategy."
"We were grateful for the European Parliament's cooperation on the last occasion I was with you in the plenary."
"Now we must ensure that the applicants get the help they need quickly and that they use it effectively."
"Thirdly, we completed the remit of the Luxembourg European Council by launching the accession process."
"The process was successfully launched at foreign minister level on 30 March in Brussels."
"It will demonstrate that enlargement is all-inclusive."
"The next ministerial meeting will take place on 29 and 30 May at the level of the JHA ministers."
"We hope that at that meeting the 26 countries will conclude the pre-accession pact on organized crime."
"Fourthly and finally, we have launched accession negotiations with the Six: Estonia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Cyprus."
"These negotiations were launched on 31 March by foreign ministers."
"Now it is down to the detailed business."
"The task ahead of us is a great task."
"We must ensure that we carry public support as the process moves ahead."
"It will be especially important to explain the benefits of enlargement to our citizens and to win their hearts for this historic project which will at last enable us to spread the benefits of the European Union to the wider Europe."
"We look to the European Parliament to help us in this endeavour."
"Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I truly believe that this has been a historic month for Europe, because of the European Conference, the discussions about accession partnerships and the first round of negotiations."
"Mr President-in-Office, you spoke about symbolism and symbols, and we have also seen many photographs which have documented the start."
"But, thankfully, you have also told us that there are matters of substance."
"It was this Parliament, and above all this party, which pointed out that the European Conference will become a farce if it is merely a social framework, if occasional photographs are all that matter."
"I am very glad that a start has been made with matters of substance, and that perhaps some people who saw things as very open and very casual have now changed their conception, that we are actually talking about subjects which are very important for Europe and the future."
"In the short time available, I would just like to mention a few points: First, we must point out in this framework and these discussions at the European Conference that we want a larger Europe, but a stronger Europe."
"The enlargement and the larger Europe must not proceed at the cost of Europe's strength."
"We see day after day how many deficiencies we have in our common foreign and security policy, and also in other areas."
"This is also important because quite a few of the countries which now want to join have only achieved their independence very recently, and are asking themselves whether joining a new community can be combined with their striving for independence."
"They may urgently want to join the Community, but they imagine it to be looser and less binding whereas it is important to us that the Community does not develop in this way."
"Second, because the negotiations and discussions about accession will continue for a long time, we shall have to set some signals in the next few years, signals which say to the countries: the moment of accession has not yet come, but you are preparing well for it."
"You are on the right path."
"Such signals are expected."
"I say that because I was recently in the three Baltic states with Pauline Green and saw how hungry they are for signals from Europe."
"At the same time, Europe has just partially introduced obligatory visas or visa charges."
"It is grotesque - to take just this example - that we expect countries and people in Europe to act on the basis of the Schengen rules, and at the same time force other countries - including Austria - to introduce obligatory visas or visa charges."
"This practice is incomprehensible and unacceptable, and I believe that we should change it."
"Third, I would like to point out that the discussions with Slovakia are very important."
"We are very sad that the Meciar regime is operating a policy which damages its own people, and I believe that the European Conference is the right framework for forcing Slovakia into pro-European behaviour."
"It is also decisively important to consider today how the European Conference can be further developed, and what the relationship is with Russia, Ukraine and in particular Turkey."
"Mr President-in-Office, I thank you for your report."
"I believe that it was a good start!"
"It will be Austria's responsibility to continue this good start."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this first European Conference was an important contribution to the whole field of the enlargement and unification process in Europe."
"It can be seen as a preparation, a part of a link in a new European order."
"It was developed to involve one country, but I believe that we should make it clear that such a European Conference only makes sense in the long run if it is open to all those who from their own point of view or that of the European Union do not yet want to hold accession negotiations but feel that eventually they belong in the European Union."
"If countries like Switzerland and others could find a link here, it would surely be easier for another country such as Turkey to go the same way, and to rejoin this process."
"I think that the five points which were discussed in London are essential questions."
"I really hope that the group of experts which the British Presidency has put together in connection with the fight against cross-border organised crime will produce in 12 months results which will then have a practical impact on the safety of our citizens. Questions of environmental protection, competitive economies, foreign and security policy and regional cooperation are in the common interest not only of members of the European Union, but also of those who are holding immediate accession negotiations and those who are anywhere in the neighbourhood of the European Union."
"I really believe that in this way this European Conference also offers the possibility of bridge-building beyond the future borders of the European Union."
"I hope that the foreign ministers at their first conference under the Austrian Presidency will continue this initiative accordingly."
"I believe that if it is begun in this broader and content-based way, it will also be possible to rebuild the bridges to Turkey. Unfortunately they were broken for reasons which we do not need to investigate today, but I hope that they will soon exist and be usable again."
"Mr President, I would like to say a word or two of appreciation and thanks to the President-in-Office for his valuable contribution to the European Parliament this afternoon and to take the opportunity of wishing him and his colleagues who are guiding the UK Presidency continued success for the remainder of their term."
"The opening of negotiations with six applicant countries this week in Brussels constitutes an historic step in the evolution of the European Union."
"I welcome this first step in the process of expanding the Union into central and eastern Europe and I look forward to the opening of the negotiations with the rest of the countries who have applied for membership."
"The process of enlarging the Union will be difficult both for the applicant countries and for the existing Member States."
"The recent publication of the Santer package of proposals has clearly shown that the existing Member States will have to take difficult decisions concerning the size of the European budget and the future operation both of the Structural Funds and of the common agricultural policy in order to prepare for enlargement."
"The applicant countries will also be confronted with a difficult process of adaptation in many areas; for instance, justice and home affairs issues are central to the enlargement process."
"It is essential that the applicant countries put into place the body of EU law already adopted to fight organized crime across Europe."
"As this area of EU law is constantly evolving, I believe they need to give it top priority and to do so they must take immediate steps to ensure that those who are responsible in their countries for the fight against organized crime, such as judges, police and customs departments and tax authorities, have access to the necessary programmes to improve their skills and operational methods in what must increasingly be a joint effort to combat organized crime."
"International criminal groups have huge resources at their disposal in terms of finance, technology, networks and expertise and the European Union must continue to develop the means to put criminals operating with impunity across all borders behind bars."
"We expect and demand no less of our future partners."
"The Council has just reached a political agreement on making it a criminal offence to participate in a criminal organization in the Member States of the EU."
"This will strengthen our hand in combatting organized crime and I do hope that the applicant countries will keep pace with us in this regard, not least in the area of dissuasive criminal penalties."
"In the future I want to see more joint EU surveillance exercises such as operation PEGASUS which is aimed at detecting the smuggling of cocaine and other prohibited or restricted goods by passengers arriving by air from certain South American and Caribbean countries and continuing in transit to other EU destinations."
"Extending such joint surveillance exercises into the applicant countries should be an early objective."
"Finally, I would urge the three Member States which have not yet ratified the EUROPOL convention to do so without delay."
"The full extent of the EUROPOL convention cannot be enforced unless this procedure is completed and it is a poor example to the applicant states if we ourselves cannot complete the ratification process."
"Mr President, on the walls outside the House there are photos taken 30 to 40 years ago, which symbolize the success of the European Union."
"Another set of symbolic photos has been taken recently, and I hope that in 20 years time, these will be another illustration of success."
"This will depend largely on what we do during the coming years."
"It will entail much homework for candidates, but also for the Union."
"The Union must finally start acting as one, and I have to say that the discord which the Union has been displaying, for instance with regard to Cyprus, is downright disgraceful, and worse still, harmful to our relations with both Cyprus and Turkey."
"The threat made by the French to exclude Cyprus is tactically extremely unwise, because no negotiator gives away his bottom line before the negotiation process has even started."
"The Union needs to stick to earlier pronouncements, as the British Presidency finally did at the start of the negotiations."
"The work can start now."
"I can of course get all worked up about the Turkish warnings that there might be a new war."
"I can also get worked up about the refusal of the Turkish-Cypriots to take part in the negotiations and about the continuing annexation, at least verbally, by Turkey of Northern Cyprus."
"Perhaps we should just put this down to attempts to block the negotiating process."
"The Union must learn its lessons and be brave enough to act as one with respect to Cyprus."
"The Union should rethink its policy on Turkey."
"We cannot pursue the policy suggested by Greece without looking at what lies behind it."
"Turkey, too, is a candidate which deserves intensive cooperation."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's new statement on this."
"What policy has the Council in mind, Mr President-in-Office?"
"And my last question is: will our Greek friends drop their resistance to financial cooperation?"
"Mr President, I think the President-in-Office of the Council has adopted a restrained position with regard to the London Conference, and it must indeed be restrained because we ought not to forget that the London Conference was largely planned to accommodate Turkey's presence."
"We, too, are sorry that Turkey was not there, and believe that as a country it will take the necessary steps in relation to democracy and respect for its neighbours that will soon allow it to upgrade its relations with the European Union."
"We view the fact that the process of the Republic of Cyprus's accession has begun as important, with talks about accession which not only represent a beginning but must promise an end to that process."
"There are many obstacles and there is a real danger that the island may be partitioned, as we see from the extreme statements in Ankara which regards Cyprus as one of Turkey's provinces."
"Ankara's attitude to the part of Cyprus occupied by Turkish troops is the same as its attitude towards its Kurdish provinces."
"I think the European Union, working together with the Republic of Cyprus, has a responsibility to ensure the integrity of the Republic and this should be made clear to Ankara, at the same time, of course, as the wish of both the European Union and the Republic of Cyprus that accession should include representation of the Turkish-Cypriot community with full rights, with respect for its special claims and problems but within a framework of the Republic of Cyprus's existence as a single and undivided entity."
"Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, with merely one minute's speaking time I am compelled to confine myself to one point, namely Cyprus."
"The accession negotiations alone will under no circumstances lead to a resolution of the political conflict which is tearing Cyprus apart."
"On the contrary, without a solution to this conflict, a successful accession is highly unlikely."
"That is why the European Union should invest time in simultaneous negotiations with Cyprus, but also in seeking a way out of this political impasse."
"Furthermore, it is obvious that the Turkish community should be able to participate in the negotiation process with a clear mandate, so that they do not feel the odd one out."
"Two pitfalls must be avoided."
"The Union must not bow to threats from Turkey, but it must offer Turkey a better and more concrete perspective for accession."
"Secondly, the Union must, in conjunction with the United States, ensure that the arsenal of long-range weapons in Nicosia is defused."
"If this does not happen, we will be in a new phase of military build-up and that is most unlikely to lead to a solution."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, there is a saying which says that if you are at the ball, you must dance."
"This is indeed the situation we find ourselves in and when I hear Mr Brok say that everything is going well I have the impression of hearing, ""things could not be going better, ma'am!' ."
"I believe that the Europe in preparation, the Europe of fifteen, of nineteen, of twenty five, is certainly not the Europe which the founding fathers wanted."
"It has no ambition."
"It wants to absorb the countries of eastern Europe with a mere 1.27 % of the budget, when we know how great were the sacrifices and the ambitions of the American project at the time of the Marshall Plan."
"We should keep this very clearly in mind."
"I think we should very rapidly envisage a federal Union of a few states and continue to work on this great project."
"It is urgent for a certain number of Member States, undoubtedly not that of the President-in-Office, to come to an agreement to bring about as quickly as possible a federal Europe."
"I would like to say something to Mr Brok."
"It truly shows great optimism to think that following this conference in London we are going to be able to resolve the drugs problem in twelve months when thirty years of prohibition have done nothing but aggravate the situation."
"It is time to give up this rather blind optimism."
"Mr President, first of all can I say I welcome the President-in-Office's statement this afternoon in which he underlined the British Presidency's commitment to a successful programme of enlargement."
"When I last spoke on enlargement in this Parliament, I said that I understood the disappointment felt by those countries which had failed to make it on to the list of the new Member States."
"I was therefore pleased that the London conference brought together existing Member States, the fast lane applicants, and those in the slower lane."
"The conference itself may have appeared to be more cosmetic than substantial in terms of what it achieved, but I believe the value of the conference will become more apparent as time goes on."
"From the point of view of the applicant countries, it must be encouraging for them to see their Heads of Government and foreign ministers now with a high profile and able to deal directly with the Heads of Government and foreign ministers of the existing 15 Member States."
"I do not think that the concluding statement from the conference, claiming that a new era had begun for European cooperation, was an overstatement."
"The more that representatives of the applicant countries are involved with us, the more likely we are to achieve the goal of stable democracy and respect for human rights and economic development throughout Europe."
"Most of us in the Parliament support enlargement."
"The more difficult question is how much we are prepared to pay to achieve it."
"We heard this week that the 10 eastern and central European countries are to be offered 1.8 billion a year in new grants to help them to prepare for membership of the Union."
"I welcome the fact that this offer is to be subject to the condition that recipient countries must keep to an agreed timetable for political and economic reform."
"We should of course remember that democracy has only come recently to some of these countries and that the timetable should reflect the need to move forward cautiously."
"That may cost more in grant aid in the short term if we are to achieve permanent stability in Europe in the long term and the cautious approach must be followed."
"We are now halfway through the Presidency, a Presidency which has adopted an extremely ambitious project in getting the European conference under way; it is fair to say I believe that ambition has been fulfilled."
"I have only one slight reservation and that is the position of Cyprus."
"I must question the wisdom of the approach and I am concerned by your actions; you could well have made a protracted problem more difficult to resolve."
"Mr President, the emphasis placed here on the conclusions of the London Conference seems to be inversely proportional to the attention given by citizens to what is considered an historic event by the Council."
"The decision to begin the overall expansion process can certainly be considered an historically significant fact as the reconciliation between states that were enemies and the consolidation of stability in freedom are factors of extreme importance for the commencement and continuation of European cooperation."
"But why is this importance not perceived by European citizens?"
"Is it because of the inability of the media to convey a positive message or is this feeling of indifference the result of the employment crisis and fears of monetary union caused by the restrictive measures imposed by governments?"
"It is a fact, however, that even if the expansion is historic, it does not rouse enthusiasm but creates fears for various reasons, including the fact that the average wage in the new states applying to join the Union is, at best, one-third or even one-sixth less than the average wage in the 15 current Member States of the Union, which will certainly affect the problem of employment and unemployment and that of company relocation."
"The achievement of political union between 15 countries, which has not yet happened, will become even more difficult with 21, owing to the still unsatisfied need to establish the new institutional organization of the Union and the problems connected with common foreign and security policy."
"The recent declarations made by the Slovenian Ambassador to Rome show how, in that country, at least one line of thought is quite different from the spirit of the governments and member nations of the EU."
"The Italian National Alliance therefore believes it is necessary, before Slovenia joins the Union, to define the problem of compensating Italians for confiscated goods and the final condemnation, and all its consequences, of the annihilation that took place during the notorious feuds."
"Cyprus' accession is very positive for us. Its territory is still divided and the problem of the Islamic unitary policy obliges the Union to work with greater commitment and good will to strengthen relations with Turkey, a necessary step to achieve greater protection of human rights and for Turkey to join the Union, a Union which needs to be rebalanced between north-east and south."
"Finally, the Kurdish problem cannot be considered a problem of the individual states with regard to immigration control, but a Community problem."
"The National Alliance therefore wishes to remind everyone that political union should be achieved."
"Mr President, we started off with the President-in-Office of the Council giving us a report on the London conference, which showed that the European Council - and it is not a precedent - has in some way taken up some of Parliament's earlier proposals."
"It was a joint ceremony involving all the countries and had a certain solemnity, which is especially important at times of historical significance."
"There was acceptance of the idea that this process should be of a global, inclusive nature, involving all the countries and ending to some extent the division into two groups. There was also acceptance that this is a process which is open to emulation and competition between the countries."
"Based on what I have just said, my comment relates to my experience as a member of the European Parliamentary delegation, headed by President Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, to the Bucharest Conference, where we met with the heads of parliament of the candidate countries."
"We talk a lot about public opinion and the participation of civil society, but basically it has to start with a decisive participation on the part of the parliaments."
"And I must point out, Mr President, that in those countries there is a profound historical aspiration - which I think we should take up - to be reincorporated into a process from which they were brutally cut off, as a result of the division of Europe. That means we must provide the impetus, and a political vision which goes beyond discussions of accounts and what could be termed ""shopkeeper's book-keeping' ."
"In other words, it is important for us to calculate the sacrifices we have to make, but we must also remember the advantages we already enjoy."
"While on the subject, I should also like to point out the concern which can be observed in some of those countries that they may be relegated to a sort of ""second division' ."
"I think it is important for us to be able to admit, again with that political impetus, that many of those countries can even speed things up during the marathon process that incorporation will turn out to be."
"Finally, Mr President, I have a comment about Turkey."
"I believe the British Presidency and the Commission are making efforts to reincorporate Turkey into this process, but I also think we must remind ourselves and our Turkish friends and partners that we currently have a customs union with them, and that to enter into a verbal escalation with one of our Member States is not the best way of conducting relations with us."
"I think that is a message which, I repeat, our Turkish partners and allies can and should accept."
"Mr President, the British Presidency has made a good start with the two-track approach. This has been expressed through symbolic events."
"One was the strengthened accession partnership which it tackled in a highly directive manner. The other, which is clearly related in spirit, but does not form part of the accession process, was the multilateral consultation and the European Conference where everyone is more on an equal footing."
"This is a good thing, and has been effectively put into practice."
"The Presidency emphasized that priority must given to good governance, democracy and human rights."
"It did not just confine itself to economic issues."
"It also talked about the environment, and so forth."
"I believe that this is an important issue."
"The third pillar is becoming increasingly important for the European Union, because we are characterized by the fact that we are an association of democratic constitutional states."
"In order that accession countries achieve this as well, it is of extreme importance that they undergo cultural change."
"In this context I am a little surprised at what is sometimes said about Turkey."
"My question to the President-in-Office is whether Turkey has in fact made clear, substantive policy changes, so that it becomes obvious that we have been wrong?"
"Is there no need for Turkey to take any further steps, and will it be increasingly received with laurels the more arrogantly it approaches the discussions surrounding the European Conference?"
"I think it is a little strange to pretend that the usefulness and value of the European Conference depends on the presence of a state which is not a constitutional state."
"It is much easier to talk about the third pillar with countries which are constitutional states and full democracies."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office what his thoughts are about this, and whether he is getting any signals that Turkey is making substantive steps towards us, instead of our being forced to make steps towards Turkey."
"The second point I wanted to make is about the foreign policy convergence of which the President-in-Office spoke."
"Will some kind of action plan be developed during the British Presidency to achieve convergence in foreign policy?"
"We will have to arrive at a situation in which European politicians do not only inspire confidence in their own country, but amongst all European citizens, so that they can see that European responsibilities are dealt with effectively and thoroughly by the European authorities."
"Mr President, it was important that the European Conference should get under way and that European integration is a step nearer."
"On the agenda were environmental issues and matters to do with regional cooperation."
"Dealing with issues of the environment with all applicant countries right from the start is essential."
"If this matter is not given the attention it deserves there will be a danger that the Union's short timetable for enlargement will mean the environment getting swept aside in favour of economic and trade agreements."
"The environment has to feature in all issues, not least of all transport and agriculture."
"The EU's unique and comprehensive process of enlargement makes security on a broad scale an even more urgent notion in the EU decision-making process, and that of its various bodies."
"EU enlargement must come about while stressing the concept of sustainable development in the areas of both the environment and social welfare."
"Cooperation in matters of the environment must be very necessarily included in the strategies prior to enlargement."
"In this we need to make the most of the ISPA financial instrument and derive from it the means to solve environmental problems as far as possible while negotiations for membership are still going on, so that the transition periods involved can be as short as possible."
"Another matter that came up at the conference was that of regional cooperation, and the connection with the environment here is important."
"Just think: after enlargement the Baltic Sea is going to be an inland sea of the EU."
"We know the problems there are with protection of the Baltic."
"Without the presence of Russia in all of this there can be no sustainable development or improvement in environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea."
"Mr President, all the speakers have said here that the conference was very important and a success, although Turkey did not take part."
"Actually this conference was conceived to involve Turkey."
"I would like to associate myself expressly with this judgement, and I do not understand why the socialist party is apparently split on this question, because the former President and present Vice-Chairman, Mr Hänsch, said yesterday in an interview that the European Conference could be dissolved, and that it should be made clear to Turkey once and for all that it cannot join."
"It would then no longer be possible to fulfil the purpose of the European Conference."
"That has not been stated here, and I am surprised that former presidents do not give this opinion here in the House, but in press statements."
"Since the decision of the EU Summit in Luxembourg, relationships between Europe and Turkey are in a difficult phase, and likewise those between Germany and Turkey."
"I will not mention the reasons, but when we consider how to improve this situation, we must discuss the preconditions which were formulated at the Luxembourg Summit."
"I think that parts of these preconditions were such that Turkey could not be a member without loss of face from the start, because border questions which are disputed between Greece and Turkey were made the yardstick, and not, Mr Oostlander, a question of the rule of law or human rights."
"I also want to reject decisively your claim that Turkey's status as a state of law is disputed."
"He does not listen, but he goes on spreading these inaccurate opinions."
"I must expressly point out that in Turkey women achieved the right to vote in 1923, and that many other aspects of a democratic constitution are in place."
"I demand that the Commission, the Council and Parliament should start talking again with Turkey, and that we formulate preconditions which enable Turkey to be present at the next European Conference."
"It is actually the case that we must have the greatest interest in finding a reasonable basis with Turkey."
"It is not the champions of the Christian West, as Mr Yilmaz said, who prevent Turkish accession, but primarily the still unfulfilled preconditions for accession."
"But it is precisely because they have not yet been fulfilled that the European Conference was founded, and it would be completely wrong now to make the next hurdles for the European Conference so difficult that Turkish participation is made impossible."
"I therefore ask the Commissioner to negotiate with the Council and Turkey to change this situation!"
"Mr President, there has been much talk of accession today, although actually the European Conference should definitely not be seen as an instrument of pre-accession strategy."
"For this reason, Turkey, which I do not consider to be a candidate for accession although I share Mr Langen's political assessment in all points, was accepted into the conference."
"But in my opinion this European Conference has an important task to fulfil apart from accession, and therefore it should be opened to other states, as Elmar Brok said."
"It should be opened to states which are not yet at the gates as candidates for accession, either because they have been internationally slandered - like Croatia, which is at least as ready for accession as Slovakia or Cyprus - or because, like Ukraine, which still has to live through a difficult time, and which we must help massively, they are not yet in a position to move closer to Europe or the European Union."
"However, the London Conference, in spite of the difficult, unclear position in which it found itself, made one specific statement."
"That was its declaration on justice and internal affairs."
"My report about expansion eastwards and internal security will be presented tomorrow."
"But beyond that, the European Conference can achieve a Pan-Europe of law and internal security before the last agricultural problem in the European Union is solved."
"People will only accept a greater Europe if it results in more, not less security."
"This approach, putting internal security at the centre of this conference, is therefore to be welcomed."
"Also to be welcomed is the consideration of Kosovo, one of the most important problems which the whole of Europe will face in the next few years, and there it is important that Turkey as a partly European and Islamic country should be involved in this region, because of its special historical connection."
"We must restore the autonomy of Kosovo under international control with international peace-keeping troops, for we have already gone beyond the eleventh hour there."
"I am therefore glad that the European Conference has concerned itself with this subject, although the outcome was inadequate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 noon."
"Aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - post-SFOR strategy"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0123/98 by Mr Schwaiger, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation 1628/96 relating to aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (COM (98)0018 - C4-0105/98-98/0023(CNS))-A4-0106/78 by Mrs Daskalaki, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on a post-SFOR strategy in Bosnia and Herzegovina containing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if all programmes and budget lines are taken together, more than ECU 350 million annually are available from the European Union for the reconstruction of BosniaHerzegovina and the other countries which were involved in the war."
"Our involvement is therefore not just moral and political, but also financial to a very large extent."
"But if we take as our basis the resources which have actually been used, in the years 1996 and 1997, less than ECU 100 million, that is about 15 %, were spent."
"The USA, with its splendidly organized team on the spot, manages to spend 95 % of the US$ 200 million which are available each year."
"What are the reasons for the vast gap between our intentions and the reality which is expressed in these statistics?"
"The activities of the European Union are hardly visible on the ground, apart from a few secondhand tram-cars with European Union written on them."
"There are many reasons for this, and they can be divided into objective difficulties on the ground and the behaviour of the Commission and the Council of Ministers."
"First, the difficulties on the ground: it is true that since the Dayton Agreement the weapons have been silent, but peace has not yet returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Political conflicts continue to smoulder, the animosity of various population groups has been stirred up towards one another."
"People around Karadzic and Mladic, and others, are particularly responsible for this."
"Intimidation and threats to refugees who want to return still continue in some places, particularly where they form a minority after they return."
"The central government of Bosnia is still incapable of acting."
"Even the institutions of the sub-republics, such as the government of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republic Srpska, are only slowly getting into gear."
"In 1996 and 1997 they were either non-existent or ineffective."
"Nevertheless the resolute process of pacification of the country continues, under the decisive leadership of the High Representative Carlos Westendorp and his deputy Jacques Klein, with the help of SFOR troops."
"Of course, as well as numerous functions to aid the construction of authorities on the ground, they carry out peace-keeping tasks, and do it very well."
"The elections at the end of the year may bring further stabilization in terms of concentration on reconstruction and more cooperation between the sub-republics."
"The Dodik government in Republic Srpska is gradually acquiring the ability to act."
"It is ready to allow its refugees to return and to cooperate closely with the European Union."
"But the previous broad administrative and financial paralysis of the Commission and the Council of Ministers can be corrected in important points by a change to Regulation 1628/96, which is now on the agenda."
"We therefore support the proposals of the Commission in principle but they do not go far enough."
"A new start is possible in which the institutions of the European Union, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament cooperate closely but this depends on a fundamental change to the Regulation."
"That is our opinion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, but also the opinion of the ad hoc delegation which visited Bosnia from 21 to 24 February."
"As for the behaviour - unfortunately I must say misbehaviour - of the Commission and Council: neither the Council nor the Commission, through the necessary cooperation, has created suitable instruments and legal bases to meet the special challenge of reconstruction, and to adapt to the difficulties on the ground."
"Summarized in one sentence: reconstruction aid for Bosnia with a non-existent or non-functioning administration of the whole state or the sub-states is something different from European legislative procedure or classical development aid with partners which can act and function administratively in the normal way."
"The Council and Commission have not adapted to these circumstances."
"For that reason, the goal-oriented, coordinated use of financial, technical and material resources on the ground was largely absent."
"Success-oriented management on the ground is still not evident enough."
"The Council has enforced a complicated and inefficient Regulation."
"It forced the Commission to juggle with three different budget lines: ' Reconstruction' , ' Return of Refugees' , ' Europe for Sarajevo' ."
"They are known by the Bosnian term OBNOVA and only formally combined."
"The Council has stymied itself by subjecting all projects over ECU 2 million - that is Article 12 of the Regulation - to a complicated procedure of a governmental committee, which almost always delayed the necessary decisions by several months."
"We in the European Parliament are no longer prepared to accept such a situation."
"A new start is necessary."
"In the name of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, I propose today to the Council and Commission nothing less than this new start."
"The Commission must have an efficient action and decision summit with a general plenipotentiary on the spot, carrying the responsibility, equipped with the most extensive autonomous powers of action and decision, and provided with a strong management team."
"That may cost up to 10 % of the operating expenditure."
"The Americans need 15 % for theirs."
"If cooperation by the European Union with the Member States and the aid organizations is to be improved, regular coordination meetings, if possible monthly, must be possible."
"I would therefore like to put the question to you, Mr President-in-Office, whether you are prepared to accept our amendments, as they are summarized in paragraphs 1 to 23."
"If you do not see it as possible at this moment, what procedure do you have in mind?"
"We have a conciliation procedure from the year 1975, and there are other procedures, which give us the possibility of providing and arranging cooperation with the Council - this has already happened with the Commission to a large extent, and the Commission has supported us in our amendments."
"Mr President, two years have passed since the Dayton Agreement and all the signs are that although important steps have been taken, the agreement's implementation is still very slow in many areas."
"For example, we see delays in the operation of political institutions, there are still problems with freedom of movement and with the return of refugees."
"Since the beginning of 1998, there have of course been positive indications that reconstruction could take place more quickly."
"The High Representative is particularly dedicated to the agreement's implementation, the Serbian Republic has a moderate Prime Minister whom we have already had the opportunity to welcome in the European Parliament in the context of the relevant Joint Parliamentary Committee, and more generally, there are better hopes for an acceleration of the reconstruction process and the repatriation of displaced persons in light of the September elections."
"Those are the optimistic points."
"However, we also know, and can see, that the peace is still fragile and indeed over a wider area, where as recent events in Kosovo have shown, focuses of tension still exist."
"In Bosnia-Herzegovina mistrust still prevails between the various sides."
"More particularly, the functioning of common institutions is always problematic."
"At some points, such as Mostar, there are important local government problems."
"In some districts the spirit is opposed to municipal elections."
"There are no laws about landmines and the disarmament issue has not been resolved."
"There are problems related to human rights, and monetary and economic problems in a very sensitive, if not fragile economy."
"It is therefore common ground that a stable and secure environment must be established so that the peace agreement can be fully implemented and the country reconstructed."
"The Peace Implementation Council has recognized and supported the existing understanding to continue the military presence after 1998."
"Those of us who went to Bosnia as electoral observers on behalf of the European Parliament had the opportunity to confirm that understanding and wish on the spot."
"That presence is deemed necessary to preserve a stable and secure environment and to ensure the prerequisites for action, both by the High Representative and by international organizations, in order to implement the Peace Agreement."
"Since December, NATO has been examining the alternative solutions for sending a multinational force after SFOR, whose tenure lapses in June."
"The European Union applauds that."
"But beyond that point, since the Union's political and economic commitments in BosniaHerzegovina and the military commitment of its Member States are huge, it would be better to have more consistent and visible common action for active Community participation in the multinational force that is to succeed SFOR."
"For that reason, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy believes with this report that it should be the WEU's job to coordinate the efforts of the Union's Member States in the context of a NATO enterprise and under NATO's leadership, a thing that would also stress the efforts to build up the CFSP."
"A European commitment of that kind would also improve non-military cooperation in the area, aiming gradually to reduce the need for a military presence as reconstruction progresses."
"This Community participation should be linked to compliance of all the parties with the agreement and with arms control, and the European Union must insist that there is no rearmament of the contesting parties."
"The production of landmines and their export to the country must also cease."
"In parallel with what has already been considered, it would be good if the Member States made a commitment to preserve and assist the European Community Monitoring Mission, the ECMM as it is called."
"Its members, who have offered a great deal, are the only people who, for the time being at least, are a visible sign of the EU's presence and Mr Schwaiger has stressed that this presence is not very much felt in the area."
"Because, that too, is one of the many paradoxes: despite the bundle of money the Union has spent there, despite the real and human sacrifices made by the Union, Europe seems not to be present at all."
"With these thoughts, we call for common action for European participation in the post-SFOR force along with the other efforts already being made, such as the training of local police forces in the context of the UN policing mission."
"As a recommendation to the Council, this report aims to contribute towards positions that will stress Europe's involvement and presence on behalf of peace and the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the basis of the Dayton Accord."
"After the words of the President-in-Office of the Council I will be brief."
"Firstly, I wholeheartedly thank Parliament and the committees involved for dealing so swiftly with our proposals, in particular the fact that a special Parliament mission under the leadership of Mr Spencer went to Sarajevo to get acquainted with the situation on the ground."
"More specifically, I would like to thank Mr Schwaiger for the great effort he has made to publish what is, in our view, a very balanced report which clearly shows that he has an understanding of the situation on the ground."
"We need not talk too much about the past."
"One thing is for certain: things can be improved on our side."
"In the past two years we have been confronted with situations that nobody could have foreseen; be it the lack of coordination in the central authorities; be it non-compliance with Dayton which, in the Republika Srpska, has led to only 2 % of the total aid going to that particular region; or other forms of non-transparent infrastructure at the receiving end which has made the distribution of aid and money a hazardous and often impossible affair."
"That has also led to rigorous centralization in Brussels over the past two years for the simple reason that deconcentration and delegation under those circumstances was not feasible."
"Mr Schwaiger's report, in combination with the measures that we prepared a couple of months ago and which very much complement each other - the Schwaiger report and the measures under preparation - show that there is a clear, common understanding between Parliament, the Commission and the Council about what has to be done."
"We have embarked upon a strengthening of our staff in Sarajevo."
"Redeployment is taking place from Brussels."
"We are undergoing deconcentration and decentralization."
"All of these meet the desires of Parliament, according to the recommendations in Mr Schwaiger's report."
"Regarding the proposals for changing the regulations, I would say the same thing: more flexibility, in particular by enhancing the thresholds above which the Member States have to give their approval to projects from 2.5 to 5 million."
"I agree with the President-in-Office that there is very little chance - I speak from experience - of the Council agreeing to a further increase from 5 million to 10 million."
"Eliminating any Member State's influence in projects up to 10 million is a bridge too far at the present stage."
"As far as the operational cost is concerned - the famous 10 % question - with the Council Presidency it is ultimately Parliament that decides this."
"I suggest that I talk to my colleague, Mr Liikanen, and that we undertake to make a proposal to the Council for a significant increase in the present percentage, which is 3.5 %."
"I have to have an agreement with him on this."
"Again, it is Parliament that will eventually decide this."
"That meets Parliament's wishes."
"In our very constructive preparatory discussions for this debate today we were in agreement that on the basis of further evaluations the Commission is prepared, during the course of this year, to make other proposals that may increase the flexibility and efficiency of our total operations."
"We can talk this through on the understanding that Parliament is prepared to accept that we do not encroach on the life of the current regulations, which lapse at the end of 1999, so that we do not run the risk of creating any kind of legal vacuum."
"We are prepared to remain in touch to see whether, and what kind of further proposals can be made at a later stage. With the President-in-Office I say: do not let this delay, in any way, the present proposals that are on the table."
"If it is deferred back to the Commission at the end of April - I say with due respect to Mr Spencer - that would be beyond the point where the next General Affairs Council would be able to formalize this modified regulation."
"We would lose more time, whereas what we are talking about is a matter of utmost urgency."
"In that sense there is no difference between Parliament and the Commission."
"All three institutions are very close together in their proposals and understanding of what has to be done."
"I hope that ultimately reconstruction and, not least, the return of refugees in Bosnia and Herzegovina will benefit from the results of this debate."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate is now adjourned to 9.00 p.m."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is questions to the Council (B4-0272/98)."
"We are starting questions to the Council 15 minutes late, so we will extend it accordingly. I hope Parliament's services, especially the interpreters, will be kind enough to make the appropriate arrangements, because Question Time will end today at 7.15 p.m."
"Mr Truscott would like to speak on a point of order."
"The Rules of Procedure say that I must allow it, but I must request that you keep within the allotted minute, Mr Truscott, because we must start Question Time."
"Mr President, I am very conscious of the time but I do have a point of order under Rule 41 which deals with Question Time."
"The problem is that the first ten questions deal with an issue that is not a matter for the Council, i.e. the Elgin Marbles, and therefore I am asking you to rule the first ten questions out of order as they are clearly a matter for bilateral discussions between the Member States concerned and not a matter for the Council."
"Mr Truscott, I respect your opinion, but this question has been accepted in accordance with all the established rules, and it is now up to the Council whether to reply or not."
"I shall not allow any more points of order."
"Mr Henderson has requested to speak."
"Good evening and welcome, Mr Henderson."
"You have the floor, before we begin Question Time with that block of ten questions Mr Truscott mentioned."
"Mr President, can I just make a procedural point before I take up question one?"
"I am afraid I have to leave at 7 p.m."
"I am happy to extend Question Time on some other occasion."
"I was not responsible for the delay today."
"If at the next occasion you wish to extend Question Time over the lunch period for a little while I would be very happy to cooperate with that by bringing forward the agenda to perhaps a 2.30 p.m. start but I cannot wait today."
"I have to leave at 7 p.m."
"Mr Henderson, I very much enjoy your presence here but I am not going to make you stay, or turn you into a hostage. Not at all."
"You are free to leave this House whenever you see fit; this is an area of freedom."
"Now as President of this sitting, my agenda states that there is an hour and a half of questions."
"If we cannot count on the valuable presence of the Council during that time, then we cannot have an hour and a half, but I would like to be able to do so."
"You may go whenever you want to."
"However, I must say that since we have started late, my wish as President of the session is that we should finish after an hour and a half."
"Your invitation to move to lunchtime seems a very good idea, especially if the food is Mediterranean."
"However, I prefer to keep lunchtime for relaxed, peaceful conversations, not for questions to the Council, which is not so relaxed. Indeed, sometimes there is a certain amount of tension, as now."
"Mr David has the floor on a point of order."
"But please, Mr David, help me to get started with Question Time itself."
"If people ask to make points of order, I do not deny it to anybody, least of all you."
"You have the floor on a point of order, but it will detract from the time we have available for Mr Henderson and his invaluable answers."
"Mr President, I will be extremely brief."
"I just wanted to say that I think we should take up the minister on his very kind offer - giving up part of his lunchtime in a future plenary session."
"I am sure that many of my colleagues in the Parliament appreciate that and, if it cannot be done formally, perhaps some of us could meet him informally for a question session."
"We will examine the possibility."
"But for myself at least, as a good gourmet, the first thing I should want to know in advance is the menu."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to deal with a block of ten questions."
"Of the authors, Mr Alavanos, Mr Lomas, Mr Sanz Fernández, Mr Gillis, Mrs Castellina and Mr Bertens are present in the House, so it is to them I shall give the opportunity to put a supplementary question."
"Mr Henderson, you now have the chance to reply to this block of ten questions and to these seven questioners."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Question No 1 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0251/98)"
"Subject: Cooperation between the EU and UNESCO"
"Pursuant to Article 128(3) of the EC treaty, ""The Community and the Member States shall foster cooperation with third countries and the competent international organizations in the sphere of culture, in particular the Council of Europe' ."
"Operating under the UN is UNESCO, the authoritative and universally recognized international agency for cultural, educational and scientific cooperation."
"A UNESCO Conference of Ministers for Cultural Affairs meeting in Mexico in August 1982 decided that the marbles currently in the British Museum should be returned to their country of origin as they had been removed from the Parthenon in Athens, described by UNESCO as a monument forming part of the universal heritage."
"What steps will the UK Presidency take to implement UNESCO's decision pursuant to Article 128(3), which provides for EU cooperation with international organizations in the sphere of culture?"
"Question No 2 by Alfred Lomas (H-0327/98)"
"Subject: Return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece"
"The year 2001 will be the 200th anniversary of the year in which the Parthenon Marbles left Athens."
"It will also be the first year of the new century."
"Does the Council agree that Britain's return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece would be an imaginative gesture towards the cultural unification of Europe, one that would be applauded throughout Europe and the world?Question No 3 by Francisco Sanz Fernández (H-0334/98)"
"Subject: Compatibility of the EU's cultural policy with UNESCO resolutions about the Elgin Marbles"
"There is a great disparity between the positions of UNESCO and the EU concerning the Elgin Marbles."
"What steps will the Council take to ensure that EU cultural policy complies with UNESCO resolutions?Question No 4 by Jan Bertens (H-0336/98)"
"Subject: Return of the Elgin Marbles"
"The Conference of Ministers of Culture held in Mexico voted overwhelmingly for the return of all the marbles which were removed from the Parthenon on the Athens Acropolis and which form an integral part of that unique building, the supreme symbol of the Greek cultural heritage."
"What will be the response of the Council Presidency to that vote?Question No 5 by Hélène Carrère d'Encausse (H-0337/98)"
"Subject: The return of the Elgin Marbles is not harmful for the museums in Europe"
"Greece has officially acknowledged that its claim concerns only the marbles that once adorned the Parthenon and the Caryatid and the Column of the Erechthyon and that it has no other claims for the return of ancient artefacts currently held in any other museum or collection in the United Kingdom or other European country."
"Does the Council agree that the return of the Elgin Marbles would represent an important expression of European unity and friendship and not adversely affect European museums?Question No 6 by Friedrich Wolf (H-0338/98)"
"Subject: Coordination between the EU and UNESCO for the return of the Elgin Marbles"
"Is there any coordination between the EU and UNESCO as regards science, education and culture and, in particular, concerning the issue of the return of the Elgin Marbles in accordance with the 1982 UNESCO resolution?Question No 7 by Fernand Herman (H-0345/98)"
"Subject: The new Acropolis Museum for the Parthenon Marbles"
"Does the Council agree that the European Union must support the construction of the new Acropolis Museum in Athens, to provide a convenient and technologically ideal home for the Parthenon Marbles that are now kept in the British Museum?Question No 8 by Alan Gillis (H-0350/98)"
"Subject: Taking into consideration the feelings of the European peoples in the cultural policy of the EU"
"European public opinion is in favour of the restitution of the Parthenon Marbles."
"Even public opinion in the UK itself is overwhelmingly in favour, as was expressed in a broadcast on Channel 4 TV on 16 April 1996, when 91 822 viewers supported the proposal for the return of the marbles and only 7516 voted against."
"Does the Council agree that the cultural policy in the EU must reflect the feelings of the European peoples?Question No 9 by Joaquim Miranda (H-0360/98)"
"Subject: The Elgin Marbles"
"The problem of the Elgin Marbles, which are currently in the British Museum although they belong to the Acropolis of Athens, is poisoning relations between two EU states, the UK and Greece."
"Will the Council take any steps with a view to reaching an agreement on the Elgin Marbles, since this is also a matter of European importance?Question No 10 by Luciana Castellina (H-0361/98)"
"Subject: Return of the Elgin Marbles"
"During the vote on the UNESCO resolution on the return of the Elgin Marbles, the Greek Minister for Culture, Melina Mercouri, said: ""We are not asking for all our treasures back, we only want the part removed from our most revered national monument, the Parthenon' ."
"Does the Council not agree that the return of the Elgin Marbles would be an important cultural and psychological step towards the unification of Europe?"
"As I said in my previous address I have to leave at 7 o'clock and I would like to do so with the blessing of the House."
"I will be happy to extend my attendance at a future sitting at an earlier time in the day if that would be helpful."
"In relation to Question No 1, as honourable Members are undoubtedly aware, although the 1982 UNESCO recommendation stated that the sculptures should be returned to Greece, the recommendation went on to say that they should be returned for reincorporation into the Parthenon."
"The Parthenon sculptures are not a matter for the Council as the European Community has no competence in this subject."
"It is entirely an issue between the United Kingdom and Greece."
"I say to Mr Alavanos that I do not accept his point about the competence of the Council."
"Even if I did, there has to my knowledge been no referral to the Council by either the United Kingdom government or the Greek government for assistance in conciliation."
"Therefore, I still believe that this is a matter for those two nation state governments to determine."
"Mr President, on a procedural matter."
"We were given notice that the Minister would be replying to all ten questions at once."
"He has only replied to Question No 1."
"Before I have my minute, could you tell me if the Minister is intending to reply to all the questions separately or is that the complete answer to all ten?"
"I thought, Mr Lomas, that I had explained very clearly."
"Mr Henderson is replying jointly to the ten questions. In other words, his first comment was an answer to all ten questions."
"Mr Lomas, now that I have explained that point, you have a maximum of 60 seconds."
"If the Council was to refrain from commenting on matters where it had no competence, there would be very few matters in the world that it would be able to comment on."
"Does the Council not feel that, in view of the fact that these sculptures were taken from Greece under Turkish occupation, they are not something in isolation like a painting, but are part of the Parthenon, a building, and they ought to be returned there?"
"Also, given that there is such overwhelming, massive support in the United Kingdom, as shown by the surveys, including a television survey which recorded 94 % of people in favour of their return, would the Council like to give an opinion as to whether this would be a practical and good thing to do, since it comments on matters all over the world on which it has not the slightest influence?"
"As I outlined, the constitutional position is that the Council has no competence on this matter."
"If Mr Lomas wishes to raise this question with the British government, then I am sure that the appropriate minister would be happy to respond to him."
"Again I say to Mr Sanz Fernández, he actually can, if he wishes, communicate with the British government."
"He will not be able to do that in the British parliament but he would have an opportunity to contact the British government and express his view and seek a response from it and, as I said to Mr Lomas, if he did that then I am sure the minister responsible would be able to reply to him."
"I fully agree with the questions which were asked about the return of the Parthenon art treasures to Athens, but I would like to place this issue in a wider context."
"This is, of course, not the only looting which has taken place."
"I thought it might be worthwhile if I broadened this Question Time into something more general."
"Then several countries have bilateral problems."
"Under Napoleon, the French took the first mosasaur head, which is now in Paris."
"We have tried to get it returned to Maastricht in Limburg."
"You know the city."
"Up until now we have not heard anything from the French."
"I believe true European integration, real European cooperation, can only take shape if this kind of cultural injustice is put right."
"Might the President-in-Office and his successors be able to help with this in future?"
"And I do hope that the Elgin Marbles will be returned."
"I would say to Mr Bertens that some of those matters were discussed in theory when we were dealing with the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The Council has a clear remit which is currently authorized from previous Treaties."
"There are authorizations in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"If my interpretation is correct, I do not believe that when the Treaty is ratified it will make any difference to the competence on this issue or the issues to which he refers and I can really go no further than that."
"It is for each state to give its views on that matter and you should address your questions to them."
"I am more than a little disappointed with the answer from the President-in-Office, but it may well be outside the competence of the EU as he has said."
"However I asked a slightly different question and I think it might still be possible for it to be answered."
"Does the Council agree that the cultural policy in the EU must, or should reflect the feelings of the European people?"
"I think that is a slightly different question from the one you have been answering."
"I thank Mr Gillis for his supplementary but he is really trying to make the same point as Mr Bertens, from a different angle."
"The question of cultural standards and cultural policy within the European Union is largely a matter for the Member States."
"When it is a matter for the Council, it is already established in the Treaties and subject to some modification in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"But as I said to Mr Bertens, if my reading is accurate, I do not believe that the Treaty of Amsterdam would give the Council jurisdiction to deal with a matter such as this."
"Mr President, I will be brief."
"This is a situation that involves two Member States and the specific question posed to the President-in-Office was as follows: is a political will necessary to resolve this issue that involves these two Member States."
"Does the British Presidency have the political will to contribute to resolving this matter finally and effectively?"
"Again I say to Mr Miranda, I am not here to express views on behalf of the British Government, I am here to express views on behalf of the Council and if he wishes to put a question to the British Government, as I said already to two of his colleagues then I am sure that the responsible minister would be able to give him a reply to the matters that he raises."
"Mr President, I wish to remind the British Presidency that the Treaty of Amsterdam has in some ways extended the EU's competence with regard to culture, in a paragraph which states that culture should be present in all aspects of Union politics."
"It is quite clear that the EU's policy of harmonization and cohesion has to include a cultural dimension. The fact that such a delicate cultural question is present in the Union's internal relations - I am talking about the refusal to restore the Parthenon frieze - can only discredit the rest of the European policy."
"Do you not think that the Treaty of Amsterdam also made an innovation from this point of view?"
"I say to Mrs Castellina that, again, it is a matter of interpretation as to what the Amsterdam Treaty says on this."
"My understanding is that it would make no difference to competence in regard to this matter, and any points she wishes to raise on this she should raise with the British Government or the Greek Government."
"Speaking as the Member for Elgin - where we are very ashamed of the past history of Lord Elgin - I wish to say to the President-in-Office that by way of follow up to Mrs Castellina, who is chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, I was chairman of that committee in 1985 when it passed a report which included the restoration of works of art in the broader sense of Mr Bertens."
"That report was adopted by this Parliament."
"No-one challenged our competence at that time."
"On the day that Greece took its seat I lodged a resolution to restore the Elgin marbles."
"I wish to remind everyone of the excellent precedent created recently by England when it returned Scotland's Stone of Destiny to Scotland."
"I am pleased that Mrs Ewing has raised the point on behalf of the town in her constituency which has the same name as the diplomat after whom the marbles are named."
"She will not know this but I was an election agent in her constituency in 1970, having been sent up there by the Glasgow Labour Party to help out."
"So I know the views of the people of Elgin on these important questions."
"I have to say to their representative that if she has very strong views which she wishes yet again to press she should raise this matter with the British Government."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Question No 11 by John Cushnahan, which has been taken over by Alan Gillis (H-0273/98)"
"Subject: Effects of abolition of duty-free sales"
"What measures do the Member States intend to implement to deal with the social and economic consequences of the abolition of intra-EU tax and duty-free sales in accordance with the terms of the 13th recital in the preamble to the Directive 91/680/EEC and the 23rd recital in the preamble to Directive 92/12/EEC ?"
"Question No 12 by Pat Gallagher (H-0368/98)"
"Subject: Transport Council request for a study on social effects of the abolition of duty free"
"In view of the decision at the March 17 Transport Council to request Finance Ministers to ask the Commission to undertake a study into the social effects of the abolition of duty free, can the Presidency confirm that this issue will be on the next agenda of the ECOFIN Council?"
"In the directives referred to by Mr Cushnahan the Council agreed that duty- and tax-free sales on intra-Community journeys could continue for a transitional period up until 30 June 1999."
"The intention was to minimize the social and regional difficulties which might arise from abolition by allowing operators time to adjust."
"It is for individual Member States to decide whether any further action is required to deal with particular social or economic consequences."
"As to Mr Gallagher's question, the President of the Transport Council has written to the President of Ecofin reporting the views of transport ministers on the need for a Commission study."
"No decision has yet been taken on whether to put this issue on a future Ecofin agenda."
"The answer again is more or less what I expected, because we have been listening to it for a long time."
"However, it does not address the unemployment question or the downside, negative aspects of the abolition of duty-free in terms of airports, airlines and, indeed, shipping companies that are already under severe pressure."
"It would be worthwhile if we had this study brought forward as quickly as possible, perhaps with a more open mind, to see if it is possible to retain duty-free sales."
"I have very little to add to my initial response to the questions."
"As I said, the matter has been raised by the Transport Ministers but Ecofin have not yet decided whether to place it on the agenda."
"It is a longstanding decision."
"To change the decision would require unanimity."
"It is up to the Commission whether it decides to produce a report."
"As I said at the last plenary when I addressed this subject, there is a lot of speculation as to what the impact of the abolition of duty-free within the European Union will be."
"There is speculation that jobs will be lost and speculation that jobs will be gained, speculation that consumers will gain overall, speculation that some consumers will lose."
"Individual Member States have to make their own calculations."
"They have had a considerable period of time in which to make an assessment."
"I can add no more at the present time."
"I am pleased that the Transport Council has communicated with the Ecofin Council."
"I sincerely hope that the Ecofin ministers will respect the wishes of the Transport Council and commission a study."
"However, I am particularly sad to hear the President-in-Office this evening talk about speculation."
"There should be no reference to speculation."
"It should be fact."
"The only way we can establish that is by having an impact study carried out on the socioeconomic effects."
"Then it will not be speculation, it will be fact."
"From studies that have been carried out in my own country it has been established - not speculated upon - that tens of thousands of jobs will be lost throughout the Union, with no alternative source of employment for those people."
"There will be an additional £17 per fare for the many hard-pressed citizens throughout the Union."
"I would like the President-in-Office to confirm that unanimity is not required for the Council to call on the Commission to undertake an impact study on the socio-economic consequences arising from the proposed abolition."
"Could he confirm that to me?"
"I can confirm that the Council could request a study without a unanimous decision, but to change the decision which was reached previously would require unanimity."
"It would be interesting if every study which was ever produced guaranteed that the facts would emerge."
"I am not as confident as that."
"A lot of judgment would be involved as to what the impact might be."
"I say that as someone who has an airport in his constituency and thus has a vested interest in these matters."
"But there are other wider considerations that the Ecofin Council and the Council of Ministers must take into account."
"I would hope Mr Gallagher would understand that."
"I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office and encourage him to stick to his guns in the face of all the persiflage which comes from those who claim to be concerned about duty-free."
"They have swallowed whole the arguments of the duty-free industry."
"The President-in-Office is quite right to cast doubt on some of the forecasts of job losses, about which I am extremely sceptical."
"However, I was a little concerned because his reply to the earlier question appeared to be rather less forthright and firm than it was last time he came to this House, when he repeated - and I supported him - that there were no plans in Ecofin to return to this subject."
"He did not put it quite as firmly this time."
"Can we have a firm undertaking that there are no - I repeat, no - plans to re-open the whole debate?"
"Mr Cassidy's comments show that there are many views on this subject which cross the political spectrum of this House and no doubt other political institutions throughout the European Union."
"I said at the last plenary that there were no plans by the Ecofin Council to place an item of this nature on the agenda."
"That was the position at that time."
"Subsequently, a decision has been taken by the Transport Council and the wording I have chosen today, that no decision has been reached as to whether or not to put this issue on the agenda, is a better way of expressing the kind of response that Ecofin might make to a request from a sister Council."
"I will be very brief."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his clear answers, but the questions also refer to the social consequences and social benefits of this matter, and I wonder if he would agree with me that the abolition of duty-free would also reduce the levels of consumption of both alcohol and tobacco and that the consequences of this can only be beneficial to public health in Europe."
"Would he agree that the abolition of duty-free, which is, as he says, a long-standing decision, would allow both sea- and airports to resume their primary role, which is to transport people from one place to another."
"I think my professor of economics would have told me that the marginal propensity to consume might be pricesensitive and that before giving an answer to that question one should conduct some surveys on whether that was the case."
"Just on that last point from the President-in-Office, I think he has answered the point that Ecofin ought to put to the Council of Transport Ministers: some more objective studies are needed."
"Is the President aware that this Parliament has had a previous clash with the Council and the Commission on a similar point, when we were insisting on an objective study of safety for users of superbikes."
"When we were successful, the people who were opposed to Parliament's position believed that the conclusions defied gravity and that in fact the superbikes were proved to be safer than other machines which the Commission and Council had no objection to."
"In that situation the decision of the European Union - or European Community as it was then - was made under very different procedures which did not involve co-decision."
"Does the Council accept that there might be a case for considering whether the legislation is satisfactory or whether an over-hasty decision was taken under the old procedures and does it also accept that a study would assist us in reaching a sound decision now?"
"It is superficially attractive always to allege that legislation which was agreed in a previous circumstance would not be approved were it to be before a political institution currently."
"I do not dispute Mr Barton's observation in general."
"But that does not mean that we can reverse all legislation which has been introduced in the past."
"It is not that long ago that a decision was reached on this but it was still seven or eight years ago and this has given outlets who benefit from duty-free the opportunity to consider the effect on their businesses and to make alternative provisions."
"There has been that opportunity in the past."
"No decision has yet been taken by ECOFIN."
"I cannot say more than that at this point."
"I do not believe there is much hope that the finance ministers will change their minds."
"On the other hand, it should be possible to provide what the transport ministers have requested, namely an impact analysis, partly with regard to employment and partly with regard to taxes, since the idea was that taxes should be harmonized during this period, which has not been done, and which may in turn have consequences for travel between different countries and consequences for ultraperipheral countries."
"It should therefore be possible to provide this."
"What Mr Cassidy said is not true, that only the industry has carried out studies in this area."
"This was first done in Sweden, and now there has been a government study which emphasizes exactly what the industry's studies did previously, namely that this will have an impact on employment in my country, costing around 2 000 jobs."
"I refer to my previous answers that one can speculate as to what a study would indicate and, indeed, on how accurately the study may be able to predict consequences."
"At this time, although the Transport Council has taken a decision, no decision has been reached by the ECOFIN Council on whether or not to take this matter further."
"Question No 13 by Jens-Peter Bonde, which has been taken over by Ulla Sandbæk (H-0275/98)"
"Subject: Equal treatment for lesbians and gays"
"Will the Council amend the legislation so as to introduce full equality of treatment for homosexual men and women and thus to nullify the discriminatory judgment of the Court of Justice in the Lisa Grant case?"
"The honourable Member who originally tabled the question and Mrs Sandbæk will be aware that the Treaty of Rome does not currently provide the Council with competence in the area of sexual orientation."
"However, the Treaty of Amsterdam will, when ratified, provide the Commission with the legal base for future action."
"The Council will continue to work with the Commission in bringing forward measures that benefit all citizens of the European Union."
"I am, of course, fully aware that the Treaty of Rome does not grant these powers, but I do appreciate the answer and would like to convey my thanks."
"However, would it not be possible for you to expand on this and be a touch more specific?"
"In your answer, you indicated that you would endeavour to do something."
"This appears to me to be a rather non-specific choice of words."
"I am curious to know exactly what you have in mind."
"I think Mrs Sandbæk is asking me to do the impossible."
"If the honourable Member had wished to ask a specific question then I would have done my very best to answer it."
"But I surely cannot be asked to predict a range of specific questions which I might wish to give answers to."
"Therefore I cannot really help the honourable Member."
"Mr President, I understand completely that you have difficulties in foreseeing the future."
"I just wanted to ask you if perhaps in this preparation for the future, for which you are responsible, you would bear something in mind, namely that if this equalization were carried out, an absolute economic inequality would result, in which communities without children would have considerable economic advantages compared to those who have children, quite apart from the fact that it would contribute to our continent slowly dying out!"
"These are very delicate matters and I understand that, but I do not understand the point that the honourable Member was making."
"Is he suggesting that where discrimination is outlawed among people who do not have children, they have an advantage over people who do have children and who are not discriminated against in a particular instance?"
"I do not follow the logic."
"Question No 14 by Ioannis Theonas (H-0278/98)"
"Subject: Severe repercussions for weakest economies of introduction of euro"
"Opposition is intensifying among workers and experts on economic affairs to the imminent introduction of the euro."
"A particularly important issue in this respect is the status of the currencies not forming part of the euro zone, the impact on the economies of those countries, combatting speculation and other pressures and the effects on workers' living standards and social rights."
"Has the Council looked into this matter?"
"On the basis of which studies and communications from the Commission - which has not notified Parliament of any relevant details?"
"What policy decisions will it take to relieve workers of the burden they are enduring in the name of the euro and to offset the severe repercussions which will particularly affect the weakest economies?"
"Far from intensifying opposition to the introduction of the euro, the most recent Eurobarometer poll shows an increase in support, though I acknowledge that this was not the case in the honourable Member's home country, which is a matter of concern."
"The Council has been very conscious of the need to ensure a social dimension to its work."
"The Amsterdam European Council underlined that economic and social inclusion are complementary aspects of the more cohesive European society that we all seek."
"The policy changes which preparation for the euro has required make sense in their own right and will benefit workers."
"They help to ensure the correct macro-economic climate for stability and growth."
"In many parts of the Union we are seeking the benefits of those policies now."
"These benefits have not been bought at the expense of workers in other parts of the Union."
"Growth across the Union is in the interests of citizens of all our countries."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office, but he gave me a very general answer and I would like to help him with certain specific facts, so that we can see what reactions are being caused."
"Recently, Greece decided to bring the Drachma into the Exchange Rate Mechanism."
"That entry was accompanied by a 14 % devaluation of the national currency."
"That devaluation is already worsening all the Maastricht indicators concerning EMU."
"The public debt, and servicing it, demand an additional sum equal to 1 % of GDP, so instead of a 4 % GDP deficit we will have 5 %."
"Economists tell us that for every three percentage points of devaluation, inflation increases by one percent."
"Here, even if 3 % is too much, even with 4 % or 5 % devaluation for 1 % inflation, we will increase inflation in Greece by 2 to 3 %."
"Public debt is increasing by 5 % of GDP."
"Are working people in Greece not justified in expecting that the agreement between the Council and the Greek Government will act against their interests, when they hope that Greece will satisfy the convergence criteria in 1999?"
"I say to Mr Theonas that it is a matter of judgement by the various countries within the European Union how they can best manage their economies."
"It looks as though eleven will wish to manage them in a monetary sense by membership of the euro."
"Greece has indicated that it intends to join the eleven."
"It has joined the ERM."
"There are consequences of these decisions and the timing of those issues is a matter for the governments concerned."
"The general principle is that it is in the interests of all citizens of the European Union to have a stable economic situation."
"The Council believes that to achieve a stable economic situation there must be a stable monetary situation, and that is why many of the Member States within the European Union have tried to put their economies in a position where they can contribute to that stable monetary situation and benefit from it."
"The warning in the long term for us all is that if we have instability and monetary disunity, then the likelihood is that there will be significant inflationary consequences in the short, medium and long term."
"Those are consequences that an economy which is competing in a global context cannot afford, and that is why the policies of the Union are geared to achieving monetary stability."
"It may well be that, although there is pain for the Greek economy in the short term, as the economy begins to restructure itself the benefits accrue in a longer-term perspective."
"I wish to congratulate the President-in-Office on his last answer."
"I agreed very much and, therefore, it reinforces the problems of those countries not in the euro."
"I single out here the British economy and the UK."
"Would he not agree that the situation in Britain is that not being part of the euro is damaging British industry?"
"We are seeing high interest rates in the UK, which are having a detrimental effect; we are seeing an overvalued pound, which is likely to lose a hundred thousand jobs in the UK economy next year."
"Would it not be better for the President-in-Office to advise the British government that the best way it can bring about stability in Europe and stability in Britain is to declare an early entry into the ERM and an early date for joining the euro?"
"Perhaps he ought to tell Mr Blair to stand up to Mr Murdoch and the Sun and declare in favour of that."
"That would be the best thing to help the British economy and help stabilize Europe."
"I have to say that Mr Kerr very rarely misses an opportunity to take a pot shot at the British Government."
"However, I am here to respond on behalf of the Council and the Council has acknowledged the coherence in the British Government's approach to the euro."
"The Council has acknowledged that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking in the House of Commons, indicated that between November 1997 and a time after the next general election a convergence process could take place and the British Government could then decide whether or not it was in the economic interests of that country to seek membership of the euro at that date."
"The Council has acknowledged that the other partners in the European Union and industry and commerce in Britain and elsewhere - and, indeed, the workers and their organizations in those countries - have a better understanding of the British position."
"The stability brought to the British economy by this relationship to the European economy and the euro has been acknowledged."
"I cannot therefore agree that the Council should approach the British Government to give the advice that Mr Kerr seeks, although he knows himself that if he wishes to give that advice to the Chancellor of the Exchequer he is free to do so."
"Would the President-in-Office like to comment on the fact that even if it were not for the single currency there was a need for consolidation of the European economies, given the fact that we are now competing in a global environment, in particular in those countries which have weaker economies and could be most at risk as a result of globalization?"
"Secondly, would he like to comment on the fact that we need to make sure that all countries of the European Union, not just those that will be joining on 1 January 1999, must start preparing, because all their businesses will be affected?"
"Given Mr Theonas' question, is it not the case that those weaker economies need to make sure that they have prepared fully for the single currency, so that their small and medium-sized enterprises can take full advantage of the stable and very large euro area that will be created next year?"
"Mr Donnelly makes a very valid point that there is a need for all of the economies of Europe to make the changes that are necessary to achieve a more competitive position within a global economy."
"There is a strong view, which the Council has acknowledged, that the establishment of the euro will be a major contribution to achieving that."
"A number of countries who will seek to join the euro at an early stage will recognize that they need to take further action to reinforce that decision so that they can get the best out of their economy in a competitive sense."
"Other economies who will choose not to join the euro or may not be eligible to join the euro at its inception will also recognize that they need to make changes in their economies as well, whether or not they enter the euro at a later stage."
"For those who seek to enter, the question of convergence and preparation is of vital importance to their economies."
"But even if a country within the Union did not seek to accede to the euro at a later stage, clearly businesses within their economy would probably want to link their calculations to euro calculations."
"Indeed, there is already evidence that this is the case."
"It is very important for the governments of those countries to do what they can to assist their industry and commerce to make the changes that are necessary."
"Question No 15 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0279/98)"
"Subject: Euro-Mediterranean relations with Algeria"
"In the context of the Euro-Mediterranean process of cooperation with Algeria, what practical form is the wish for partnership expressed by the Council actually taking?"
"What programmes and projects have been launched in the past two years?"
"What is the outlook for the immediate future?"
"To what degree do young Algerians benefit from the EU?"
"Does our intention to offer protection reach Algerian women?"
"Will measures and programmes be introduced to combat corruption?"
"The European Union is developing cooperation with all 12 Mediterranean partners, including Algeria, within the Euro/Mediterranean process launched in Barcelona in November 1995."
"A wide range of initiatives have taken place in fields as diverse as the environment, investment, cultural heritage and industry."
"The needs of women and young people, as well as the necessity of combatting corruption, are taken into account when drawing up initiatives under the process which is supported by ECU 4.7 b in European Community financial assistance for economic transition under the MEDA programme."
"Negotiations are also under way for a new association agreement with Algeria."
"The Presidency hopes that good progress can be made in these negotiations during the course of the year."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has answered the question without saying anything concrete. It was almost a compromise answer, and overly evasive."
"However, I would remind him that at the moment, Europeans want to get involved and do something to support the people of Algeria."
"Please give me a more concrete answer, because you have told us absolutely nothing apart from vague remarks."
"Do you not think, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that this would be a very good time to establish a specific programme in favour of Algeria, to take effect immediately, before the association agreement negotiations?"
"You must realize that because of its nature, the association agreement is a long term measure, although negotiations have begun."
"The reality is that young Algerians are not benefitting at all from the European Union, and neither are Algerian women."
"I cannot add a lot more to what I said in my original reply."
"What I can say to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo is that there will be a conference of the Mediterranean countries and the EU in Palermo in June."
"That will be a further opportunity to discuss many of those issues."
"But it is the aim of the Union to seek to build links with Algeria."
"Economic links are important and must be accompanied by a commitment to the other things that would be incorporated into any association agreement such as democratic procedures and human rights."
"Question No 16 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0285/98)"
"Subject: The EIB's information policy"
"The European Investment Bank lends money to a series of projects both in the EU and in the applicant countries."
"Compared with other banks like the EBRD and the World Bank, which lend money to similar projects, the EIB provides very little information about the environmental impact of projects. This applies both before projects are approved and after the decision has been taken."
"For example, the EBRD - unlike the EIB - publishes an environmental impact assessment before decisions are taken on various projects."
"The World Bank also publishes documentation on the environmental impact of projects before decisions are taken."
"Does the Council consider the information provided by the EIB about the environmental impact of various projects to be adequate?"
"If not, what improvements does it feel that the EIB ought to make in this area?"
". Since the European Investment Bank's task is to contribute to the balanced and steady development of the Community, it is bound to act in respect of the provisions of the European Community Treaty concerning the environment, in particular Article 130r which states that 'environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of other Community policies' ."
"The Council has not taken a view on whether the information provided by the European Investment Bank on the environmental impact of particular projects is adequate."
"In general this is for the Commission to judge and the Honourable Member may therefore want to direct his question to that source."
"The reason why I asked this question is because I have been in contact with a number of eastern European environmental organizations which are very unhappy about the way the European Investment Bank has acted in certain projects in eastern Europe, that is, when environmental impact assessments are not carried out until after grants have been made to projects which are very suspect from an environmental point of view."
"I think the Council itself should take overall responsibility, since this affects the environmental situation in the applicant countries."
"They expect major adjustments which could, for example, affect biodiversity which is also affected by these projects."
"I think the Council itself should have an overall view about how the European Investment Bank acts in eastern Europe, and about the fact that it has a significantly worse policy than, for example, the World Bank or the EBRD."
"I wonder whether you really do not see this as part of your responsibilities, since it is part of the Union's overall policy in the area of the environment in relation to the applicant countries."
"I very much agree with Mr Sjöstedt that environmental policy is a very important policy within the Union and that Community policies generally should be taking much more account of environmental matters."
"Indeed, in the Amsterdam Treaty which has not yet been ratified, of course, there is an additional Union obligation to give environmental considerations a higher priority."
"Currently, under existing Treaty provisions the EIB publishes an environmental policy statement which sets out its general approach."
"In relation to the countries who wish to accede to the European Union, environmental matters are important matters for them and from my discussions with them they have all recognized that."
"One of the things which can be identified in the accession partnerships is the need to take action on the environment."
"I am sure that when those matters are identified by the countries which wish to accede to the European Union the Commission will respond with appropriate funding within their remit."
"I think all the countries who want to be on the negotiating line for membership of the European Union - at the moment there are six - recognize that they have to make many environmental changes before they will be able to accede, and that involves very many issues."
"One of the key issues is having the necessary regulatory expertise to be able to monitor environmental considerations and make any necessary recommendations for change: from matters relating to power stations, to matters relating to environmental standards in public parks, across a wide range of diverse issues, I agree with Mr Sjöstedt that it must be given higher priority and I am sure that the EIB is aware of its obligations in this regard and I can say that the Council will do everything it can to assist that process."
"Only today we have discussed a matter in Parliament relating to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit on Social Development, especially in developing and less developed countries."
"This included proposals which were approved by Parliament today to introduce ethical rules into trade agreements, rules which move in the right direction with regard to social development and child labour, but also with regard to environmental requirements."
"It was very pleasing to see Parliament support these demands."
"I see the Council's answer as very positive and would just like to ask a supplementary question."
"You say that the rules are such that you cannot always fulfill our requests for environmental impact assessments."
"In that case, is the Council prepared to help change the rules for the EIB and other EU institutions in the right direction, so that environmental impact assessments can be made?"
"The EIB generally has to follow the policies of the Union but it has its own decision-making structure and the Board of Governors is composed of finance ministers from the Member States and they are charged with implementing the policies of the Union in the execution of their duties."
"I think in relation to agreements with third world countries one needs to strike a balance."
"One cannot expect poor third world countries to immediately meet environmental standards that one would expect to be applied in rich countries within the European Union, but that does not mean that one ignores environmental matters."
"I am sure that the first to recognize that would be the governments and the peoples of those third world countries themselves where they genuinely want to develop their economies, but they want to do it on a sensible basis."
"They do not want to destroy their environment and I think it is wise to agree programmes over a longer period and those should rightly include environmental considerations, but not exclusively."
"Mr President, I would be interested to know whether the best practice model would also be possible for the information policy of the EIB, because listing the most successful projects would have a considerable effect on the future of the other projects."
"I would say to Mr Rübig that what he says makes sense."
"I hope that the bank would adopt that policy."
"Question No 17 by Veronica Hardstaff (H-0288/98)"
"Subject: Arrangements for the agrimonetary systems for non-EMU states"
"Will the Council be making recommendations on arrangements for an agrimonetary system for countries remaining outside the ""Eurozone' when the decision is made in May as to which countries will be the founding members of EMU?"
"The Commission has indicated that it will submit draft proposals to the Council for agri-monetary arrangements to apply after 1 January 1999, shortly after decision on single currency participants are taken in May."
"The Presidency will ensure that the Council undertakes an examination of the Commission's proposals as early as possible after due consultation of the European Parliament."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"It is a matter of great urgency and anxiety among the agricultural community in those countries which are not going to be in the first wave of EMU because they are subject, not merely to the vagaries of weather and climate and the changes in CAP reform, WTO and GATT, but will continue to have considerable anxieties about the vagaries of currency exchange."
"I would urge that our agricultural communities be given this information as quickly as possible so that they can plan ahead knowing that at least one area will not be as uncertain as many others in the years ahead."
"I can give Mrs Hardstaff the commitment she is looking for: the Presidency recognizes the importance of this issue, and a speedy response will be given as soon as possible after the date to which I previously referred."
"Mr President, this is of interest both to the countries within the single currency and to those which remain outside."
"Can Mr Henderson tell us whether there is a tendency to equalize the green exchange rates with the commercial exchange rates of the currencies?"
"Thank you for that further supplementary."
"That would be a matter that the Commission would need to consider, and the Council would liaise with the Commission on that matter."
"Thank you very much, Mr Henderson."
"I fear you want to leave us."
"When we started Question Time, I suggested extending it to 7.15 p.m. but you told me that your plane would not wait and you would have to leave at 7.00 p.m."
"This Presidency greatly enjoys your company and the chance to listen to the answers you give to the honourable Members of this House, but I cannot keep you here against your will, when you really cannot stay."
"Let us hope that in the future we can organize the work of this House better, so we can keep precisely to the time we have both agreed upon."
"Thank you for your presence and your replies."
"Questions Nos 18 to 40 will be dealt with in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia - post-SFOR strategy (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0123/98 by Mr Schwaiger, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation 1628/96 relating to aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (COM(98)0018 - C4-0105/98-98/0023(CNS))-A4-0106/98 by Mrs Daskalaki, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on a post-SFOR strategy in Bosnia and Herzegovina containing a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Daskalaki and Mr Schwaiger on their reports."
"Admittedly neither of them is present, but I hope that they have not already given up hope that their reports will be considered and decisions about them made."
"They are two very good reports, two short but pregnant reports, which also go in the right political direction."
"What is more, both Mrs Daskalaki and Mr Schwaiger have worked very constructively with the other groups in the committee."
"When we consider the situation, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we must weigh up the positive as well as the negative developments or non-developments there. On the one hand we must say that the development in Republic Srpska has been thoroughly positive."
"We have there a president who is certainly no angel on the political scene, but who has nevertheless begun to cooperate with Europe and the USA."
"We have a prime minister whom we have recently been able to receive in the European Parliament, Prime Minister Dodik, whose work is thoroughly constructive."
"We can surely record this as one of the positive developments in Republic Srpska."
"We have not yet reached the end, and we must be careful, because the nationalists may still gain the upper hand."
"Secondly, we have made progress in economic and infrastructural development."
"I was recently in Sarajevo, and the picture there today is quite different, not only compared to the war period, during which I also visited it, but also in the period afterwards, up to about nine months ago, when I was last there - and that applies not only to the infrastructure, but also the life of the people and their enjoyment of living, which is becoming evident again there."
"On the negative side: the return of the refugees is still faltering."
"I do not say that nothing is happening, but much too little is happening."
"It's a roundabout that no-one really wants to get going, and they are all waiting for each other."
"The Croats are waiting for the Bosnians, the Bosnians for the Serbs, the Serbs for the Croats, or however they want to set the ball rolling."
"In any case, it is still unsatisfactory, and I believe that we must do everything we can and that all of us must encourage the High Representative to continue to work there."
"The second thing which is very serious is the situation in Kosovo, in Albania, in Macedonia and in Serbia itself."
"We get the feeling, and the Bosnians are getting it again, that they are still in a very weak situation."
"They are the only ones who have no supporting power in their area."
"The Croats have one, the Serbs have one, and there is also the Kosovo problem, which is interpreted at least as a problem of the Islamic minority in a Christian environment."
"I therefore believe that it is necessary to continue to have troops on the ground, even at lower strength, and perhaps with a stronger European engagement."
"In that I can entirely support Mrs Daskalaki, who is just coming in, regarding her report and the Schwaiger report."
"We need more efficiency, more decentralization and more coordination on the ground."
"These are also some of those points to which the Commission led by Tom Spencer correctly referred."
"I have been able to see these deficiencies for myself in the past few years at the Donus conference, in Sarajevo and in other places."
"We have spent a lot of money, but not efficiently enough."
"This must stop!"
"We must spend the money more efficiently."
"There must be more coordination, and more must be decided on the spot."
"I believe that it is impossible to control things centrally from Brussels to this extent, because we do believe that we have them under control."
"We do not have them under control because our approach is a strongly centralist one."
"I am therefore glad that the Commission has presented the proposals, and I am also glad that the Presidency is going in this direction."
"That is due, not least, to the initiative of this Parliament."
"In this way we can hope for a happy ending, the sooner the better."
"Madam President, can I add my congratulations to both Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Daskalaki for their excellent reports."
"I had the honour of leading the ad hoc delegation to Bosnia some weeks ago."
"I have to say I came back very angry and rather ashamed that the European Union should be represented in quite such a way, should be quite so ineffective in a crisis of extraordinary proportions."
"I was angry with the Commission; but I would like tonight to pay tribute to the way the Commission has responded in the last three weeks to pressure from Parliament and in particular pay tribute to Hans van den Broek and to everyone involved in the Commission for the agreement they reached with Parliament on Monday night in the vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee."
"I have to say that until about 5.25 this afternoon I was also extremely angry with the Council because Parliament had been very critical - the delegation had been very critical not only of the Commission, but also of the Council for its failure to coordinate on the spot in Bosnia, for its insistence on lunatically complicated tendering arrangements."
"I want, however, in a rare mood of openness to congratulate Doug Henderson, the President-in-Office, for what I thought was an extremely constructive speech earlier this evening."
"I was impressed by the way he commented on Parliament's amendments, and I was impressed by the way he offered talks with Parliament to resolve this matter by the end of April."
"I have therefore suggested to colleagues informally tonight a timetable that would meet his requirements and I have circulated that timetable to colleagues so that the groups can discuss it tomorrow morning."
"That timetable, which would culminate in a parliamentary vote at the beginning of the next plenary, would allow us to have time for discussions with the Council and with the Budgets Committee so that we could honour our side of the bargain by releasing the ECU 30 million that could be immediately spent in Bosnia."
"I think we are very close on this issue."
"Everything that goodwill and intelligence and flexibility can do I promise, from my committee."
"This is an issue where the cooperation of the three institutions here in Brussels and Strasbourg will actually, at the end of the day, contribute to the cooperation of all three institutions and the proper representation of the European Union in Bosnia where it matters."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first to complain that this debate has been held in two parts, as often happens, unfortunately, in this Parliament, with one Commissioner, Commissioner van den Broek, attending the first part, and then another Commissioner, Commissioner Flynn, a worthy representative of the Commission but someone less interested in Bosnia-Herzegovina: this is something reprehensible, I have to say."
"Moreover, the Council is no longer here and what the political groups say is of no interest to anyone."
"Having said that, I too want to congratulate Mrs Daskalaki and Mr Schwaiger for their excellent work."
"The first thing we have to bear in mind is that with the Bosnia-Herzegovina question Europe has given off its worst impression of the last 40 years, since the Second World War in fact."
"We have witnessed a massacre, a massacre a few steps away from home, without the European Union being able or knowing how to say a word."
"After giving off this bad impression - the Americans had to intervene to find a solution! - the EU seems to be showing its own inefficiencies, its own inability with regard to reconstruction too."
"It is right that attention is drawn to what is happening with regard to reconstruction."
"So what is happening?"
"Simply, the political instability of Bosnia-Herzegovina remains, despite all the expenditure by the European countries, by the EU; the central institutions are non-existent to such a point that we did not even know who to sign undertakings with; the Brussels centralization, which Brussels wanted, which the European Commission wanted for control and transparency, has had negative effects; it has actually been counterproductive."
"The more Brussels asked for control and transparency, the more obviously fraud and embezzlement multiplied."
"Allocations are already rare. European public opinion is already looking at us because of budget restrictions in every country."
"So we can no longer allow ourselves to have this type of attitude. We should learn from Bosnia-Herzegovina to establish an innovative approach to Community aid: no longer non-refundable subsidies, but rather partnerships and returnable loans."
"I think that only one independent plenipotentiary representative, with exceptional powers and with specific decision-making powers can help in this respect."
"Europe is watching us!"
"Madam President, let me first stress the importance which the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and I personally attach to the effectiveness of aid for the former Yugoslavia, so that reconstruction takes place quickly and people can return to their homes."
"Against that background we were very concerned when we received the report from the Parliamentary delegation which recently visited the former Yugoslavia and returned home saying that the situation there with regard to aid is not being managed in a good and efficient way."
"A large number of proposals were also made regarding how the aid efforts and administration could be improved so that the aid really got where it was meant to go."
"As I understand things, the Commission has accepted the line proposed by Parliament and is prepared to ensure that a more efficient organization than the one we had before is created to take responsibility for these aid efforts in the former Yugoslavia."
"We think that is good."
"I also thought that what Mr Henderson said today gives us reason to believe that the Council is also going to ensure that it does whatever is in its power to make the efforts effective."
"Against this background, I recommended to my group this evening that we should support Mr Schwaiger's proposal tomorrow and vote the report through. The group unanimously supported my recommendation."
"Let me finish by saying that if any conclusion may be drawn from this, it is that Parliament has performed a very important function, precisely the function which falls to Parliament, namely to ensure as a supervisory authority that when there is cause for criticism, that criticism is made, and to ensure that measures are taken to correct what has gone wrong."
"Madam President, the Dayton Agreement was established by military might, by imposing military intervention and interference."
"Two years later, our rapporteurs have made an assessment - both of them, and many speakers as well - and have found that something may have been achieved by military means but nothing non-military has been achieved at all."
"The refugees have not gone home, arms may have brought peace but it is fragile, millions of ECU remain unabsorbed, the central administration does not function, the system of democratic liberties and human rights is not working properly. So what are the results of this militarily imposed Treaty?"
"They have assessed the situation and I agree with their assessment."
"I disagree, however, with their conclusions because what is it that they are asking for? An extension of the military presence, and not only that, but its reinforcement too, they are recommending that to make its presence felt the European Union must play the tune of calling for mobile military forces, interventions by the WEU under NATO's leadership, more and more military intervention, and for what?"
"To get the same result, which cannot be cured by military presence and intervention, as we see from the self-evident outcome, from the two-year assessment of Dayton."
"What is the issue here?"
"Let the Bosnians, the Herzegovinans, the Croatians and the Serbs bury the dead you are responsible for because of the conflicts you created."
"Let them bury their hatreds and passions and find for themselves how to cooperate peacefully, so that economic and social reconstruction and development can progress. That is how the European Union can show its presence - by staying out of it."
"Leave those peoples alone, before you spread more general conflict in the Balkans."
"Madam President, like Mr Caccavale, I actually find this a rather farcical parliamentary debate when the groups start to speak the moment the Presidency is no longer here, and we have a different Commissioner who is following up these matters."
"I have been in this Parliament for twelve years now, but this really beats everything I have ever experienced. This is what happens when you are in the European Parliament."
"As far as the core of the issue is concerned, the Green Group supports the two reports by Mr Schwaiger and Mrs Daskalaki."
"I would like to start by speaking to Mrs Daskalaki's report because it is clear that if a continued SFOR presence in BosniaHerzegovina is not guaranteed, anything might happen again."
"So it is vital that the presence is continued, and it is clear that there have been plenty of signals from the United States to suggest that it is going to lessen its participation. What's more, I think it is perfectly normal that the European countries accept responsibility for pursuing peace-keeping operations in what is a European country, after all."
"To me, a very important point in Mrs Daskalaki's report is that attention is rightly paid to the force which not only has to provide for a shift towards Europe, whereby Europe finally accepts its responsibilities, but also for a new relationship between the military and the police presence."
"The UN group which will be deployed for policing operations will therefore be more prominent, and will focus on training local police, and everyone in Bosnia knows how important it is that this strategy is persevered with."
"In conclusion, I would like to say a few things about Mr Schwaiger's report."
"To be honest, Mr Spencer, I am not as optimistic as you, because this Parliament came up with exactly the same analysis as the one expounded in Mr Schwaiger's report."
"We have known for two years that things are not working out this way, that the situation is untenable."
"We also knew which changes were needed, and they have not been implemented."
"As far as that is concerned both the Commission and the Council are most certainly not without responsibility, and I think this ought to be stated pointedly here."
"I believe there is hope for the future."
"I am always an optimist, so I am happy to go along with this and I think it is important in this context that Parliament keeps something in reserve not to give immediate approval to everything we are promised, but to see what will be decided at the Council on 27 and 28 April."
"We will not give the green light until we know that what we are getting is what we should be getting."
"If together we work towards that, ladies and gentlemen, we know we will have done something for Bosnia."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the agenda is set by the party leaders, and this time in the knowledge that on Wednesday evening neither the Commission nor the Council can be present."
"I just wanted to let you know this."
"That is how it has been set."
"I regret that there was no alternative, but is was not a surprise."
"It was not evil intent on the part of the Commission, there was an agreement to do it in this way."
"Madam President, as a member of the ad hoc delegation I was able to see for myself how difficult the situation for people in Bosnia is at this time."
"Mr Schwaiger's report pointed out, in many proposals, what action must be taken to bring about an improvement."
"However, for me as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, it is important that the coordination and preparation of specific projects in the context of an inclusive repatriation programme have the highest priority this year."
"For this purpose, the efforts of the NGOs and other organizations on the ground must be more strongly supported and coordinated by the Commission."
"Reconstruction has been delayed because mine clearance work is not yet finished."
"Also, reconstruction of the whole infrastructure, and gas, water and electricity, and traffic links, schools and health care must be more strongly supported."
"For this reason, the return of refugees cannot yet take place this year in some places, but must be properly prepared, so that the refugees themselves can decide to return."
"If today too many refugees are sent back too early, the region may be destabilized, and that may permanently prevent the final repatriation."
"Madam President, I too was in Sarajevo some time ago, where I heard the story about the parliament building."
"The parliament building was going to be reconstructed with European aid as a symbol of effective decision-making and good practice."
"Since that time it has remained ruined and it is now a symbol of the inefficient decision-making of the European Union."
"It is in fact terribly sad that the European Union Ambassador told me at the time, ""Look, you have floods of money from the European Union, but you have decisions from the USA' ."
"Madam President, shortly after the war we used to make arrogant jokes about the Americans in the Netherlands, and we used to say: you have the money, we have the brains."
"But now the situation seems to have been reversed."
"At the moment it is the Europeans who have the money, so to speak, and it is the Americans who are making the intelligent and effective decisions."
"We have to put this down to the fact that the European Union is made up of a number of Member States who are much more interested in their own gains when it comes to construction projects, rather than a union of individual members who are capable of outstepping themselves in order to meet their responsibility."
"That is the painful reason why we are lagging behind the Americans and have started to act a bit like a satellite."
"That is all we are really."
"I welcome Mr Schwaiger's report wholeheartedly."
"I think it is excellent and well thought out, in particular when he says we should make ourselves more visible through decentralized decision-making processes, by increasing our presence with a clearer figurehead, with a large, effective staff and a wide remit to coordinate and take decisions."
"I think this is a very important issue and I thoroughly welcome the fact that it has been given so much attention in this report."
"The return of refugees, and the restoration of order in a strategically positioned enclave in Europe is, of course, of significant interest to Europe."
"If this is successfully achieved, then the SFOR force should stay, because if refugees are starting to return to the area, then we will need a SFOR which tries to bridge the gap between military and civil aspects, and which is able to act during riots and to make arrests, if necessary."
"I find this an excellent element in Mrs Daskalaki's report as well, and I would like to offer my sincerest congratulations to both rapporteurs on the remarkable results they have achieved on behalf of this Parliament."
"Madam President, I would like to concentrate for the moment on the Daskalaki report, which I think is excellent. I would like to emphasize a few of its points."
"First, it makes quite clear that peaceful reconstruction work is obviously a priority after such a terrible war, but that unfortunately it can also be necessary to secure reconstruction militarily, as we are finding in the case of Bosnia."
"I believe that it is very important that this is put in writing."
"Secondly, this report appeals very clearly to Europe's own responsibility in matters of securing peace and of reconstruction in this war region."
"I consider this to be quite important, because the consequence that the Western European Union was activated is a quite excellent development, and since we know how important it is to develop further the common foreign and security policy of the European Union."
"One thing has almost been forgotten yet again: that essentially it was the United States which took on liability for the failure of European security policy, and I would not like to imagine what would have happened if the USA had ended its involvement and we had probably left the country in a state of chaos again."
"My plea, therefore, is that we should finally work consistently to construct a common foreign and security policy in the European Union, a common foreign and security policy which actually deserves the name."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Dayton peace agreements unfortunately continue to require to be secured militarily."
"The Daskalaki report about a strategy for the period after the expiry of the SFOR mandate next June therefore comes at just the right time before the decision of the North Atlantic Council about the new provisional operation plan, which will then be confirmed by the NATO foreign ministers in May 1998."
"Securing a peace - perhaps we should rather say a state of non-war - must become more and more a European responsibility."
"The demand that the Western European Union should organize military action in the context of a joint SFOR operation led by NATO with Austria also taking part would be an appropriate symbol of a European security policy in the Balkans."
"Unfortunately the reconstruction of Bosnia leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Not because the European Union has made too little money available for it - on the contrary, it is the biggest donor, with ECU 408 million last year - but because these resources, as the Schwaiger report shows in detail, are not being appropriately administered and distributed on the ground."
"A senior official with appropriate power of decision can and must remedy this."
"Bosnia-Herzegovina was and is a test case for the influence of the EU in this area, an influence which must be made much more effective, particularly in view of the new crisis in Kosovo."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports with which we are dealing today are closely related, and anyone who, like me and others here, has followed events on the ground for years, realizes that without the presence of the SFOR soldiers the civilian peace process has no chance."
"I would recommend to Mr Ephremidis that he should go to Sarajevo and its surroundings; he would come back with the same realization."
"He could not do otherwise."
"But if you do not open your eyes, you do not change direction."
"The soldiers prevent open hostilities, they sometimes help to seize war criminals, they support the reconstruction literally with their own hands, for example, by building bridges."
"They - at least the Franco-German brigade - are also actively involved in the repatriation of refugees, because they systematically collect data and facts village by village, which are the necessary preconditions for return, and they then pass them on to the appropriate German authorities."
"For our financial help to flow and reconstruction really to start, we need an instrument other than the PHARE programme, which, for its implementation on the recipients' side, assumes structures which do not yet exist and will not exist for a long time."
"Just imagine that the Marshall Plan had had to function in these circumstances after World War II."
"We would still be waiting for its beneficial impact."
"Thank heaven, the Commission is prepared to follow up the discoveries of the delegation which was in Bosnia, so that finally the financial aid is reaching its target."
"For egoistic national reasons, the Council shared the guilt for the previous mismanagement, but in the main it passed the buck to the Commission."
"The Council must finally accept Mr Schwaiger's proposals, for the sake of Europe's credibility."
"We need a truly responsible plenipotentiary of Europe on the ground. Otherwise, we shall lose to the Americans what little is left of our credibility, influence and respect!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Methane emissions ."
"The next item is the report (A4-0120/98) by Mr Marset Campos on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on the strategy for reducing methane emissions (COM(96)0557 - C4-0001/97)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Commission's initiative on the reduction of methane emissions at European level is essentially correct and positive."
"However, on the one hand, it is somewhat late given the commitments made and our support, demonstrated in Maastricht and Amsterdam, to lead our society towards a sustainable model."
"And, on the other hand, it suffers from inadequacies in terms of the first-hand detailed studies on this issue at European level which could lay the foundations for specific, global proposals adjusted to the actual situation."
"Finally, therefore, it is lacking in all the proposals it puts forward."
"We in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection have approved this report with the very positive incorporation of the contributions made by both the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The Commission's communication is appropriate and positive since methane gas is the largest contributor to the ""greenhouse effect' after carbon dioxide."
"Added to this, methane emissions increase by 1 % a year - almost 500 teragrammes per year. Since the average life of methane in the atmosphere is relatively short and varies between 8 and 17 years, it is more effective to combine the fight to reduce methane emissions, either through a decrease in emissions or combustion."
"This initiative is somewhat tardy, since other industrialized countries - such as the United States, Australia and Canada - have effectively adopted global strategies intended to reduce emissions."
"Nevertheless, we believe that the initiative is also insufficient since we do not have a detailed study in Europe on this issue - there has been one on the basis of national studies, but never a specific one -, and there are inadequacies in the proposals."
"I would like to look at several of them."
"In general, the initiative is positive since it sets out all the undertakings given under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Conference, the Fifth framework action programme on the environment ""Towards Sustainability' , as well as the Environment Council of 1994 and the demands of the Council's Ad Hoc Group on Climate, in accordance with the Berlin Mandate."
"However, some points need to be added which we believe to be important."
"Firstly, we must urgently adopt an ambitious package of legislative, economic and social recommendations."
"Secondly, we believe that we should establish a European Climate Agency to coordinate all measures, including those proposed here."
"Thirdly, we consider it essential to provide greater access to gas pipelines for the most important sources of methane already mentioned."
"Fourthly, we should incorporate three specific issues into the proposal. As regards agriculture, we must study European rice cultivation; we must also look at livestock farming in a more realistic way to ensure that our livestock industry is not harmed in comparison to other livestock industries; and we must thus give more consideration to the CAP in terms of its environmental impact."
"In terms of landfill sites, the proposal must be included in our European energy policy, and as regards the use of energy, we must improve the control of leakages from all types of gas pipelines and from coalmines."
"There is another aspect which is worth mentioning briefly: the improvement of research."
"This is important because we believe that we are missing the train in terms of providing instruments and materials in a growing market, precisely on this issue of controlling methane emissions."
"We should also provide economic assistance, tax exemptions and all sorts of benefits for those European companies which are achieving a reduction of methane emissions abroad."
"And finally, we need to increase public awareness regarding these issues so that they also get involved and participate in an active way and that we are not merely dependent on legislative measures."
"Madam President, I would first like to thank Mr Marset Campos for his really excellent report and also the recommendations which he has presented to Parliament."
"But I would also like to express praise for the Commission, because the communication which it has presented to us is excellent and of much help for the debate."
"Thirdly, if you will allow me, I would like to excuse my colleague Ulrich Stockmann, who has prepared an opinion for the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"I am speaking in his place."
"Unfortunately he has had to undergo an operation and cannot be here today."
"To get to the point: First, it occurs to me that we are living in a time of great surprises, because who would have thought ten or twenty years ago that such a commonplace molecule as methane would be the subject of an evening sitting of the European Parliament?"
"This puts me in a reflective mood, because it is quite possible that in future we shall discover that other commonplace things are also vitally important."
"Research exists to discover things which we do not know."
"It is possible that in future we shall make some unpleasant discoveries which force us to reflect."
"Second, I would like to note that when I talk about research, we should really do research not just with the purpose of solving problems, however important that is, but also to discover the unknown."
"This is something unknown which we have actually discovered."
"The problem which faces us in this context is that methane, like other gases which affect climate, has a global impact, but that we have no global decision centre."
"I am therefore especially thankful that the idea of a Climate Agency, a European or perhaps even better an international Climate Agency, is really being considered."
"I know that at first such a thing raises fears of a new bureaucracy."
"But I ask, in a world in which there is no proper decision centre, where can global management be done if not in new institutions which we set up?"
"We must do the calculations."
"We must submit a global report, we must discuss in the parliaments and governments, and we must also act globally."
"At the same time, and that is the paradox in this situation, we are not just dealing with a global subject, but with a decentralized one, because the sources from which the methane comes are distributed very diffusely over the whole world."
"Mr Marset Campos has indicated what these sources are."
"At the same time, we also need decentralized action, enlightenment, we need to educate the people who now participate directly or indirectly in the human production of methane."
"There are many examples, which are also listed in the Commission's communication."
"But that brings me to the question of how these examples can be acted upon?"
"What is the motive which causes people to carry out such action or to invest money in it?"
"Not everyone reads the Commission's communications."
"Not everyone reads the decisions of the European Parliament, and even if people read them, I am not yet sure that they are personally motivated by them."
"What moves people?"
"There must be a material reason for taking action."
"That brings us to the question: How is it financed?"
"What is the personal profit, in the spheres of agriculture and waste disposal, of acting differently from the way we have had to act until now?"
"I would like us to put the emphasis on that when we discuss climate in future."
"How can the good advice that we give, the good analyses, actually be put into effect?"
"That is in fact the central question, to which until now we have basically given no answer."
"We always say that the Commission must make a proposal to us, the Commission has the right to make proposals."
"It is a splendid right, but sometimes also an unpleasant duty, because the answers are not always immediately to hand."
"Nevertheless we hope that in the future the Commission will make proposals to us in accordance with the maxim ""We must do it' rather than ""We could do it, we ought to do it' , and that it also explains to us how it is to be financed."
"That would be my request to the Commission."
"It is expressed in the decision."
"I thank you for listening to me."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and to thank him for the work he has put in on it."
"On behalf of my group we welcome the report, although we have reservations over one or two of the paragraphs, particularly the recommendation on the European Climate Agency and paragraph 5."
"I do not think we will be supporting that."
"We do not see any need to set up a separate agency and I do not imagine the Commission does either, although we noticed that Mrs Bjerregaard is not gracing us with her presence tonight."
"The largest sources of methane in the environment are defined by the report and by the Commission document as livestock and landfill."
"I wish Mr Flynn all success in pursuing Agenda 2000, which is the only way, as far as I can see, that we are going to reduce the methane emissions from livestock in the end."
"I want to concentrate very briefly on this issue of landfill."
"The paper emphasizes the possibility of high levels of methane elimination."
"I wish whoever had written this in the Commission had had a word with whoever was writing the directive on landfill."
"When this point was taken up by the Committee on the Environment, I as rapporteur was told by various officials in the Commission that 90 % or at any rate 100 % elimination of methane emissions via energy recovery systems or flaring was virtually impossible."
"Flaring might perhaps produce very high levels of methane capture but anything else, they said, could not go above about 70 %."
"They were extremely pessimistic."
"I now read in the Commission's document - pages 12 and 13 of the English text - ' Several options can reduce methane emissions from landfills, some of them by up to 90 %.' That was denied by the Commission again and again in the Committee on the Environment, and I think that is very regrettable."
"What will now happen is that we have two Community instruments fighting against each other."
"The landfill directive will now make it very uneconomic for landfill operators to invest in methane recovery systems because the Commission's own instrument demands of them that they put less biodegradable waste into landfill progressively over a period up to 2010."
"The objectives set out in this strategy are therefore combatted by a proposal from the Commission."
"I think that is regrettable and I do not suppose Mr Flynn will have anything very constructive to say about it, but I thought I would put it on the record."
"I should like to thank Mr Marset Campos and all those who contributed to the debate."
"The aim of the communication of the Commission is to examine the problems related to atmospheric methane emissions and to identify the main emission sources and sinks, to review some cost-effective mechanisms for reducing these emissions and to provide some options that could be used in a Community greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy."
"The options focus on three sectors: agriculture, waste and energy."
"The communication also provides a first response."
"In the light of the Kyoto Agreement that aimed at reducing a basket of six greenhouse gases, including methane, by 8 % by the year 20082012, it will be necessary to examine further the contribution that methane emission reduction can make to the Community's overall target."
"The report by Mr Marset Campos and the accompanying motion for a resolution show that he is fully in tune with the concerns that are set out in the Commission's communication."
"Moreover, the debate on this communication could not have come at a better time since, following the agreement on the protocol at Kyoto, the Commission is now very actively engaged in further reflections on how best to implement the commitments it has made with respect to emission reduction."
"Reductions in methane, as the second most important greenhouse gas, will certainly be an important consideration in the Community's post-Kyoto strategy."
"Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after CO2 ."
"Given that the major proportion of methane is man-made it is vital for these emissions to be restricted and reduced."
"All of those who have contributed made that point very forcefully."
"In 1990 agriculture accounted for 45 %, waste for 32 % and energy for 23 % of European Union methane emissions."
"Calculations in the communication show that by 2010 a reduction of up to 15 %, compared with 1990, is feasible based on current policies."
"But a reduction of up to some 40 % or more in the same period is estimated to be the maximum technically feasible, assuming that significant policy changes are made."
"The Commission can therefore largely share the views set out by you, Mr Marset Campos, in your report for addressing the emissions of methane."
"On the motion for a resolution itself I would like to make a few specific points."
"On paragraph 2: the Commission has made some further studies, aimed at obtaining more detailed information on methane emissions."
"Specifically as regards methane hydrates I can inform you that the Director-General for Research has an ongoing project on this particular topic."
"This will be very welcome news to you."
"On paragraph 3: the Commission is in the process of drawing up a strategy to meet its Kyoto commitment of reducing its emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8 % by 2008-2012 compared with 1990."
"Mr Linkohr will be very anxious to have that kind of measurement achieved."
"That is our aim."
"The scope for reducing methane emissions will be an important consideration in this strategy."
"That is the point you make."
"On paragraph 5: the Commission takes note of Parliament's wish to see a European climate agency as a means of coordinating public and private climate protection."
"I note the difference of opinion on both sides of the House as far as this particular recommendation is concerned."
"It is an interesting idea."
"I say to Mrs Jackson, who makes the point very well, that there are a number of implications that need further study in this regard."
"On paragraph 9: the Commission recognizes that gas leakage from old pipelines - a point made specifically by the rapporteur - in the former countries of the Soviet Union is an important source of methane emissions."
"The deployment of European Union funds for repairs to these pipelines would certainly bring environmental benefit."
"Such actions would have to be considered in the overall framework in so far as the overall priorities are concerned and the availability of money."
"On paragraph 21: the Commission certainly subscribes to the view that greater public awareness is essential if emission reductions are to be achieved."
"This effort needs to be taken not only at Community level but also at national and local levels if it is to be really effective."
"I welcome the contributions that have been made."
"Even though my colleague Mrs Bjerregaard is not here, she can rest assured that I will bring the matters raised by you to her attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Suitability of blood donors"
"The next item is the report (A4-0112/98) by Mr Cabrol on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the proposal for a Council Recommendation on the suitability of blood and plasma donors and the screening of donated blood in the European Community (COM(97)0605 - C4-0027/98-97/0315(CNS))"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the current Council recommendation applies essentially to the first section of the previous Commission communication which related to blood safety and self-sufficiency in the Union, for which I was rapporteur."
"This first section is devoted to the safety of transfusions and more particularly to the two primary conditions of this safety: donor suitability and screening of donated blood."
"Self-sufficiency is mentioned incidentally, when it is a question of volumes of blood donations."
"Firstly with regard to donor suitability, the Council wishes to have exhaustive information on these donors, whose gift is clearly a generous one - this needs to be underlined as we are asking, in Amendment Nos 14 and 18, for the application of the principle of voluntary donations - but it is not without consequence for the donor or for future potential recipients of transfusions."
"This information must be encouraged - this is the objective of Amendment Nos 1 and 5 - in order to gain a better understanding of, and cooperation from, potential donors."
"In order to find a donor who is at the origin of a contaminated donation, it is important to set up a register to include the name of the collection centre and precise identification of the donor in the form of a code number which would guarantee confidentiality of information."
"It seems essential to us that statistics should be held centrally on a single register within the Union, with a unique identification code enabling precise traceability."
"This is covered by Amendment Nos 8 and 11."
"To reduce as far as possible the harmful consequences that a donation could have on either the donor himself or on possible recipients, the Council is proposing a detailed questionnaire on donor criteria."
"This questionnaire is in response to the demands of Parliament itself in its previous resolution on blood safety."
"There are three points in this questionnaire worth drawing your attention to."
"The first relates to risks connected with journeys outside of the European Union."
"Of course, many illnesses only exist and can only be caught in some countries, for example, malaria."
"Nevertheless, it would be useless to discriminate in this matter and to exclude certain third countries such as North America, where some illnesses are, nevertheless, endemic."
"This is the objective of Amendment No 20 which corrects the original text in this sense."
"The second point relates to sexual activity."
"Wherever there is sexual activity, absolutely wherever, in no matter what country, even in the European Union, there is also the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases."
"This is why we recommend voting against the two points in the Council's questionnaire which mention sexual activity."
"The first is aimed at Africa, we do not want this included, and the second is aimed at countries other than in Africa, for the same reason we do not want this included."
"This removal would render Amendment No 21 null and void."
"The third point relates to homosexual practices between men."
"These practices still carry very high risks, the rectum holding up much less well to the virus than some other mucous membranes."
"We therefore reject Amendment No 29, which would limit the danger to high risk male homosexual relations, as if no other male homosexual relations carried a danger."
"I repeat that, medically, all male homosexual relations carry risks, very considerable risks."
"The exclusion of donors on the basis of these criteria could be definitive or temporary, depending on the case and the illness."
"But in any case, absolute confidentiality must be guaranteed in order to respect the rights of donors and to maintain the generosity of the general public."
"Amendment No 10 is intended in this direction."
"Full and specific tests must be carried out on donated blood and plasma and we must be continually informed of the existence and validity of new viral markers."
"This is the intended direction of Amendment Nos 7, 9 and 13."
"But these tests only show positive after a certain period of time in the contaminated donor, a period during which antibodies are produced yet during which the antibodies are still not sufficient to be detected by the tests."
"This is where the need for a questionnaire comes in, as it is the only way of removing these high risk donors during this period."
"Finally, the Council makes recommendations on the volume of blood to be taken from donors, and the frequency of donations."
"The standards advocated by the Council seem a little too high to us and we would rather recommend those of the Council of Europe."
"This is covered by Amendment Nos 24 and 25."
"In conclusion, Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the important questions we have raised, we advocate voting for this recommendation and our amendments."
"This text will undoubtedly contribute to greater safety in blood transfusions which, without reducing the risk to zero, will enable patients within the European Union to benefit from the lifesaving support of a blood transfusion when they need to."
"Madam President, I support and, indeed, salute Mr Cabrol for the breadth of experience, knowledge and compassion that he has always brought to this subject."
"I am speaking on behalf of our shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Needle, who cannot be with us, courtesy of Air France, who have done their best this week to make this a shadow Parliament."
"All of us here want to see a speedy passage for this Council recommendation. my group is concerned that the proposal before us has no binding force."
"We look to the Council of Health Ministers on 30 April."
"In Amendment No 17 we call on the Member States to work together and with the Commission on binding legislation by the end of this year, and certainly no later than 1999."
"The Commissioner will know of the concern in my country, and probably in his also, at the danger, however remote, posed by new variant CJD in the matter of blood plasma products."
"We are deeply concerned that there should be a field of safety and of common practices throughout the European Union in the matter of blood products and their safety."
"My own view, and that of my group, on this is that, whilst the emphasis put on donor selection and the appropriate testing of donations is fairly adequate - and it has been outlined by Mr Cabrol in his remarks - we still need to look very carefully at the monitoring of recipients of blood transfusions."
"We need to be certain that throughout the Community the same measures are in effect, the same points of contact are available and information is wisely considered, assessed and shared."
"One thing that concerns my group very greatly is the issue of voluntary donations, and here I agree with Mr Cabrol."
"It seems to me wrong that we should be legislating here on the basis that there is not a marked distinction between voluntary donations and paid donations."
"We may be a single market but there is not a market in blood: there is a community in blood."
"We are in the most literal sense blood brothers and blood sisters."
"The book that has most influenced my life is that by Professor Richard Titmus called 'The Gift Relationship' , which sets out how much the principle of altruism relates to the giving of blood."
"We should do nothing in the course of this legislation that makes it harder for people to offer this most precious of donations. But we should also do nothing that makes it harder for us to trace those who, for whatever reason, might spread an infection and endanger others."
"We are wholly in support of Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 18, tabled by Mr Cabrol, and those on the issue of voluntary donation, which have been tabled by my group."
"One last word on Amendment No 29: we need to draw a distinction between unsafe practices between men and any sexual practices between men."
"There are many unsafe sexual practices between the sexes, as well as between men, and we should not stigmatize the entire gay community in what we say tonight."
"Madam President, I think we all agree that this proposal is aimed at establishing a Community strategy to improve confidence in the safety of the blood transfusion process."
"And it is not a new proposal, since we already have an excellent directive from 1989, which provided for quality, security and effectiveness in terms of medical products derived from plasma."
"However, we must not forget that the Convention on European Pharmacopoeia, with an excellent technical monograph, has also been ratified."
"Therefore, this proposal contributes by giving more security to the entire process. For that reason we give our full support to Professor Cabrol's report, to which he has imparted the best of his knowledge and professional authority."
"However, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has approved several amendments to which I would like to draw the attention of the European Commission since, if they are approved, they would actually distort the proposal and the Community law which is currently in force."
"I will look firstly at the reference to the Council of Europe's recommendation."
"It is not that I disagree with it, but there is an accepted Court of Justice doctrine that we should not make cross-references since they are based on different legislation and we would therefore lose legal security."
"Secondly, Amendment No 14 refers to the establishment of the legal principle of voluntary and unpaid donations of blood or plasma."
"But talking about the legal principle seems to me to be truly absurd."
"As a political objective we should move towards self-sufficiency, but establishing a legal principle, if we realize what we are talking about, is unacceptable."
"Maybe I should explain in this Parliament that the Community institutions all agree that every policy should be directed towards achieving full employment. But establishing the legal principle of full employment in the European Union would be truly absurd, despite the fact that we all want to see this objective realized."
"Confusing a political orientation of an ethical nature with a legal principle is a legal aberration which should not be brought about by any report from this Parliament."
"I would draw the attention of the European Commission to this question so that, although it is proposed here, it acts as a sort of filter, it carries out a reasonable job - as the European Commission usually does - and does away with this reference."
"In the same way, I cannot accept the attempt to apply the same principles and demands to blood and products derived from it."
"I would not need to provide any example here but blood does in fact undergo a determined treatment, while derived products are treated completely differently."
"I trust in the European Commission's good judgement to ensure that these amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment are properly done away with and that they are not taken into account."
"The original proposal would be thus much better with the amendments tabled, which are also original, from Professor Cabrol."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the safety of donated blood is a matter of life and death."
"That is why the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party supports the request by the rapporteur for binding legislation towards the end of next year on blood products, donated blood and blood plasma."
"On behalf of my group, and of my colleague Mr Eisma who is not able to be present here tonight, I would like to draw attention to the following points."
"First of all, we wish to underline that blood should be donated on a voluntary basis, and that donating blood should therefore be unpaid."
"It is vital that the principles recommended by the World Health Organization, namely that donations should be unpaid, voluntary and anonymous, are implemented by the Member States in cases of medical intervention to the human body."
"This has not been expressed clearly enough in the proposal, which is why we fully support Amendment Nos 14 and 18 which deal with this issue in greater depth."
"Moreover, we consider it extremely important for health reasons that the amount of blood a donor is allowed to give per session is reduced from 800 to 650 millilitres."
"Finally, we do not wish to refuse people giving blood purely on the basis of their sexual orientation."
"We think it is essential that all applicant donors are fully aware of the risk that donated blood and plasma can transmit contagious diseases."
"But it would be a form of discrimination to exclude a priori all homosexuals."
"Homosexuals might only pose a risk when they engage in unsafe sexual practices."
"I ask you to support the Liberal Group's Amendment No 29 which deals with this subject, and consequently not to consider this group amongst the excluded groups in Appendix 5."
"Madam President, Commissioner, our group is in complete agreement with Professor Cabrol's report on the Council's proposal on the suitability of blood and plasma donors."
"We also agree with the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"We would like to highlight three issues which have been sufficiently discussed: confidentiality and respect for donors, regardless of any stigma; the need to create a central identification service in Europe - as already pointed out in other epidemiological reports; and the adoption of all the precautions necessary to avoid the transmission of diseases or new risks."
"Nevertheless, there are other aspects which we would like to underline. Firstly, the maximum quantity to be donated should be the same, independent of weight, since volume of blood and body mass are two different things, and there is no direct relation between the two quantities."
"Secondly, in our view, it is very important that donations are voluntary since we must remember that AIDS in fact originated in North America due to the abuse of trade in blood from Haiti."
"Madam President, faced with the dangers of using blood and blood products, one necessity alone should guide all our actions and attitudes: the safety of the sick and wounded."
"This is based on two factors: the competence of the doctor providing the transfusion and the quality of the transfused product."
"To treat the issue lightly, or to content oneself with an approximation on the subject is a criminal attitude which has already causes dozens and dozens of deaths, not only in France, I am told."
"However, the text proposed to us by the Commission seems to contain, alongside sound demands, some outrageous remarks which I was surprised had got this far without being noticed."
"The fact that it is considered far more dangerous to have a sexual encounter in Pretoria than in Bangkok leaves me truly confused."
"On the other hand, it is a little ridiculous to make no mention of whether sexual relations are protected or not, whilst male homosexuality is rejected as a whole regardless of the methods practised when it relates to blood donations."
"On the other hand, it seems inappropriate to become alarmed when the possibility of setting up a circle of transfusion centres or of tying them into a central body is considered, for in each of our countries national blood transfusion centres collect perfectly confidential statistics, which are coded and permit traceability."
"I would like to indicate finally, Madam President, that the centralization of information at European level would seem to be as safe as that at national level - I say that for the benefit of certain worried people, particularly in my country where, as everyone knows, harmful political forces are developing."
"Madam President, it is impossible to imagine modern medicine without blood donation."
"It saves lives."
"Yet there will also be risks attached to transfusions."
"These risks should be limited as far as possible, and that is what this proposal aims to do."
"Thankfully, we do not need to reinvent the wheel in Europe as far as blood screening is concerned."
"Much important work has been carried out by the Council of Europe."
"A reference to the recommendations made by the Council of Europe is therefore in order, and I wholeheartedly endorse Amendment No 1."
"But there are two things I would like to draw your attention to."
"Firstly, I believe that in principle, donations must remain voluntary."
"A paid donation is essentially no longer a real donation, because a quid pro quo in the shape of money is expected."
"This is a step back."
"Neither for the donor, nor for safety is it desirable that blood or blood products are donated for money."
"There will be an increased chance of less safe donors coming forward, and the aspect of solidarity with one's fellow human beings will be lost."
"Secondly, I would like to add a little explanation to the amendments I have tabled."
"In my amendments I point to the ISBT 128 system for the identification of donated blood."
"ISBT stands for International Society for Blood Transfusion."
"It is a recognized body in the world of blood transfusion."
"The system I have just referred to amounts to a standardized, personal identification code which is allocated to each blood donation."
"This system is recognized by the United States, Canada, and a number of European countries."
"It would be obvious to choose this as the general standard for Europe."
"Lastly, I would like to say something about safety."
"I see the enclosed survey as an extremely important selection mechanism for donors."
"The questions about sexual behaviour may come across as a little inappropriate, but we all know that certain types of sexual behaviour are more dangerous than others."
"As long as the responses are well protected, this should not present any problems."
"The safety of the people at the receiving end is more important in this case."
"Finally, a word of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Cabrol."
"It is an excellent report."
"Madam President, I ask for your indulgence in advance because I wish to take a few moments longer than anticipated as I want to deal with a lot of the amendments which are extremely important for blood and blood safety in the Community."
"Parliament has voiced its concern in several reports and resolutions about the safety of blood and blood products and the attainment of self-sufficiency in the Community, and the Commission welcomes the committee's report this evening."
"Parliament has noted that the recommendation is a logical sequel to the Commission's communication presented on blood safety and selfsufficiency."
"It correctly pointed out that only the first two activities, that is donor suitability and screening of donations, were addressed."
"These are the very first two phases in the blood transfusion chain."
"The Commission considers it sensible first to focus on them."
"But I can assure the honourable Members that steps are already under way to address the other identified activities in the development of the blood strategy."
"I wish to thank Mr Cabrol for his contribution and also those others who have contributed this evening."
"With regard to the amendments proposed by Parliament, the Commission is prepared to accept fully Amendments Nos 5, part b. of 13, and 23, and to accept partially Amendment No 2 - which requires some editing; No 9, the intention of which is acceptable but will require the establishment of common criteria for the parameters to be collected that are comparable throughout the Community;"
"No 10, the wording of which will have to reflect the fact that much of current practice is experience - rather than evidence-based - and efforts will need to be promoted to obtain good scientific evidence here; No 11: the intention here should be to have a unique coding system with relevant information communicated to all Member States and to the Commission and not a unique and common code; part of No 15: editing here too should reflect that although the risk is still theoretical, appropriate measures need to be taken to minimize any hazard associated with possible transmission of new variant CJD via blood components and manufactured plasma derivatives."
"The Commission proposed such measures in its prospective donor deferral criteria."
"Part of No 16: we have to reflect here the need for common parameters at Community level and for the collection of epidemiological data."
"Part of No 19: rewording is necessary here due to potential legal difficulties with the term 'partner' , which must be linked to legal and administrative provisions in the Member States."
"Part of No 20: although acceptable from the aspect of travel outside the European Union, it goes beyond the Commission's intention of recommending Member States to pose certain questions and should, therefore, I suggest, be reformulated."
"Part of No 21, which exceeds the Commission's intention of proposing that Member States pose questions if they so wish."
"There are some additional amendments as well - Nos 27 and 28 - and that is dealt with under Amendment No 11; and No 29, which is acceptable."
"We would like to think a little further about the actual wording there."
"The Commission finds the following amendments unacceptable."
"I would like to go through them very quickly."
"Amendment No 1: it is important to recall that in adopting Directive 89/381/EEC, which governs the placing on the market of medicinal products made from human blood and plasma, the Council agreed that Member States should encourage the voluntary and unpaid donations of blood and plasma as the starting material for the manufacture of medicinal products."
"There is, however, no definition of such donations in the directive, and significant differences exist among the Member States as to what it really means in practice."
"The definition of voluntary non-remunerative donation adopted by the Council of Europe is much more restrictive than what applies in most Member States and strict adherence to it in the Community may have an adverse affect on supplies."
"Amendment No 3."
"Because the Commission considers that measures to be introduced at Community level should take into account, in addition to those of the Council Europe, national and international standards, guidelines and recommendations including those of the WHO and our major partners such as those in the Food and Drug Administration of the United States."
"You must remember that considerable volumes of plasma and plasma products are used in the Community which originate in the United States."
"The Commission considers therefore that any reference to international standards should be as general as possible."
"Amendment No 4 which is unacceptable as written because the concern is not at the risk of new variant CJD to blood products but the still theoretical risk, not yet scientifically proven, that new variant CJD could be transmitted by them."
"The use of plasma as an excipient in medicinal products coming from countries which have had no confirmed cases of new variant CJD is a recommended precautionary measure and the wording used of 'imported blood between Member States' is totally lacking in clarity, I suggest."
"Amendment No 6 would only lead to some confusion and final medicinal products like plasma derivatives, derived from blood and plasma, can already move freely in the internal market, as long as they meet requirements of quality, safety and efficacy and therefore may be shared with other Member States."
"But the difficulty arises when labile components, for example red blood cells, platelets or plasma prior to fractionation, are prevented from being shared with other Member States."
"Amendment No 7 is unacceptable as it implies that there are Member States that are not responsible for collecting blood and plasma, which of course is not the case in reality."
"The second amendment is also unacceptable because many donors do not wish to be in registers and we have to bear that in mind."
"Amendment No 8 is similar to Amendment No 7 and while a common donor identification and registration system is certainly the ideal, donors themselves, on whom the entire blood transfusion chain is dependent, are reluctant to be even on national registers and a single donor identification and registration system common to all Member States contradicts the Commission proposal for a mutually compatible system."
"Amendment No 13 is unacceptable because the Commission uses the word 'blood' in its generic sense."
"With regard to 9c, whether the plasma is recovered from a whole blood donation or is collected through the process of plasmapheresis, it is a sample of the donor's blood taken at the time of donation that is tested, not the plasma."
"As far as Amendment No 14 is concerned, Directive 89/381 requires Member States to promote voluntary, unpaid donations for plasma used as source material for medicinal products."
"The exact wording must be maintained here."
"Amendment No 17: first we oppose it because it is necessary to clarify what is meant by 'blood products' ."
"The labile components that do not come under Community legislation and the plasma-derived products must adhere to existing pharmaceutical legislation in respect of quality, safety and efficacy."
"Now with regard to the labile components, there is no legal basis for the Community to introduce binding legislation and Article 129 only provides for recommendations or incentive measures but excludes, of course, harmonization. In future harmonization legislation might be possible if and when the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified."
"Amendment No 18: the definition of voluntary, non-remunerated donation of the Council of Europe is more restrictive than the term 'unpaid' as used in Directive 89/381, and there are significant variations in the Member States as to what constitutes such donations."
"Amendment No 24 regarding the proposed donation frequency stems from the implicit assumption by the authors that each and every donation is made at the maximum possible abstraction of blood volume."
"In Amendment No 25, the whole purpose of course of automated plasmapheresis is to arrive at volumes that may exceed 15 litres but in a way that is safe for the donor."
"Now finally may I take the opportunity to make a further comment on new variant CJD because Mr Whitehead brought it up specifically."
"For plasma-derived products the issue of the assessment of risk of new variant CJD in blood is under very close scrutiny by the Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products which advises the European Medicines Evaluation Agency in collaboration with the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee."
"The issue is also under discussion in the Scientific Advisory Committee on Medicinal Products."
"We are awaiting the advice of these bodies just now."
"With regard to blood for transfusion there is no legal recourse, under Article 129, for us to take any action apart from non-binding recommendations."
"As I said earlier, we have already done this."
"As Members will be aware, this is the first proposal for a Council recommendation from the Commission under Article 129 of the Treaty."
"The Commission took the decision that you should be fully consulted even though some Member States in the Council had some initial hesitation, given that there is no formal requirement to do so under Article 129."
"Mr Cabrol's report confirms to me that the Commission was right to do so."
"I want to put it on record for you, Mr Cabrol, and for your colleagues, that I will insist that you continue to be consulted on all future recommendations under Article 129."
"Parliament must have the opportunity to actively contribute to recommendations with a bearing on public health."
"The Commission considers that this recommendation is a major step along the road to giving effect to the Community blood strategy that the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament helped to put in place in the years 1994 to 1996."
"I regret the length of my reply, but this is a vitally important matter for all citizens of the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"1999 budget procedure - Adjustment of the financial perspective"
"Madam President, since we are having a debate on three reports together, and I am the rapporteur for two of them, we will look firstly at the motion for a resolution which, at first glance, is more technical; that is, the report on the adjustment of the financial perspective, after the technical adjustment, to take account of the conditions of implementation."
"I will then go on to look at the guidelines for the 1999 budget procedure in - if you do not mind - a lighter tone to make these late hours somewhat more agreeable."
"The process of adjusting the financial perspective to take account of the conditions of implementation refers to the transfer of appropriations for commitments that were not implemented in the previous year from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to the new budget year and to the appropriations for payments. This would guarantee, when necessary, as stated in the Interinstitutional Agreement, an orderly progression in relation to the appropriations for commitments."
"This year, we must take account of the fact that the adjustment is different from that of previous years, since 1999 is the last year of both the financial perspective and the Structural Fund programming period."
"And this has led to the Commission transferring all the unused appropriations from 1997 to 1999."
"Taking all this into consideration, and looking at the conditions for implementation in accordance with paragraph 10 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, the Commission proposes transferring to the 1999 budget ECU 1 433 million which were unused for the Structural Funds in 1997, and ECU 101 million of appropriations for commitments unused for the Cohesion Fund in the same year; in other words, a total of ECU 1 534 million."
"Taking into account previous adjustment decisions, we find ourselves with an increase in the Category 2 ceiling of approximately 18 % in relation to the 1998 budget."
"Until now the Commission proposal has strictly adhered to paragraph 10 of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Nevertheless, this is not the case as regards the proposal on adjusting the appropriations for payments. In this respect, the Commission adopts a position contrary to the strict application of the financial perspective provided for in paragraph 10 of the Agreement, since it proposes no increase in the ceiling for appropriations for payments, on the grounds that it will be perfectly possible to face up to requirements."
"Although I know fully well that an adjustment in the appropriations for payments is not limited to Category 2, I believe that the ceiling for appropriations for payments is underestimated and that the increase in Category 2 for 1999 will worsen to an even greater degree the proportion between the appropriations for commitments and the appropriations for payments."
"In its arguments concerning the appropriations for payments, the Commission constantly makes reference to the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"At one point, it even states that additional payments might have been made to the value of ECU 1 000 million above the appropriations for payments provided for in the budget for 1997."
"It is at the least surprising that the Commission proposes not to increase the ceiling for the appropriations for payments."
"I believe that the Commission is combining two procedures: on the one hand, the financial perspective, which is a framework in itself; and on the other hand, the 1999 budget, which sets out the estimated actual requirements."
"I would insist that we keep these two procedures separate and consequently call for the overall ceiling for the appropriations for payments to be raised by ECU 300 million."
"It remains to be seen whether the Council will accept this."
"If it does not, there will be a new tripartite dialogue before the presentation of the draft budget."
"Having said this, I will move on to a more light-hearted consideration of the guidelines for the 1999 budget procedure."
"Since I have been a member of the Committee on Culture, I am taking this poetic licence."
"I do not think I am being original when I say that politics is the art of the possible."
"The budget is, in fact, the practical concretion of the principles of every Community policy that we debate and approve in this House."
"Making policies always involves making decisions."
"We will have to adhere to these guidelines which we are going to approve throughout the entire budget procedure which I hope - since we are now in spring - turns out to be a bed of roses, rather than a calvary, despite the fact that we are about to enter Holy Week."
"We are therefore now going to approve certain guidelines rather than going into the financial aspects at the moment."
"Eventually, when the Council's first reading has taken place, it will be time to earmark a total figure for each heading and line."
"I have tried to make this report as brief as possible so that the political priorities can be clearly distinguished."
"I understand and am sorry about the fact that the views of certain committees are not reflected but I would thank them all for having made it possible to have clear and concise guidelines."
"If we had done otherwise we would now find ourselves with a telephone directory which would prevent us from separating the wheat from the chaff."
"As rapporteur, I have taken on board all the opinions of the committees except, of course, those which would contradict the resolution being approved."
"The report aims to present the 1999 budget as a bridging budget between the financial perspective which is ending and that which we are discussing."
"Since that year marks the end of the current financial perspective and the beginning of the consideration of the new one, with the debate on Agenda 2000, this budget not only brings to a close an era, but also must be considered as a ""bridging budget' towards the future."
"The millennium is ending and we have the honour of witnessing a historic change in our continent."
"This will also be the first budget denominated in euros, our common currency, which will unite Europeans even further and which will promote economic growth."
"In the medium term, we will see the enlargement of the European Union to include countries which were always European."
"In addition, the Union will have to continue with its objective of economic and social cohesion because it is necessary to have solidarity between the regions, so that economic development and the new technologies do not lead to an increase in the differences between the rich and the poor."
"We want to draw up a budget with its own meaning for 1999; a budget for the people and one which can respond to their expectations of the European Union."
"This does not simply involve determining income and expenditure, but it must also be able to sound out the opinion of a political union in a changing world."
"European citizens, through the Member States, have transferred authority to the Union, including part of their sovereignty, so that we can thus meet their needs more successfully."
"In this respect, the report refers to Article F.3 of the Treaty which states that ""the Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies' ."
"Therefore, the Union's budget should be distinct from, and complement the budgets of, the Member States."
"The EU budget and those of the Members States are not comparable since the tasks and perspectives of each one are different, as is their method of facing up to common challenges and problems affecting the citizens."
"In order to fulfill its task, the Union must have an influence on those aspects where there is, let us say, a ""European Value Added' which justifies strengthened action on the part of the Union."
"In addition, we must note that the European Parliament has acted and cooperated responsibly in recent financial years in order to ease the path towards convergence for the Member States."
"And it will continue to do so, although it will not lose sight of the budget's political significance."
"Parliament is in favour of rigour, in the sense of a more efficient and rational use of financial resources."
"I do not want to wave the teacher's stick, but I must in order to reprimand the Council and the Member States for not having done their work, since in order to fulfill the commitments made at Edinburgh concerning the package for Structural Funds, and at Cannes, for the PHARE programme, this 1999 budget must face increases estimated at around 18 % for Category 2 appropriations and 36 % for Category 4."
"Moreover, we must condemn the scandalously inadequate implementation of the Structural Funds in certain Member States."
"This does not represent a saving for the European Union, but a fraud against the citizens, who are deprived of European intervention which would help relieve their problems."
"Nevertheless, Parliament must be clear on the fact that, in the budget procedure, the Council is neither an enemy nor an adversary nor a rival."
"We should not mistake this for a war."
"The Parliament and the Council share piano and stool in playing a ""duet' ."
"We need loyalty in the interinstitutional dialogue through which the two branches of the budgetary authority come to agreement on the score."
"Among the main tasks of the melody to be interpreted are the priorities established in paragraph 3 of the report: the creation of employment through investment in infrastructure and research and development; support for small and medium-sized enterprises; and measures to combat youth unemployment."
"We also want to develop the concept of the Europe of knowledge which encompasses education and training as well as research and development."
"There is no doubt that Europe's greatest potential is in its people, in the human value of the Europeans raised in an age-old society."
"In the same way, the 1999 budget must pay careful attention to the environment, in accordance with the commitments made at the Kyoto Conference."
"I will now conclude my speech, ladies and gentlemen."
"Music has always united our countries, overcoming all sorts of frontiers and barriers."
"I hope that the genius of our great composers enlightens us and that Parliament and the Council can emulate Arthur Rubinstein in the interpretation of this ""suite' which is now beginning."
"Madam President, I would like to begin my speech regarding the sections of the other institutions by firstly stating my satisfaction at the decision taken by the Presidency, which adopted the preliminary draft budget yesterday."
"This enables us to observe the timetable we set ourselves in committee, and observe the tighter deadlines we have this year, which could allow us to begin the budgetary conciliation procedure with the Council on 17 June, as planned."
"I also hope that this year the budgetary conciliation with the Council will take place in the same spirit of reciprocal cooperation that meant that last year we avoided a second reading."
"I will now look at the figures in heading 5, administrative expenditure."
"The forecasts indicate a 4 % increase, that is, ECU 182 million, compared with last year."
"This means for example that for the European Parliament, as 20 % is allocated to Parliament, a margin of ECU 36 million."
"For Parliament, but for the other institutions as well, this margin is obviously not a cost objective, but a cost ceiling."
"This is because we cannot ask for less rigour for ourselves than that imposed on all the Member States at this particular time."
"One of the lines I have indicated, with the consent of the Committee on Budgets in these guidelines, concerns firstly changing the nomenclature; this is a requirement laid down by Article 19 of the Financial Regulation, which talks of harmonizing the nomenclature."
"This will necessarily lead to greater facility in reading the budget and a greater transparency in it."
"Here too, I have to give credit to Parliament for conforming to the decision taken by the Committee on Budgets, which goes back to the previous year, in the budget adopted yesterday to which this new nomenclature we had hoped for is appended."
"The other guideline relates to the increase in the staffing structure, which in principle should be based on the anticipated rigour that applies to all the institutions."
"Obviously, this cannot happen unless we do not have to provide for necessary and justified requirements which can arise in the various institutions, such as requirements connected with negotiating the enlargement."
"We would like similar supporting documentation to revalue jobs, and I have asked all the institutions to provide information on the measures concerning the reorganization of labour and concerning mobility, on vacancies arising as a result of retirement, disablement or sickness, on recourse to auxiliary agents and even on recourse to interinstitutional competitions and the list of jobs that will be vacant in 1999."
"I have also confirmed the decisions taken by the European Parliament on its property programme and on exercise of the purchase option, on the transfer with regard to the property of the Court of Justice, on dealing with the problems of asbestos to be eliminated from its properties and the fitting-out of premises for the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee."
"In this connection, I wish to say that I consider it essential, before the conclusion of this budget procedure, to include a definitive solution for these two institutions, indicating specific times, costs and their final establishment."
"I appreciate the decision of the Presidency to avoid following up the onerous request to build a new hemicycle in the building in rue Belliard, that would have cost at least ECU 16 million."
"The Presidency has decided to make one of Parliament's rooms available to the committees, following their transfer, to be used as a hemicycle."
"The first reading will obviously deal with the results of the implementation of the previous budget."
"Finally, a further guideline for all the institutions is the preparation of a detailed report, supplemented by the timetable on the consequences of the introduction of the euro for each institution and the computer problems for the year 2000."
"To conclude, Mr President, I hope that, in continuing their work, all the institutions will show a sense of responsibility according to the current experiences of the EU and the Member States, on the example of that unfortunately shown yesterday by the Presidency of this Parliament which limited the increase to 0.64 % compared with the previous year, well below the objective of a 2.5 % increase fixed by the Commission for administrative expenditure."
"Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the budget for 1999, I greatly appreciated the fact that the general rapporteur, Mrs Dührkop, had started to consult the different sectors, in particular the agricultural sector, at a very early stage."
"Both the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are determined to continue the procedure followed for the 1998 budget as far as agricultural expenditure is concerned."
"It is important that this procedure, which in the meantime has been christened the ""Tillich-Mulder' procedure, is also adopted by the Commission and the Council in equally positive terms."
"The precise description of this procedure can be found in the working document of the Committee on Budgets, namely Working Document 12 of 2 February this year."
"As far as the report at hand is concerned, I contributed to the more precise wording of paragraph 13 on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Three points are emphasized in this paragraph."
"The total figure set by the Commission for Category 1 in its draft budget, should not be taken as a ceiling."
"This figure may be based on possible estimates, but these have no normative character as such."
"The final figure in this budget category should continue to be adjusted for as long as possible on the basis of more current expenditure estimates, in other words, right up until the second reading."
"A possible amendment for the Council and the Commission will then be a rather binding guideline."
"Should cuts be necessary in the meantime, these should be made selectively for certain budget items, which must be looked at anew, and not across the board."
"Finally, the problem of the reserve should be further clarified."
"In the area of agriculture, where more clear-cut estimates will made in future, a reserve provided for by resources, is essential."
"The reserve system which will have to be drafted in general terms could be used to fall back on in part, but general uniformity would sell short the specific character of the agricultural budget."
"This clear method of approach guarantees a good basis for an effective agricultural budget policy, and gives Parliament a bigger involvement in the agricultural expenses than has been the case for many years, an experience which will be valued by the Commission and, hopefully, by the Council."
"Madam President, in the budget for 1999 we are not just preparing for a new millennium, but we are also laying the foundation stone for the greatest challenges to European integration for many years."
"Since the announcement from the Commission and the European Monetary Institute about monetary union, we now have fairly precise information about the timetable for a common currency as well as its prospects and the risks involved."
"The continuation of the information campaign about the introduction of the euro remains an important matter, to prepare the European population fully for the conversion, because in this field we can look very positively into the future."
"On the other hand we are already setting course for the ambitious project of expansion to the east in the next millennium."
"There is much for us to do there, too."
"So we must strive to accelerate further the completion of the internal market, to remove existing obstacles from our path."
"We should therefore pay special attention to suitable measures such as the action plan for the internal market."
"We must also strengthen the trust of the citizens in the problem-solving skills of the European Union."
"This includes, above all, the ambitious driving forward of the employment initiative, on which we decided last year."
"I would like to point out once again the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in creating jobs."
"We have already heard this week that the measures to support small and medium-sized enterprises which have been provided are now almost too numerous to count."
"Yet the resources are apparently far from exhausted in many fields."
"We therefore need a comprehensive, precise evaluation by the Commission, so that suitable measures can be carried out within the next budget plan, and so that the efficiency of support for small and medium-sized enterprises can be effectively increased."
"One more thing must be clear to us in this context."
"The most effective support for companies is the kind which from the outset leaves the resources and effort in the companies."
"Therefore, in the budget procedure, we should conform exactly to the principles of SLIM legislation, that is of a SLIM initiative, on which we have already voted today in this House, or to general bench marking."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy has naturally considered in detail the guidelines for the 1999 budget."
"There are two particular subjects which we regard as particularly urgent."
"They are, first, the transition from the fourth to the fifth research framework programme, and second, in the field of energy policy, the conversion of the Kyoto decisions into a clear policy of the European Union."
"First I would like to thank the rapporteur for including both subjects in the guidelines."
"We are conscious of this honour, because not every committee manages to have its subjects included in the guidelines."
"On the other hand, the rapporteur promised us that in a kind of new Dührkop Dührkop procedure all opinions of the committees would be included in the decision."
"Unfortunately that was rejected by the Committee on Budgets."
"We regret that very much, Mrs Müller, because we are already conscious of the problems regarding the financial resources of the fifth research framework programme, and because we also know that, in particular, the question of how we are to handle the year 1999 in terms of budget policy is not altogether easy to answer."
"It would have been very sensible if the Committee on Budgets had accepted the proposals of the Research Committee, so that, in particular, we can manage the transition next year in an orderly fashion."
"We hope that during the first reading more precise numbers will be available, including those from the Council, so that we can make progress in providing financial resources to the specific programmes."
"Regarding energy policy, there is an urgent need to act at European level."
"I do not think that the statements in the guidelines do justice to this problem."
"We hope that at first reading, which we as a committee will follow very closely, we shall succeed in getting support for our concerns, even in the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, the 1999 budget exercise is getting under way in an atmosphere of serenity and interinstitutional cooperation."
"There are encouraging signs that it will live up to the great challenges of the Union: employment creation, Economic and Monetary Union and the preparation of enlargement."
"In 1999 Economic and Monetary Union will enter into its third stage."
"The recent reports and the reactions have underlined the continuing determination of the Member States to improve the health of their public finances."
"This climate of budgetary rigour cannot be ignored at Community level either."
"The guidelines concerning the Community budget for 1999 show that all institutions are ready to assume their responsibilities in this respect."
"Bringing the increase of payment appropriations roughly in line with the growth of national budgets - as proposed by Barbara Dührkop Dührkop - indicates a very responsible approach by the European Parliament."
"Within a rigorous setting, the 1999 budget must meet the obligations of the Union and focus on growth and employment creation."
"With regard to agricultural expenditure, the Commission expects - for the time being - credit requirements at the level of the 1998 budget."
"Should these forecasts change significantly during the year, the Commission will follow the successful procedure last year and submit a late rectifying letter."
"I take note of this procedure - it is called the Tillich-Mulder procedure in your report."
"For the structural actions, 1999 marks the end of the current programming period."
"The tentative agreement at the budgetary trialogue yesterday to increase the ceiling of category 2 by EURO 1534 million in commitments and the overall ceiling for payments by EURO 300 million paves the way for correct conclusion of this programme."
"For internal policies, the institutions should jointly underline the efforts to contribute to growth and employment creation: the fifth research framework programme - for which a satisfactory agreement must be found well before the end of the year - the reinforcement of the Trans-European networks and the 'employment and growth initiative' are the principal priorities in this respect."
"It is a three-year programme and should therefore continue to be the focus for the 1999 and 2000 budgets."
"On external action, the particular emphasis will be the transformation of PHARE into an effective pre-accession instrument."
"The Commission will propose reinforcing PHARE by ECU 150 million in a supplementary and amending budget for 1998 to bring its multi-annual envelope into line with the decisions of the Cannes summit."
"Naturally, this proposal will have to be accompanied by a detailed assessment of the scope for implementation."
"On these elements there seems to be a convergence of views among the institutions."
"It is also encouraging that yesterday's budgetary trialogue agreed to relaunch discussions on the question of 'legal bases' at a technical level."
"It is in this framework that the Commission will discuss and adopt the preliminary draft budget for 1999 at the end of this month."
"I have every hope that the reinforced interinstitutional cooperation which has permitted a successful 1998 budget will again bear fruit for the next year."
"This would then perfectly set the tone for the next interinstitutional agreement which we should discuss in the months to come."
"Madam President, if Mrs Dührkop Dührkop can wax lyrical at this late hour I am sure you will allow me a little bit of levity if I say first of all that Commissioner Liikanen has virtually stolen my speech."
"He said the things that I was going to say and when he began by saying that this is a budget which is surrounded by serenity, following Barbara Dührkop's analogy with playing a piano. I am reminded of Eric Morecambe, the great comedian from the UK who is now dead."
"There was a sketch where Eric Morecambe is playing and is making a real honky-tonk noise."
"It sounds absolutely awful and André Previn says, ' you are playing all the wrong notes, ' and Eric says, ' I am playing the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order.' That has always seemed to be the way we have done the budget in the past, and Barbara's analogy with playing a piano is not too far out, because this year is different."
"I said it when Helen Liddell first came to the Budgets meeting."
"We do not deal with the Commission like this - we even had a Scots interpreter in the English language booth doing it with a Scots accent for Helen Liddell."
"It seems that everything is going so well and that is good."
"I think it shows the partnership that is being developed and a maturity towards the budget from the three institutions involved."
"On Mr Viola's report, I think we have to say that the fact that it is unamended and went through Committee unamended shows the consensus from all the groups as far as these guidelines are concerned - what we expect from the budgets of the other institutions."
"We congratulate Mr Viola on the work he has done and we hope that consistency will continue as we go through the year."
"On the Dührkop report on the adjustment of the financial perspective, the trialogue which occurred earlier this week, as Commissioner Liikanen said, has been extremely fruitful, carried out in an atmosphere of cooperation where the three institutions want to get a settlement."
"It is not an adversarial situation where we are trying to score points off one another; instead we are actually trying to get a budget which we can all agree to and this adjustment of the financial perspective."
"One hopes that when Mrs Liddell goes to the Council she can come back and report to Parliament that the additional resources that have been provisionally agreed can be agreed in total."
"It would be a major achievement if we could see that."
"On the main report, the political group which I represent as coordinator supports it throughout - to such an extent that we wanted it to be kept, like Mrs Dührkop's, as short as possible."
"As to the amendments which have been proposed, we agreed last week not to support any amendments, and I say this mainly for colleagues like Mr Brinkhorst."
"We see nothing wrong with his Amendment No 1, but we actually think it is better placed within the first reading."
"On this occasion we would not be inclined to support it."
"Having said that, several of my colleagues see no reason why we should not support it, and I remain to be persuaded that we should support it between now and voting time tomorrow; so do not give up hope yet, Mr Brinkhorst."
"If we do vote against, let me make it clear that it will not be because we disagree with the content of that report, but because we took a stand to keep this report as short as possible."
"We can apply that to many other amendments, but please try to understand that it is not for dogmatic reasons, it really is a matter of simplicity."
"It is a budget, as Commissioner Liikanen said, of prudence: we use the terms 'a citizens' budget' and 'a taxpayers' budget' in the same sentence and I think that is what we are trying to achieve with these guidelines."
"When we look at the priorities, as far as our group is concerned the main priority is about job creation, about creation of employment; no matter how we do it, whether it be through infrastructure, whether it be through research and development, whether it be through support for small and medium enterprises."
"That is the thrust of our approach to this budget."
"We also support the phrase 'Europe of knowledge' which Mrs Dührkop has introduced - one would expect her to give priority to education and training, having known her for many years; and we would want to see European funds spent in the area of education and training and research and development. The thrust of the report you can find in paragraph 8, and I think we can give our full support to what it says there."
"At the end of the day it is about getting that agreement, about making sure that the three institutions are working together."
"And who knows, at this rate we may end up with one reading of the budget."
"Oh that it were so!"
"Madam President, I would like to state that I agree with the budgetary guidelines contained in Mrs Dührkop Dührkop's report."
"This agreement indicates that, apart from the discrepancies in terms of economic policies, there is a common concern among the groups of this House as regards European problems in fighting unemployment and strengthening the European dimension of the Community budget."
"It is hoped that the 1999 budget procedure will maintain a similar procedural basis and form as that used in 1998, when the European Parliament was able to defend its own priorities before the Council, thereby achieving the extension of the ad hoc procedure including that of the late rectifying letter to the PDB, not to mention the almost unanimous commitment of this House to defend appropriations earmarked in the PDB for the Structural Funds in Category 2."
"It is true that this year the process is even more complex since it marks both the end of the current financial perspective and the beginning of Agenda 2000 and the problem of using up the remaining appropriations for commitments."
"Our opinion is that the appropriations provided for in Edinburgh for 1999 should be strictly respected, and among the existing alternatives we should choose that which guarantees that every last ecu available will be fully committed for the Structural Funds for Category 2."
"We will continue to show that the current financial perspective should be the basis for the next perspective, particularly as regards the percentage of own resources: taking 1.27 % as a base and not as a ceiling should be the financial expression of the European effort for enlargement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is a common link between this evening's discussion on the guidelines for the 1999 budget exercise and yesterday's debate on the procedure for discharge of the 1996 financial year which has of course not escaped you."
"The link is the importance recognized in the execution of the budget and the fight against fraud, whilst proposing to make the 1999 budget the ""taxpayer's' and the ""citizen's' budget."
"Indeed, having arrived at a crucial and decisive stage in its development, with the creation of the euro and the commencement of accession negotiations, Europe needs to be explained to its citizens and to be understood by them more than ever before."
"Europe can only be credible and can only inspire confidence if the tax payers' money is managed soundly."
"The rapporteur's second concern is to make the 1999 budget the budget of the people and on this point also, I like the sound of what she is saying."
"The public must be convinced that Europe is made for them and it seems to me extremely important to strengthen social and economic cohesion."
"Without this understanding they will end up punishing us, there is no doubt about this."
"More than a management budget or a simple ""bridging' budget, the 1999 budget could, above all, be a pivotal budget which will determine the conditions of the financial future of the European Union."
"With the new financial perspective, with a new interinstitutional agreement at the beginning of the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union and within the context of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the 1999 budget will be seen as a budget for revival, whilst at the same time taking up the already well known priorities which must be continued: budgetary action for jobs - a commitment in the 1998 budget gained support from the European Council of Luxembourg in November 1997 - priority to jobs through investment in infrastructure and research and development, support to SMEs, measures to combat youth unemployment, and to provide education and training for a ""Europe of knowledge' ."
"A pivotal budget, a revivalist budget, but a realistic budget as well, one which recognizes that the increase in appropriations for payment for 1999 must not surpass the average growth in Member States' budgets in relation to the 1998 budget, but within certain acceptable conditions such as respect for the Edinburgh objectives for Structural Funds."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union for Europe Group and I support the rapporteur's approach, and are convinced that the budget exercise will commence auspiciously well."
"Madam President, the significance of the debate on the budget at this stage is, as Commissioner Liikanen said, that it gives joint guidelines for the Commission in its forthcoming preliminary draft budget."
"From listening to the debate so far it seems that we are going to have a very easy ride."
"The Commissioner has pre-empted matters by referring to a number of points in Mrs Dührkop's report."
"During the life of this Parliament we have seen significant progress."
"When Parliament itself give clear and concise guidelines it will have an impact on the Commission's preliminary draft budget."
"I congratulate Mrs Dührkop for being very concise and having the courage to inject useful but limited guidelines on the number of sites."
"She has withstood the temptation of becoming a telephone directory, as she herself said."
"The ELDR largely share the priorities expressed in the House by many others."
"Let me just concentrate on one point raised by Mr Wynn, who was so kind as to say that the Socialist Group, having not finalized its view, still thought that for reasons of principle it should not vote for particular amendments which our group would like to put forward."
"I would hope that Mr Wynn could reconsider this point."
"It concerns the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"That Treaty will enter into force by 1999."
"It will be useful for the Commission to understand the signals from Parliament that it is already taking the view that the Schengen information system and Eurodac, which are key elements in transforming the first pillar into an area of freedom, security and justice will actually be incorporated."
"We hope, therefore, that you can go one step further so that we can give this guideline to the Commission to introduce it in the preliminary budget."
"Madam President, notwithstanding the serenity mentioned by Commissioner Liikanen, we are aware that the current budgetary process is particularly important and complex."
"It is the last of the present financial framework, and it also acts as a sort of bridge to the next framework, while some see it as the closing stage of a cycle."
"Mrs Barbara Dührkop, therefore, does not have an easy task."
"I sincerely hope that this is not the beginning of the calvary that she mentions in her statement."
"With regard to the report, I would like to begin by saying that we agreed with much of what it contains."
"It goes without saying that we identify with the priorities of employment, education, vocational training, environment, more intensive control of programmes and development policy."
"We welcome the clear request that, regarding Structural Funds, Edinburgh should be respected, and we draw attention to the importance accorded to monitoring execution and to the efficient use of funds."
"However, there are other points that we also consider to be important but on which we diverge."
"Firstly, we consider the pursuit of those priorities to be incompatible with the budgetary restraint that continues to be advocated."
"Such restraint is also, although not explicitly, a real priority of this as of previous budgets."
"But, in our view, it is not possible to fulfill the ambitious priorities listed with the limited means that will consequently be available to the Union."
"Moreover, we do not agree with the proposal contained in paragraph 10 of the report, despite the positive amendment already introduced at the suggestion of the rapporteur whereby this budget will cease to be the sole foundation and become one of the foundations of future financial perspectives."
"In this connection, we consider that the proposal of the Committee on Regional Policy, contained in the amendment relating to this point, is much more reasonable."
"Indeed, we do not understand how this budget can be even one of the foundations of future financial perspectives."
"As stated in the report, it may be a bridge, but not a foundation."
"The foundation for future financial perspectives can and should be confined to current financial perspectives."
"That is, moreover, consistent with what we earlier approved when we voted for the Colom i Naval report, specifically regarding the ceiling of 1.27 % or, more correctly, of 1.13 % of GNP for payments at the end of the period, as is proposed by the Commission."
"Meanwhile, and still on the same point, we have serious reservations regarding the creation of a preallocated reserve."
"We are in no doubt that the aim is to contain spending, since the creation of the reserve is explicitly connected with reducing the ""burden on taxpayers' ."
"However, the text does not clearly define either the mechanism whereby this objective is to be achieved, or even its practical consequences."
"In all events, we fear that it will certainly have the effect of negating the concept of Community funds as we understand them today."
"These are the reasons why we will vote for the report provided the proposal of the Committee on Regional Policy is approved."
"Madam President, I would first like to thank Mrs Dührkop and Mr Viola sincerely for their reports."
"I believe that they are balanced guidelines, and it seems particularly important to me that we should build a so-called bridging budget, which begins to mark out our vision for expansion in the years 2000 to 2006."
"I am particularly glad about the setting of priorities, and that the rapporteur has observed the canon of priorities so consistently, to give it special emphasis, and I am obviously in particular glad about the priority for the post-Kyoto process with the new budget for 1999, which allows us to make a decisive contribution."
"At this point I would like to announce to the rapporteur some fireworks, good proposals from my party, fireworks which on this occasion do not produce any CO2."
"I would like to make, on behalf of my party, proposals which aim at information campaigns to encourage the use of products whose manufacture uses little energy."
"I would like to promote restructuring in the research budget, modern energy-saving technologies which lead to a real breakthrough."
"I would like the rapporteur to promote pilot projects in the budget, heating insulation for private houses, offices and energy-intensive industries."
"And of course, particularly in view of the newcomers in the European Union, I would like to put through a realignment of the SAVE and ALTENER programmes."
"Last but not least, a million solar panels, a programme for the acceptance of photo-voltaics."
"I believe that if the rapporteur, as she has shown until now, is disposed to 'putting butter on the fish' , and to allowing the priorities to be followed by deeds, a real contribution to the post-Kyoto process can be made in the next budget."
"I hope so, and in this spirit I hope for continued good cooperation."
"Madam President, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, the new buildings in Brussels also created work, at least in Brussels."
"But I really wanted to say something about the 1999 budget: Commissioner, your speech was not bad, but the one which you made about the budget ratification was better, because you made it in French!"
"You yourself classified it as more sexy."
"As for the 1999 budget, I would like to make five points."
"First: the 1999 budget is a bridging budget, as Mrs Müller has already said, because no one can still be of the opinion that we can discuss the 1999 budget without bearing in mind that the new financial perspective for 2000 to 2006 is being dealt with simultaneously."
"Second: this means that we must come to terms with the difficulties that the 1999 budget has produced."
"No one can explain away the fact that an 18 % rate of growth in the appropriations for commitments for Structural Funds is of a dimension which is beyond the discussions and the possibilities of a budget discussion."
"I would like to quote a sentence: ' This is not of this world.'"
"It is appropriate here if people believe, as someone once wrote in Edinburgh, that the matter can simply be prolonged."
"Third: in the case of the foreign policy programmes, we have a spending situation which is equally haywire."
"If resources of ECU 2 300 000 000 were not committed and ECU 3 200 000 000 were not paid out within the PHARE programme alone, it must be clearly said that in 1999 it makes no sense to increase the PHARE programme by 36 %, only to put into the budget cashbox money which was deducted from other foreign policies by 10 % reductions."
"Projects in South Africa, South America and Asia, and all sorts of NGO programmes, are suffering as a result, just to present something which actually will not happen in the budget year."
"These are the problems which confront us when we discuss the 1999 budget."
"We have, that is Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has found a formulation in paragraph 8 of her guidelines, in which, as never before in this House, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, she states in writing that Parliament is only prepared to join in creating a 1999 budget growth rate which is on the level of the budget growth rates of the Member States."
"We have never before committed ourselves to such a condition."
"But if that is what is wanted, the problems which I have just mentioned must be solved."
"And if we want to solve them, we shall have to find ways whereby the future financial perspective can be announced at the same time."
"That must be based on more flexibility, and on the principle that no Member State can be forced to effect expenditure that takes money from the Community budget, if it itself is not prepared to take this money."
"In the informal three-way discussion, and in the three-way discussion on Tuesday, I said, "" The 1999 budget will only materialize - and I say this here very clearly, above all so that it is on record for the Council - if there is an interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions about the questions of the legal bases.'"
"Please, let no one hide behind the legal process which has been initiated before the European Court of Justice."
"We need a solution to this problem in principle."
"Parliament is ready for it, and I have the impression that the other two institutions are too."
"But prepare yourselves - I am not fooling around - there will be no 1999 budget if this problem is not solved."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we started the 1998 budget procedure during or around the time of the Ajax Amsterdam football match."
"This evening there is also a football match, between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund."
"I shall come back to this point again at the end."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy mentioned the first of April. We would surely rather have seen the football match, but the seriousness of the situation, namely the 1999 budget discussion, keeps us fixed in the House at this hour."
"For the first time, information policy is not firmly anchored in the guidelines."
"We have assumed that we shall have a viable concept between the Commission and the European Parliament of how information policy in 1998 is finally to be controlled."
"However, unfortunately this does not seem to be the case, and I would like to remind at least those who have been elected from this House as representatives to the Bureau or the Conference of Presidents to look again at the budget decisions of 1996, 1997 and 1998 in paragraphs 18 of the 1998 guidelines, 30, 31 and 32 of the 1998 first reading, and 11 of the 1998 second reading, and paragraphs 9 of the 1997 guidelines, 17, 48, 49 and 50 of the 1997 first reading, because precisely in view of the morning discussion today that is certainly not unimportant for the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents."
"But now to the content of the guidelines before us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Dührkop, you have in paragraph 2, I believe, a mistake which only originates in the German version, because again it refers to an employment budget."
"That might be a problem for our party, but I know that you mean a budget for more employment, and therefore I ask you to make an alteration, at least before the vote tomorrow."
"In the fourth starred point of paragraph 8, again at least in the German version, there is such an unfortunate formulation that I do not understand it at all."
"In paragraph 9, I consider that your own formulation is excellent, and I believe that it hits the nail on the head."
"Therefore, our party will apply for a split vote, above all on the question of a vote on the critical mass and the policy of the Commission, because in our opinion this does not belong to it in principle."
"We consider that your formulation is better."
"In paragraph 15, which concerns the employment initiative which was defined and voted on in the 1998 procedure, the second part is at least unclear, if not actually wrong."
"We have quite clearly declared ourselves for the three main aims of this employment initiative, and also voted for them."
"At midday today we finally voted on the Pronk report as the legal basis, and we also said that small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account in the field of the third system together with others, but what it says there now is that they should be given priority."
"That is not what we voted for."
"As far as the amendments before us are concerned, we agree entirely with the submitter of the first amendment, Mr Brinkhorst, at least as regards its aims, but we have not yet formed a final opinion."
"To come back to the football match: today in Spain, in Madrid, the match was delayed by an hour because the goalposts fell down."
"Since Mrs Dührkop comes from near Barcelona, and such a thing never happens in Barcelona, I wish the rapporteur, and the other rapporteur Mr Viola, great success in remaining standing throughout the 1999 budget discussions."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Viola, on having produced guideline resolutions which are just that."
"They are guidelines and they have strenuously resisted what so often happens if people try to turn the guidelines into some sort of advance and premature first reading."
"What we have here is a very clear view of principle."
"I merely want to refer to a couple of paragraphs in Mrs Dührkop Dührkop's excellent report and underline them, in particular recital D where she emphasizes that what we have to concentrate on in the budget procedure is the whole question of the collection of revenues so as to avoid wastage."
"We spend so much time dealing with expenditure that we have to prioritize the proper collection of own resources as a major, fundamental and integral part of the budget procedure."
"The other point I would highly commend her for is the incorporation in paragraph 9 of her report of the response to the challenge laid down by Commissioner Liikanen some two years ago about the policies of critical mass."
"Today in the guidelines motion he has Parliament's response, and we hope that, having had Parliament's response, we get preliminary draft estimates that reflect that response in a way that we can see."
"If you read paragraph 9 carefully, Mrs Dührkop has there accepted the challenge that it means looking at those policies which should be continued and even reinforced, but also at those which should no longer be thus considered."
"So it has bitten the bullet, it is a serious response, and one which I commend."
"For the rest of my time, I want to turn to Mr Viola's report which, again, is excellent."
"The points I would underline in his report are as follows: in paragraph 4 he makes the very important point about the European civil service."
"I hope when we are talking about the European civil service as we proceed into the detail of the budget, we will perhaps extend some of the thoughts set out there and talk about both appointment and promotion being exclusively actions which should take place on merit."
"This should be the only criterion for appointment and promotion within the European civil service."
"I note and welcome in paragraph 5 the view that no new post ought to be created in 1999, and I hope that, as we progress into the budgetary procedure, the caveat expressed there is one that can be dropped."
"I commend very fully all the points that are laid out in clear chronological sequence in paragraph 8 of the report, where there are a whole series of matters on which this House, as part of the budgetary authority, needs further information."
"I particularly turn to paragraph 9 - property policy."
"Today, as has already been recalled, is 1 April."
"I received, I suppose, what has been the most complicated April Fool's Day hoax in the form of what purports to be a report to the European Parliament from the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, a report that would have us believe that something like ECU 36 million is going to be spent on converting the Belliard I and II buildings to meet their purpose."
"I say to them: nice try on April Fool's Day but we look forward to receiving the genuine report on what should be made available for the conversion of those buildings."
"Yet there are serious challenges before us in the buildings area, and I am sure that, in the approach that Mr Viola is taking, he will continue with the same level of serious scrutiny as we have had in the past."
"The only area that I see seriously lacking in the Viola report - but I think we can take it for granted - is in relation to communications policy."
"We have lots of discussions coming up on communications policy."
"I just want to add one thought, and I say it with great respect to you, Madam President, as something you can take back to the Bureau."
"I am increasingly of the view that to understand what Parliament's Bureau actually does and decides you have to be a Kremlinologist to read their minutes and get any meaning out of them."
"So at this time when we are talking about communications policy, you can perhaps translate into the Bureau minutes the same degree of clarity, lucidity and transparency that this Parliament is trying to instil into the European Central Bank."
"It would be a great service to parliamentary democracy."
"Madam President, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Dührkop, on an excellent report on the guidelines."
"As you might expect as the Committee on Budgets' rapporteur for the satellite agencies, I would like to concentrate particularly on paragraph 18 in her report."
"This has appeared again this year in the guidelines."
"The question is why should we have a paragraph on the satellite agencies again."
"Many Members of this House and members of the Committee on Budgets will think that with Parliament's acceptance of the Kellett-Bowman report on matters relating to satellite agencies, the matter has been done and dusted."
"This is not so."
"Mr Liikanen has used the word 'serenity' but, as an Americanist, I would always say that 'eternal vigilance' is the key."
"With the satellite agencies eternal vigilance is certainly the key as far as we are concerned."
"While we want to pursue our paragraph in the guidelines, there is the question of the annuality of the budget procedure."
"Over the last three years, great strides have been made in presenting the budget lines for the satellite agencies."
"We have insisted on a number of guiding principles which I am glad the agencies have taken up."
"And these have been pursued with the help of Mr Liikanen and his colleagues in the Commission."
"What are these guidelines?"
"Firstly, there are prior information and prior spending patterns."
"We are looking at the way in which resources have been used for previous years, i.e. the take-up or utilization of each agency's budget."
"This must play a role in the future allocation of agency funding in the European Union."
"When we look at this year's Kellett-Bowman report on the discharge, we see that for Dublin there was an underspend of ECU 140 000; for Thessaloniki an underspend of ECU 1.28 million. There are reasons for this, but these come into play when we look at future spending patterns."
"I am sure the Commissioner is aware of these. However, most importantly, we are concerned to look at the work programme which is set out and properly costed."
"That work programme must be agreed with the various policy committees."
"The second issue is transparency."
"What we have tried to ensure is that the agencies come forward with a staffing organigramme."
"We have succeeded in persuading the agencies to do this, but the work programmes are costed and we can see horizontally through Title I, Title II and Title III expenditure of the agencies' report, what each project is going to cost."
"This is most important for us as a Budgets Committee, more important for the substantive committees, and it will be important for the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control when we come to look at the discharge later on."
"We are making progress here."
"My last point concerns accountability."
"The key issue is how we allocate resources."
"As Mrs Dührkop, Mr Tomlinson and Mr Wynn have said, we are utilizing EU citizens money'."
"This must be seen to be done in a manner which is transparent not only to Parliament but also to the client group of the agency and the citizenship itself."
"To achieve these goals, we have established and will continue to hold regular meetings with the agency heads and the rapporteurs of the substantive committees."
"That process will continue this year."
"How can we conclude?"
"Mr Liikanen made the point about 'serenity' ."
"He said that peace has broken out."
"It certainly has."
"Peace has broken out with the agencies."
"We have a new process set up, but that vigilance is going to be important."
"I know that one of his colleagues, Mr Bangemann, said about Alicante that we must be vigilant."
"The Budget Committee of Alicante is spending ECU 24 million on a new building about which the Commission knew very little and about which Parliament was not even informed."
"Vigilance is the key, Mr Liikanen!"
"We must tighten up procedures and we will monitor them both through the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Madam President, I too wish to congratulate Mrs Dührkop on her specific and essential report and recall that, within the framework of the rigour imposed by the Union and the Member States this year, the 1999 budget, as the rapporteur mentioned, should be the first budget of the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and should therefore contain choices that relate to the innovations of the Treaty itself."
"This means that the budget should favour employment, as has been point out, through investment in infrastructure, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, investment in research and development, but also support for measures within the framework of local employment initiatives and regional pacts for the third system, in line - unlike what Mr Tillich maintained - with the commitment assumed by the European Parliament last October, as precisely stated by Mrs Dührkop in her report."
"Training and refresher courses are considered to be two of the key instruments for developing adaptability and entrepreneurship and, above all, for enabling young people and women to find jobs."
"These are the guidelines, and they were also recalled at the Extraordinary Luxembourg Summit."
"That is why the LEONARDO and SOCRATES programmes and, more generally, education and training programmes need adequate financing."
"Social dialogue, which is given an ever more important role by the Treaty itself, should find the necessary corresponding provisions and strengthening measures in the budget."
"Mrs Dührkop rightly considers that the 1999 budget should be the citizens' budget, aimed at enhancing and improving economic and social cohesion."
"In this context, the activities and networks of nongovernmental organizations, which make a fundamental contribution to the development of the European social policy for the elderly, the disabled and for the fight against social exclusion and which represent an essential means for citizens to take part in the construction of Europe, should continue to receive adequate support."
"I wish to conclude by taking up a point, mentioned by Mr Samland, that seems particularly important to me: an essential condition for ending the procedure on a positive note is for the Council to sign the agreement on the legal bases."
"I do not think the Council has any alibis any more from this point of view, and so I wish to conclude the debate - as I am the last one to speak - with this commitment: the Minutes of this meeting should be forwarded to the Council so that it knows that Parliament is no longer prepared, this year, not to reach an agreement on this matter."
"Madam President, although it might be out of the ordinary in terms of procedure, I would like to say to Mr Tillich - and this is very important - that I am from San Sebastián and that I am a Real Madrid supporter because otherwise I would have problems with my two children when I go back home."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to one more thing."
"You still have the opportunity, for 24 more minutes, to play an April Fool's trick or have one played on you."
"Be careful!"
"(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Wednesday 1 April have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I wish to comment on the Verbatim Report of Proceedings, to which someone has drawn my attention."
"I do not usually read my own speeches, but someone read this out to me."
"There are two words in it which I would like to have deleted, because they were addressed to another Member and were not part of my speech."
"The words are: ' Be quiet' ."
"Someone annoyed me, and I asked him rather sharply to be quiet."
"He really did annoy me."
"This was not addressed to Mrs Lalumière, and so must be deleted from the Verbatim Report of Proceedings."
"Thank you, Mr von Habsburg. In any case, that is not part of the Minutes but of the Verbatim Report of Proceedings."
"The problem will be solved."
"Mr President, I have some sympathy with Mr von Habsburg."
"Nevertheless, our proceedings are supposed to be recorded accurately and that clearly is an accurate part of the proceedings."
"I think he was entirely right in his comments but I think we should have the full rich tapestry of this House recorded rather than some sanitized version that suits us if we want to look holier than thou."
"Mr President, it arises from the Minutes and the session news, which record my splendid contribution in which I attacked the British Government for its failure to join the single currency, thereby sacrificing 100 000 jobs in Britain."
"Unfortunately it says that I am a member of the Party of European Socialists, and I am sure that they would not want to be embarrassed by that."
"Perhaps we could have it corrected to recognize that I am an independent Labour member who sits with the Green Group in the Parliament."
"Mr President, we decided yesterday that the debate on the Schaffner report should go ahead, but that we would let the voting wait."
"Of course, the delay arose because the High Level Panel's report was only in French."
"I forgot to point out something at the time which I hope is quite obvious, namely that the deadline for tabling amendments also depends on when voting is to take place. In other words, the groups should be able to table amendments once we all have the text and can read it."
"That is what I would like."
"Mrs Lindholm, I think your comment is justified."
"I would like to say that the debate will take place, although there will be no vote."
"It is only common sense that the deadline for tabling amendments must be extended, and that will be done."
"(The Minutes were approved )"
"Rules of Procedure (new Rule 44a)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0054/98) by Mr Crowley, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on insertion of a new Rule 44a on other reports and the annual reports of other institutions in Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"Since for some reason beyond his control the rapporteur is not yet here, you will understand if I call on Mr Ford to speak."
"So we are starting the debate with Mr Ford's speech."
"Mr President, I was going to suggest that maybe we should take Mr Dell'Alba's report first, which is going to be very short and is also on the Rules, but if you wish to do it the other way round, I am quite happy to start."
"Maybe it will give Mr Crowley a few minutes to arrive if Mr Dell'Alba is with us."
"Mr Ford, your idea is extremely helpful, and I might have suggested it myself if Mr Dell'Alba had been here."
"But he is not here either, so I would therefore ask you to open the debate."
"I cannot go on to the other report because Mr Dell'Alba is not here."
"Mr President, thank you very much."
"I was going to rise to congratulate Mr Crowley on this report."
"I still congratulate him in his absence."
"It is a report that actually clarifies the situation with respect to the proliferating number of annual reports that we have in this House."
"There was some difficulty in the Rules Committee initially and this report took some time before it finally emerged from the Rules Committee but when it did emerge it did so unanimously."
"We have now got an agreement, at least in the Rules Committee, across the House with respect to this whole plethora of annual reports and it means that we have a clearly laid down procedure that we can follow in future and we will not have the constant debate about what route, what institutional route, a particular report should follow."
"The Socialist Group will therefore be supporting the report and I congratulate Mr Crowley on it."
"Thank you for your comments, Mr Ford, and for having helped me to get our work started."
"Mr President, flexibility is the name of the game in political and economic systems these days and I think that Mr Crowley's report is to be welcomed because it is a contribution to this flexibility."
"Mr Ford has already pointed out, and I am sure that Mr Crowley would have done so had he been here, that we lack flexibility in the organization of one aspect of our work: the response we have to reports that come from committees or outside bodies."
"Mr Crowley's report restores that flexibility to Parliament, to the Conference of Presidents and to the relevant committees and I welcome it on that account."
"There was some suggestion in the Committee that perhaps this report did not formally change the position but simply reordered and clarified it."
"If that is so I would welcome it because I think that it is not merely the function of the Rules of Procedure to provide a minimum framework, a simply reductionist approach to the rules, but to encourage the right and rational outcomes."
"Over the coming months and years, time in the plenary will be at a premium and it is undoubtedly right that Mr Crowley's report gives us the opportunity to be more flexible, to be more rational and to be more successful."
"Since we are having difficulty in getting Mr Crowley and Mr Dell'Alba, let me make a general remark about the work of the Rules of Procedure Committee."
"Sadly, with the exception of course of the people who are here today, attendance at the Rules of Procedure Committee is not always of the best, and yet the curious thing is that - like education - the Rules of Procedure are something that everybody has an opinion on, both in the groups and in the plenary."
"I would like to think that in future the very interesting matters that we discuss in the Rules of Procedure Committee will attract the attention from all colleagues that they deserve."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Crowley for this excellent report and to comment on the utter Irishness of it, because not only is the rapporteur not there but it is a non-solution to a non-problem."
"You could not in fact make a better job of it."
"It is rather striking that the rapporteur for the next report, Mr Dell'Alba, is not there either."
"Oh, he has just come in!"
"Perfect."
"That is timing!"
"The fact is that we used to have just a single annual report by the Commission."
"Now we have a proliferation of different annual reports by different institutions."
"It turns out, however, that there is a difference between, let us say, those annual reports that are presented by the institutions as required by the Treaty and the other annual reports."
"What I would have liked to have seen in the report by Mr Crowley was for us to do something with the reports, and that is not indicated."
"We just have a debate, or we do not."
"That is a non-solution."
"Mr President, like the other speakers, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, who is not present, for an excellent report."
"Of course, the aim of this report is actually to try to simplify Parliament's treatment of all the annual reports we have to deal with."
"In his report, I think the rapporteur counted 25 different annual reports which are dealt with in depth in this Parliament, which means that we can handle two or three annual reports at most in each part-session."
"Furthermore, this seems to be a growing trend."
"If it carries on like this, I think we will find in a few years' time that most of our work involves dealing with such annual reports."
"I do not think there is any other Parliament in the world that examines and pronounces in such detail on what different authorities have done in the past year."
"I also think there is a link between these large volumes of opinions which are generated on annual reports and the low turnout at voting in our Parliament."
"Last year - that is, before we had a financial incentive to take part in votes - the average turnout here in the Chamber was between 50 % and 60 %, which I believe is the lowest in any democratically elected assembly in the world."
"When I am out and about talking to people, they often ask me why so few Members of Parliament vote."
"The simplest answer is that an awful lot of our work involves expressing views which are virtually meaningless."
"If we can simplify these matters with the Crowley report, so that we do not spend so much time producing views on these reports, but deal with the main and most important questions instead, I think we will have done something to make this Parliament's work much easier."
"That said, I would like to thank the current rapporteur, and I will be listening very carefully to what he himself has to say."
"Mr President, it is a very interesting innovation that this debate be rounded up with a contribution from the rapporteur, and why not!"
"I wish to welcome Mr Crowley's report."
"This is a useful adaptation of the Rules of Procedure."
"There was nothing quite so preposterous as to see this Parliament debating time after time reports on reports, especially, for example, the report that comes every year from the Committee on Institutional Affairs - usually with Mr Valverde López as rapporteur - where Parliament receives the annual reports on European Union from the European Council."
"It is a report, of course, on the previous year."
"We usually receive it half way through the next year."
"The Institutional Committee then drafts a report on this report, and we end up debating a year and a half later the events of a year and a half before on the basis of a report on a report."
"This was, of course, nonsense, and there are many examples of this nonsense."
"This change to the Rules of Procedure will enable us to get rid of this sort of nonsense, and where we do not have a very good reason for having a special report on a report, or a special debate on a report, we will no longer need to do so."
"So I welcome this change to the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I will not need the five minutes as my esteemed colleagues have covered the most essential parts of the report."
"I wish to apologize to you, Mr President, and to the House."
"Unfortunately, I had a puncture in my wheelchair this morning and that is what delayed my arrival - I had to get it repaired."
"I would like Members to be reassured that this is not an attempt to get certain issues off the agenda and stop them being debated within Parliament or to prevent committees from drawing up reports that they feel are politically important for those committees."
"Rather, it is an attempt to try to bring into line the proper workings of this Parliament, to give more time for this House and this Chamber to respond more rapidly to the ever-changing political events that are taking place."
"My colleague, Mr Corbett, has already mentioned that with certain reports we are debating a report on a report."
"I would go even further and say that in other annual reports that have come before this Parliament, not only are we dealing with a report which may be two years old but we are also regurgitating and recycling information that was put in an annual report three or four years ago, and yet we feel that it all has to be included again each year, year on end."
"That certainly wastes the time of this Parliament; it puts the services under tremendous pressure to be translating into 11 working languages huge rafts of documents which every Member does not read, which every Member does not take notice of and, most importantly of all, which the public and the media ignore totally."
"The reason why there was some difficulty with this report initially was that certain Members who felt that issues of importance to them - I would cite Mr Ford, who had an annual report on racism in the European Union - were afraid that they would be knocked off the agenda."
"I hope that my amendment which was agreed in committee will overcome those problems for them."
"It also requires a bit of diligence from the Conference of Presidents to ensure that they do not derive undue power from the little bit of leeway which we have given them in this report."
"Finally, I wish to say to the House and to Members that, with all of my heart and all the persuasive argument that I can muster, I commend this report to the House."
"I also wish to inform Members that, because of the changes taking place in the Treaty of Amsterdam in the way this House operates, we will be dealing with more reports from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities in this Parliament that will be far more wide-ranging and innovative in changing the way this Parliament operates."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"Modification of Rule 141 of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is the report (A4-0111/98) by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on amending Rule 141 on subcommittees."
"Mr President, I am sorry I was not able to help with a possible reversal of the order of the two reports. Having said that, I would like to start by explaining my report."
"I must say, I am very pleased it has finally arrived in the Chamber, because the question is an important one. In particular, it helps to correct a situation we are aware of, which has not prevented our work but which, I believe, should be corrected from the point of view of the Rules of Procedure."
"What is it about?"
"The Rules of Procedure, in their current form and interpretation, give us to understand that the subcommittees, of which there are three in this Parliament, can only be composed of full or substitute members of the main committee."
"This has led to practical difficulties in application, at the level of the political groups."
"We are aware of the complex nature of these subcommittees. I am thinking particularly of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, which deals with human rights worldwide, and the fact that many of those countries, such as those in the third world, fall within the remit, so to speak, of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, for example."
"Consequently, there is widespread interest, not only among the members of the main committee - in this case the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy - but also in the other committees represented in the Subcommittee on Human Rights. We have found the same interest in the other two subcommittees, albeit to a lesser extent."
"So these rules and this interpretation of the Rules of Procedure have been ignored by the European Parliament which, through its political groups, has appointed to the subcommittees representatives who are not members of the main committee, as shown by the statistics in the annex to my report. This has created a breach, if not of the Rules of Procedure, at least of their interpretation."
"We have heard the question asked by the chairman in response to a request from several members of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, and the Committee on the Rules of Procedure was greatly embarrassed. We either had to reassert the right - a right which had been violated - or, I would not say adapt to the reality, but recognize that, in fact, this situation might not be ideal."
"Being responsible for this report, I have tried to summarize the opinions on both sides, reaching a solution that may seem to be a compromise but which in fact seemed the best way to guarantee both the fundamental link with the main committee and also the flexibility we consider essential to ensure the greater participation, the greater involvement of everyone in the important activities of the subcommittees. As we well know, such activities very often include reflection, discussion and investigation rather than legislative and operational matters."
"The formula is simple: that full members of the subcommittees should be full or substitute members of the main committee."
"This seemed to be an elegant way of accepting the practice of this House, allowing other members to join the subcommittees and, in so doing, maintaining two principles: the fundamental link, but also the opportunity for greater involvement."
"That is the proposal we are making and we hope Parliament will see fit to approve it."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Dell'Alba on his report on the membership of subcommittees."
"As he has told us, there are three subcommittees at the moment: security, human rights and monetary affairs."
"It has been clear for some time that people outside the foreign affairs remit - such as those involved with development - are interested in particular in the membership of the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"Also, there has been some interest from the committee on which I sit, which is the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and which deals with human rights in the European Union but is rather interested in human rights amongst the applicant countries that technically, at the moment, are dealt with by the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"We welcome Mr Dell'Alba's proposal to clarify the situation as it stands, which means that only full members of a subcommittee must be drawn from the membership of the committee; therefore, by analogy, implying that substitutes on subcommittees can be drawn from other committees as well."
"I note that Rule 163(3) says that unless we specify otherwise at the time of the vote - maybe by an oral amendment - these rules come into operation on the first day of the next part-session."
"The next part-session will start on 11 May - so that the adjournment, as Mr Corbett has just told me, will be the longest in our history, from March until May - and at that date we will find that the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs is not affected, but that suddenly two members of the Subcommittee on Security and Disarmament will no longer be eligible to be members, along with three members of the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"We need to clarify that."
"Certainly the Socialist Group will be happy to accept that this new rule change comes into force at the beginning of the next Parliament."
"But that is something for Mr Dell'Alba to propose, or else the consequences will be as I state."
"Finally, I thank Mr Dell'Alba again on resolving a problem which, unlike Mr Wijsenbeek's intervention last time, certainly has a political dimension and is one that we are interested in resolving."
"Mr President, like Mr Ford, I should like to congratulate Mr Dell'Alba on an excellent report."
"In describing it he seemed a little reticent about calling it a compromise."
"Perhaps to his Italian radical temperament the idea of compromise is one that is a little more suspicious than it is to the pragmatic British."
"On the contrary, I would regard it as a great benefit and advantage of the report that it is a very sensible compromise between two desires, two considerations, one of which is to have a wide range of opinion and expertise working in the subcommittees, while the other is to have a clear line of responsibility between the subcommittees and their principal committees."
"I am not entirely sure that, if we adopt it as it is, it will have the effects that Mr Ford fears."
"After all, we have ignored the provisions of the interpretation up until now."
"It would be slightly surprising if we became more dogmatic and more draconian in our application as a result of what we might adopt today."
"One final point: quite rightly, Mr Dell'Alba did not make a strong point of the proposition that in reality the present interpretation is ignored."
"I would not want to be committed to the view that if a rule is ignored it should necessarily be changed."
"If it is a bad rule it should be changed; if it is a good rule it should be applied."
"That is something that is of wider general application than simply to the matter of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Dell'Alba on his report."
"It is a short report but also a significant one."
"It has been quite a long time in committee, it has had a long gestation period, but even if Mr Ford is proposing - and I think he is correct to do so - that we delay its birth, it will still be very important."
"It is always the responsibility of the parent committee to ensure that it knows what is going on in its subcommittees."
"The purpose of a subcommittee is to report back to the main committee."
"So the parent committee has to be sure that the subcommittees are clear in their purpose, that they are being consistent in the work that they do, and that there is continuity between the subcommittee and the main committee."
"The previous rule, which was quite clear, was being ignored."
"I take Mr Donnelly's point that just because something is being ignored you should not necessarily change it."
"But there was an anomaly in the way the previous ruling was being interpreted, so that you could even have a subcommittee meeting - although it may never have done so - where none of the members of the subcommittee were actually members of the full committee."
"Now, with this rule change, it is quite clear that the full members will have to be members of the main committee."
"We considered having the majority of the members, but in the end we have settled for the full members."
"That will make certain that the committees are not just independent but that there is interdependence between the subcommittee and the main committee."
"It is for those reasons that I will be supporting the report."
"Mr President, like the other speakers, I would like to start by thanking Mr Dell'Alba for an excellent report."
"As I see it, it meets two requirements."
"Firstly, it reinforces the links between a subcommittee and the main committee by stipulating that all the full members must also belong to the main committee."
"On the other hand, it also permits a certain degree of flexibility by allowing the substitutes to come from another committee."
"That may be necessary of course because, as Mr Dell'Alba says, there are some cases where matters need to be coordinated."
"So it is a good thing for members from other committees to be included in dealing with such matters."
"Some people have expressed fears about this structure, because it could mean that a rapporteur belonging to a subcommittee might be a member of another main committee. In other words, they could be a substitute in the subcommittee and then become rapporteur for a matter which was then taken up by the main committee."
"That would mean that someone who was not a member of the main committee could present a report on that committee's behalf."
"As I see it, this is a purely theoretical risk, since appointing the rapporteurs on individual matters is still the job of the main committee."
"Presumably we can rely on the main committees not to appoint any rapporteurs who are not their own members."
"Having said that, I would like to thank Mr Dell'Alba once again for an excellent report which I am certain will be passed by a large majority today."
"Mr President, I would like to take up Mr Ford's suggestion, which I think is a wise one."
"With the agreement of the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, I would therefore like to propose that it should be recorded in the Minutes that these rules come into force after the summer recess, on Monday 14 September, to allow us to adapt to the situation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00 noon."
"Report of the High Level Panel on the free movement of persons"
"The next item is the report (A4-0108/98) by Mrs Schaffner, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the report of the High Level Panel on the free movement of persons, chaired by Mrs Simone Veil (C40181/97)."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the High Level Panel has done an excellent piece of work."
"As Mrs Schaffner said, this is of course a problem which we in this Parliament have been aware of for years."
"But it is an important task which needs to be carried out now, at a time when I believe mobility must increase and continue to increase with the euro."
"We know that progress has been made with the other three freedoms, but that has not been the case in this field, partly because of a lack of legal instruments but also, I believe, because the political will is not there."
"Also, we have weakened the position of citizens of nonMember States far too much."
"There is a weakness in one respect, and I would like to point out that not even the High Level Panel has really agreed on how tax matters are to be resolved."
"The report also reflects the fact that national legislation has ceased to reflect human reality."
"We have a number of different kinds of mobility: moving completely from one Member State to another; working in border areas and living in one Member State and working in another; and having permanent links with a number of Member States."
"This is a familiar feature of the Commissioner's homeland and my own."
"We have experienced cars being seized when the authorities in one of these two countries take the view that the person in question is actually domiciled in the other."
"I would therefore like to emphasize the proposal of the working group that, in regard to taxation, we need a common definition of residence."
"I would like to ask the Commission what action it has taken in the light of the High Level Panel's report.1 I also think that an important element in the argument is that there is a legal basis in the Treaty, Article 100, which has provided authority for coordinatio on other matters of taxation."
"I also think we should adopt the proposal that Member States should be able to read other Member States' so-called ""smart cards' when it comes to entitlement to social security benefits."
"Only an expert can deal with the jungle of the E111 form and so on."
"It is now time to put this on the agenda."
"Finally, I would like to point out that there is an error in the Swedish version when it comes to the national ombudsmen's duties, but this does not apply to the other language versions."
"Mr President, first of all I wish to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur."
"She had a difficult task to accomplish."
"On behalf of my colleague Anne-Karin Glase, who cannot be here today, I wish to present extracts from her opinion on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The complexity of the overall problem meant that the committee had to restrict itself to questions of access to employment and social and family status."
"The objective of the EURES network established in 1994 is to create transparency in the European employment market."
"However, the fact that the employment market database has too little to offer is still the weak point of this system."
"EURES is not well enough known either to businesses or to employees, and so is not getting enough information or use."
"One problem is the recognition of proof of qualifications in the private sector."
"As far as the non-regulated professions are concerned, unfortunately neither employers nor employees recognize the value of the qualifications demanded or offered in other relevant employment markets."
"Earlier attempts to address this matter failed because of rapid job changes and because only basic educational qualifications are taken into account, not professional experience or further training, among other things."
"Meanwhile, the regulated professions have achieved quite satisfactory results, with the exception of a few unsolved problems."
"The situation in the public sector is another matter, because freedom of movement is far less well developed."
"Being a national of the country in question is often a requirement for employment."
"Free movement involves the social rights and family status of EU citizens."
"The provisions based on Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72 have made effective coordination between very different national insurance models possible, but there are still some matters to be resolved."
"Such matters are of two types: those which can be resolved within the scope of existing regulations, and others for which this has not yet been possible because of the differences between national legislations."
"The full principle of free movement also includes the right to take family members to the host country, but it turns out that in many cases social benefits are reserved for nationals only."
"Another set of problems arises if the spouse is a national of a third country."
"A detailed examination should be made of which stipulations based on Regulation 1408/71 apply here."
"With regard to divorce, minimum protection should be maintained for a specific period, in order not to create potential pressure on the spouse due to any dependency."
"However, I fail to understand why some circles in the European Parliament are trying to make previously unjustified immigration possible on the basis of family status."
"This trend is expressed, for example, in paragraphs 9 and 11 of our opinion, and also goes against the vote of the Group of the European People's Party."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, further to the excellent work by the High Level Panel chaired by Mrs Veil, Mrs Schaffner has submitted an excellent piece of work as the European Parliament's rapporteur."
"Although I have to say that my opinions differ from Mrs Schaffner's on almost all aspects - I shall explain why shortly - I must compliment her."
"She has produced some very careful work, and made it easier for us to understand the essence of the interpretation of free movement on the Conservative side of the Chamber."
"So, many thanks to Mrs Schaffner for having made her report so clear."
"Clear explanations are easier to handle, and help to highlight distinctions."
"Mrs Veil makes 80 proposals and recommendations on how to overcome the difficulties confronting EU citizens, as described by the rapporteur and the draftsman of the opinion, in order to take advantage of the freedom of movement specified by the Maastricht Treaty."
"I have the impression that the Schaffner report appreciates what Mrs Veil says, but then describes how the difficulties which Mrs Veil wishes to eliminate could be accentuated."
"The crucial factor - and I am grateful to Mr Schiedermeier for having spoken so clearly when standing in for Mrs Glase - is that we do make distinctions."
"Firstly, who benefits from freedom of movement?"
"""The citizens of the Union' , everyone says."
"According to Mrs Schaffner, only nationals of an EU Member State are citizens of the Union."
"People who are long-term residents of the European Union, legally and with all the necessary permits, are not citizens of the Union but third country nationals, and must therefore be treated differently."
"Let us consider, for example, the US businessman who works for Chase Manhattan Bank in Frankfurt, lives there with his family, earns and spends his money there and participates in local life."
"He is only allowed to do so in Germany."
"If he is transferred to another country, a very difficult phase in this man's life in the European Union begins."
"He must overcome a wealth of permit provisos from the European Union against third party nationals."
"I deliberately mention the US businessman, because I do not want to make it easy for you always to speak of the people you are really thinking about in the debate about third country nationals."
"That is why I refer to this US businessman."
"I think it is a good idea to set up information and advice bureaux on European citizenship, although I do not think it is particularly sensible for European citizens to receive advice there from students, Mrs Schaffner."
"I think qualified legal advice should be given by fully trained people, though I do not wish to belittle the status of students, who are sometimes cleverer than Members or lawyers, as we know."
"The term ""freedom of movement' in the Maastricht Treaty concerns people being allowed to exist with equal rights, as well as capital, services and goods."
"That is why it is stated that capital, services, goods and persons have freedom of movement in the European Union."
"We guaranteed this from 1 January 1993."
"Your report shows that you can take goods, services and capital wherever you want in the European Union, at any time of the day or night."
"Freedom of movement of persons, however, belongs to the Union of Mistrust, which you want, and which is far from reality."
"Thank you, Mr Nassauer."
"With regard to what you said at the beginning of your speech - could you please put your headphones on - regarding your comment on speaking time, I would like to say that, in the absence of Mr Newman, the Socialist Group merely distributed their time between two speakers: one minute for Mr Schulz and one minute, which has yet to come, for Mrs Zimmermann."
"That right is available to the political groups and is not up to the Chair, and that is why an extra minute was allotted to Mr Schulz."
"So far as the power of the Chair to allow a little more time for Members to speak is concerned, all the political groups have had the benefit of my indulgent discretion in that respect."
"Mr President, Mrs Schaffner's report raises issues which cause financial, political and social problems to those who either live or move within the borders of the European Union."
"I wish to offer my warm congratulations to Mrs Schaffner for attempting to provide answers and propose solutions to these problems."
"In this sense, the report is extremely forward-looking and not at all conservative."
"If it were conservative it would not propose solutions or face up to the problems."
"However, it is forward-looking in that it sees the problems, confronts them and proposes solutions to them. The problem, however, is not whether there is Community legislation on all these issues."
"We all know very well that the three institutional bodies have dealt with these issues."
"The problem is that national legislation in the Member States either does not exist or has not been harmonized in a common direction, along common political lines which would make it easier to solve these problems."
"A third point I would like to mention is that my group will of course be delighted to vote in favour of the report, but we disagree - for very specific and fundamental reasons - with Amendments Nos 8 and 9 and with the second part of Amendment No 11. We are under an obligation, firstly, to solve the problems of the European citizen by strengthening European cohesion and secondly, to deal with the problems of people from third countries."
"Mr President, soon the new single European currency, the euro, will be introduced."
"This is the finishing touch to the free movement of capital and goods."
"Mr Schulz was of course right in saying that the free movement of capital and goods is being fully taken care of with the introduction of the euro, but we are not quite there yet as far as the free movement of people is concerned."
"The Simone Veil High Level Panel has done excellent work, and I would like to say to the banks in question that I am proud that Mrs Veil was once the chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party in this House, as well the President of this Parliament."
"We can recognize her liberal approach in this text."
"But for people to move around freely is not yet as easy as is sometimes suggested."
"May I remind everyone that we debated and adopted three guidelines proposed by Commissioner Monti."
"Those are now with the Council and everything has suddenly gone quiet."
"They deal with the abolition of internal border controls; the unimpeded travel of people from other countries, that is third countries; and the abolition of restrictions on workers' residency."
"The ball is now in the court of the Council of Ministers, and I believe Parliament should use the present debate to draw attention to this."
"Organizational measures must be taken, certainly, as well as other measures."
"I will deal with one of these organizational measures."
"We believe that in the next European Commission, one Commissioner should be responsible for the entire field of the free movement of people."
"Furthermore, complaints bureaux are very important, but it is also important for civil servants, particularly at the European level, to become more helpful and citizen-friendly."
"Mr President, I would like to conclude with one sentence."
"The Veil Panel has produced good work, and so has the rapporteur; it is now up to European policy makers and civil servants."
"Mr President, the free movement of persons in the European Union must be one of the objectives in the construction of a political Europe, taking into account the fact that free movement and its effective implementation are intimately linked to the concept of citizenship of the Union."
"Many things must be improved in order to achieve truly free movement of persons in the Union, and the report by the High Level Panel, chaired by Mrs Simone Veil, recognizes this in its conclusions and recommendations. It underlines, in particular, the fact that the main problem in this field concerns the actual application of directives and regulations rather than a lack of legislation."
"I would like to point out that both the report by the High Level Panel and Mrs Schaffner's report highlighted the problems connected with the free movement of citizens of the European Union, paying less attention to the problems related to the numerous citizens of third countries."
"If we want to build an integrated Europe, but one which both shows solidarity and is open to the social and cultural contributions of other civilizations, we must also take care to improve and increase the transparency of the legal status of nationals from third countries."
"In order to have a true citizenship which takes account of people from third countries, the procedures for granting visas must be improved, there must be better information and openness in these procedures, and the right to family reunification must be extended and strengthened, while always ensuring respect for fundamental rights and the right to dignified treatment and privacy."
"In this respect, it is also essential to do away with unequal treatment between EU citizens and nationals of third countries, which exists because of certain national laws on aliens."
"According to the Treaties, the free movement of persons should also apply to people from third countries who are legally resident in the Union. We must therefore demand that they be treated in the same way as any citizen in the Union in terms of their political, social and economic rights."
"Finally, we must support a Europe which believes that its convergence with other cultures and civilizations is socially and culturally enriching and is not a danger for public order or internal security."
"We want an open and united Europe; not a Europe which has turned into a veritable fortress."
"Mr President, the report on the free movement of persons from the High Level Panel chaired by Simone Veil is well received by Mrs Schaffner."
"It is perhaps possible that Mrs Schaffner is right to some extent at least."
"But despite the report's very good, detailed explanatory section, it is impossible to relate Mrs Schaffner's report to the High Level Panel document, as this is only available in French."
"I sincerely hope there will soon be an end to this unacceptable situation, in which essential documents are lacking in one or more languages."
"It undermines public support and trust in both MEPs and Parliament itself."
"As my French is not that good, I can only comment on the Schaffner report itself."
"The main conclusion of the report is that free movement has largely become a reality."
"I think there are many EU citizens who would not agree, and who time and time again have problems themselves or meet people who have."
"Nor can the problem be reduced to an administrative, bureaucratic matter, but depends of course on whether the Council is prepared to do what it should have done on 1 January 1993."
"This deadline has been postponed time and time again, and the question is, when will it end?"
"What surprises me greatly as a Swede is that no account has been taken of the experience and knowhow which the Scandinavian passport system, which has existed for forty years, has to offer."
"This is a different approach, but I believe it has a great deal to offer."
"Mrs Schaffner makes a clear distinction between EU citizens and those of non-Member States."
"She even argues in favour of discrimination."
"In paragraph 23 we read: ' Calls on the Commission to make it clear that workers from non-Community countries are not entitled to the full freedom of movement of Union citizens' within the Union."
"We believe this is totally unacceptable."
"Free movement must apply to everyone who is lawfully in the Union."
"Freedom of movement is not just about showing your passport."
"Mrs Schaffner also looks favourably upon the compensatory measures."
"The Green Group in the European Parliament has always distanced itself from compensatory measures, and we do so again now."
"There cannot be any freedom of movement with them."
"We are moving into a grey area of controls."
"We are also opposed to the report's assumption that the Schengen Agreement and the Treaty of Amsterdam are already clear and ratified."
"Two countries will be holding referenda on the Treaty of Amsterdam: we do not know how these will go."
"The European Union and Parliament must not go so far that democracy becomes a sham."
"Mr President, the Schaffner report is a good report and the usual congratulations must make way for genuine thanks for the quality of this work."
"It covers the conclusions of the report published by the High Level Panel ordered by the Commission, and its text unambiguously underlines the obstacles and reticence which are still hindering the free movement of persons, even though the dissenting voices are somewhat more muted."
"But to tell it as it really is, the quite scandalous and completely unacceptable situation in which we find ourselves is the fault of the Council, the Member States and the national governments."
"Scandalous because the Treaties imposed the establishment of true freedom of movement as of 31 December 1992 and it is now 1998."
"Scandalous because, despite the iterative judgments given by the Court of Justice which upheld the Treaties, things have hardly moved on at all."
"And scandalous because the governments of the Member States continue to drag their feet when it comes to implementing that freedom which is most important in the eyes of our fellow citizens."
"We have actually been very rigorous in making arrangements to allow capital, services and merchandise to move freely yet when it comes to people, the Member States and governments have used all sorts of delaying tactics to hinder the initiatives from Parliament and the Commission, whose aim is to create a veritable union of European citizens free to move about as they choose."
"The Council is the main institution responsible for this resistance."
"Their timidity, the restrictions and the barely hidden sacred cows are holding back our national officials."
"The Member States who are sitting on the directives governing freedom of movement should be sanctioned for non-application of the Council's decisions, however timid."
"As for the national governments, they remain faithful to their traditions of conservatism and faint heartedness and refuse to apply the directives, thus adding to the already large number of petitions on the freedom of movement and appeals to the European Ombudsman."
"The Commission itself uses a great deal of restraint when applying its right to take action against Member States who are in default."
"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the initiative to compile all the provisions relating to free movement into a single clear document so that these texts finally become accessible to the citizens and practitioners of European law."
"The proposal to hand over responsibility for the free movement of persons to a single Commissioner is in the same spirit and should be actively supported."
"However, the report remains tarnished with a worrying failing. In paragraph 23, it mentions that workers who are citizens of third countries do not enjoy the same freedom of movement as EU citizens."
"They are only allowed to stay or work in a different Member State as a result of the freedom of movement of services by right accorded to their employers."
"This situation is quite simply unacceptable."
"We must arrive at a situation in which anyone legally residing and working in the territory of a Member State of the Union is entitled to do so in any other Member State."
"The practice of granting freedom of movement to the employer as opposed to the individual must be completely stamped out."
"I believe that the two amendments proposed by Mrs Zimmermann, Nos 8 and 9, should replace the original text."
"Whether or not they are adopted by Parliament will determine how the members of the Group of the European Radical Alliance use their vote."
"Mr President, the High Level Panel report on the freedom of movement of persons in Europe has perhaps disappointed some of its initiators because it does not put forward any fundamental modifications to the existing legislation, and that is perhaps why it is so difficult for Members of Parliament to obtain a translation of this text."
"Anyway, the report seems to say that the general legal framework is already in place, and that first and foremost it is a question of applying the existing texts."
"As I am in the fortunate position of speaking and writing French, I have been able to understand the basic report and can inform my colleagues that this text is totally without bias and hence sits very well with all the rest of the literature on the subject."
"For example, the report does not systematically wage war on border checks on people travelling between different Member States and even states, and I quote, ""that the removal of such border controls should not be done to the detriment of security' ."
"Similarly, the report painstakingly avoids confusing the freedom of movement of European citizens with that of citizens of third countries, a mistake which is all too easily made in our circles."
"Better still, it emphasizes the fact that the right to free movement of European citizens, as set out in the Treaty, should not necessarily be taken to imply the right to move about or stay without completing all the specific formalities."
"Finally, the High Level Panel has burst yet another bubble by explaining that the free movement of citizens of Member States does not mean that they should necessarily enjoy the same rights everywhere."
"On the contrary, each Member State should be able to retain a certain number of specific laws and the situation should not arise in which, in order to simplify the lives of 5.5 million people voluntarily living outside their own country, they complicate the lives of 360 million other Europeans who live at home and ask for nothing."
"We would hope that common sense could be applied in all European policies, especially the single currency."
"Some are contestable at times, such as those concerning public office. Others however are more useful, such as the arrangements for retaining certain welfare benefit rights when working in several Member States successively."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Schaffner on her report, which has proved to be moderate in its approach to free movement. It is full of good intentions."
"Moreover, there lies within it the desire to strengthen external border controls, implement new means of redress for individuals who encounter problems when exercising their rights, modernize social security rights and encourage language training and cultural exchanges. This we can be proud of."
"However, this should not prevent us from criticizing certain unacceptable points."
"Mrs Schaffner is effectively proposing to narrow the range of public office posts reserved for nationals and thereby, it seems to me, relax public office access criteria."
"Under no circumstances can we allow a situation in which public office might be threatened where national preference still prevails."
"In France, as in nearly all the other European countries, public office is reserved for nationals, and that is how it should remain."
"The report also proposes a more flexible interpretation of the rules governing family reunification."
"As far as I am concerned, I have always defended the notion of family because I believe it is the guarantee of our nations' survival."
"However, the notion of family reunification cannot be extended infinitely, and it absolutely must not be used as a pretext for opening the flood gates to a wave of new immigrants into a Member State - immigrants who, to meet the entry criteria, merely have to claim to have a distant relative already resident within the territory."
"The report also proposes improving the situation of third-country citizens resident in a Member State."
"But is it not the case that everything is already in place to accept them and absorb them into the adoptive country?"
"In France, foreigners legally established within the territory enjoy the same rights, the same privileges, as any French person born in the country."
"Should they expect more?"
"We do not believe so, for that would be discriminatory."
"Finally, this report sets out to favour the free movement of citizens of the Member States of Europe."
"All well and good. However, we must not miss the wood for the trees."
"It has been clearly demonstrated that the Schengen Agreement cannot yet be applied to the letter because of the catastrophic consequences it has for the security of the Member States."
"Removing internal border controls and replacing them with hypothetical common external borders means the free movement, trade and consumption of drugs, illegal immigration, insecurity and international crime, all of which continues to escalate."
"We must look at the evidence: regrettably, the uniform conditions necessary for a European space without borders - conditions of national security, full employment and social calm - are not yet in place."
"So yes, as it says in Mrs Schaffner's report, we do propose to strengthen border controls but, ladies and gentlemen, this must be counterbalanced by a coherent, dissuasive and harmonized immigration policy, increased cooperation between the police forces and the courts, and harmonization of the methods for acquiring nationality which must be based on affiliation and a restrictive policy on family reunification."
"Madam Commissioner, I am glad you are here today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are deluding ourselves if we believe that the free movement of persons in Europe has already been achieved."
"Many of us have commented on the many restrictions."
"But I think the report of the High Level Panel chaired by Simone Veil also shows how changes can be brought about."
"It is quite clear from the 80 points included what the problems are - problems with which I myself have been very familiar for 27 or 28 years, I must say."
"I am Dutch and have lived in Germany since 1970."
"'So what?' you might think."
"""You are a citizen of the Union, so that is not a problem.'"
"I could tell you of many problems which I still experience."
"Of course, I now have a German diplomatic passport which makes things a bit easier."
"But I also have a residence permit, which is crazy, but that is the way it is."
"This applies to many of us if we want to take advantage of what is actually in the Maastricht Treaty."
"The Maastricht Treaty also states that there could be many more people like myself whose nationality is other than that of the country they represent."
"But it also states that we are entitled to take up employment in one country and live in another country, for example like transfrontier workers, who live in one country and have insurance in another."
"I come from the Aachen border region, and I am aware of all these problems and the difficulties which exist."
"But what happens if these people get divorced, as happens in almost one in three marriages?"
"Major problems then arise regarding entitlements to pensions, social security benefits, family allowances, and so on."
"I could go on and on."
"I welcome the fact that we are tackling this problem and that much of it is addressed in the Veil report."
"But I have been talking about people who have a European Union passport."
"Suppose we now consider those people who do not have a European Union passport, or who have not changed their nationality, whether consciously or unconsciously, perhaps for the same reasons as myself, but have lived here for 30 years."
"We brought them here to work for us."
"You could say they have done their bit, and now they are out on their own."
"These people have a great many problems."
"Mr Schiedermeier says that perhaps they want to come in by the back door, but I would like to tell him about a problem I have at the moment. The family in question has German nationality."
"Two children went to school abroad, but were not in Germany when they were 16, which means they have no right of residence."
"Six children live in Germany and have a right of residence, as have their father and mother."
"The other two must go back. What sort of a country is that, if we send these people back, if we do not give these people the opportunity of being able to stay with us?"
"When we see that only Germans are accepted into the public sector - I was in the public sector myself for 30 years - and that many provisos apply to non-Germans, that there are no permanent residence permits, and so on, then I think we still have a very long way to go."
"I hope our amendments are accepted, because that would then also let us show the Member States where we are heading at the start of the 21st century, namely towards a common Europe, where all citizens have the same rights and the same opportunities to cooperate in building this Europe, irrespective of nationality."
"Mr President, it is not very often that, in order to rightly praise the work of a rapporteur, I can agree with the words of Mr Schulz."
"But in fact, Mr President, I believe two things can be said about Mrs Schaffner's report: it is balanced and it agrees with the Treaty in force."
"Mr Schulz has said the report is ""Maastrichtian' ."
"Well, if that is what he wants to call it, then it is ""Maastrichtian' ."
"It is in line with the text of the Treaty in force and I am therefore in favour of it."
"Mr President, I agree with many of the points raised so far, so allow me to look at two more general points which I believe are relevant."
"Firstly, we live in a frontier territory where everything that has been done so far casts both light and shadow."
"Of course there have been shadows, Mr Schulz, but there has also been light, and many achievements."
"And in response to an excellent speech by Mr Pradier, I would raise my first point. Mr Pradier, in fact the fourth freedom still remains to be developed, but we must not forget that one of the great successes of the Maastricht Treaty is that through Article 8 it bestows a political nature upon this fourth freedom, this free movement of persons and, if that is the case, it must also be the derived law."
"So as well as the free movement of goods and capital, as well as the free movement of services - not forgetting, Mr Pradier, that behind every service, as you pointed out, there is normally a person who has the rights that any social and democratic country recognizes - the fourth freedom, the free movement of persons, is the fundamental political crux which transfers the centre of gravity of the European Union from the relationship between consumer and market to the relationship between citizen and rights."
"That is a great achievement, and that is how we must highlight it and all its consequences."
"Of course, from now on, the Amsterdam Treaty presents us with a challenge: incorporating into the acquis communautaire that which up until now has been, as I said, the frontier territory of the third pillar, in particular the free movement of persons."
"That is our challenge and there is no doubt that it will present many problems."
"However, it is also included in the Amsterdam Treaty; that is a great achievement and one which will have to be developed with all due caution."
"The second point which I believe is relevant and has not been mentioned is the need to guarantee and consolidate the direct effect of Article 8A. If Articles 8 and 8A are purely supplementary legal bases for the adoption of the rules of derived law, then the right of movement and residence of the citizens of the Union is based on the Treaty itself and not on the directives."
"This must be remembered."
"These rights are inseparable from EU citizenship, as are the other rights contained in paragraphs b), c) and d) of Article 8."
"The report from Mrs Veil's High Level Panel supports this theory of the direct effect, and demands that every EU citizen should be able to invoke it in establishing the application of the principle of non-discrimination."
"We would point out that the Court of Justice has not yet given a ruling, and we hope that in the near future, when it gives its ruling, it will help to consolidate this theory."
"As regards the Commission, we must point out that in the proceedings brought before the Court, the Commission has maintained this theory of direct effect."
"However, in the second report on citizenship, which is being debated in Parliament at this moment, the Commission only makes an ambiguous statement: that it would be logical if Articles 8 and 8A together generated rights relating to entrance and residence."
"Nevertheless, in the last analysis it resorts to the legal bases of Articles 49, 54, 56 and 6 of the Treaty."
"I will finish, Mr President, by saying that I think we must also point out that we are still lacking a single legal base for free movement."
"In my view, these are the fundamental challenges which must be developed, from now on and with the Amsterdam Treaty in hand."
"Mr President, of the four freedoms mentioned in relation to the internal market, the free movement of persons still poses some problems."
"But that is no surprise."
"Did the people who drew up the Treaty realize how broadly this freedom might be interpreted?"
"And could they imagine how far-reaching the consequences of the free movement of persons might be?"
"The abolition of internal borders was in reality only possible in combination with compensatory measures and a very strong external frontier."
"Has this really been so useful to the citizens in the end?"
"All the same, the strengthening of the Union was an unavoidable consequence of the ideal of open borders."
"Mrs Schaffner's reports discusses the High Level Panel's contribution to the debate on the free movement of persons."
"To my mind, it goes a little too far, for example in its interpretation of the Treaty's regulations and in its exaltation of so-called ""European citizenship' , an imaginary concept which is far removed from the people, but is forced upon them through promotional campaigns."
"The amendments from both the Green Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Party of European Socialists are truly unacceptable."
"As far as the Greens are concerned, I would like to say this. The reference to the anti-discrimination article in the Treaty of Amsterdam is superfluous in a report on the free movement of persons."
"But if you are going to quote, make sure it is complete. Why table an amendment which lists sexual preference and age as well as disabilities, but leaves out gender, race, and religion or belief."
"Through their amendments, the Socialists clearly want to give people from third countries more rights than EU citizens."
"The logic of this escapes me."
"At present a French citizen can settle freely in the Netherlands, as long as he can support himself."
"The person concerned is not a Dutch citizen, after all, covered by Dutch legislation."
"This is a restriction, but to my mind a necessary restriction, otherwise there would be all kinds of social abuse in the various Member States."
"If there are restrictions for EU citizens, than why should these not apply to citizens from third countries?"
"Indeed, why should they get more freedoms than EU citizens?"
"These amendments are unrealistic, and if they are adopted we will most certainly vote against the report."
"Mr President, on behalf of the representatives of the Alleanza Nazionale, in expressing our keen appreciation for Mrs Schaffner, we also wish to say that the High Level Panel's report shows considerable awareness of the vastness of the problems in the field of the free movement of persons."
"Even if there have been considerable improvements over the course of the years, there is a need to eliminate the distortions that continue to delay the full application of the rules on the matter."
"Reading Mrs Veil's report, we can see how the main problems relating to the free movement of persons are caused not so much by a gap in the legislation but rather by the non-application of the directives and regulations, which are at times obsessively complex."
"There is also a problem with adapting Community law to national law, as in many cases the former is only partly included rather than in full."
"So we need to put everything in order. We should try to regulate the various aspects of this question with single directives or regulations, thus avoiding the problem of complex, indecipherable regulations."
"At the same time, citizens' rights will be better defined through this process of simplification."
"Citizens who decide to settle in another Member State of the Union should be able to benefit from the same treatment as citizens who do not leave their countries of origin, and not be penalized for making that choice."
"The fundamental concept should be unique, based on equal treatment and the combating of discrimination out of respect for human rights."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by making an appeal to the European Parliament and all my colleagues. This Parliament has always been the driving force behind the principle of the free of movement of persons as a fundamental freedom."
"I hope this will continue to be the case during the debate and the vote on Mrs Schaffner's report."
"The European Parliament must continue to counter the tendency found in many Member States to turn in on themselves and erect institutional and actual barriers to the free movement of persons, and even to discriminate against citizens on the basis of their nationality."
"In my speech I would like to go into a particular point, namely the status of third countries in the context of the free movement of persons."
"In my country, Belgium, a debate is taking place at present on the local election voting rights of migrants who have been resident in our country for many years."
"My party, the Socialist Party, has been won over to this, but it is a terribly difficult debate, which has to cut across people's fears, people's racist reflexes."
"However, it is incredible how many other forms of discrimination exist alongside this one against people from third countries, who are in fact permanently resident in Europe."
"The right of residence, of being able to work in paid employment, or to become self-employed and even, Mr Schiedermeier, the right to live with one's family - a fundamental human right laid down in international conventions - are not evident to these people, and are even challenged by you."
"Even though the High Level Panel had a limited mandate, it makes good recommendations."
"I believe we should support these in this Parliament."
"Or do we think that a Turkish migrant from Genk in Belgium should not be able to look for work in Aachen in Germany, 35 km away, whilst his Italian neighbour is able to do so?"
"Do we think it is normal that a young Turkish person should have to apply for a visa to follow his football team on a trip to London, whilst his Spanish friend can do so without one?"
"Do we think it is normal that people from third countries cannot invite their ill relatives to come over here if they can guarantee that they can support them?"
"Or is it humane to make a woman who has been abandoned by her husband leave the country, for the simple reason that she is not a European Union citizen?"
"My group, ladies and gentlemen, supports the abolition of all types of discrimination between citizens of Member States, and between EU citizens and citizens of third countries who are permanently resident here."
"That is the purport of a number of our amendments."
"I note incidentally that both the Veil High Level Panel and a number of proposals tabled recently by the Commission take quite a big step in that direction, and I hope you will be able to endorse our philosophy."
"But after this debate I no longer harbour any illusions about the attitude of some of the political groups in this Parliament."
"I would like to thank in advance the members of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, the Greens, and all the others who will support our amendments willingly."
"Mr President, to the citizen, freedom of movement within the Union is perhaps the most concrete expression of what Europe means."
"People can live and work in different countries and decide in which country they want to live, in the long or short term."
"In the referendum on whether Sweden should join the EU, freedom of movement was one of the decisive arguments in favour of membership, but many transfrontier workers still have problems drawing their pensions and supplementary pensions, and problems when they want to register in another country."
"Freedom of movement is on the way to becoming a reality, but some governments are dragging their heels."
"There are reasons for showing them up as examples and a warning."
"So we will take up Mrs Thors' topic."
"The EU prohibits discriminating against citizens of other countries, but is it in accordance with the Treaty to discriminate against your own?"
"In Sweden, a large number of knowledge-intensive companies are having problems finding well-trained people."
"Ericsson, the telecoms company, has threatened to move its entire development department and corporate management to another country if it cannot get foreign people with leading-edge skills to move to Sweden."
"But they do not want to do so for tax reasons."
"To solve the problem of high taxation, the Swedish Government wants to introduce special tax exemptions on the grounds of nationality."
"Ordinary Swedish workers will have to keep on living with income tax at over 50 %, while at the same time, well-trained, highly mobile workers get tax relief - and this, according to my information, with the support of the Commission, which is thus directly supporting tax dumping for localizing businesses."
"This exception for highly-trained workers will protect the high taxation policy which otherwise would become impossible."
"Otherwise, freedom of movement would lead to lower taxes and equalized conditions between Member States."
"The prevailing competition on tax has shown that a lower tax burden favours companies."
"But if they are discriminated against if they stay in their country, and forced to pay tax to their homeland if they leave, then confidence in the EU will evaporate."
"In our country, we are now seeing the principle of living standards dictated by nationality, which enshrines the principle of unequal pay for the same work."
"Scandinavia is a very good example when it comes to a passport union, but it is an equally poor example when it comes to tax."
"There is still a lot to be done when it comes to freedom of movement and freedom itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur and the High Level Panel, chaired by Mrs Veil, for their work."
"I believe that one of the most important successes of the European Union is the single market, which covers much more than the purely economic field."
"This single market also involves new freedoms and opportunities for citizens in their roles as employees, consumers or members of a family."
"So today, Community citizenship has taken on a new dimension."
"Nevertheless, we must be aware of the fact that there are still many difficulties to be faced in order to achieve the complete freedom of movement which should have been possible since 1993."
"The general conclusion is that the existing legislation is adequate."
"So the problem that needs to be solved is ensuring that Community rules are effectively applied and, in my view, that is a great challenge."
"As a member of the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Unemployment and the Media, I can assure you that the existing problems, mainly relating to the recognition of professional and academic qualifications and residence permits, as well as such day-to-day issues as the use of motor vehicles, have direct repercussions on the private and personal lives of citizens and their families."
"Nor must we forget that the lack of available information is to a large extent responsible not only for the obstacles to free movement, but also for a great deal of disappointment when citizens realize that their expectations are not compatible with Community law."
"For example, many people are not aware of the steps which must be taken to ensure that their contributions to social welfare benefits are recognized in another Member State."
"Or to give another example, the costs of transferring money abroad are a serious difficulty for those people - such as pensioners - who live outside their own country for a considerable period of time."
"In my view - and I agree with the report in this respect - gaps such as these could be filled by improving the public information campaigns on the rights of Europeans."
"In the same way, it is essential to promote administrative cooperation between national and Community bodies and institutions, with a view to achieving transparency and comprehension of Community legislation. That would make it easier for citizens to ascertain their rights and obligations."
"It would also be extremely useful to have the opportunity to run training courses for people working in administrative bodies, covering the most commonly encountered problems, so they can be resolved at a level which is closer to the citizens."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize the measures presented in the field of education."
"The study of foreign languages, cultural exchanges, and a consideration of the difficulties facing trainees and people with grants or scholarships are all problems which must be given special attention."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the construction of a common educational territory is, in my opinion, the most important support needed in order to achieve our ultimate objective, the building of an area of true freedom and security within the European Union, towards which we must all strive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mrs Schaffner's report on the report on the free movement of persons produced by the High Level Panel chaired by Simone Veil."
"Of the four fundamental freedoms, it is the freedom of movement and the right to reside anywhere in the Union which are really taking a long, long time to introduce."
"That was why the Commission set up the High Level Panel."
"Their task was to examine any concrete obstacles to the free movement of persons within the Union, and to propose appropriate solutions."
"The High Level Panel concludes that legislation on the free movement of persons already largely exists, and that most problems can be identified and solved without the legislation being amended."
"The Panel considers that the main problem is the implementation of these rights."
"To make it easier for individuals to exercise their rights in practice, the Panel has formulated 80 recommendations, which mainly concern: better information; which rights apply to the freedom of movement; increased cooperation between Member States; better training for national civil servants; and how to make it easier for people to seek work in another Member State."
"I think today's debate is precisely about all these problems."
"The report touches on citizens of non-Member States."
"It mainly deals with how to coordinate the social security system which needs to be extended to cover those citizens completely or partially."
"The High Level Panel also recommends more mobility for citizens of third countries who work in service companies."
"The report is also in favour of mobility for the family members of citizens of third countries, but I would also have expected it to come up with more statements of principle when it comes to citizens of third countries residing legally in our fifteen Member States."
"I believe they expect things of us."
"Mrs Schaffner, the rapporteur, supports the many valuable recommendations from the High Level Panel."
"A number of these recommendations will also be debated here in Parliament, for example in relation to the proposal on supplementary pension rights for workers moving within the Union, and the proposal to extend the social security system to citizens of third countries moving within the Community."
"I share Mrs Schaffner's view that real work is required in the area of information, as regards both the citizens and the authorities."
"As Parliament knows, the Commission has also taken a number of initiatives in this field, such as the EU's Information Programme for the European Citizen which was launched in 1996, and the Carolus programme for the exchange of civil servants between Member States' administrations."
"The aim here is that the legislation covering freedom of movement in the single market should also be applied in practice by all our civil servants."
"In other words, we need civil servants who provide a good service to all our citizens."
"In reply to the report's exhortations to the Commission, I would also like to mention two important measures which have been taken and will help to ensure that the principle of the free movement of persons becomes a reality."
"The first initiative is a plan of action for the single market."
"One of the aims of this plan is to create a single market which will benefit all citizens."
"In order to achieve this, work is now in progress to abolish personal ID checks at borders; review the provisions on housing; defend social rights; and make it easier for people to move around in the labour market within the EU."
"Action is also being taken to improve dialogue with the citizens."
"The other initiative I would like to mention is a plan of action for the free movement of employees, which the Commission of course adopted in November 1997, and which also affects some of the recommendations from the High Level Panel."
"The second proposal made by the High Level Panel will be found in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"On this point, the Commission is working to implement these amendments to the Treaty in the shape of practical policies as quickly as possible."
"I believe both the High Level Panel's report and the Schaffner report provide a good basis for further discussion on what concrete action is needed to achieve real freedom of movement for the citizens of Europe."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be postponed until the High Level Panel's report is available in all languages."
"Enlargement and cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs"
"The next item is the report (A4-0107/98) by Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the implications of enlargement of the European Union for cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs."
"Mr Schulz wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, I refer to Rule 96 of the Rules of Procedure and would ask you not to open the debate now."
"My reasons are as follows. We have 6 minutes left before voting begins."
"Anyone who regularly spends time in the Chamber knows what will happen here in a few minutes time: a very undisciplined mass of Members will pour in, with no interest in any debate."
"That is unfortunate for Mr Posselt, the rapporteur, and Mrs Spaak, the draftsman of opinion, and also for those who are still to speak this afternoon."
"However, it is our duty to carry out these debates in a reasonably acceptable manner, and that is no longer possible."
"Secondly, Mr President, I would ask you to convey the protest of at least the Social Democrat members of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to the Bureau of the European Parliament."
"Every time, we have the extraordinary pleasure of having to debate our reports at a time like this, which I think is inappropriate in view of the importance of the topics."
"Perhaps that could be taken into account in future scheduling."
"It is up to the Presidency to decide whether or not to postpone a debate."
"I can see from your applause that you are in agreement with this, but I will give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Posselt, to allow him to state his position."
"Mr President, I regret the circumstances which have led Mr Schulz to make his justified comment."
"But I think it is completely justified, and I would like to state quite categorically that I wish to protest at the way this part-session is being conducted, both on behalf of my group, and as rapporteur."
"I have absolutely no objection if these reports are discussed on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning."
"I will certainly be here, and I think that each day and hour of the part-session is as important as any other."
"However, I also think there are specific topics which are of interest to a wide public, and the extremely important matter pertaining to the Rules of Procedures which we discussed this morning, which is very important to us internally but is of no public interest, is quite definitely not one of them."
"I wish to protest at the absurdity of us debating matters pertaining to Parliament's Rules of Procedure in the morning, at the most effective time for press coverage, and then postponing the important topics which are of public interest until the evening."
"In accordance with what you have just said, I put it to the House that the debate should be postponed until 5.00 p.m. this evening."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.00 noon)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure of welcoming today a delegation of 12 members of the Maltese Parliament, headed by Mr Spiteri, who are seated in the official gallery."
"The delegation has come to Strasbourg for the tenth meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"Today they have attended meetings with their colleagues from the European Parliament, concerning both Agenda 2000 and Malta's relations with the European Union and its future prospects. There were discussions on the different fields of culture, education, research and development, cooperation on policies concerning immigration and the fight against terrorism and drugs, and the Union's Mediterranean policy, particularly the Euro-Mediterranean process."
"I hope they have a pleasant stay and a very fruitful debate."
"Mr Chichester wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, I wanted to thank you for allowing a gap between the debates this morning and the votes at 12 noon to allow Members to come in and take their seats."
"I am sorry some colleagues have been so tardy in doing so but thank you anyway."
"Votes"
"Mr Dell'Alba has the floor to make a clarification about when this would come into force."
"Mr President, I simply wish to confirm what I requested during the debate: that this regulation should come into force on 14 September, so as to give the subcommittees concerned time to adapt to these new regulations."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Mr President, I would ask for a revision to be made of the translations in the different language versions, in particular the German version, where I have noted that certain translations could give rise to misunderstandings."
"Before the vote on paragraph 8"
"Mr President, before you call a vote on compromise Amendment No 22, I would like to intervene regarding paragraph 8 in its entirety."
"If adopted, this amendment will replace two amendments: Amendment No 11 by the Group of the European United Left and Amendment No 19 by the Europe of Nations Group."
"Naturally, as this is a compromise amendment, it is put to the vote beforehand."
"Well, our Amendment No 19, which referred to paragraph 8, sixth indent, had two objectives: one, to add the words 'more rigorous use' ; the other, to delete part of the text."
"I wanted to say that I am quite prepared to remove the addition of our Amendment No 19, but could we vote separately on the words Amendment No 19 was aiming to delete, in other words, the sixth indent of paragraph 8A - ' the possible incorporation of the EDF into the community budget' ?"
"That is my request."
"You are right, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, the compromise amendment does not exclude the amendments to which you have referred. They will be voted on afterwards."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, we have now taken a vote on this report."
"I assume - gentlemen of the Council of Ministers please take note - that the fact that Parliament has just voted in favour of the motion does not mean that transfer of the reserve resources will happen automatically, but we expect that the assurances given by the Council presidency to this House will also be observed in implementing the resolution in the Council of Ministers."
"Should that not be the case, the resources will remain in the reserve fund, to make it clear to those who must pass a resolution on this in the Council that this opinion is not just one for the wastepaper bin, but that it must be adopted into the directive as we have discussed it here."
"Mr President, what Mr Samland of the Committee on Budgets has just said was obvious to us, of course."
"This view is shared unreservedly by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"I think the Council and its Presidency are aware that they now have to act to make funds available for Bosnia-Herzogovina."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy fully supports what Mr Samland said."
"Mr President, yesterday when Mr Henderson responded to my requests to comment on the various points, I had the impression that he was willing to talk and will remain so over the coming weeks."
"Further to this vote, however, I will interpret my duty as representative of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and of Parliament to mean that I can have a discussion with Mr Henderson on the points to which he has not yet been able to agree, so that we can assert our view as far as possible."
"Some major points concerning the Commission's capacity to act are still to be implemented."
"We must push this through, in the interests not only of Parliament, but also of the European Union as a whole, so that our aid in Bosnia-Herzegovina can finally be effective and we can catch up with the Americans."
"Mr President, I do not want a debate but just so that we understand the relationship between what the Foreign Affairs Committee was recommending and what my colleague, the chairman of the Budgets Committee, has just said, can I just for the record confirm that I was impressed by what Mr Henderson said yesterday as President-in-Office of the Council in responding to our amendments from the seat of the Presidency."
"I am convinced that there will be time now before a final decision is taken in Council for discussions to continue."
"I do not wish to delay, and neither did the Foreign Affairs Committee at any moment wish to delay, the delivery of aid to Bosnia or indeed to delay this regulation."
"I think it is important, on the wider issue of our relationship with the Council on CFSP and other matters, that there be absolute consensus among the groups of this House which is why I did not press this matter, as you know we could have done, earlier."
"I am content now to rest on the assurances we had from Mr Henderson and I am sure now this will actually lead to progress and I will sit down before you hit the hammer."
"Thank you very much, Mr Spencer, but your speech would have been more appropriate during the explanations of vote."
"We will continue with the votes."
"Mr President, I shall be voting against this amendment which refers to the 128 encoding system, for two reasons."
"First of all, the author has been unable to explain to me what this system is, and I would like to say that when someone proposes an amendment with references such as this one, they should at least supply the documents to which it refers."
"My other reason for voting against this amendment is that I have finally been able to find out what it is about."
"It is in fact a very expensive, primarily American bar code system to replace a very simple Eurocode system which will cost next to nothing."
"There is therefore no doubt in my mind that this amendment should be rejected."
"After the vote on the text of Annex 2(8)"
"Mr President, I am terribly sorry to have to point out that there were no voting machines working in this whole row of seats, which can be proved. And we would all have voted against the motion."
"They did not work."
"I am very sorry."
"This will be recorded in the Minutes and the officials will go and test it."
"Mr President, on this side too, there was a whole row, an entire block of voting machines which did not work."
"Could you repeat the vote please?"
"Because I have a feeling there was a more serious reason for them not working. I have a feeling they were switched off."
"Mr Wijsenbeek, since you were once the chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, you know that once the result of a vote has been given, it cannot be repeated."
"There may have been an error in the interpretation of what I said."
"I think that was the case."
"(The President repeated the vote)"
"Mr President, I do not know why, but during these last few votes there was a clear divergence between the numbers you read out and the numbers listed on my group's voting list, which in fact correspond with the numbers some of the other groups have."
"That is why there is clearly some confusion over exactly what we are voting on."
"Could you please call out the numbers, Mr President?"
"Because I have votes here, for example, on Amendments Nos 21 and 25, and on a number of original sections of texts, but it is not completely clear what is covered."
"I think this is an important subject, so I want to know exactly what we are voting on."
"Mr de Vries, we have just put the original text of Annex 2(8) to the vote."
"After the vote on Annex 3"
"Mr President, I would like to inform you that I am present in the Chamber, I am voting and my machine is voting."
"Thank you very much, Mr Falconer."
"That will be noted."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Could you inform the House, before we start Mrs Lalumière's report, whether there are any appels nominaux in the course of the vote?"
"I believe there is no roll-call vote, Mrs Jackson."
"I will announce it as the texts are put to the vote."
"Mr President, does not the advice you just issued to Mrs Jackson defeat the object of the exercise?"
"If we know there are no roll-call votes we can all go out now and have lunch!"
"Mr Falconer, I am sure the Members of this House do not need to be told in advance whether or not there are any roll-call votes in order to fulfil their duty."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 5"
"Mr President, as the objectives of the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists accommodate each other very well, we also agree with the amendment of the Socialist Group if they agree to insert the word 'democratic' before the word 'Russia' ."
"The sentence would then read: ' considers that the European Union must develop special links with a democratic Russia...' ."
"(Parliament approved the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, the air in here is not just very warm, but stifling. It is affecting our concentration."
"May I ask to have it checked so that the air in this Chamber is better at 3.00 p.m."
"I will pass this on to the House's services so that they can confirm your request and look into the matter."
"The European Parliament report on the guidelines for the forthcoming 1999 budget is written in diplomatic language and is at pains to mask the two major contradictions which need to be addressed, that of the Structural Funds and that of the single currency, not to mention the question of enlargement which will come later."
"On the subject of Structural Funds, the application of the 1993-1999 financial forecasts, approved by the 1992 Edinburgh Summit, would, given the late payments, give the 1999 budget a figure of 1.325 % of Community GNP in credit commitments and 1.235 % in payment credits, in other words considerably above the ceiling of 1.10 % allocated in January during the orientation debate (which in turn was lower than the maximum of 1.27 % allocated in Edinburgh)."
"This progression raises the question of Structural Fund inflation and the fund's usefulness, which has already been highlighted by my group in a recent study entitled 'Welfare Europe or Europe of the Nations' ."
"It also raises the question of the legal nature of the interinstitutional agreements such as Edinburgh which claim to definitively link Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"It is quite clear that these agreements do not have the status of a Treaty and that the Council in particular still has the right to change its mind when circumstances dictate."
"The second problem concerns the implementation of the single currency."
"We can predict with certainty that this will lead to an increase in Community spending on inter-regional rebalancing."
"This guideline will go against Member States' wishes to continue to reduce their public deficits in the years to come (as the figure of 3 % is a ceiling, not an ideal level), and in a wider sense to keep Community expenditure within reasonable limits."
"Will this upwards pressure on expenditure be felt in the next year if the euro comes into effect on 1 January 1999?"
"The resolution of the European Parliament suggests that this will come to nothing, and that is perhaps true since the full effects of the new system will not be felt immediately."
"However, Parliament is prudently arranging an escape route by stating that the Union's budget must always conform to the terms of article F3 of the Treaty of European Union, according to which: ' the Union shall equip itself with the necessary means to achieve its objectives and carry out its policies effectively' ."
"The Commission has set out the guidelines for the pre-draft of the budget by highlighting the need to adopt a strict budget in order to alleviate the tasks expected of Member States preparing for EMU."
"The budget is intended to increase by 3 % whilst monetary depreciation in the Member States stands at 1.8 % on average."
"In real terms, the increase in the budget should therefore be of the order of 1.2 %."
"However, when the principal budget items are analyzed, the wide range of the changes becomes clear: namely +8 % for the Structural Funds, +3 % for the programmes aimed at the central and eastern European and Mediterranean countries, +3 % for internal policies and 0 % for the agricultural budget."
"We can therefore deduce that the agricultural budget is considered by the Commission to be a secondary item, despite the fact that in 1997, farmers' incomes dropped by roughly 3 % and agricultural expenditure was significantly lower than provided for in the agricultural section of the guidelines."
"Our group is asking for an increase in agricultural spending in 1999 of an amount equivalent to that put forward in the pre-draft of the budget and in the draft of the 1998 budget."
"It is important to reiterate that the final 1998 budget was reduced by ECU 550 million."
"To this end, our group has submitted six amendments to the conclusions of Mrs Dührkop Dührkop's report."
"In fact it needs repeating that it is essential to continue to subsidize incomes according to the measures set out in the 1992 CAP reforms, or else the credibility of the CAP - the aim of which is to guarantee a viable rural environment - would be jeopardized."
"An examination of the agricultural proposals of the Santer Package, presented to us on 18 March last, raises a great many questions about the future of the CAP."
"If the principle of income subsidies is flouted in the draft 1999 budget, our fears will be fully justified."
"Given the state of mind of the Commission and the European Parliament, we wanted to reiterate in another amendment the compulsory nature of agricultural spending in terms both of the level of pricing and of income subsidies."
"Finally, as rapporteur for the 1998-1999 agricultural prices, I have been able to carry out a detailed analysis of the Commission's proposals."
"As Commissioner Fischler said, the package price remains stable virtually in its entirety."
"In reality, as I have already told my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, agricultural prices and subsidies will see a twofold drop: firstly due to the 1.8 % monetary depreciation in relation to the previous year and secondly, as of 1 January 1999, a drop of approximately 3 % for those Member States participating in the euro, due to the withdrawal of the green ECU."
"There is no trace of any compensation for the loss of income associated with the green ECU in the budget pre-draft."
"The farmers are therefore going to get the impression that they alone are financing the implementation of the euro, both through the resultant budgetary constraints and through the withdrawal of the green ECU."
"This situation cannot be tolerated!"
"The 1999 budget will be the last European Union budget before the Council of Ministers adopts the new 2000-2006 financial perspectives and the euro becomes a reality."
"Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has found herself on the horns of a difficult dilemma, namely how to maintain the strict budgetary controls adopted by the Member States whilst incorporating into the European budget the financial consequences of the third stage of economic and monetary union, the Treaty of Amsterdam, Agenda 2000, and the pre-accession of the central and eastern European countries."
"There is no response to this question in the report."
"On the contrary, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop attempts to reconcile conflicting interests without identifying actual priorities and satisfying the various parties and lobbies who enjoy the Community manna."
"With the exception of agriculture, which is strictly ring-fenced, there seem to be no strict budgetary controls."
"Paradoxically, with the ECU 150 million adopted at the Luxembourg Summit, employment looks like the poor relation in the European budget."
"In truth, only simple cosmetic measures have been taken."
"This budgetary conformism accurately sums up the budgetary guidelines of the European Parliament for 1999."
"It does not break with its bad traditions, which we have challenged on numerous occasions, namely: clientelism, fraud, wastage, politicization and United Nations embezzlement."
"Cabrol report (A4-0112/98)"
"I always pay attention to the work our colleague Mr Cabrol does in this House because he contributes valuable and extremely precise professional help, together with a tremendous sense of responsibility in the area of public health."
"I also believe that the amendments proposed by the rapporteur point towards increased safety for both donors and recipients."
"In that sense, they can restore confidence to both parties, which is something that is much needed."
"However, we must not forget the problems associated with a lack of blood and derived products within the European Union."
"The quality and safety criteria are happily taken into account by the Commission."
"These measures will be instrumental in wiping out the stigmas caused by the contaminated blood crisis and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in France and in Europe."
"Although we might consider that there is now virtually no risk as regards AIDS, it is vital that we take all known measures to eradicate all risks of transmitting the BSE agent."
"Mr Cabrol's amendments meet this safety requirement."
"As regards imported blood, we must, at all costs, avoid repeating past errors so that the recipients of blood transfusions can once again have complete confidence in the procedure."
"There is a heightened duty of transparency and vigilance."
"Finally, I would like to insist upon blood and plasma donations remaining free."
"That is the only way to avoid corruption."
"This point needed repeating, and that has been done in the report."
"There are many of us who fight for this - whether blood donors like myself or not - and who support these proposals."
"Timely and reliable clinical and laboratory control is a necessary precondition for the collection and provision of blood."
"In this connection, the proposals contained in the Cabrol report are especially significant and are a positive step aimed to guarantee the monitoring which must be carried out both on the donors and on the storing and availability of blood supplies and blood products."
"We consider that, to avoid a repetition of the defective monitoring procedures that are becoming ever more widespread in the EU, resulting in the spread of serious diseases that have justifiably given rise to social unease, responsibility for the collection and provision of blood and blood products must be assumed exclusively by public organizations which have the necessary experience and infrastructure. At the same time we must ensure that this vital treatment, which offers substantial help to those suffering from serious chronic conditions or diseases which require the immediate intervention of the medical services, does not become a means for unaccountable large multinational corporations to indulge in profiteering."
"Moreover, the products of blood donation, which must be voluntary and not undertaken in return for payment, must be made available free of charge for those in need."
"The coincidental problem of the long-term lack of blood at national level calls for common regulations to be implemented by national bodies, with a permanent system of continuous intercommunication on the system of blood donation, existing supplies, and methods for storing and transporting these supplies. This will ensure the timely and safe use of these reserves throughout Europe."
"We cannot legislate for morals."
"However, it behoves us to guarantee all those preconditions that will ward off anything that is opposed to individual and social rights to health and life."
"Raising the awareness of the general public, ensuring the highest level of scientific research, and monitoring national and scientific bodies to prevent the production of products which will threaten an individual's health, are necessary safeguards against the criminal phenomena of distributing contaminated blood and blood products."
"We accept the need for checks on the blood that is collected, and we demand regular analysis and monitoring of data on the indicators of viral diseases in an attempt to prevent the danger of them spreading. However, we must denounce attempts to create a new apartheid with the proposals that have been made regarding the exclusion of donors who have travelled to Africa."
"Moreover, we must express our deepest concern about attempts to introduce, under the guise of health protection measures, the unacceptable measures provided for in the Schengen Agreement concerning the invasion of an individual's private life through the setting up of questionnaires relating to their sexual behaviour and sexual relations. These measures do not avert any danger whatsoever - they are merely being used as a pretext to make the violation of the private life and dignity of the individual both socially acceptable and commonplace."
"I would like to thank and congratulate Professor Cabrol on his report on the Council's recommendation concerning the admissibility of blood and plasma donors and the tests carried out on blood donor samples in the European Union."
"I would like to make a point of restating that both on ethical grounds and in order to guarantee the safety of blood products, blood donors and blood users, it is absolutely vital that donations remain free and are done on a voluntary basis."
"This text should pave the way for achieving the highest level of safety."
"The donor exclusion criteria which should prevail throughout Community territory, as set out in Annex 5 - with the exception of the criteria excluding homosexual men which seemed to me to be wholly discriminatory - will help to provide this level of safety, which each citizen has a right to expect."
"Furthermore, the setting up of a single donor registration and identification system common to all the Member States certainly constitutes a step forward."
"It will be much quicker to consult the resultant centralized database and this will provide an added product safety measure."
"Needless to say, this data must remain strictly confidential, and one of the main guarantees of this is the donor identification encoding system which is unique and common to all the States."
"It might seem astonishing that a Member should vote against a report whose goals he shares."
"Of course, everybody is in favour of improving the safety of transfusions and therefore of surrounding blood donations with precautions aimed at protecting the health of the recipients."
"But the guarantee so given must be on technical grounds and must not disguise political, moral or religious beliefs."
"It therefore seems to me that the Council's recommendation - barely improved by the proposals of our committee and its rapporteur - distances itself from concerns for public health to give a normative legal value to highly discriminatory prejudices."
"In the first place, building a database of people excluded from giving blood is contrary to the principal of confidentiality which must go hand in hand with the detection and treatment of certain illnesses, particularly AIDS."
"Even if it were possible to guarantee the confidentiality of the database, it would still supply personal information about these illnesses to persons other than the sufferers and the doctors treating them, which is in contradiction to the rules adopted in most countries of the Union."
"Above all, section 5 of the explanatory statement, recitals 21 and 25, and paragraph 5 of the recommendation of Annex 2 of this text are completely unacceptable when taken together."
"It emerges that from the Council's point of view, the following are excluded from giving blood and should possibly be filed as such: homosexual men; persons who have had sexual relations in Africa; and persons who have been sexually active in another country - to be specified - other than Africa."
"In addition, journeys outside Western Europe and North America should also be declared."
"What emerges from these proposals is that for the pseudo-scientists who drew up this text, the threat posed by a person cannot be attributed to risky behaviour - which is something that everybody could understand and accept - but to their sexual orientation, the place where they live and their race."
"The European Parliament would be doing itself a service by refusing such proposals a great deal more energetically than has the rapporteur."
"We have already seen through other recent reports that the road to hell is often paved with good intentions."
"Our very legitimate compassion for the victims of transfusion accidents must not be allowed to eclipse the principles of non-discrimination upon which the European Union is founded, nor should it be allowed to encroach in even the slightest way on essential civil liberties."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of Mr Cabrol's report."
"The report, which is a recommendation to Member States, underpins the Danish desire for voluntary and unpaid blood donations."
"Article 129 of the Amsterdam Treaty introduces a high level of health protection in Community policy, including measures aimed at setting high standards with regard to quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin, blood and plasma."
"This is to prevent blood and plasma from becoming common commodities."
"I would like to congratulate our colleague, Professor Cabrol, on his report on the Council's recommendation concerning the admissibility of blood and plasma donors and on the screening methods used for blood donations in the European Community."
"This recommendation is aimed at providing a high level of safety, and for this reason donations must be both voluntary and free."
"Donors must also answer a series of questions which are listed in Annex 2, and must meet certain criteria which are listed in Annex 5 and which, of course, should not be discriminatory."
"A single, common system for the whole Community territory for the purpose of identifying and registering donors and related data would provide much quicker access and consultation."
"The confidentiality of such information would, furthermore, be guaranteed by an identification encoding system."
"Lalumière report (A4-0060/98)"
"Mr President, I abstained from the voting on the Lalumière report, although it is really excellent."
"However, some amendments have diluted the report somewhat."
"The report does justice to the task, accurately describing Russia as one of the European Union's major partners and specifying a clear strategy for the European Union's cooperation with Russia."
"However, I regret that talking about the question of Russia's membership or non-membership of the European Union gave the impression that this was under discussion."
"It was not, and is not, under discussion."
"If that is made clear, I think we may be content with the report."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Lalumière's report."
"It is an extremely important one."
"However, I would like to point out that some of its content does not entirely reflect my own views on foreign and security policy, especially in connection with EU/WEU/NATO- Russian cooperation."
"But I think it is essential that the EU should give its support in any way it can to developing relations and cooperation between NATO and Russia."
"That is why this report is an important one."
"I voted for it, although I cannot completely agree the solutions which were approved in the part-session."
"This report, on a subject which is acknowledged to be difficult, and presented by our colleague Catherine Lalumière, is important for several reasons and great care has gone into producing it."
"This is no less that we would have expected from its author, whom I would like to congratulate most warmly."
"Although everybody can rejoice at the economic and democratic transition which is forging steadily on, real questions and worries remain."
"I believe it is vital to enter into real collaboration against organized crime since this appears as an ever growing threat not only in Russia, but in the whole of Europe."
"Needless to say, this collaboration will not be possible without the participation of Russia, by means of a frontal assault on the corruption which is endemic to the country."
"This effort will also provide a solid basis for lasting and healthy economic relations between the European Union and Russia."
"There can be no true area of free exchange without this pre-condition."
"We must be able to say this to our Russian counterparts. But are they capable of listening?"
"With the dismantling of the USSR and its satellites came the hope of a peaceful and stable Europe."
"However, the reality is far from this."
"Of course, we might legitimately think that the risk of a major conflict has gone, but Yugoslavia and Kosovo are there to remind us that low intensity conflicts can still arise which could lead to major crises."
"Finally, whilst reiterating my support for this text, I would also like to emphasize that I share Mrs Lalumière's position on not inviting Russia to join the European Union."
"It seems to me that this is a position which none of the parties want."
"It would be far better for another democratic body to be organized in the East around Russia, which could negotiate economic, cultural and political agreements with the European Union."
"Relations between Member States of the European Union and Russia can only be based on equality and mutual benefit."
"Institutions expressing the interests of large multinational corporations are making concerted efforts to make the people of Russia serve their illegal interests. Unfortunately the European Union, in complying with the dictates pronounced by NATO, is also attempting to form in Russia a developmental model which is consistent with its own interests, while remaining indifferent not only to the repercussions this will have on the Russian people but also to the dangers of destabilization and conflagration in the region."
"Following the overthrow of the USSR and the promotion and support, direct or indirect, of the so-called Russian Mafia, which controls a large section of the economic and therefore the social life of the country, plans are being pushed through to strengthen the process of democratization, which aims to completely marginalize the Russian people and to subject them to the geopolitical dictates of NATO and the USA."
"The enlargements of NATO and of the European Union aim to create a new border, which will bring NATO forces and interests into direct contact with Russia."
"It is to be noted that European Union strategy with regard to Russia promotes reform of the latter's political structure, by means of funding programmes, and especially by means of the TACIS programme, to the point where the need for the emergence of a middle class to support political power is underlined."
"In the context of the new carving up of the markets, there is an attempt by large monopolistic interests in the European Union to secure the Russian market for their own economic and geopolitical interests, thereby intensifying the exploitation of working people."
"We support proposals which are aimed at direct contact and dialogue between analogous bodies and institutions in Russia, the European Union and its Member States, whose aim will be to look for opportunities and to fashion agreements for the development of cooperation on all sides. Such cooperation will fulfil the need to create an area of peace and prosperity in Europe and to avoid friction and conflict between the various parties."
"We are radically opposed, however, to the substance given today by the European Union to the promotion of a dialogue, the sole aim of which is to overcome the resistance of this country to accepting the leading role of the USA, closely followed by the European Union, in Europe and throughout the world."
"It is crucial for the European Union radically to change its position, to reexamine the objectives it has set itself and the methods it uses, and to accept the significant role that Russia is being called upon to play in developments both in Europe and further afield. The European Union must recognize the fact that only through equal relations based on mutual benefit will peace and stability be guaranteed in the region, and it must allow Russia to heal the wounds caused by the overthrow of the USSR in the way it chooses."
"Russia is an unstable country in terms of democracy."
"What we have to prevent at all costs is the construction of an EU and European partnership which Russia perceives as a threat."
"This can be done by integrating Russia in European cooperation as far as possible."
"This includes NATO, which the report does not cover."
"To keep on building the EU up towards a kind of EU state is the worst possible way of establishing good relations with Russia."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has voted in favour of Mrs Lalumière's own-initiative report on the future of our relations with Russia."
"The general tone of the text is correct when it highlights the fact that the current weakening of Russia represents a transition in its history, and that the equilibrium of the European continent will largely be determined in the coming years by the role Russia plays."
"Our own development is also linked to that of Russia: we need only think of the vast untapped energy reserves and natural resources in Siberia, which Russia must exploit with our active help."
"The priority given by the rapporteur to consolidating Russian society is completely pertinent."
"Let us not confuse the Russia of today with an emerging country whose financial difficulties can be alleviated with traditional financial aid."
"First of all, the new democratic Russia needs us to take into consideration the huge efforts it must make to overcome the legacy of 80 years of communism."
"We must help Russia overcome the traumas left behind by 80 years of a planned economy and abnegation of political and social life by single party rule, the outcome of which is the absence of an elite trained in anything other than nomenklatura , the absence of a middle-class, and the absence of a long period of maturation of a civil society."
"Gaps like these cannot be made up in one day!"
"They must start from scratch: after a very long and painful hiatus, Russia must get back to the dynamism and poise it enjoyed at the beginning of the century, which the revolution of 1917 stopped dead in its tracks."
"The Lalumière report has the merit of deliberately placing itself outside the two stereotypical visions of today's Russia, namely the anecdotal and catastrophic view disseminated all too frequently by our media and the menacing view maintained by those who have not yet understood the magnitude of the transformations which have already taken place and who want to think of Yeltsin's Russia as simply a continuation of Brezhnev's USSR."
"However, those who knew Brezhnev's USSR and witnessed the first Russian democratic presidential elections are in a position to measure the chasm separating the two eras."
"The Russian people fairly and squarely turned the page and rejected the Communist regime in free and open elections."
"It is with this Russia, which has emerged from the Soviet Union which had engulfed and disfigured it, that we must increase our ties."
"We must renew the old links and develop new relationships at all levels, the main one being, of course, intergovernmental relations, a point on which the rapporteur remains much too discrete."
"It is actually up to the heads of state and government and those who want to see an active Russian policy to break free from the attitude of distant observation which has been all too prevalent up till now, to draw up guidelines for intensive cooperation with ambitious and bold objectives, and to resolutely back the Russian reformers."
"We should congratulate ourselves on the confident atmosphere surrounding the recent tripartite summit between the Presidents of France and Russia and the German Chancellor."
"The Community cooperation programmes can make a useful contribution towards the development of a vast partnership in all domains."
"True, as set out in paragraph 31, strict controls over the funds allocated to Russia must be observed, but the rapporteur could have insisted in a symmetrical article on the need for the Commission to exercise equally strict controls over its own services operating on Russian soil, which have not always given the impression of integrity and professionalism which we would all like to promote."
"Whatever happens, the Member States of the European Union must guard against their actions being driven by the politics of the bloc which the Russians themselves rejected, which would carry the risk of very quickly erecting a new and completely artificial wall on the continent of Europe."
"Certainly, security - our security - now involves cooperation with Russia."
"In this respect, it is particularly regrettable that the majority of the European members of NATO allowed Washington to impose an enlargement of the organization upon them, an act guaranteed to further raise the suspicions of the Russian leaders and mar Russian opinion rather than inspire confidence."
"It is high time Europeans overcame their reluctance, their mistrust, their stubborn prejudices and the inertia generated by years of the Cold War and fundamentally changed their approach to defence and the way it should be organized by closely linking it with Russia."
"(The sitting was suspended at 13.34 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0391/98 by Mr Bertens and Mr Eisma, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on the forest fires in Brazil; -B4-0396/98 by Mr Dell'Alba and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the forest fires devastating the north of Brazil; -B4-0404/98 by Mr Azzolini and others, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on tropical forest fires in South America and South-East Asia; -B4-0405/98 by Mr González Álvarez and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the forest fires in Brazil; -B4-0410/98 by Mrs van Putten and Mr Newens, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the forest fires in Latin America and South-East Asia; -B4-0415/98 by Mr Habsburg-Lothringen and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the serious problems caused by the weather phenomenon El Niño in particular in Peru and Ecuador; -B4-0418/98 by Mr Telkämper and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the new forest fires in South-East Asia; -B4-0421/98 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the forest fires in Brazil."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, in Latin America, Brazil and Asia the world's lungs are on fire."
"Kalimantan and Brazil have been ravaged by massive fires for weeks."
"The Brazilian Government is refusing help - let us not beat around the bush - and in doing so appears to be supporting the large landowners."
"It is a disgrace that short-term economic gain is pursued this way, at the expense of the most beautiful and most vital parts of the natural world."
"Europe should not stand idly by."
"It is in our interest that these fires should be extinguished as soon as possible."
"We should put pressure on the countries concerned to accept all international support, and the European Union should give technical aid alongside the United Nations towards actually extinguishing the fires."
"Existing European Union budget lines are not being effectively utilized, or at least not sufficiently."
"Obviously, structural measures must also be taken to prevent a repeat of these disasters."
"Countries in South-East Asia and Latin America must implement effective legislation and take different measures to combat the slash-and-burn methods, or manage them better."
"The Commission should also move more quickly in drawing up guidelines for importing tropical hardwood into the Union."
"More support must be given to the sustainable management of crops, whilst the Mega-Rice project should be examined critically, at the very least."
"We must prevent erosion and further deforestation."
"The Union could take the initiative and organize an international conference on the issue."
"I hope Parliament will support my amendment on this shortly."
"Lastly, Mr President, El Niño is blamed for everything."
"Let those countries remember that El Niño will have grown up before too long, and that the situation will only get worse."
"For the moment, they can still control this child."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, I would like to put a preliminary question in this debate on disasters."
"The European Parliament has considered this phenomenon, this problem of disasters, with remarkable regularity every month. We take decisions, but most of the time we have no idea how those decisions are followed up."
"What I mean is those decisions do not get any further than being mere declarations of intent or solidarity, because any possibility for financial support to mitigate the effects of disasters has been withdrawn from the Budget."
"That is why, following up a suggestion we put forward here three or four months ago, we think the Commission should implement a Community strategy defining not only the kind of actions to take but also how they should be followed up, with regular constant monitoring of results."
"In this case we are not dealing with a disaster on European territory, but one in a particularly sensitive and important area, namely Amazonia, the very lung of the world."
"And the news from Amazonia is worrying."
"According to a note I received today from the Brazilian Embassy, the most recent reports indicate that there are twenty fires burning along a line stretching nearly 400 kilometres. Satellite photographs also show fires of similar intensity in Guyana, and of greater intensity in Venezuela."
"The note also emphasizes that there are nearly a thousand firemen in the area, particularly from the Argentine Fire Brigade, awaiting the arrival of a further 500 men and specialists from the United Nations."
"What happens in Amazonia or the great tropical forests - whether in Indonesia or Africa - is obviously of world-wide concern."
"This, therefore, is a problem of international concern and responsibility, which requires an international combination of efforts, assistance and solidarity."
"I do not think it is enough to accuse those countries of inertia or negligence."
"In our opinion, so far as Amazonia is concerned, there should be an international treaty or agreement involving all the countries of the Amazon, under the auspices of the United Nations, clearly defining a policy of protection and sustained development for the whole of that area."
"The international community should contribute to the technical effort in terms of human and financial resources."
"In our opinion, the European Union also has an important role to play here."
"We support the proposal put forward in the joint motion for a resolution on the G8 meeting."
"We think that would be an forum of sufficient importance, with the necessary powers to hammer out a solution to this problem."
"Finally, I should like to ask when there will be a clear common EU policy on forests."
"We do not think the present policy is bold or supportive enough, particularly as regards the reforestation of the southern regions, which are threatened with increasing desertification."
"We should not leave the protection of forests to others."
"It is also in the interests of the world that we Europeans should look after our own."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the tropical forest fires in Indonesia were started by criminals and that the Indonesian Government is certainly implicated."
"We are familiar with the system of concessions."
"There is always a promoter on hand to slip a bulging envelope to a member of the government or a member of their family, then, once the tropical wood has been exploited, the land is turned into plantations."
"I think that the NGOs' appeals for a boycott of tropical wood are completely justified, and now more so than ever."
"We must find a system which guarantees transparency for consumers, particularly by supporting certification systems such as the Forests Stewardship Council system."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to state that I am very pleased that this resolution means we are examining the forest fires in Brazil and Indonesia."
"However, our urgency gives rise to a dual approach to a certain extent, because we are combining two elements here: the 'self-induced' if you like, or environmental disasters and forest fires caused by man; and the El Niño phenomenon, which has had a far more widespread effect than the forest fires."
"Both must be dealt with, both are necessary, and I would say that these are two disasters which complement each other, but are not necessary connected."
"We are currently talking about Brazil and Indonesia."
"When we add El Niño to this, it will be many more countries tomorrow, and perhaps even ourselves the day after that."
"I received some information from the Peruvian Embassy this morning about the damage caused in that country so far by El Niño."
"The number of dead is currently around 300, with 70 000 homeless, 15 000 homes destroyed, 120 bridges broken, the main hydroelectric plant at Machu Pichu completely wrecked by landslides, and about US$ 1.2 billion's worth of damage."
"That is about 3.5 % of the country's gross domestic product."
"If we consider the scale of the destruction - which affects not only Peru but also Ecuador, and could just as easily affect Brazil or Indonesia - it is very clear to me that far greater international solidarity is required of us. We must discuss in more detail firstly how we can exert influence to mitigate the effects of the El Niño phenomenon as much as possible, and secondly how we can cope with these disasters and also exert a certain amount of pressure on the appropriate governments."
"I would like to state in this respect that it is very regrettable that the plenary session of the Earth Summit in New York in 1997 rejected the international Global Forest Convention, which was tabled by the European Union, amongst others."
"As we are talking about forest fires so much, I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission and those responsible to table this Convention again at the next possible opportunity, because it is urgently required at international level."
"Mr President, on 15 January about 40 000 indigenous people and small peasants lost their villages, provisions and fields."
"So far, a quarter of the Brazilian state of Roraima has been destroyed by forest fires."
"This is as much as Belgium and the Netherlands put together."
"The Brazilian Government, however, has been more than reluctant to help, and even more reluctant to ask for international aid."
"The first time it asked for this was only two weeks ago and, by that time, the international press had already pushed the alarm bells and the President finally had to admit that there was a catastrophe in the region."
"It is not just a catastrophe, it is also a man-made tragedy."
"The Government does nothing to stop the fires because there are big-money interests involved."
"Brazil has given large concessions to international mining companies but, as the area is rich in mineral resources, the Indian reservations have always been an obstacle to the mining companies' interests."
"As far as they are concerned, the full destruction of the area is welcome because it is the easiest way of getting rid of the indigenous problem."
"According to scientists, it will take about a hundred years or more before the people there will have forests and a normal, natural life again."
"That is to say that for about a hundred years there will be no Indians to annoy the mining interests."
"The Indians have the right to use the land but do not have the right to what is underneath it."
"In other words, they will not get a penny from the mining."
"What is more, not even the Brazilian people will profit from the mining resources which will be sent out of the country to the industrialized countries."
"I really think it is very tokenistic to ask for some aid programmes for the area."
"We really need to ask whether the economic model of plundering natural resources, without any regard for the people or the ecology, is acceptable."
"What is going on here is neoliberalism, which is very similar to neocolonialism, and it is being done with the help of the Brazilian Government."
"If this is the outcome of our international trade agreements, I really think we have to start changing this situation and changing it quickly."
"Mr President, destructive fires on a vast scale in both South America and South-East Asia have caused unprecedented damage to the world's rainforests over the last year."
"In the state of Roraima in Brazil, reports indicate that 700 000 hectares of pasture and forest were destroyed in three months and, up to very recently, a line of fire stretched for some 400 kilometres."
"Mercifully, heavy rain has now come to the aid of the firefighters from Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela who have been seeking to stop the advance of this disastrous conflagration, and many of the fires have been put out."
"It is vital, however, that a new strategy be adopted if the rainforests are to survive."
"Amazonia is the home of an incredibly rich variety of plant life, terrestrial species and several hundred AmerIndian cultures."
"Rainforests everywhere also have enormous importance for environmental and climatic conditions throughout the world."
"It is deeply worrying that greater resources were not made available at an earlier stage to fight the fires."
"Preparations need to be made for a much more effective and earlier response in future."
"The European Union, its Member States and the United Nations should participate."
"Perhaps the matter can be given priority at the so-called G8 meeting in May, taking place in Birmingham in the United Kingdom."
"The El Niño phenomenon made a large contribution, but the fires were largely caused by slash-and-burn methods of agriculture, and then got out of control."
"What occurred this year could be a forerunner of still worse fires in the future."
"It is vital that preventive steps be taken beforehand."
"Land reform to provide the landless with alternatives to clearing the forests, effective legislation and provision of guidance to prevent reckless burning are desperately required."
"As in South-East Asia, logging should be stopped."
"Destruction of the forests should be brought to a halt."
"In 1995, apart from fires, 29 000 square kilometres of forest were cleared - an all-time high."
"Although the Brazilian Government restricted clearing to 20 % of any holding, holdings of less than 250 hectares were exempted."
"While we respect the sovereign rights of the people of developing countries, protection of the rainforest and the prevention of fires is in their interests even more than those of the world as a whole."
"International assistance has been provided through the World Bank, but the experiences of the last year in South-East Asia and South America underline the need for a new strategy to be adopted now."
"I very much hope that the Commission will be prepared to tell us something about the input it is prepared to make in the process of working out and implementing such a new strategy."
"Mr President, the environmental tragedies that have affected Brazil and South-East Asia are further proof, if that were necessary, that market forces should not and cannot be the only guidelines followed by the national and international communities."
"Many natural and other disasters in recent years, and many of the unsustainable situations with regard to environmental pollution suffered by capitals worldwide, are the result of a lack of self-control of the imaginary market rules."
"The market, for example, requires an ever greater number of cars to be produced and sold, but the same market does not care that our European cities are already full of cars, that our children no longer have any space to play in, that the air is unbreathable and the historic centres are sustaining irreparable damage to their cultural wealth."
"All this affirms that it is not market forces but politics - and, therefore, the primary interests of the people and communities - that should direct or guide our ways of life."
"We now come to the point we are dealing with: the fires and destruction of the tropical forests in Amazonia and South-East Asia."
"There is no doubt that these devastating fires are the result of commercial greed and a blinkered outlook on life."
"You need to be blind and insensitive not to see the disastrous consequences for everyone, and for the speculators themselves, resulting from these natural disasters: hectares and hectares of forest going up in smoke coincide with the overheating of the earth's atmosphere, with the creation of phenomena such as the greenhouse effect and El Niño causing flooding, hurricanes and extraordinary climatic changes worldwide."
"Politics are therefore not dying, and should not die."
"Nation states or supranational communities, such as the European Union in part, should do everything possible."
"They should reach agreements and find the appropriate means of pressure so that these states or speculators with no interest in health or the future of the earth's atmosphere are made to see reason, within the scope of the international community."
"If the Black Sea is one of the most polluting seas in the world and this sea flows into the Mediterranean, the coastal countries cannot fail to intervene to end this lethal pollution."
"The same applies to the fires in the Asian tropical and subtropical forests."
"Mr President, I will use this additional time you have granted me to welcome Commissioner Pinheiro and to welcome the decision of the Commission which, in Solomonic fashion, as we are dealing with Asia and Latin America, thought of asking the Commissioner responsible for Africa to reply."
"We are certainly very concerned, and we are pleased that it has been possible to include this subject as an absolute priority among the urgent matters to be dealt with at this sitting."
"We are very aware that, beyond El Niño, human responsibility is very high, both in the Asian continent and with regard to the Brazilian authorities, which are still delaying the arrival of the United Nations mission that should have become operational several days ago."
"I have to say, however, that we are very concerned, Commissioner Pinheiro, about the state of use of the EU budget line for tropical forests, which was keenly desired by our Parliament, a line which, as you know, in the same way as many lines relating to foreign actions, has sustained considerable delays of execution."
"We are asking for one more effort to be made, with this resolution."
"Mr President, the European Commission is very closely following the latest developments in South-East Asia, and in particular in Indonesia, ever since the outbreak of large-scale forest fires in 1997."
"While rains have occurred in Sumatra and Java, the rest of the country is dry and may continue to be dry until May 1998."
"The recurrence of fire hotspots was detected on 19 January with prevailing fires occurring mostly in the northern areas of East Kalimantan where rain has not fallen since December 1997."
"As you are aware, the Commission in the short term has no other means of responding than with humanitarian assistance."
"I am pleased to say that my colleague, Emma Bonino, through ECHO has allocated more than ECU 1.5 million to alleviate the acute needs of food and health care in Indonesia, in particular in the regions most severely affected by the fires and drought."
"The funds have been channelled through the International Committee of the Red Cross and also Médecins sans frontières de Belgique ."
"A mission will be carried out by ECHO to Indonesia in April to assess further humanitarian needs in vulnerable areas, including Kalimantan."
"The mission will enable the Commission to programme its assistance in 1998 to areas where humanitarian needs are most urgent."
"Also, and in a more long-term perspective, the Commission and Member States in Jakarta set up in 1997 a joint European Union Fire Response Group (EUFREG) composed of forest fire experts from various Commission and Member State projects in Indonesia."
"The task of the Response Group is to provide the Government with relevant information and advice if needed, to monitor and assess the situation on a day-to-day basis and to assess possible needs, for example, regarding fire-fighting equipment, to improve the efficiency of measures taken by the Government."
"At the same time, the Commission is working with the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team in order to assess the regional impact on a short and long-term basis of phenomena such as El Niño."
"We will continue to fund the project on fire prevention and control in South Sumatra which we hope will be a pilot case that could be extended to other regions."
"As regards Brazil, we have heard today that, thanks to the rain that has fallen in the last few hours, roughly 90 % of the fires are now virtually extinguished and this is good news."
"As far as we understand, more than 34 000 sq km have been devastated by this fire in Roraima."
"In the short term, the European Community Humanitarian Office - ECHO - envisages channelling funds towards the communities affected by the forest fires, namely indigenous communities."
"Several European non-governmental organizations have shown their interest in working in the affected areas."
"ECHO is proceeding to analyse their requests for funding, and a meeting is being held today, 2 April, at the Delegation of the European Commission in Brasilia."
"At this meeting, among others, are participating Oxfam, the Indigenous Council of Roraima and representatives of Member State embassies to coordinate European aid."
"However, as several honourable Members have mentioned, the problem is not just a short-term problem: it is also the long-term prospects for sustainable management and a sustainable policy in tropical forests."
"I am happy to say that the European Union has been financing some projects in that regard."
"One known as PRODESQ concerns fire monitoring and afforestation control and the second one, known as ECOFORCA, aims at developing and applying low-cost monitoring technologies for the detection of fire in forest areas."
"Besides these two specific projects, there is a larger one under the acronym of PP-G7 which encompasses not only the promotion and conservation of sustainable forest management but also some programmes on research and some pilot cases with regard to some of the communities."
"We think that, regardless of all these efforts, the idea of holding an international conference on this issue would be very much welcomed because the consequences of such fires are not just bad for the countries where they occur but for all humanity."
"I wish to say that from 1992 to 1997, a total of ECU 300 million has been committed under the tropical forest financial instrument, which Parliament has granted to the Commission."
"Unfortunately, despite this commitment only ECU 130 million has been disbursed during this period."
"This is why we have decided to ask for an evaluation of all our projects from an independent external expert because we have to correct this mismatch between commitments and disbursement."
"Finally, I wish to say that, even if we do not have budget lines specifically for disasters, the Commission takes the resolutions seriously."
"If honourable Members want to follow what has happened, there is one thing that used to come after Question Time called 'les suites données ' which is very boring but you can always identify what has been the follow-up to the proposals that have been made in this House."
"Second, it is very difficult to identify beforehand what disasters may occur but my colleague, Emma Bonino, and ECHO deserve our sympathy because they always manage to respond very quickly and effectively in order to mitigate as much as possible all the disasters that have occurred, at least on the humanitarian side."
"Thank you very much, Mr Pinheiro."
"I hope you will not see my bad pronunciation of Portuguese as an insult to that beautiful language, which I admire so much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 4.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"Arrest of Dino Frisullo in Turkey -B4-0409/98 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the arrest of Italian national Dino Frisullo in Dyarbakir (Turkey); -B4-0411/98 by Mr Vecchi, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the arrest and detention of Italian national Dino Frisullo in Turkey; -B4-0412/98 by Mr Graziani, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on respect for human rights in Turkey; -B4-0420/98 by Mr Orlando and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the arrest of Italian national Dino Frisullo in Dyarbakir (Turkey);"
"Cameroon -B4-0392/98 by Mrs André-Léonard and Mr Fassa, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, on freedom of speech in Cameroon; -B4-0401/98 by Mr Hory and Mr Scarbonchi, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on freedom of speech in Cameroon; -B4-0403/98 by Mr Pasty and Mr Azzolini, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, on freedom of speech in Cameroon; -B4-0408/98 by Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United Left - Nordic Green Left, on human rights in Cameroon; -B4-0417/98 by Mrs Aelvoet and Mr Telkämper, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on freedom of speech in Cameroon;"
"Death penalty in the United States -B4-0407/98 by Mr Manisco and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal in the United States; -B4-0423/98 by Mr Orlando and Mrs Roth, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal in the United States."
"Arrest of Dino Frisullo in Turkey"
"Mr President, we have all seen on television recently the attacks made by the Turkish police on the Kurdish population of Dyarbakir, which was calmly celebrating its feast."
"We have seen elderly Kurdish women being kicked in the head, and photographers and journalists beaten."
"Three Italians were arrested and one of them, Dino Frisullo, is still in jail."
"This is a question of human rights, democratic freedoms and the rights of the Kurdish people in Turkey."
"This is the level of respect shown towards agreements signed with the European Union by the political and military leading class of Turkey."
"We have also learnt today that the Turkish Government will essentially be responsible for Cyprus joining the European Union with the annexation of the north of the island occupied by Turkish troops."
"It has been maintained by the EU, recently and over the course of the years, that the so-called ""lay Turkey' should be encouraged to democratize the country and that Turkey should be protected from the so-called ""Islamist danger' ."
"We signed the customs union for those reasons, despite all reservations."
"But the tragedy of Turkey is the leading lay Turkish class."
"In the name of the modernization of Turkey, the genetic code of this leading class includes military expansionism and ethnic cleansing within the country."
"This Turkish leading political and military class only understands the language of force."
"The EU Member States should stop supplying arms to Turkey. Finally, the Member States should formally warn Turkey against annexing the north of Cyprus or other acts of hostility against that country."
"Mr President, I would like to say that it is really discouraging to see how, once again, the Turkish Government does not want to understand why negotiations have not got under way for its accession to the EU."
"It does not want to understand, to the point that it is attacking a free demonstration on the part of the Kurdish people, in which European pacifists have participated, including my fellow countryman who is currently in jail in Turkey. The Turkish Government does not want to understand how it is impossible for the country to be able to join the European Union if it fails to respect human rights."
"It is not that the Christian club does not want an Islamic country. In fact I agree here to a large extent with Mr Vinci, when he says that it is the lay component that contains something totalitarian and dictatorial, to such an extent that the lay state of that country is guaranteed by the armed forces, an anomaly that I do not believe exists anywhere else in the world."
"That is why, Mr President, it will be necessary for people who, like me, support the need to approve the customs union, to review our positions vis-à-vis Turkey, at least until the rights of the people are respected, particularly the Kurdish people."
"I recall, Mr President, that after the First World War, based on the Treaty of Sèvres, the Kurds had the right to independence in a country that was to be called Kurdistan."
"Then that Treaty, like so many others relating to minorities like the Kurds, became a scrap of paper, and there is no longer any trace of it in our history."
"We need to resume this dialogue. We need to tell the Turkish Government and the neighbouring governments that they have Kurdish populations in their countries, and the time has come to restore independence and trust to a people who currently do not have any trust other than that of those visiting the Turkish jails, like our colleague who was awarded the Sakharov Prize two years ago."
"Mr President, as those speaking before me said, on 21 March the Kurds celebrated their new year, the ""Newroz' , during which demonstrations took place defending the rights of the Kurdish people. Representatives of nongovernmental organizations, pacifists and MPs from several European countries took part."
"Those demonstrations were followed by unacceptable action on the part of the police, who tackled many of those taking part, arresting some of them, including Dino Frisullo, who is still in prison."
"I would like to say that, as I know Dino Frisullo personally, I can assure you that he has always shown peaceful intentions and interest in non-violent choices aimed at favouring dialogue between the parties."
"The Turkish Government, however, rather than try to talk with the Kurdish people, has chosen repression, preventing the lawful exercise of the right of expression and demonstration of Kurdish and Turkish citizens and citizens of several European countries."
"Within this framework of failure to respect the international agreements and unacceptable repression of human rights - by a country which not only maintains cooperation relations with the EC and has achieved customs union with the EU, but, from a legitimately certain point of view, is also aspiring to join it - it is essential for the EU, and for the European Parliament in particular, to support the action of the Italian Government, which has firmly requested the immediate release of Dino Frisullo."
"I think we should make the Turkish Government understand that European public opinion, together with Italian public opinion, cannot tolerate a country with which the above relations are maintained still being able to oppress human rights in this way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in all sincerity I believe that we are not so much discussing the problem of the Italian citizen, Dino Frisullo, as the Turkish Government and the role Turkey is playing in its relations with the EU."
"Two fundamental questions arise: the first relates to respect for human rights in Turkey, and the second to the support the EU has always given to the Kurdish question and, more generally, to the rights of minorities wherever they are."
"Today, Turkey is at a crossroads."
"It has to choose which way to go."
"It is a historic and cultural crossroads that this important country has often reached."
"However, its Government has to realize that, if it wants to maintain serious relations with the EU, it has certainly not started out on the right track."
"Cameroon"
"Mr President, the Cameroon is a signatory of the Lomé Convention which states that development aid is subordinate to respect for human rights and fundamental liberties, such as freedom of speech."
"The two year imprisonment of the journalist Pius Njawé and the six month imprisonment of Michel Michaut Moussala are unacceptable on the grounds that they infringe the freedom of expression which is normally guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the republic, and the law governing social communications."
"Do the Cameroon courts have several interpretations of the law?"
"I fear they do, since violations and infringements of civil liberties have shown a dangerous increase and mirror the worsening of the situation in terms of human rights."
"There can be no democracy in a country which censors the media."
"Gagging the press and preventing news from being broadcast is a serious infringement of basic civil liberties."
"I therefore appeal to the Cameroon Government to stop these practices, to free the two journalists, and to return to a situation in which human rights are rightfully in place, as they are in all states who have a fundamental respect for themselves."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Pius Njawé is the director of a private press group known as 'The Messenger' and has been detained since 26 December 1997. He has just been heavily sentenced to two years' imprisonment."
"His crime is that he allowed an article entitled 'Is Biya ill?' to appear in his newspaper, which referred to a mild heart condition suffered by the President of the Republic of Cameroon."
"Another journalist, Michel Michaut Moussala was condemned to six months' imprisonment."
"Pius Njawé, who has been imprisoned several times and is considered to be the father of the freedom of the press on the African continent, has once again paid a heavy price in the necessary fight for the freedom of the press in countries where the tradition of a single party still survives and where no opposition is tolerated."
"The freedom of speech is sacred."
"It is one of the pillars of the democratic process on which the European Union is founded."
"We therefore demand the immediate release of these two journalists and that human rights and freedoms, of which the freedom of expression is fundamental, be respected."
"Mr President, anyone acquainted with Cameroon - as I am - has a great liking for the country. Its people are particularly friendly and reasonable, and generally it is still a relatively well-managed country, compared to its neighbours."
"It is therefore all the more regrettable when events take place there which absolutely contradict our principles."
"However, I would like to point out something else. We have the Lomé Convention with these countries, and Article 5 is clear and unambiguous."
"But what happens?"
"To be honest, I have always had the impression that this Article existed on paper only and is not implemented."
"If we do not draw the consequences of what we are demanding, we must not be surprised if the governments and people revert to a tradition which is not so very old."
"After all, people alive today remember when things were still quite different."
"If we do not insist on the implementation of our provisions then it is not surprising. However, it should make us examine our consciences."
"Are the attitudes we support credible?"
"Is our support of human rights and international law credible?"
"Are we really credible, and do we use the great opportunities we have to enforce them, not only in a moral sphere, but also in an economic and social sphere, as we always trumpet?"
"I think we should take up the case of a friendly country such as Cameroon, not in order to criticize it but in order to criticize ourselves, so that we can finally achieve credibility."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of Cameroon raises a more general problem: that of freedom of expression, and particularly freedom of the press, in some of the developing countries, particularly some African countries."
"In my experience as an MEP, this is not the first time I have had to face such a question. A journalist has been tried and condemned for publishing false and biased news."
"This is not the right way to interpret freedom of the press: you cannot censure the falseness or otherwise of news to impose penalties that go way beyond anything the conscience of any civil people can bear."
"That is our problem."
"Mr President, I have of course read the joint motion for a resolution on the freedom of expression in Cameroon with a great deal of interest, and I can obviously agree with its recommendations."
"Or at least with the obvious position that freedom of expression occupies a prominent position in the list of fundamental freedoms every single human being is entitled to."
"I hope you will allow me, however, to point out to this Parliament that freedom of expression is sadly not only being jeopardized in Cameroon. In earlier resolutions, this Parliament itself wanted to restrict freedom of expression, in particular in the resolutions which have become a boring tradition, which under the guise of combating racism and xenophobia, argue for muzzling legislation against people who do not necessarily and indiscriminately consider the so-called multicultural society as an ideal to be pursued."
"I note that on our continent as well, for example in France as a result of the communist Gayssot Law, people were recently awarded heavy sentences, and even reduced to poverty, after simply expressing an opinion."
"Only a few moments ago our colleague Jean-Marie Le Pen lost his political rights, and therefore his mandate in this Parliament, for two years because of an innocent election clash."
"I wonder what is being said in Cameroon about this kind of situation, and whether the Parliament of Cameroon will vote on a resolution on political freedom in France."
"I note - one of many observations of this kind - that in my own country the Minister of Justice is starting a criminal law reform whereby press offences, which is what we are talking about today, will no longer be tried by the Crown jury, but by a college of politically appointed judges. The Minister of Justice stresses that it is his deliberate intention to curb the freedom of expression of one opposition party, namely my party."
"We cannot merely denounce the events in Cameroon and advocate freedom of expression in that country; we should also do so in our own countries and on our own continent."
"Mr President, of course I emphatically support the release of Mr Njawé and Mr Moussala."
"I also think we must attach more importance to the question of press freedom, including in the Lomé states which are closely associated with us."
"However, I think we must view the problem in a wider context."
"I am very pleased that Article 5 of the Lomé Convention is emphasized so strongly in the resolution."
"I think that the freedom of the press is endangered from time to time in the majority of Lomé states, and that it is true that Cameroon is the one-eyed king in the country of the blind."
"If we look around the region and consider Nigeria or the Congo, for example, the circumstances are quite different."
"I am therefore of the opinion that Cameroon is one of the states characterized by relative stability, which also affects the rule of law."
"Nevertheless, this event cannot be excused."
"We should draw conclusions for our policy as a whole."
"As Mr Pinheiro, one of our best commissioners by far, is here today, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Commission and also the Member States to use our development aid much more than in the past, to promote programmes in the fields of education and training which underpin the rule of law."
"Educating junior political leadership, public sector officials, judges and all those connected with the media, including journalists of course, is necessary, because freedom of expression is threatened from various sides."
"I therefore think we have a very great duty in the field of education and training, to educate junior leaders who will break out of the vicious circle and ensure that a policy is pursued in most of the Lomé states which complies with Article 5 of the Lomé Convention."
"We have a very great task here, which we must finally face up to."
"Mr President, I think Mr Posselt is both right and wrong."
"We do indeed have a great task here."
"However, we have to carry out this task not as if we were masters of the universe, but as people of solidarity who are not trying to teach the Africans how it should be done."
"If we consider the history of the 20th century in Europe or the history of European involvement in Africa over the last 300 years, it becomes clear that we are not in a position to rebuke anyone."
"We have a common task of basic solidarity."
"Cooperation with non-governmental organizations and democratically elected governments are at the forefront here."
"We must work with them to find ways and develop initiatives which no longer make an appeal to civil and human rights seem an empty gesture."
"Death penalty in the United States"
"Mr President, after Mr Manisco's sad but lucid speech, little remains to be said, other than that I agree with him."
"I just have a few points to add."
"Firstly, I wish to recall the European Parliament's firm opposition to the use of the death penalty, as already stated several times in previous resolutions, including those on the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal."
"We should also remember that, while we are discussing these arguments, other people are in the arms of death and some of them have just been killed under the death penalty, as in the recent case of an American woman."
"Then we should mention the terrible deterioration in the living conditions of the prisoners, as we have seen in particular in the Greene Jail in Pennsylvania."
"We therefore believe it advisable for the European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, not only to confirm its ""no' to the death penalty, not only to ask for the suspension of the sentence against Mumia Abu-Jamal, but also to ask for a retrial of the case, which we know very well is suspect."
"I just wish to add that we have submitted an amendment to ask all European companies thinking of investing in the United States to give preference to those states where there is no death penalty."
"Mr President, a great deal has already been said."
"Once again, we have a new case of the death penalty."
"This time it is the Mumia Abu-Jamal case, and this time it is in the State of Florida."
"What has repeatedly motivated us as Europeans and the European Parliament in these matters is firstly the fact that the death penalty still exists at all in the United States, and secondly the circumstances under which it is carried out."
"Each case which is judged or sentenced in this way certainly involves its own tragedy and its own drama."
"During the meeting in Geneva recently of the UN Commission on Human Rights, we had the opportunity to speak to a Texan attorney who opposed the death penalty."
"He drew attention again to one particular factor which I think we do not appreciate."
"First of all, most people in the United States know very little about why and how the death sentence is pronounced."
"They do not hear about it and are not even particularly interested."
"They usually only ever hear of the dramatic cases."
"Also, the nature of the sentencing differs widely from one state to another."
"Stepping across a state boundary is practically enough to avoid being sentenced to death for the same crime."
"This difference in the severity of the penalty is something which concerns us in all cases, most particularly if it involves the ultimate penalty, the death penalty."
"There is no uniform case law on this subject."
"The same deed is assessed in different ways."
"Sometimes it might be a mass murderer, sometimes a first-time murderer."
"Murder is murder and is always dreadful."
"But I think we should make it clearer to the Americans why we are so concerned about the death penalty in the United States."
"All European citizens will be eternally grateful for the fact that they sent over their young people to free us from Nazism, a large number of whom fell on the Normandy beaches and in the push into Germany. They live in a country which vigorously defends human rights - freedom of thought, freedom of expression, the right to association, the right to publish - and yet they allow the most basic right of all to be attacked by the state itself."
"This surrender to violence exemplified by the execution of an innocent person twelve years after a highly contestable guilty verdict - exemplified also by the fact that firearms are placed in the most untrained of hands and are made available to the most unstable of people, causing the deaths of dozens of innocent people - this collective surrender to violence has to be pointed out. We Europeans call upon the citizens of Pennsylvania."
"Stop this state-sponsored violence! Demand an end to the execution of human beings, and in particular today of one human being, namely Mumia Abu-Jamal."
"Mr President, I hope you do not consider my Spanish to be an insult either."
"Mr President, as far as the arrest of Mr Frisullo is concerned, permit me to remind you that on 4 March last, the Commission adopted its annual report on the development of relations with Turkey since implementation of the customs union."
"In its report, the Commission notes that the human rights situation and the process of democratization have not made any substantial progress over the past year."
"Furthermore, in its communication on a European strategy for Turkey adopted on the same day, the Commission confirmed its intention to continue giving financial aid to the Turkish NGOs working towards an improvement in the human rights situation in Turkey."
"The Commission also wants to cooperate with the Turkish authorities, especially on the training of the police force."
"Despite Ankara's recent decision to suspend all political talks with the European Union as a result of the conclusions of the European Council in Luxembourg, the Commission still intends to continue informing the Turkish delegation of EU concerns over questions relating to human rights and respect for the democratic principle."
"In this spirit, the Commission will not hesitate to take up Mr Frisullo's case with the Turkish authorities, and call for more substantial information and explanations on the subject."
"As to the question of freedom of expression in the Cameroon and the case of the two journalists, I would say that I share your concerns over their recent sentencing."
"It poses a serious threat to the freedom of expression of journalists, a freedom which we all know is one of the vital ingredients of true democracy and one which is also covered by Article 100 of the Lomé Convention."
"Indeed, in recent times there has unfortunately been a tendency for those in power in the Cameroon, as in other African countries, to curb freedom of expression with the help of a judiciary system which lacks independence from the government."
"Despite everything, I hold out strong hopes that the Court of Appeal, which is this very day examining the appeal launched by Mr Njawé, will not confirm this trend."
"I believe it is important for you to know that, via Directorate-General VIII, the Commission has already made its concerns on the subject known to the Cameroon authorities."
"I can assure you that it will continue to strive for adherence to Article 100 of the Lomé Convention by closely monitoring the way the human rights situation develops in the Cameroon, and in particular the situation vis-à-vis the two journalists in question."
"To conclude, Mr President, the question of the death penalty has once again been raised in this Parliament."
"The Commission's position is in fact well-known because it has so often been repeated."
"I simply want to say that as far as the United States is concerned, we consider that it is vital that all guarantees enshrined in the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights and other pertinent instruments are respected."
"The Commission believes that the US judicial system will ensure that they are."
"It is, however, regrettable that a civilized country such as the United States, one of the major world powers, should continue to pursue such a barbarous practice as the death penalty."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Pinheiro."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs André-Léonard was saying, our debates have been short, though that does not mean that the quality or importance of the issues covered have been in any way compromised. However, we have reached the end of our debates."
"Therefore, I would propose that we suspend the sitting until 4.30 p.m."
"Mr Posselt has the floor to speak on a point of order for a maximum of one minute."
"Mr President, I would like to comment on one of my favourite subjects - the Conference of Presidents."
"As you are one of the few Presidents who always provide information about what is said here in a part-session, I would like to point out that it is strange that the Conference of Presidents decided against placing such an important topic as Kosovo on the agenda, on the grounds of lack of time."
"Unfortunately, the majority of the House was not in favour of including the topic either."
"Consequently, we have discussed three topics today, have interrupted the sitting for twenty minutes, and a current crisis in central Europe has not been discussed."
"I feel we should set our agendas much more efficiently and expertly than the Conference of Presidents has done this time. Please let us return to the urgent debate in full, so that time is also available for the necessary topics."
"Thank you very much, Mr Posselt."
"This will certainly be recorded in the Minutes and the group chairmen who make up the Conference of Presidents will read and take note of your comments."
"I am a Vice-President and a member of the Bureau, but I am not a member of the Conference of Presidents."
"In any case, in my current role of responsibility, I note your comments and will forward them to the people concerned."
"(The sitting was suspended until 4.30 p.m.)"
"Mr President, you may notice looking around the room that there are a large number of my colleagues who cannot be here tonight because of the flight arrangements that make it difficult to get back to London and the UK generally from Strasbourg."
"My colleagues send their apologies but I think it is very difficult for any Member of this House to carry out their duties when they cannot get to and from here, as was raised by Mrs Green on trying to get here earlier this week."
"The problems of getting home from Strasbourg are just as bad and colleagues have had to leave here at lunchtime today so that they can be home for tomorrow morning."
"That is a ridiculous situation and I hope that this will be looked at by Parliament's Bureau because you have made decisions regarding Members and their voting records here that are now being disrupted by the travel arrangements that they have to make to travel to and from Strasbourg."
"Mr Provan, there are two parts to your point."
"On the first part, we will continue to press the airlines and the appropriate governments for an improvement in the service."
"On the second part, that will be taken into account when we review the operation of the roll-call vote system, which we shall be doing shortly."
"We now come to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"VOTES (continuation)"
"The rapporteur proposes that throughout the French text the term contrôle démocratique should be replaced by responsabilité démocratique."
"Are there any objections?"
"(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment)"
"Before the vote on paragraph 5"
"The rapporteur, who unfortunately cannot be with us this evening, has asked me to propose an oral amendment. Where it currently says 'to hold the ECB to account' the rapporteur is asking for this to be replaced by 'for the ECB to be answerable to' ."
"(The President established that there were more than 12 objections)"
"Mr President, I wish to apologize, because I wanted to ask the rapporteur, who is unfortunately not present, whether she could repeat the question."
"It concerns paragraph 5."
"This is a difficult situation for me."
"I am chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and I would have liked to have heard what the rapporteur had to say on this."
"I know what was agreed - an oral amendment was agreed with Mrs Randzio-Plath which she wanted to table here - but I do not know the exact wording. Under the circumstances, I would therefore recommend a separate vote, whereby we are in agreement with the first section to 'must ... be exercised ...' ."
"I would not vote in favour of the second section from 'and that, as the only directly elected institution at this level, the European Parliament is a particularly appropriate institution to hold the ECB to account' in its current form, but in the form which Mrs Randzio-Plath wished to propose now."
"That was the problem."
"Mr President, I think it is important to actually say why Mrs Randzio-Plath is not here as there may be some opposition to this because of the fact that she is not here."
"You will know that she was extremely distraught at lunchtime that her report was not taken because her husband is ill and she has had to go home."
"That I think is something we can all understand and I would ask colleagues here who know she is a very hard working woman to please understand that."
"She did try this morning to get the report voted as you know but many other of our colleagues walked out and would not stay on to vote."
"That is to be regretted, she was very distraught and I would ask you please to be understanding at least of that point."
"Mr President, Mrs Randzio-Plath has informed you of the oral amendment tabled, with which Mr von Wogau is not familiar."
"There were colleagues here in the Chamber, unfortunately from your own group, Mr von Wogau, who rose when the President asked whether the oral amendment was approved."
"There was a sufficient number of them, which resulted in enough colleagues rejecting the oral amendment."
"That is the problem we are faced with."
"Otherwise there could have been no doubt."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath had expressly submitted the oral amendment to the President in advance because she could not be present today."
"I would therefore ask for the vote to be taken again on the existing wording."
"It was not we who blocked it, but the colleagues who rose."
"Then we shall see who has a majority."
"Let us try to keep calm about this."
"I have a number of Members who want to make points of order."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that it was not possible to vote on the agreed oral amendment tabled."
"But it is those people who actually took a gamble on the whole process, and have now done so again, who must bear responsibility."
"Now we should vote on the original text."
"Mr President, insofar as it is just Mrs Randzio-Plath's absence which is causing the problem, there is a compromise which we found following an agreement within the committee, which was voted in."
"We had honed this agreement to perfection when at the last moment, we found that the term which accurately translated the term we had agreed on, namely 'to hold to account' was felt by some people to be too aggressive towards the Bank."
"Two or three words were suggested but our British colleagues did not consider them to be appropriate."
"We therefore decided to wait until we found the appropriate wording and this morning, Mrs Randzio-Plath and I found it."
"(Mixed reactions) It is deplorable that in order to prevent an agreement being passed, twelve people felt obliged to rise."
"That is regrettable."
"That said, Mr President, to extricate ourselves from the blind alley in which we now find ourselves, we could start by voting on what Mr von Wogau has proposed, with Parliament then voting on the rest."
"I would like to point out straight away that there is practically no difference."
"It is merely a question of nuances."
"Certain people have become so hysterical over these nuances that they have made a mountain out of a molehill."
"Mr President, I would like to say for the Minutes that we should take up the proposal made by Mr von Wogau and Mr Herman, that we all sympathize with Mrs Randzio-Plath, and that no one in our group took part in the boycott of this proposal, which you did not read out, incidentally."
"I misunderstood your last point."
"I quite clearly read the proposal out."
"Mr President, many people in this House know that almost every word counts, particularly in this report."
"We had wording which allowed us to assume that a broad majority accepted it."
"However, some of our colleagues did not actually know that a situation had arisen in this case, for reasons which Mr Herman has just explained, which cannot really be resolved by the usual application of the Rules of Procedure."
"If we now adopt a resolution which does not take account of the oral amendment, we shall be doing something which the majority of the House did not want."
"I would propose two solutions, which I think are correct, to get us out of the situation."
"If you, Mr President, would ask the question again as to whether the oral amendment is to be allowed, we could ask those Members who rose previously with good reason to remain seated, now they know what it is about."
"If we had the opportunity to vote on the oral amendment, we would have the result which the vast majority of this House wants, and the majority would be correct."
"Should this not be possible, we must resort to what Mr von Wogau proposed."
"However, the first solution would be more correct, in my opinion."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to say that we made great efforts in committee - and I expressly acknowledge Mrs Randzio-Plath's efforts - to help reach an agreement."
"We had reached agreement on practically all the points in committee, as Mr Herman said."
"It was accepted by almost all the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"The fact that the expression '... hold the ECB to account' in paragraph 5 seemed to many members of my group to be too strong remained unresolved."
"Then people said: ' We shall reach agreement.'"
"I must say that I myself took no part in this last discussion, but Mr Herman did."
"He says he has now found this word, which is the right one."
"However, I have the impression that not everyone in the House understands what this word is."
"I must say that I do not have it in writing either."
"I would therefore suggest, even if it is not strictly in accordance with the procedure, that we ask Mr Herman again to say quite clearly what the subject of the oral amendment is, as tabled by Mr Friedrich."
"I would suggest that we reach some sort of agreement."
"I think it is reasonable to expect that we do this."
"It is clear that if the oral amendment were put to the vote, it would be carried."
"There is no question about that."
"But the rules exist to protect minorities in this House and that is the purpose of 12 Members being able to stand up and object to an oral amendment."
"No one from the groups who voted against the oral amendment have objected or said they misunderstood."
"I now have one person from each of these two groups asking for the floor."
"I will hear what they have to say before taking any decisions."
"Mr President, I was one of the twelve Members who stood up earlier and I would like to make a small comment."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath is absent and the coordinator of our group is also absent."
"It is he who was to have given us the information."
"I knew this discussion had taken place within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and I knew there had been an attempt at conciliation."
"I think it is a good thing that an agreement was reached between Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mr Herman."
"But neither our group nor the other groups were informed."
"And I would like to take this opportunity of reminding everyone that this Parliament has more than two groups."
"It has several."
"I am quite happy to say that had I been correctly informed, I would have voted in favour of Mrs Randzio-Plath's oral amendment. However, I believe just as strongly that as a matter of principle, the two large groups should not ignore Parliament's other groups."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I wonder whether we can make a molehill out of this particular mountain."
"You have acted correctly according to the Rules of the House."
"Twelve Members stood up; I regret that they stood up but they did."
"However, let us return to the original text, which many people tried with great goodwill to modify because there was perceived to be a nuance in terms of the original text being too strong."
"My own view is that it is a very fine difference and, indeed, to say that we want to hold the European Central Bank to account is generally acceptable to the majority of people in this House."
"I would advise you now to go forward to the vote."
"If you wish to take a split vote, all well and good, but my advice to the House is to vote both parts and to vote for them."
"Mr Harrison, that is precisely what I intend to do."
"After the vote on paragraph 5"
"Mr President, I formally contest the way you have proceeded."
"Rule 116 gives the President the power to fix a deadline other than of one hour."
"It does not give him the power to accept at the last minute a split vote which has not been submitted within the allotted time."
"This deadline is set at 9.00 p.m. the previous evening for all the groups and all the Members."
"You did not amend it before the sitting and you cannot accept a request for a split vote if you have not amended the deadline beforehand."
"If you like, I can read you Rule 116..."
"Mr President, throughout the intergovernmental conference which paved the way for the Amsterdam Treaty, a strict rule was adhered to by the negotiators - namely, no mention was made of the single currency - and it is imperative that we do not reopen Pandora's box!"
"The result is that today, in a month chosen by those taking part and nine months from the theoretical launch date of the euro, some of their number are realizing the dreadful truth that the Maastricht Treaty has stripped the national democracies of their power without creating any equivalent controls at other levels, and that monetary union will be controlled by no one."
"People are asking themselves whether a monster has been created which will devour us all."
"The European Parliament, in order to give the illusion that it is trying to react - in spite of the fact that it is jointly responsible for the situation - is therefore taking the initiative of adopting a report on democratic accountability in the third stage of EMU."
"However, this is a purely cosmetic exercise, for three reasons."
"First of all, the European Parliament obviously cannot correct the Treaty."
"It therefore works on peripheral tasks such as improving the presentation of the ECB reports or the procedures governing its directors, as it is doing today."
"These proposals - assuming they are accepted by the other institutions - will not change the system fundamentally."
"Secondly, in order for the ECB to work in a democratic environment like the national central banks, even so-called independent banks, a European state would have to exist. That is a condition which is not and certainly will not be fulfilled in my lifetime."
"Lastly, the present situation is exactly what the authors of the Maastricht Treaty wanted."
"As there was not and still is not a European democracy, it was decided to make people think that the single currency could be a purely technical matter, one which could be managed without the involvement of politics."
"The German leaders have again today latched on to this illusion to keep their citizens in the dark while definitive decisions are taken."
"And that is why the Herman report, which made the mistake of putting the question of democratic accountability too clearly, was suddenly withdrawn from the agenda of the present part-session."
"The people will therefore have to wait to be plunged into monetary union before they finally discover the true nature of the system."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the European Central Bank, although not until there had been significant corrections by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"The attempt to push through amendments to the Treaty concerning the appointment of the ECB presidency by the European Parliament failed."
"There will rightly be no vote of no confidence against the president of the European Central Bank, and there will be no 'Banking Committee' as a control body."
"We owe our word to the citizens that the independence of the ECB will not be not undermined."
"As the future guardian of the currency, it must be able to work without any political interference."
"Only then will it earn the same high reputation as the Deutsche Bundesbank has in my country."
"It will guarantee that there will be absolutely no waiver in stability and budgetary discipline."
"The dialogue between the ECB and the European Parliament must be constructive in respect of objectives, specific decisions and coherence between monetary and economic policy, but also social and employment policy."
"We therefore say 'Yes' to an open exchange of opinions, but 'No' to mistrust and abstruse control procedures."
"Another piece of good news: today the German Federal Constitutional Court has rejected the petition against the euro."
"The path for the introduction of the single European currency is now clear."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for a highly relevant report on democratic accountability in the third stage of EMU."
"We are aware that the Maastricht Treaty establishes that the ECB is to be independent in terms of personnel, organization, operation and finance, as well as politically."
"On the other hand, we do not believe this totally excludes a more pronounced democratic responsibility for the ECB, which is also apparent from Article 109B(3) of the Treaty on the role of the European Parliament."
"In view of the single currency's importance for the positive development of the European Union as a guarantee of employment, sustainable growth and social welfare, it is essential to realize the need for democratic accountability and openness for the ECB."
"So the report on the strengthening of openness and democratic accountability is very welcome."
"We believe that the European Parliament, as being the only one of the Union's institutions directly anchored in the population, should be able to play an active role together with the ECB to guarantee democratic accountability and openness within EMU."
"We also believe that strengthening democratic accountability and openness will help legitimize EMU without affecting the independence or credibility of the ECB."
"The European Parliament should also play a key role here."
"We also believe that it should not affect the ECB's independence to have all the decisions taken and all the reasons for those decisions published soon after they are made."
"Equivalent rules apply to the US central bank without significantly affecting its operations."
"Finally, we would like to emphasize the need for the Council, the Commission and the European Monetary Institute to consider this report seriously, together with its proposals on democratic accountability in the third stage of EMU."
"When it was being set up, the European Central Bank needed an unprecedented degree of independence, much more so than any national central bank, since economic and monetary union was being introduced."
"Today, the approach can no longer be so restrictive."
"We have reached maturity and on 2 May, in an extraordinary sitting, we shall give our decision on the countries to adopt the euro when the single currency is introduced."
"The European Central Bank no longer suffers from a lack of financial credibility."
"Monetary sovereignty is in the process of being progressively transferred to it, and nobody doubts any longer that it will be able to contribute to lasting growth."
"The ECB therefore now needs the European Parliament to see its operations strengthened and better promoted thanks to the democratic controls exercised by an elected Assembly with universal suffrage."
"I am therefore in favour of Mrs Randzio-Plath's report."
"The overly extremist requirements presented during the Parliamentary committee debates should be put aside."
"The ECB must not become a poor imitation of the United States FED."
"By contrast, the Maastricht Treaty makes the European Parliament an essential part of the legislation."
"It enables us to play a positive role in the European Union's monetary policy."
"Let us therefore build a basis for regular democratic dialogue and a network of mutual information, but let us guard against it becoming a blocking tool."
"The euro must be the shared responsibility of all the citizens of the European Union if it is to create prosperity and employment."
"At the core of the debate on this report is the notion of ""independence' ."
"In her report, the rapporteur attempts to explore the limits of this notion."
"The central question is to what extent monetary policy can be influenced, controlled and possibly even adjusted by political bodies, without affecting the formal independence of the European Central Bank."
"To my mind this is not the right starting point for this report, which is supposed to deal with accountability ."
"In the former, there is the implicit view that, by using monetary policy, it is possible to implement the aims of an economic policy which are considered important, such as adequate investment, employment and increased welfare."
"At the hearing held by the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs in the spring of 1997, Mr Duisenberg, the current president of the European Monetary Institute, clearly stipulated that monetary policy can only achieve so much."
"As it now transpires, the rapporteur has - still - not grasped this point."
"This inspires little confidence for the future, when it is argued that the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs should play an important role in the process known as democratic accountability."
"It is for these reasons of principle that I voted against this report."
"It was not without a certain amount of pleasure that I learnt of Mrs Randzio-Plath's report. I was glad to see politicians dare to ask for increased democratic controls over those who hold the economic reins and who do not always have the desired legitimacy."
"I wanted to highlight this brave act at a time of exacerbated liberalism whose merits are constantly being heralded without opposition."
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it needs to be said loud and clear that independence is not necessarily a byword for irresponsibility and that, on the contrary, it is through true democratic accountability, and indirectly through greater transparency, that the European Central Bank will gain legitimacy in the eyes of European citizens."
"Naturally, the purpose of our colleague's work is not to call into question the independence of the ECB."
"Rather, it is to mirror certain questions regarding the methods used to implement this necessary democratic exercise."
"The committee debates were difficult and interesting."
"Furthermore, whilst I regret that the vote of no confidence has been abandoned - while also recognizing that this type of amendment to the Treaty would be difficult - I have to admit that we have achieved a worthy compromise, and one which constitutes an important step forward in ECB controls."
"I can also assure you that I will be vigilant over the question of legal consolidation relating to the nomination of candidates which is henceforth subject to the approval of the European Parliament."
"Faced with a debate of such importance, and on the subject of regrets, I want briefly to return to the question of employment and that of the Parliamentary banking committee."
"As regards the latter, I question the deep-rooted nature of certain groups' refusal, especially since this committee clearly has the role of informing and creating initiatives and not of controlling."
"Eighteen million people out of work, a similar number of people in insecure jobs, a European Council on employment, and governments fighting to reduce unemployment in their respective countries, and there are still political leaders who believe that the fight against unemployment is not a priority."
"That is what I wanted to say in relation to Mrs Randzio-Plath's report, which I support and applaud once again."
"The ECB will conduct a single currency policy for all the Member States participating in European monetary union. As a consequence, the democratic controls must be exercised on a European level."
"The European Parliament, which is the only directly elected institution at this level and which enjoys certain powers bestowed upon it by the Treaty, will be ideal as the ECB's privileged political point of contact."
"The disruption caused by the introduction of the single currency will occur before political union has truly emerged."
"However, in a democracy, legitimacy is born of universal suffrage."
"There is therefore a risk that if the ECB acts without political consultation, when all is said and done it will be held responsible for all ills, which in turn will lead to public condemnation of the entire project."
"The Central Bank will be independent, but it will not be able to be irresponsible."
"Calling it independent involves defining what it is independent from and taking steps to ensure that its political counterpart is as strong as it is, failing which there will be no equilibrium."
"Its responsibility implies a dialogue and a transparency between it and public opinion, through the elected bodies of the Council and the European Parliament."
"That is why we fully approve of Mrs Randzio-Plath's proposals for codifying this responsibility."
"In this spirit, the ECB's annual report should clearly take growth and employment into consideration when covering the way monetary policy supports the general economic policies in the Community."
"Ultimately, many of us would welcome an amendment to the Treaty to enable the European Parliament on the one hand to have the same powers in this matter as it does in nominating the Commission, and on the other hand to submit a vote of no confidence against the president of the forthcoming ECB to the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers for their decision, should the Treaty be contravened."
"Such a development would increase the legitimacy of the ECB's decisions."
"As regards the coordination of economic policies in Europe, the European Council of Luxembourg made progress on more extensive coordination of national economic policies and more especially those concerning employment."
"We believe that the European Parliament should involve itself more in this process."
"It is in this area that a great deal of work will be done in the coming years, and it is a sine qua non for balanced economic and monetary union."
"In the third stage of EMU, the democratic responsibility concerns both the ECB and the coordination of economic policies."
"However, the monetary side of the union is today a great deal more structured than the economic side."
"To become a reality, the initiative set in motion needs political guidance: operating on a purely economic basis is not enough."
"This represents an enormous responsibility for the Socialists in the European Parliament, and an expectation of new proposals."
"During the part-session in Strasbourg from 30 March to 3 April, the Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted in favour of the report on democratic accountability in the third stage of EMU."
"The report emphasizes, among other things:"
"1) the need for the future ECB to provide information on the definitions and operational objectives it uses to achieve the set objective of price stability;"
"2) the need for publication of the minutes of ECB board meetings;"
"3) the need to ensure a dialogue between the European Parliament and the ECB on economic and monetary affairs."
"The Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted in favour of the report, based on the fundamental approach of requiring the greatest possible transparency and openness in the institutions of the EU."
"In this connection, it should be emphasized that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament are still of the opinion that the four Danish reservations are not under discussion, including the reservation on the third stage of EMU."
"Lindqvist (ELDR), Eriksson and Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), Gahrton, Holm, Lindholm and Schörling (V), Krarup and Lis Jensen (I-EDN), in writing."
"(SV) EMU is a centralized, high-risk project with little popular support."
"The priorities of EMU are price stability and low inflation."
"There is a serious risk that unemployment, which is already high, will increase still further."
"The regional differences between growth areas and areas of depopulation may be exacerbated."
"EMU will lead to a major centralization of currency and foreign exchange policy, which may grow to include tax and finance policy."
"EMU is a political project which increases the federal aspect of the EU and reinforces the trend towards establishing a state."
"EMU and the European Central Bank, or ECB, will have more independence and power than any other bank in the world, the United States FED included."
"The members of the ECB, who will be elected for eight years and cannot be removed, will have incredible power over currency, interest and other economic policy which has a direct effect on people, regions and nations."
"EMU will centralize and reserve economic policy to a handful of bank directors, which will considerably undermine democracy."
"The proposals for better supervision and democratic control presented in this report can scarcely reduce the democratic deficit in the third stage of EMU."
"For this reason, we have voted against the report."
"This report is full of good ideas on how the new European Central Bank will be held democratically accountable before this Parliament."
"It reflects the criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty regarding consultation with Parliament on the implementing measures."
"However, I fear that there will be no more transparency and democratic accountability in this regard than there has been in the process to date."
"So far the Commission has ploughed ahead with its own strategy without any interest in transparency or accountability."
"Consequently, we had the bizarre declaration from the Commission last week that eleven countries are economically strong enough to join EMU, among them Belgium and Italy."
"The inclusion of these two Member States in the list of first-wave countries demonstrates clearly that the Maastricht criteria were not adhered to and that massaging of figures is acceptable practice."
"Italy and Belgium come nowhere near the condition of restricting public debt to no more than 60 % of national wealth."
"Indeed, they are more than double that figure."
"I hope that when Heads of Government meet under the British presidency next month for the formal vote they will have a better regard for the criteria than the Commission has displayed."
"Given the Commission's commitment to pushing the project forward without regard to the economic circumstances in each Member State, it is difficult not to conclude that it views the scheme in a political light."
"The result of this can only be instability within the system and severe economic consequences for those Member States outside it."
"The political nature of the project will also surely undermine the position of the Central Bank and make democratic accountability harder to achieve."
"Whilst in general I can support the worthy objectives of greater transparency and accountability in the workings of the ECB, I find that this report which continually uses the phrase 'democratic accountability' has, in fact, confused accountability with the giving of an account."
"The dictionary definition of accountability says it is being 'responsible to someone or for some action' ."
"It is wrong therefore to suggest that the ECB is in some fashion responsible to Parliament."
"It is in my view a mistake to give the impression that Parliament's right to be informed translates as a form of accountability, in the accepted sense of the word."
"I will not therefore be supporting this report as it relies so heavily on the suspension of disbelief."
"I have voted for the Randzio-Plath report because the degree of accountability it calls for is better than nothing."
"However, it acknowledges - and even welcomes - the fact that the Bank will remain wholly independent."
"The Bank will control monetary policy, and will do so with one overriding aim: to achieve price stability."
"If this chokes growth or causes unemployment, so be it."
"Nothing that Parliament or Ecofin can say will prevent it."
"True democratic control of the Central Bank would require the creation of its analogue, a central European government."
"Without that, we have the creation of a free market Europe, dedicated above all to the interests of bankers."
"This has been described as 'the spectatorship of the proletariat' , though that is only part of the story."
"This is not to suggest that we should be trying to create a central European government."
"There is no consent for that, and there can be no confidence, on the EU's past form - CAP etc. that such a central government would be successful."
"The overhasty rush to create a single currency has left us in a fine mess, and we are left resorting to sticking plaster in a vain attempt to patch things up."
"To surrender monetary policy to third parties is to surrender to others a significant part of a country's national independence."
"Indeed, the dimensions that such an action assumes when it is carried out by more countries is unprecedented in modern history."
"Such an action, even if it should prove to be of benefit to those nations, must be prepared with a great deal of care and attention. All means of ensuring that those who take on this responsibility will be carefully monitored must be scrutinized and safeguarded, so that they can operate and act in a way that will serve national interests and social prosperity alike."
"We currently find ourselves faced with a necessary fact of life, which has been commonly accepted."
"The European Central Bank is in the process of formation and it will take over the shaping and control of monetary policy. This will directly affect hundreds of millions of citizens, without the people of the countries taking part in the euro - or their governments - having any opportunity to exercise any democratic control."
"Nor will the EC and the constituent bodies of the EU be able to exercise control. Why?"
"Because the ECB has been created with the sole aim of serving large financial and political interests and of safeguarding the conditions in which they can increase their profits. It has not been created to achieve the aims of social prosperity and a higher standard of living for the working people and citizens of Europe, nor to combat the scourge of unemployment and the continuous degradation of ever broader strata of the population."
"The report we are debating today constitutes the most irrefutable proof. It establishes the lack of democratic control by providing evidence, even if indirectly, that the creation of the ECB is an expression of the attempt made by big business to evade national and popular control, and even the completely downgraded control of national central banks."
"However, when the supporters of Maastricht voted for the Treaty they were very well aware of what they were creating and what its repercussions would be."
"Even if they did not realize it at that time, they should at least have demanded that this Treaty be amended with the revision of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"But that did not happen."
"On the contrary, any debate on EMU was excluded from the intergovernmental conference on the revision of the Treaties."
"The declaration that democratic accountability will be guaranteed or that the aims of the ECB will be broadened to include other aims apart from monetary stability is a conscious attempt at disorientation, when not only is this not provided for in the Treaties but, on the contrary, the Treaties make every provision for the independence of the ECB from any possible national intervention. These provisions restrict the number of people on its board, thereby ensuring that it is not represented by all Member States."
"We fully endorse whatever measures may bring about transparency, or indeed measures to inform democratically elected bodies of the policy and operation of the ECB."
"However, we believe that these measures will not be able to reverse the unacceptable situation brought about by the creation of the ECB."
"The only solution is to repeal the Maastricht Treaty and not to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"For this reason, we remain firmly committed to the aim of national referenda on the Treaties, in order to give people the opportunity to express their opposition to this policy and to the surrender of their important sovereign rights to supranational, hermetically sealed, unaccountable bodies."
"The question of the democratic accountability and embedding of the European Central Bank is the last major unresolved matter in the run up to the launch of the euro."
"It must be made clear that it is not a question of restricting the independence of the ECB and the European System of Central Banks - this is a fundamental condition of monetary operation."
"On the contrary, it is a question of interpreting it correctly."
"We will counteract the monetary Utopia of 'apolitical currency' , which becomes a dangerous illusion if dogmatists implement it in economic practice, with the realistic concept that monetary policy remains a specific dimension of the overall economic policy in which it is to be embedded by binding, institutionalized discourse."
"This report takes a first hesitant step in the right direction."
"It is regrettable that the prevailing idea in the House of the 'grand coalition' has resulted in the original report being watered down and becoming much less consistent."
"We were never under the illusion that our amendments would change anything in this respect."
"Nevertheless, the extent to which the Group of the Party of European Socialists has fallen behind the original approach of the rapporteur must be recorded here."
"Daskalaki report (A4-0106/98)"
"We have voted in favour of the report in question."
"We believe a continuing international presence is necessary in Bosnia, under a UN mandate."
"We also believe it is important not to add to the tension in the area by exporting arms."
"On the other hand, we distance ourselves from the demand to use the articles of the Amsterdam Treaty on military action or the outdated military alliance of the WEU."
"The Member States of the Union can contribute to peacekeeping actions with the UN and ECSC as the basis."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted against the report on post-SFOR strategy, because Denmark is exempted in the area of the common foreign and security policy."
"Marset Campos report (A4-0120/98)"
"The Commission's communication on a strategy for reducing methane emissions is timely."
"It makes some worthwhile proposals and some which need to be reconsidered."
"Methane has negative as well as positive claims."
"It is negative in the sense that it is a greenhouse gas second only to carbon dioxide or CO2 emissions."
"It is positive in the sense that it can be harnessed to provide a cleaner and less polluting energy source."
"It can also be used in the manufacture of industrial products such as synthetic rubber and chemical fibres."
"The natural sources of methane include animals, wetlands and marine flora while the anthropogenic sources include the burning of fossil fuels, landfill emissions, waste water and sludge treatment."
"The latter account for 70 % of existing methane."
"While the increase in methane emissions appears to be slowing down, this is not a reason for inaction."
"Landfills are a major source of methane emissions which we can turn to our advantage."
"Essentially, what is required is an appropriate plan of action aimed at halting or reducing methane emissions."
"However, agriculture should not be made the scapegoat."
"The Commission considers that to take account of the digestive habits of ruminant livestock, in other words cattle and sheep, there should be livestock reduction."
"This is not a feasible solution."
"Firstly, this is already taking place because of milk quotas and BSE."
"Secondly, it would open the door to competing third countries."
"As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has pointed out, we should call for more research into improving animal diets and better management of livestock effluents in intensive farming regions."
"If we are serious about sustainable development, let us look at exploiting the potential of methane for energy and industrial purposes."
"Electricity can be produced from the re-use of methane from landfills."
"This could also open new opportunities for small companies."
"There should be appropriate financial incentives."
"We need more research, more public information."
"It is a challenge which, if approached properly, can lead to a range of new opportunities."
"Enlargement and cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs (continuation)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0107/98) by Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the implications of enlargement of the European Union for cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs."
"Mr President, the European Union is undergoing its greatest upheaval since its establishment in the 1950s."
"Major enlargement, coupled with fundamental reforms, is imminent."
"Apart from the question of the single currency, on which a vote has just been taken, there are three principal processes which concern us."
"The first is the question of enlargement."
"Concrete negotiations on enlargement began this week."
"This is a historic moment, because it involves the greatest enlargement in the history of the EU."
"The second point is the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is also taking place this year, by which our institutions will be reformed - at least in part, if by no means adequately - and by which a broad spectrum of further development and cooperation will be opened up, particularly in the areas of justice and internal affairs."
"The third area is the ratification of the Europol Convention which is currently taking place, under which Europol, the European police force, will at last be able to act."
"It is now time to link all these processes together in practical terms, as the communitization of the important areas of asylum, immigration and protection of external borders will be important in the five years following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"However, the creation of operational authority for Europol is also important, and it would be a mistake if we did not use the simultaneous process of eastwards enlargement of the European Union, and the negotiations on it, to make all these new policies pan-European and involve the candidate countries as fully as possible."
"We are therefore of the opinion that we must ensure that the European Union should set the stage for the corresponding integration of these states now."
"In the case of Austria - which has thankfully been a full member of the Schengen Agreement, which it implements in full, since yesterday - we had the problem that that country joined first and only then began to create certain conditions."
"We should not repeat this mistake during eastward enlargement."
"We must use the years between now and 2003, 2006, 2008 or whenever the first stage of enlargement takes place - in a region which suffered from dictatorship and repression for decades - to establish the rule of law and develop criteria for a state in which the rule of law prevails, for which spot-on qualification is just as necessary as the oftquoted single currency criteria."
"We believe these states have achieved a lot by their own efforts, by liberating themselves, establishing the rule of law and making great sacrifices."
"However, we must of course help them. One of the focuses of my report is therefore education and training - the training of junior managers in justice and administration, who will then actually be able to apply European law and the acquis communautaire, which are currently undergoing rapid enlargement."
"The Czech Minister of Justice has stated quite clearly that she has not been able to implement much European law so far, and the little she has been able to implement in her country could not be applied by civil servants because they had not been trained to do it."
"We urgently need to focus our efforts by expanding our programmes to cover the central and eastern European countries and equipping them with the appropriate material resources."
"I therefore suggest as a follow-up the establishment of a European Academy for Internal Security, in the existing border area between the European Union and the candidate countries, possibly in Lower Bavaria or the Oberpfalz."
"Deggendorf would be a possibility, where there has been a major border control force establishment."
"This European Academy for Internal Security should work towards one of our long-term objectives, namely a European border control force, because we are of the opinion that the individual states cannot assume control of external borders in the long term and that this should be under joint control."
"Of course, the current situation is that we still have national border control forces which work well and have proved themselves."
"Naturally, we shall require transitional periods on the existing external and eastern borders, even after eastward enlargement."
"Austria has shown us, however, that every transitional period comes to an end at some time."
"We must develop perspectives now for the time following the transitional period."
"The idea of a European border control force has thus been developed and has thankfully met with broad consensus in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"In this connection, I would like to thank the other groups in this Parliament for their intensive cooperation on my report, particularly Mr Schmid from the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"I must also thank other Members who have ensured that we reached a consensus in setting an important stage for the future."
"I believe there is a broad consensus in the European Union, particularly in the areas of combating crime, drug smuggling and trade in people, and the major problem of money laundering, and that there is also interest in the candidate countries, because this is not a matter of patronage, but of partnership."
"Give and take already exists on both sides."
"I therefore believe that this can become an engine for enlargement of the Community as a whole."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of Mrs Spaak and rise to present the results of her studies."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs shares the rapporteur's concern that the applicant countries should set in place stable institutions which guarantee democracy, the rights of their citizens, and the ability to take on the obligations of the Treaty and the acquis communautaire."
"The first amendment from the Committee on Institutional Affairs highlights three problems: firstly, the five-year deadline for the adoption of measures aimed at the free movement of persons; secondly, their applicability to the procedure contained in Article 189 B; and finally, the decision about strengthened cooperation."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs thus insists that clauses relating to the field of justice and home affairs be revised when the institutional reforms take place, which should occur before the first enlargement."
"The Committee is concerned about the risk of fragmentation of the European legal landscape."
"In fact, the option which allows Member States to declare whether or not they accept the pre-judicial jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in the area of Title VI is dangerous for everybody, but more especially so for applicant countries, given the difficulties they face in adapting their legal systems."
"Finally, I would like to draw the rapporteur's attention, if I may, to Amendment No 4 concerning paragraph 17, which was accepted by the Committee on Institutional Affairs but rejected by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"This amendment deals with the delicate problems of transition periods, which can only result from a precise and concrete evaluation of the existing situation in the new Member States at the moment of their joining."
"This modest amendment has the merit of shortening and simplifying paragraphs 17 and 18 whilst still covering the essentials."
"Mr President, it would probably not come as a surprise to you if I wanted to begin, like Mr Schulz, by saying that the Group of the European People's Party will vote in favour of this report, though probably not because Bernd Posselt is a hardline right-winger, but because he has prepared a report which tells it like it is - exactly as Mr Schulz has described very accurately - and which demonstrates the necessities which exist in this area."
"If we are talking about realities here, permit me to begin with a minor factual correction or small remark."
"The term 'eastward enlargement' is used again and again in this House."
"As an Austrian, this always surprises me, when I consider that two of the applicant states have their capitals located a good distance west of Vienna."
"The enlargement we are considering is an enlargement into central Europe."
"If we were going to expand into Belarus and the Ukraine I would be happy to talk about eastward enlargement."
"One aspect of this report which seems tremendously important to me is the fact that it reveals that the Community, or European Union, is changing more and more from an economic community into a political and thus a security community."
"It reveals the security dimension, namely the security dimension which we must extend to the applicant states."
"I think this is tremendously important, because the external - but also internal - image which the Union conveys again and again is, unfortunately, purely economic."
"That cannot be correct."
"Those states which wish to enter the EU expect certain solutions, particularly in such areas as security."
"Each of these states has its own problems with ethnic groups or minorities, just as each Member State of the European Union does, without exception."
"I believe this is particularly important if we are referring to the causes of this problem and trying to suggest solutions, as for example in paragraph 4, as regards ourselves - that is, the fact that the field of justice and home affairs must be integrated in the next institutional reform, which must take place before enlargement."
"There is a further point in this report which I would like to emphasize because it seems particularly important to me as an Austrian. Mr Posselt has already mentioned it: the need for a European border control force."
"In Austria, we have experienced the consequences of exposure to such rapid change, to a very, very great extent."
"We have had to make massive changes to our border control units in Austria over recent years."
"Thank heavens our borders with Germany and Italy in the south were opened one or two days ago."
"This is hopefully the last major step we have had to take for the next three or four years."
"Then there will be further changes, as soon as the enlargement of the European Union has actually taken place."
"I do not regard it as particularly practical for us to demand massive measures in the area of border security now from the applicant states, in whose infrastructure we shall have to make massive investments if they have great difficulty in actually implementing them."
"I believe that is also one of the key points of the report."
"Mr President, by an unfortunate coincidence, the start of negotiations on the enlargement of the European Union with the central and eastern European countries clashes with the Posselt report on the effects of EU enlargement on cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs."
"I would nevertheless like to congratulate Mr Posselt on his excellent work."
"This report is born of the desire to create a European space of freedom and justice."
"Furthermore, the actions undertaken in this field will be subject to an annual review, which the Commission will pass on to the Council and the European Parliament."
"This review will be useful as it will enable us to judge the capacity of the central and eastern European countries to fulfil two of the three Copenhagen criteria, namely the political criteria and the ability of the candidate states to take on the acquis communautaire ."
"The challenge is just as great for the European Union - and the indefatigable Mrs Spaak unstintingly insists on the absolute necessity of deepening the European Union as a prerequisite to any enlargement - as it is for the central and eastern European countries, who face a double challenge."
"In fact, it is not only a question of adopting the measures in record time, which will allow the measures being addressed in the present debate to be transposed into national law. It is also a question of linking up with the cooperation effort initiated by the Fifteen in the field of justice and home affairs."
"It is actually more a matter of changing their mentality than a problem of budgetary means."
"Although the path ahead of us remains long and the tasks before us remain considerable, we must acknowledge the work already accomplished by the central and eastern European countries."
"The remarkable area of individual freedom regained in most of the countries which until recently suffered under communist dictatorship is to the credit of the candidate countries and is a very encouraging sign for the future."
"Mr President, Lech Walesa, the former president of Poland, is reputed to have said: ' It is easy to turn an aquarium into fish soup' and went on to compare the task ahead of us by stating that: ' The degree of difficulty associated with the transition of a totalitarian state into a democratic state worthy of the name is comparable to the task of turning a fish soup into an aquarium' ."
"I believe he was not entirely wrong, and it is in the light of this wise observation that we should measure the efforts being made by the central and eastern European countries."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the hardline right- and left wingers have paid tribute to each other - you obviously have to be hardline to be a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and I am very glad to be a member of the Committee on Institutional Affairs and able to do without this attribute, which I find very dubious - I would merely like to remind the members of the Committee on Internal Affairs that they are also members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, which is something which is frequently forgotten."
"There are many ludicrous clauses in the Treaty of Amsterdam, but one of the most ludicrous is probably Article 29, which has, of course, also been included in this report."
"It says: ' The Union's objectives shall be to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing joint action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combatting racism and xenophobia' ."
"The word freedom is not repeated."
"The word justice is not repeated."
"Only the word security - or safety - is repeated."
"This imbalance is also reflected in the imbalance of this report."
"Anyone who makes an unbalanced policy out of an imbalance of the values of law, freedom and security, and disturbs this balance, is using popular fear to do so."
"Fear is not removed, but whipped up."
"A major criticism of this report is the imbalance between the area of law and freedom and the security policy."
"It may well make demands for guarantees of the rule of law and the stability of democratic institutions, but not, as we might expect, on us, where these things are strained, but on the countries of central and eastern Europe."
"As if the rule of law would be guaranteed in the area of security by the establishment of the European Court of Justice, or civil rights protected by a charter of civil rights with the involvement of Parliament."
"As if we should not be the first port of call for reproaches about the instability of institutions and the lack of the rule of law."
"The report does not include a single word about this."
"The report demands a common policy on asylum, but does not say a single word about the Geneva Convention, which is being removed piecemeal precisely by the policy of the European Union."
"Reference is made to the rule of law, but only as an obligation for others."
"This imbalance represents a serious imbalance in our system of values."
"The second imbalance in this report has seldom been expressed so blatantly."
"It is the imbalance of the burdens under which we are placing ourselves and the countries of eastern Europe."
"With this policy, we are turning the countries of eastern Europe into a buffer zone for security, immigration and refugees for the European Union."
"We are turning them into a glacis by telling them to solve our major problems, without helping them to do so."
"Schengen prior to entry, a visa policy prior to entry, and adoption of the common asylum policy prior to entry, with nothing in return!"
"That is no policy to bring about an area of freedom and the rule of law."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the Yalta Conference, the states of western Europe in a way bought their freedom at the price of the servitude and ruin of the central and eastern European countries."
"And, unfortunately, it is a cause for regret that the Member States of the Union and the European Union itself did not really contribute to the liberation of these countries, despite which, and thanks to truly exceptional men such as Lech Walesa, Václav Havel and of course, Pope John Paul II - not to mention many others - they liberated themselves."
"If, in the words of that great Pope, Europe is now breathing with both its lungs, it is primarily thanks to the resistance and freedom of thought of these individuals and peoples."
"We therefore owe a debt of gratitude to these countries and we must help them regain the freedom that comes with a democratic state."
"As was mentioned earlier, many judges, police officers and civil servants in those countries have only known the totalitarian and repressive ways of the state."
"They therefore have to re-learn that they are now living in a society which respects individual, civil and political rights."
"That is why Mr Posselt is absolutely right to ask for greater cooperation with the applicant countries in the name of this moral debt which we collectively owe, to help them effectively set up this democratic state."
"The rapporteur was also right in underlining that the measures contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam concerning the crossing of external borders, the abolition of border controls, asylum and immigration will be particularly difficult to implement for these countries in the short term, and again I agree with the Prince of Habsbourg-Lorraine on this point."
"Whilst it is true that we have a duty to help in the development of the eastern European countries and to contribute in such a way as to help them fundamentally return to a society which respects the rights of the people, it is also clear that we must proceed with tact and not act like school teachers."
"To conclude, I would like to pay homage to the fact that Mr Posselt has reminded us of our duties towards the nations of eastern Europe."
"The same thing applies to international relations as to human relations: life is composed not just of rights, but of duties too."
"Madam President, Commissioner, there are four matters I would like to raise, but the first thing I would like to say is that I am really glad that it is Commissioner Gradin herself who is present here, given her commitment to the fight against the trade in women and children, which also forms part of this report."
"So, moving on to the four matters I would like to bring up: firstly, I hope that the so-called acquis document which will be started with the applicant countries will be applied to all countries equally, irrespective of whether we are negotiating or not."
"We have heard rumours of dangerous conflicts."
"The second thing is the cooperation which is to take place between administrations - in other words, that the 1 500 people who will be sent from the Member States to work in the applicant countries really will be working in the legal and judicial sphere."
"This is a case of people helping administrators in the field, which is what we need more than anything else."
"Thirdly, it is not enough to ratify conventions, they must also be implemented, such as the UN Convention on Children's Rights."
"This is what the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party took account of in our amendment."
"Fourthly and finally, I am unhappy that it is not only trade in human beings we are dealing with here, but also the trade in organs in the applicant countries."
"Unfortunately, we have heard in Finland that this has happened in the applicant countries."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"I now hand the floor over to Mr Schulz who has requested to speak pursuant to Rule 108."
"Mr Voggenhuber, we cannot start a debate."
"Nevertheless, I will give you the floor for a point of order, if that is the reason for your request."
"The Rules do not provide for replying to a Member who has invoked Rule 108."
"I will, however, allow you to make a point of order."
"Madam President, I would also like to make use of this Rule of Procedure - and I think more justifiably, having been mentioned by name, which I did not do in my speech, in which I did not name the Member."
"However, I will happily grant him the right to do so."
"I believe that, had Mr Schulz been listening to me, he would have noticed that precisely the point which he uses was one of my major criticisms, namely that the legal guarantees, the demand for the rule of law and the stability of institutions is not directed at ourselves, as the state of affairs would make necessary, but at the countries of central and eastern Europe, with incredible moral arrogance."
"I think I made it clear that the precise criticism is that in this third pillar, the position of the European Court of Justice has not been clarified in cooperation between justice and home affairs, that we have no list of basic rights, no parliamentary and judicial control over this area, and that the moral finger should be pointing at us, before we point it at others."
"That is an evident shortcoming of this report. It is significant that it does not mention it once."
"Madam President, I have been mentioned twice, so I should really be able to speak twice under Rule 108."
"I would like to thank my colleagues most sincerely for their support and positive cooperation, particularly Mr Schulz and others."
"However, I would also like to say that Mr Voggenhuber should either read reports in future or change his speechwriter if he has not got the time to do so, because my report struck a fine balance between the rule of law and internal security."
"By the way, I have no hesitation in mentioning that I adopted suggestions and proposals from Mrs Roth - not as many as she would have liked, but some."
"However, there were some major amendments on which we also achieved a broad consensus."
"Mrs Roth abstained in the final vote."
"All the other members of the committee voted in favour."
"She did not table any amendments during the partsession."
"Neither did you."
"I wonder why not?"
"Seen from this point of view, I think this is a last-ditch stand to which we should not attribute too much importance."
"(Applause from the Group of the European People's Party)"
"Mr Posselt, in any case, regardless of Rule 108, it is quite obvious that you cannot refuse to let a rapporteur speak when he asks to do so."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Mr Voggenhuber, I think you are out of order."
"I would gladly give you the floor, but it does not make much sense. I believe the explanation was very clear."
"Madam President, I hesitate to try your patience."
"However, if I am to be not only addressed personally but attacked twice in a debate, I also have the right to respond to both speakers."
"I shall not exaggerate, and thank you for your generosity."
"I would just like to say one thing about not reading reports."
"I do not know if it is possible to write reports without reading them, but in case it is possible for some Members, may I just quote one passage which was also quoted by Mr Posselt as if it referred to the EU itself."
"However, it must be expressly interpreted as a condition of entry for the countries of central and eastern Europe."
"Perhaps it is possible to be a hardline right-winger in this Parliament, but people should, I think, at least know their own reports, in order to be able to defend them rather better."
"Mutual legal assistance in criminal matters"
"The next item is the report (A4-0122/98) by Mr Buffetaut, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft Council Act establishing a Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union (5202/98 - C4-0062/98-98/0902(CNS)) and the draft joint action adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union on good practice in mutual legal assistance in criminal matters (13300/97 - C40069/98-98/0903(CNS))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the increased cooperation between the Member States of the European Union is completely legitimate under the principle of subsidiarity when it is clear that joint action is more effective than individual actions within the various Member States."
"Can there be a more legitimate area for such cooperation than in the fight against international crime?"
"It would indeed be a paradox if the main beneficiaries of the free movement of goods and persons were lawbreakers, international criminals and gangsters."
"The removal of all border controls will necessarily lead to an escalation of such activities."
"Now more than ever it is vital that we bring about concrete, practical, realistic and effective mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union."
"In their now famous appeal, seven European magistrates underlined the fact that alongside the visible, official and respectable Europe being built - to quote them - there was a hidden and much darker Europe, that of the Mafia and criminal activities."
"To combat this, they notably asked for a review of the European Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters, and recommended a series of practical measures such as allowing European judges to directly address judges from other European countries."
"It is these concerns which are addressed in part by the draft Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters and the draft joint action on good practice in mutual legal assistance."
"As it happens, both these texts are also part of the action plan against criminality adopted by the Amsterdam European Council."
"It seems that the Member States encountered difficulties, since the text submitted to us is somewhat truncated and not very definitive."
"Indeed, modified versions, with which we have not been supplied, are now in circulation."
"It is quite exasperating and unsatisfactory that we should be giving a verdict on texts we know to have since been modified."
"It is important to highlight the fact that in addition, last December's Justice and Home Affairs Council decided to suspend dealing with certain particularly delicate questions and instead to refer to an additional protocol about which we know nothing."
"This exemplifies the major difficulties encountered by the negotiators in the difficult field of justice - namely the lack of mutual confidence between Member States as regards their respective legal systems."
"This is in spite of the fact that all the nations concerned recognize the state of law, although the legal traditions and philosophies differ from one Member State to the next: Common law, droit romain and the Napoleonic code."
"Moreover, law and punishment touch on essential elements of the freedom of individuals and national sovereignty."
"We must be pragmatic if we are to achieve positive results in these areas."
"Inter-state cooperation remains without doubt the most effective way of progressing because it reassures the Member States and avoids conflicts of principle."
"That said, what is the essence of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs?"
"To make the Council's text more effective, if not bolder."
"We therefore believed it necessary to remind everyone of the strategic importance of legal cooperation in the fight against organized crime; to highlight the need to place consistent and easily applied instruments at the disposal of the justice professionals; to affirm that it is important to develop mutual trust between judicial systems; to take into consideration the requirements for speedy inquiries and court cases, whilst still respecting fairness and justice; to try to eliminate the obstacles in the way of legal cooperation; to take into account defence requirements; and finally, to encourage direct communication between the judiciaries."
"I would like to emphasize this last point."
"This is actually one of the recurrent requests of the justice professionals and a prerequisite for effective administration of justice."
"The draft Convention makes provision for this facility, yet immediately grants Member States the option of not joining this simplified mechanism."
"However, this direct communication is an essential constituent of an effective procedure."
"That is why we believe that allowing Member States an opt-out actually carries the risk of divesting the Convention of one of its most useful aspects."
"To conclude, I would like to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs who have provided me with their highly competent and courteous support. I would also like to say that it is a matter of regret to me that the Council is asking us for a verdict on texts which have since been modified."
"Madam President, we are once more confronted with legislation which makes us painfully aware of the contradiction between true Union law and mere international settlements."
"The Convention and the joint action are only a continuation of the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and a similar Benelux Treaty of 1962, which is to be updated by a link with the Schengen Agreement and adaptation to modern systems."
"Has this project succeeded?"
"The amendments tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs shows how much remains to be done here."
"The amendments tabled by Mr Buffetaut should therefore be accepted in any case, including the reduction of the limit proposed by this Parliament, as it concerns indispensable refinements."
"There is one exception, however - permit me, Mr Buffetaut, to say this. In Amendment No 23, the Council text, insofar as it concerns part (b), should be given preference."
"In my opinion, the amendment entails dilution, which does not correspond to the tone of your remaining amendments."
"Have we thus gained legal instruments which are suitable for the contemporary demands of fighting crime and upholding the law?"
"I do not think so, any more than the so-called communitization of the Schengen Agreement was achieved by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"What we need is not the continuation of antiquated treaties with more and more bureaucracy, but the real communitization of the legal dimension in cross-border traffic, immigration, refugee and asylum law and the protection of the civil liberties of EU citizens, which have gained a requirement for regulation in the interim."
"But where is the political will for such communitization?"
"That is a question which must be put to us, the European Parliament, first!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft Convention and joint action go back to the Council's action plan for combating organized crime."
"I hope I shall not fall out with listeners or Members yet again if I say that combating organized crime is an imperative."
"It is indispensable."
"We must therefore also consider that the Convention passed to us on 14 and 20 January initially represents a major contribution by the Council to implementing the objective of the action plans."
"Mr Ullmann has just indicated that existing agreements should be developed."
"The objective is to develop, expand and facilitate the application of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 20 April 1959, its Additional protocol of 17 March 1978, the Convention of 19 June 1990 applying the Schengen Agreement, and the Benelux Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 27 June 1962."
"You can see the difficult problem with which we are confronted and the difficult task Mr Buffetaut has had from the list of treaties and the details I have mentioned."
"He has had to try to do justice to the requirements emerging from European integration - particularly economic integration - on the basis of old treaties, which were concluded at times when the institutions which now exist were undreamt of."
"In one aspect it cannot be helped: the unlimited economic activity which is possible in the European Union also entails unrestricted activity in the underground economy, which is initially being combated by an attempt at intensified police cooperation."
"I repeat: an attempt - because Europol is still not getting into its stride to the necessary extent, to say nothing of the millstone around its neck - at least, it is a millstone in the view of the Group of the Party of European Socialists - of the overdue need to grant it operational powers at Union level, which lies in the distant future."
"If we assume that this European police force exists, with rights and, of course, powers of control under the rule of law - so the Member who has just spoken need not get excited - this would not mean that the results which such policing would bring could be used judicially to the correspondingly necessary extent."
"That is where the debate on Mr Buffetaut's report must begin."
"The current draft specifies the procedure under which mutual assistance is granted and the observance of the forms and procedures specified by the petitioning Member State in accordance with which mutual assistance is to be granted."
"The return of the proceeds of crime, the procedure required, and cooperation in telecommunications traffic between Member States - a very difficult topic - are described."
"It specifies how the transmission and transfer of procedural documents is to take place, including the necessary translations of the procedural documents to be transferred."
"Facilities for examinations, how they can take place by video-conferencing, and how the corresponding translations can be made during video-conferencing, are specified."
"A host of other matters, which I do not wish to mention at this point, are described, which would be necessary to make judicial cooperation possible between two states in proceedings from the confiscation of the proceeds of crime to video-conferencing, whilst observing the existing institutions of the other respective state."
"If this is multiplied to involve 15 Member States cooperating with each other, whilst strictly maintaining their existing institutions, hell will have frozen over by the time we have translated the proposals, I am sure."
"We shall not get anywhere like this."
"What we need is what Mr Buffetaut has indicated, to our surprise: an intensification of the will to harmonize."
"We must begin by harmonizing quite distinct areas of judicial cooperation."
"I know I cannot always say this without being punished from within my own ranks."
"To me, harmonization means that if the European Union wishes to gain executive powers in the long term - including in the area of judicial cooperation - rights must be transferred to it by the Member States."
"We have been transferring rights from national sovereignty to the European Union in stages, including in recent months."
"We are all pleased that we shall soon have monetary union in the European Union."
"We hope that all the Member States of the European Union will soon have the euro as legal tender."
"We know that all the groups in this Parliament who have voted for the introduction of the euro have done so because they hope that it will intensify integration."
"On the other hand, as the debate on the Buffetaut report has shown, we are faced with the major difficulty that we are not prepared to transfer powers where the nation state is still at its mightiest: police and the judiciary."
"If we go on creating an economic area of this type, as we are doing, equipped with a single currency, but holding on to the idea that only our public prosecutors in the Federal Republic of Germany, France or Belgium are in a position to fight crime on the basis of their respective national law, like a child with a favourite toy, then I am going to turn to crime at some stage."
"That is simpler than being a law-abiding citizen in Europe."
"What we are talking about here is the future capacity of the European Union."
"I see all the clever lawyers, including on my own committee, sitting over there saying: ""There he goes babbling to himself again, with no idea how the legal system works."
"If he knew what all the obstacles were he would not talk like that.'"
"But, precisely because we need the courage of non-lawyers in order to make progress in judicial cooperation, I will tell you again: in the opinion of our group, the best thing about the Buffetaut report is that he tries to make it clear that we shall only make progress in judicial cooperation and mutual assistance in criminal matters by intensifying harmonization in cooperation within the scope of application of joint actions and in the stronger and stronger application of methods which have proved themselves on the basis of mutual experience."
"One last remark on the procedure of this House."
"If we are to be consulted, the Council must appreciate that the consultation procedure forms part of the legislative process."
"This is not a courtesy shown to Parliament. It is a constituent part of the legislative process."
"If, as Mr Buffetaut indicated, Parliament is discussing the submission from the Council as communicated to us - in this case under pressure, because we want to keep to the Council's deadline - and the Council changes its text in the middle of this consultation procedure, it makes what we do here cosmetic. This is probably not the fault of the Council representative present here, who should tell his masters that this Parliament will not, I hope, permit it to trample all over its rights, particularly in the third pillar."
"It is democracy which is being trampled underfoot, which is something which democratically elected governments should avoid if possible!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I will begin by saying that my group will support Mr Buffetaut's report, which represents excellent work by the rapporteur and admirable cooperation on the part of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"Having said that, Mr President, allow me symbolically to address the people listening to us in the gallery and interpret what they must feel watching us here today debating this issue, and watching the way in which we are doing it."
"I am sure they must feel a mixture of confusion and impotence at what we are in fact acknowledging, because, Mr President, the problem is very clear."
"We have seen massive demonstrations in various Member States against organized crime, from the demonstrations against terrorism in Spain, to the ""white march' in Brussels, and every other type of protest."
"In all the Member States, there is a common awareness that this is a common problem that we can only tackle together."
"And in the face of this, the political initiative, the political impetus of the Member States is lagging way behind."
"When making declarations, we talk about the need to create a single judicial, police and legal area."
"However, when putting these declarations into practice, we continue to get lost in a sea of regulations - regulations among which, in many cases, even the most experienced, knowledgable lawyers have difficulty finding their way."
"And meanwhile, as we have heard from all sides of the House - because I believe our position in this respect is unanimous - the internal market benefits, above all the criminals, even though this is a macabre irony."
"Mr President, this report, which undoubtably puts forward some suggestions, must be welcomed, but it represents progress in only very small steps."
"It is almost, if you will allow me a certain degree of irony - although the seriousness of the issue does not warrant it - a ""lame' step."
"Why do I say ""lame' ?"
"Because in this case, Mr President - and I am referring to everything that was also said from the seats here in this House - we have lacked from the beginning interinstitutional respect and, to a much greater degree, respect for the citizens."
"Mr President, it is no longer a case of us having been sent a draft Convention which does not correspond with what we are currently debating."
"The problem is that this draft Convention is actually nothing of the sort."
"We cannot consider a convention which from the very start has been incomplete to be a draft convention."
"There are certain articles, for example Article 4, whose only content is ""deleted ' ."
"The same is true of Articles 8 and 9."
"What sort of way is this to draw up regulations?"
"What kind of legally binding content does it have?"
"And then there is the usage of suspension points: paragraph 2 of Article 12 has three suspension points; subparagraphs e) and g) of paragraph 6 of Article 12, three suspension points plus three more suspension points, six suspension points in all; paragraph 6 of Article 15 contains more suspension points; and there are also some in Article 16."
"There is also the usage - and the Council should tell us what purpose they serve - of ""square brackets' which are unfamiliar to us. In the Council's language, these correspond to issues that are being debated by the Member States."
"But we do not know what significance there is in asking for Parliament's opinion on those sentences included in the ""square brackets' ."
"Mr President, this procedure is not satisfactory."
"We have condemned it many times in this House."
"We cannot allow this procedural game."
"We cannot allow it, because we must defend our institutional competencies - and here I would like to thank the Commission which, on the contrary, shows a deference in these matters concerning the third pillar which is worthy of praise."
"We also cannot allow it because we must defend our authority as an institution."
"But, more particularly, we must not allow it because we are representing here the European citizens; citizens who are sitting here today and who, I imagine, will take away a very confused idea of the progress we are currently making as regards the third pillar."
"Mr President, I consider the Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union, on which the report is based, to be a suitable instrument for reducing, if not removing, the existing shortcomings in the combating of cross-border crime, allowing for the justifiable criticism and amendments mentioned by the rapporteur."
"International telephone tapping, observing the respective internal legal arrangements, must be just as possible as controlled service, the transmission of procedural documents, the audio-visual examination of witnesses and expert witnesses across borders, and the spontaneous exchange of information between prosecuting authorities, on as simple a basis as possible."
"These are instruments which have long been available to organized crime, and their extension to prosecuting authorities should reduce the technical lead enjoyed by organized crime."
"We therefore agree with the report in full."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Buffetaut on a valuable report on the draft of the Convention and joint action on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters."
"Both these instruments are necessary in the fight against organized crime."
"It also means that we are defending the security in law of the individual in a Europe without borders."
"I have long argued in favour of facilitating cooperation between the courts and other judicial organizations in the Member States."
"In the work on fighting embezzlement of Union funds, I have seen for myself how delays in exchanging information between different legal systems are a direct encouragement to crime."
"The appeals to Geneva from a number of prosecutors are another example of why something has to be done."
"We will not be able to meet the challenges which today's organized crime presents unless we have effective legal cooperation."
"The Convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters is intended to improve and complement the way we work now."
"One basic assumption is that the courts in different Member States will in future be able to exchange information and request assistance from one another directly."
"This is an important principle."
"I think any exceptions to this principle should be kept to the absolute minimum."
"Among other things, the Convention will also make it easier to question witnesses and obtain evidence between Member States."
"At the same time, the Convention leaves room for further improvements in terms of cooperation."
"Mr Buffetaut complains that there are a number of questions which have not been settled in the Convention."
"For example, the report states that raids and seizures have been dropped and will be covered by a later rider to the Convention."
"The same applies to the question of data protection and the role of the European Court of Justice."
"I can understand the rapporteur's concern, but increasing cooperation on criminal matters will not grow overnight."
"It is a long-term task which is about a process in which, at the same time as improving practical cooperation, we are also working on harmonizing our various laws."
"The rapporteur also proposes that Europol should act as a channel for communicating proposals for mutual legal assistance between Member States."
"Europol has a good chance of getting a request to the right address fast, so I think the proposal is interesting."
"It is also in line with the discussions already under way on giving Europol's liaison officers a coordinating role for letters rogatory."
"Joint action is an important complement to the Convention."
"It lays down a number of principles as to how Member States are to handle a request for mutual legal assistance."
"I particularly welcome the provisions on set times for action."
"Of course it is possible to discuss joint action, as the rapporteur has done, and a convention is not the best way of laying down fixed principles for action."
"On the other hand, I believe the important thing for both the rapporteur and myself is that the Member States should apply the principles quickly and effectively."
"The annual reports are an important tool here."
"They can be used both to assess the situation in each Member State and to make comparisons between them."
"Like Mr Buffetaut, I believe the European legal network should be included in the report work."
"The network will contribute knowledge and experience on how to develop and intensify mutual legal assistance between Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Driving disqualification"
"The next item is the report (A4-0121/98) by Mrs Reding, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft Council Act establishing a Convention on driving disqualifications (5217/98 - C4-0061/98-98/0901(CNS))"
"Mr President, the figures speak for themselves: 45 000 dead and 1.6 million injured on our roads, and all the pain and suffering that goes with these horrifying statistics."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these figures are shocking. In order to counter such a distressing situation, a twopronged assault combining prevention on the one hand and repression on the other is envisaged."
"Prevention is achieved through campaigns aimed at alerting people to the dangers of drink driving and educating them about the fight against illegal substances; compulsory technical vehicle inspections; improvements in the provision of signals; and so on and so forth."
"These preventive measures are intended to improve road safety in general and remove the cause of certain accidents before they can occur."
"Hand in hand with prevention, we must also organize suppression, since even the best prevention campaigns have not stopped some of our fellow citizens from flouting traffic regulations."
"Sanctions already exist in our Member States and these range from fines for minor offences to driving disqualifications for more serious offences."
"The European institutions have already been very active in the area of prevention."
"Under the auspices of this Convention, the suppressive aspects of this European action need to be strengthened."
"The Convention proposes to inaugurate the recognition by a driver's country of residence of a decision to ban them from driving taken in another Member State."
"To put this more clearly, measures are needed which will bring about a situation whereby a ban in one Member State would also be enforced in the country of residence and, by extension, everywhere that a driving licence is required in order to drive a vehicle."
"In future, these cowboys of the road will no longer be protected from prosecution in their countries of residence for offences committed in another Member State."
"That said, certain organizations and several colleagues have told me of their concerns over the protection of citizens against the consequences of applying this new Convention."
"I can now reassure them on this point."
"The Convention has been painstakingly put together and incorporates barriers against all forms of abuse or unjustified complications relating to the people in question and furthermore, the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has adopted a number of amendments which will further strengthen citizens' protection."
"I do not intend to list all of them but I will mention the most important ones."
"First of all, the Convention does not apply to minor offences."
"The catalogue of offences concerned only includes very serious offences which endanger people's lives."
"It is not therefore aimed at pursuing minor traffic offences. On the contrary, it is aimed at stopping dangerous drivers."
"Next, driving disqualification does not rely on a so-called centralizing bureaucracy in Brussels, but on the relevant authorities in the Member States of residence, who alone have the right to choose whether or not to apply the Convention."
"It is not, therefore, a remote and ill-known entity which will decide, but an authority close to its citizens."
"Finally, the Convention makes provision for a number of cases in which it does not apply, the most notable of these being the situation where the offences committed do not carry a disqualification in the country of residence."
"For example, if a resident of Luxembourg is disqualified from driving in another Member State because of a blood sugar level of 5 parts per 1000, this decision would not be applicable in Luxembourg where the limit is 8 parts per 1000."
"The Convention is not applicable if it can be established that the person concerned has not had the opportunity of defending themselves correctly, especially due to procedural irregularities or language problems, for the right to a defence is a fundamental right which must be respected."
"Furthermore, the Convention also makes provision for several procedures aimed at taking into account the differences in administrative or legal methods in the different Member States."
"I am therefore of the opinion that even though the present Convention may not be perfect, Parliament's amendments have rendered it logical, legally speaking more correct and transparent, and therefore better placed to protect the rights of our citizens."
"By respecting the law and being transparent, the amended Convention constitutes an important step forward."
"I therefore ask Parliament to support the Council in this initiative."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Reding has just spoken most comprehensively about her report and I must congratulate her most sincerely."
"I believe that what she has said here, and the content of the unanimously adopted amendments, show that this report was not only prepared very well, but also that its content addresses the points in question."
"Nevertheless, I would like to state that this report affects us all, although only a few Members are present, because any of us could commit a traffic offence in another country resulting in disqualification from driving in that country, but not in another."
"Although this Convention provides for the respective country of residence to decide whether the driver should be disqualified, there are some cases in which we must ensure that no-one is disqualified from driving when they would not have been disqualified at home."
"It is fundamentally necessary that we should get round to making uniform regulations at a European level which are applied uniformly, particularly where traffic legislation is concerned."
"As Mrs Reding has stated, a step has been taken in the right direction and I hope that others will follow."
"Although there are countries in which the alcohol limit for driving is zero and others where it is 80 mg per 100 ml of blood, these differences should be removed, if we want to have a unified Europe."
"I would welcome the introduction of real, uniform regulations in Europe, whether for speeding, the alcohol limit or other areas of traffic legislation, so that we had European rules for disqualification from driving, instead of more rules made under bilateral agreements."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the legislation we are debating affects all European drivers and thus a large number of people, which ensures it will get attention, but this also justifies the need to give it careful consideration, which is our intention here."
"Firstly, some misunderstandings must be cleared up."
"This is not a matter of harmonizing road traffic legislation in Europe."
"It is not even a matter of communitizing the consequences of driving offences."
"The objective of the Convention only concerns disqualification from driving, which is a relatively advanced stage for drivers."
"That is the sole objective of this Convention."
"It has now been asked whether such a uniform ruling can be made, in view of the diversity of laws on driving in Europe."
"If we, as Europeans, use the entire area of the European Union as drivers, we must also accept that uniform rules apply, in principle."
"Should a driver therefore commit such a serious offence in one European country that he is disqualified from driving, it must also be accepted that this will have consequences at home."
"To put it another way, road hogs must not get away with shaking the dust of one Member State off their shoes and carrying on driving at home, as if nothing had happened."
"That is why this rule is correct in principle."
"There have been objections from drivers' organizations."
"They are quite entitled to take a critical attitude to such a regulation and we want to consider it."
"The question is whether disqualification from driving can be enforced at home, in view of the differences in regulations, but also in view of the different legal systems."
"It is the old story: how much Europe do we need?"
"This regulation does not apply without restrictions."
"It is restricted by safeguards within the rule of law."
"This Convention will initially only apply to serious offences which are individually listed, not to every offence."
"Secondly, it must for example be stated that disqualification can only be enforced at home if, of course, it concerns an offence which is also punishable at home."
"The notorious example of someone losing their licence for drink driving in Sweden with 30 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood would not be implemented in Germany, because such behaviour in Germany is not normally punishable."
"There is thus a host of rules which demonstrate that the principles of the rule of law apply."
"However, there is a further objection, namely the differences between legal systems, of which there is a comic example."
"In one of the most delightful Member States of the European Union, exceeding the speed limit can be detected by a police officer with the naked trained eye, as it is said."
"This would, of course, not be recognized everywhere."
"It can therefore be disputed whether it makes sense."
"But if we accept that every Member State enjoys the rule of law, we can have confidence that the judicial authorities act within the rule of law in principle. Should we enter the sovereignty of such a state, we must accept that slightly different rules may possibly apply there."
"However, Europe as a whole is subject to the rule of law and we can also put our confidence in it in this area."
"Mr President, the implementation of the free movement of persons within the Union leads to the urgency of the measure being discussed."
"We thank Mrs Reding for her excellent work and, while awaiting an approximation of the national laws, we hope the Council's proposal will at least serve to establish, at European level, recognition by the country of residence of a decision to penalize a driver by withdrawing their driving licence on the part of another Member State."
"The subject draws attention to identification documents in general."
"I will take this opportunity to report a paradoxical situation, which is that of the obligation to hold a passport for various Community citizens within the Union. For example - and this causes them problems - young Italians born in Belgium, but not having Belgian citizenship, do not hold an identity card but simply a residence permit that does not allow them to travel in Europe."
"We are therefore asking for a real European identity card to be introduced and for the current, anachronistic Community residence permit to be changed to a residence permit and free pass."
"Mr President, in principle we have two methods of achieving road safety objectives."
"The first is penalties, which we are discussing today."
"I would also like to comment that disqualification from driving is a threat to the livelihood of many people."
"We have experienced many suicides following disqualification."
"It is really an extreme measure which should therefore be used carefully."
"We have a second method, namely using incentives."
"We should emphasize training very intensively, particularly on the roads, as lifelong learning."
"We should emphasize research to improve the safety of vehicles, their drivers and the roads, and we should emphasize infrastructure, meaning electronic systems, simply to make traffic safer."
"I believe that a combination of both methods will ultimately lead to success in Europe."
"Mr President, nobody wants road hogs to endanger life."
"The tone of this report is therefore welcome."
"However, it seems to us that the implementation of its intentions has not succeeded."
"Apart from the legally unusual construction of Article 3 in conjunction with Article 5, the main problem is, in my opinion, that errors occur for a wide variety of reasons in proceedings abroad, particularly in the investigation of the circumstances, and remain unchallenged, again for a wide variety of reasons."
"The linking of the place of residence to findings in the decision in the state in which the offence was committed does not appear to permit the accused to exhaust the full potential for defence to which he would be entitled under the laws of his country of residence."
"The facility for the Member State to reject enforcement in a case in which rights of defence have been breached does not, in our opinion, constitute sufficient compensation, for practical reasons."
"We would prefer proceedings to take place in the respective country of residence."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Reding on her valuable report on the Convention to ensure mutual recognition of driving disqualifications."
"As you are all well aware, the number of accidents on Europe's roads is far too high."
"Many of them are caused by careless or unauthorized driving."
"Disqualification has proved an effective tool in the work of improving road safety."
"At the moment someone who has had his driving licence withdrawn in a country other than his home country can legally get it back when he returns home."
"This is absurd."
"The Convention on driving disqualifications will close some of the existing loopholes."
"The Commission shares Mrs Reding's view that a Council decision on the Convention is urgent."
"I can tell you that political agreement was reached at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 19 March and that is a step in the right direction, and the United Kingdom presidency is very optimistic concerning the possibilities of adopting the Convention at the next meeting of the Council at the end of May."
"The Convention establishes a notification mechanism between the state where the offence took place and the state of residence of the offender."
"The state of residence will ensure that the foreign penalty is enforced or that a suitable domestic sanction is imposed on the offender and, if necessary, other Member States will be informed that the driving licence in question has been withdrawn."
"The report suggests that strict deadlines should be introduced for the notification, recognition and implementation procedures."
"The proposal is an interesting one."
"It would make for greater predictability and security in ensuring that the necessary measures are also adopted in time."
"In her report Mrs Reding also stresses the importance of cooperation under the Convention being practicable."
"What we must seek to do is establish the fastest and simplest procedure possible."
"This is a praiseworthy ambition."
"I also welcome Mrs Reding's proposal that, in future, a Member State should only be able to notify procedural changes which make for simplification."
"However, we must, at the same time, remember that the Convention is the outcome of a negotiation process."
"There will certainly be room for improvement, so we must make an assessment of how the Convention has worked a couple of years after it enters into force."
"With more than 45 000 deaths on Europe's roads each year, we must take road safety extremely seriously."
"Once it has entered into force, the Convention on driving disqualifications will be an effective instrument for combating this kind of offence."
"I would like to thank both the Commissioner and the rapporteur, Mrs Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Abolition of duty-free sales"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission:"
"B4-0279/98 - O-0073/98 by Mr Cornelissen and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the social and regional consequences of the abolition of duty-free sales in the regions affected; -B4-0283/98 - O-0087/98 by Mrs Ewing and Mr Castagnède, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the duty-free sales system."
"Mr President, the decision taken by the Ecofin Council in 1991 to abolish duty-free sales for travellers within the European Union from July 1999 has thoroughly stirred up feelings recently."
"This is not surprising and in itself not alarming."
"What is worrying, though, are the reports that the abolition will lead to the loss of a great number of jobs in some regions and sectors."
"I would like to mention for example the ferries, regional airports and certain tourist regions."
"The Irish Minister for Transport expects 30 000 to 50 000 jobs to be lost."
"The sector itself quotes a figure many times higher."
"Amongst the priorities of the European Union are combating unemployment, and the development of deprived regions."
"Partly in view of the fact that many workers in the relevant sectors are feeling a sense of unease, we believe there should be clarity."
"I am therefore asking the Commission whether it would be prepared to carry out an independent study into its possible effects, looking in particular at the sectors and regions most affected."
"Mr President, I trust you will give me a positive reply, in view of the promises made by the Commissioner initially responsible, Mrs Scrivener, during the Parliamentary debates in 1990 and 1991."
"Mr President, this House probably knows that, representing the Highlands and Islands, I have a great connection with the Scotch whisky industry with its hundreds of distilleries and hundreds of types of whisky - a very important employer in areas where there is often no alternative employment."
"I would like to follow on from Mr Cornelissen: I do not need to repeat what he said but I endorse his demand for a full study."
"What annoys me is that this was promised by the tax Commissioner in November 1990 and May 1991."
"Commissioner Monti came before the EMAC Committee and I was present on that particular occasion when we put these points to him and he seemed to me unrepentant and rather debonair about the fact that such a promise had been made and that the promise was broken."
"I am still wondering if we could get an explanation from the Commission as to why the promise was not kept."
"We have had other studies of course."
"We have had a study from a research department of Parliament which has caused some of the concern among citizens because, as Mr Cornelissen said, we do not know how many jobs are at stake."
"But there are estimates that far more than 40 000 jobs may be lost, and this at a time of enormously high unemployment."
"The effect on peripheral areas would be very serious because, as I have said already, such areas have very few employment alternatives."
"We have received justifications from the Council for a refusal to reconsider this matter."
"One is that it is necessary for the single market; but is it not rather ironic that, so far as alcohol is concerned, we do not have a single market?"
"We have not yet managed to tax in accordance with any sensible rule, for instance alcohol strength."
"We have not got a level playing field so far as alcohol is concerned."
"So the first justification does not seem to me to hold water."
"The second justification - there are probably many others that the Commissioner might be able to put forward - is that ECU 2 billion is the cost of the loss in duties."
"But some of the studies suggest there is no proof that amount would be made up even if duty-free is abolished."
"There is no doubt of course that, in many cases, duty-free affects the cost of airport fares and ferry charges."
"We know that to be true, we do not disguise the fact."
"But I go back to the effect of these costs, if they have to rise in peripheral areas."
"There is enormous concern among the citizenry."
"I know it would have to be unanimous, but please, in view of the concern, could we not ask that the Council look at this again?"
"Mr President, the Commission is aware of the questions raised in some Member States about the situation which will arise after June 1999, the date on which intra-Community duty-free sales will end as decided by the Council of Ministers in 1991."
"I am sure that you also appreciate that the Commission is aware that the large majority of finance ministers have made it very clear twice in November 1996 and very recently in March 1998 that the decision taken in 1991 to end intra-Community duty-free sales will not be reconsidered."
"The Commission therefore remains convinced that the transitional period of more than seven years granted to the duty-free sector was sufficient to meet the duty-free trade's legitimate concern about the phasing out of such sales."
"The Commission has been asked several times, including during the present session, whether it intends to carry out a study of the implications of the abolition of tax-free sales."
"The answer is short."
"The answer is ""No' ."
"There is no reason for doing so."
"Let me once again explain why."
"When the Commission between 1989 and 1991 discussed the tax arrangements for the establishment of the internal market with this Parliament, the then Commissioner responsible for fiscal matters declared herself ready to carry out a study on the social and economic consequences for all professions whose future was to be concerned by the entry into force of the internal market arrangements on 1 January 1993 and to look for appropriate solutions where necessary."
"This declaration was made to meet inter alia the concern expressed by Parliament about the consequences of an immediate abolition of duty-free sales on 1 January 1993 and to see if some arrangements for a phasing-out of this activity were justified and possible."
"Against this background, the Commission, which had not proposed any specific measures in favour of this activity in its own proposal, finally welcomed in the following discussions within the Council the introduction of a derogatory regime of more than seven years."
"It also kept the competent committee of Parliament closely informed about the solutions then agreed."
"I must stress that, having received this information, your institution never again mentioned the study initially envisaged until very recently."
"The Council, by adopting such a specific regime which largely overcomes the need for a study - seven and a half years is more than a study - took into consideration the socio-economic dimensions of tax-free activity, as this is clearly reflected in the 'whereas' clauses of the relevant directives."
"Consequently, the Commission remains convinced that this specific regime was an appropriate and practical answer to the concern expressed at the time by the European Parliament."
"Comparing this long derogatory regime to the solutions provided for other professions affected by the internal market legislation, for example, customs freight forwarders who receive funds for reconversion and so on of about ECU 30 million, a seven-year period allowing for an annual turnover of about ECU 7.5 billion does not appear to be disadvantageous treatment."
"Moreover, launching a study now is not only unjustified but would be slightly irresponsible on our part."
"Launching a study now, just over one year before the end of the actual derogatory regime would be most counterproductive as it might be seen by the taxfree industry as a way of re-opening this issue and further delaying the inevitable."
"This would run against the necessary and overdue adjustment of the industry which constituted the primary reason for allowing a seven-year period."
"The Commission does not intend to give the wrong signals."
"I would like to elaborate on the regional effects that are raised in the question."
"I welcome this regional dimension which is focused on some real, specific and limited problems which might arise as a consequence of abolition."
"The Commission, however, underlines the fact that it will be up to the individual Member States concerned to consider if, and to what extent, specific regional difficulties may occur and to take appropriate measures, including research, assessment and evaluations of local or regional effects on which demands by Member States themselves might be based."
"It may well be the case that Community funding could be available to alleviate any specific problems caused by the abolition of duty-free sales."
"It will, however, be for Member States to identify any such problems and then to assess what kind of action, if any, would be appropriate."
"If Member States then wish to seek support from the Community they will need to do so under existing procedures: for example, those applicable to structural funding."
"Cases would then be examined in partnership with the Commission and decisions taken on the merits of each individual case."
"In the case of Structural Funds, interventions are aimed at reducing regional and social disparities."
"Together with the Member States and the regions concerned, the Commission has established a framework for these interventions covering matters such as priorities, financial resources and forms of assistance, which are usually implemented by means of an operational programme."
"The current programme runs until the end of 1999."
"The next programming period for the Structural Funds will run from 2000 to 2006."
"On 18 March this year, in the framework of its Agenda 2000 package, the Commission adopted its new draft regulations on the operation of the Structural Funds."
"In its new Article 4, it allows Member States to propose for eligibility under the national Objective II quota any areas facing or threatened by a high level of unemployment arising from an ongoing or planned restructuring of an activity of key importance for the agricultural, industrial or service sectors."
"Sea and air transport form part of the service sector."
"Community rules also provide Member States with the means to pursue legitimate public service goals for transport links when commercial operators are unable to meet these goals without public assistance."
"Community guidelines already exist in this area - for example, on aid to maritime transport links."
"Honourable Members will therefore see that well-known and tested procedures already exist through which Member States and the Commission can work in partnership to help in situations where specific problems might arise in relation to the abolition of intra-Community duty-free sales which will take place on 30 June 1999."
"Mr President, thank you Commissioner Monti for your explanation."
"I think you will actually find, if you look back in the records of this House, that the study has been requested for some time now."
"It is not just a recent phenomenon; we have been requesting the study for some years now."
"This motion calls for a study of the economic and social implications of the abolition of duty-free."
"It does not call for the retention of duty-free."
"I think that is a point that has to be made at the very start."
"I listened carefully to what you had to say, Commissioner Monti, and I know that on more than one occasion you have said no to carrying out such a study even though it had been previously agreed to."
"I understand the reasons that you have given."
"When you initially said that duty-free was to be abolished on 1 January 1993, a study was appropriate in the run-up to that period but when the derogation was agreed until 1999 then the study, as you say, is no longer applicable."
"You have also pointed out in the past that in the intervening period of seven and a half years the duty-free lobby were supposed to run down their operations and in fact what has happened is that the duty-free lobby have done the exact opposite and have expanded it."
"I take those points on board."
"We have noticed that there have been several studies carried out, many of them indicating job losses, some of them indicating the exact opposite."
"Can I say that I do not believe any of them?"
"I do not believe any of the studies from either side because none of them has been carried out by an independent assessor."
"They have all been carried out with vested interests and therefore I think it is appropriate at this time that we have the true picture, the clear picture of what will happen post duty-free."
"That is why we need an independent assessment."
"But as I have heard you say, Commissioner Monti, you are still saying no."
"Can I take you back to a meeting, a joint hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Transport and Tourism which was held last year on the question of duty-free, when you said that you were prepared to look at ways of ameliorating the effects of any unemployment."
"The question I have to ask is how can you look at ways of ameliorating the effects without a study?"
"You tried to turn that slightly in your answer earlier by saying it is up to the individual Member States to look at that and to look at ways of utilizing the Structural Funds by diverting them into those areas that may have unemployment caused by the abolition of duty-free."
"I would say that is not the duty of the Member States because if we do that then all of a sudden we will have a piecemeal policy on the Structural Funds and that is the last thing that we want within this Chamber, especially when we are coming up to the review of the Structural Funds."
"What we have also got to look at is the economic consequences and there are a number of unanswered questions here, too."
"An example that has been used on many occasions is if a ferry travels between two EU countries and passes through international waters what are the passengers entitled to?"
"Are they entitled to duty-free or are they entitled to pay duty at the port of departure or are they entitled to pay duty at the port of arrival?"
"There are economic questions here that have to be answered and therefore a study, I think, would address this balance and I would accordingly urge you to take this up."
"Mr President, I am surprised and disappointed at the Commissioner's negative reply."
"It is hard to believe that, in 1999, authorities are introducing measures without knowing what the effects will be on employment and regional development."
"May I point to the statements made in this House by the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, about how much store he sets by good cooperation with the European Parliament?"
"The Commission's reply does not square with this."
"Nor does it show much respect for the tens of thousands of anxious workers in the sector."
"I would draw your attention to the march in Brussels last year in which 5 000 people took part."
"The reply is also at odds with the citizens' Europe the Commission is so keen on."
"Could I therefore ask the Commissioner in the strongest possible terms whether he is prepared to discuss this disappointing outcome with Mr Santer."
"Could I also ask him, partly in view of the recent request made by the Transport Council, and in the interest of tens of thousands of worried people, to carry out the requested study urgently, so that we all know what we are talking about."
"We are adult enough, Mr President, to judge whether it is correct or not."
"Mr President, I rise to support Mr Cornelissen, Mrs Ewing and Mr Miller."
"My group supports the resolution."
"It has already been said that promises were given in this House by the Commission that it would undertake a social and economic impact study into the abolition of duty-free sales."
"Mr Cornelissen has put his finger on the pulse."
"The reality is that the Commission representatives continue to refuse to make any analysis even in the face of the decision taken by the Transport Council last March to call for a study of the situation."
"Regardless of what position individual Members of this House have on the worth of the continuation of duty-free, my group strongly supports this motion as it addresses the failure of the democratic process whereby the Commission continues to ignore the wishes of those who are elected by the citizens of Europe."
"It is they who have the right to expect that their interests are represented wholeheartedly."
"So let us have the study and then we can take the necessary decisions on this issue."
"Mr President, in passing laws which affect people, trade and places, we all have a duty of care and a duty to care."
"Conscious of this, more than seven years ago I proposed the amendment, prior to the decision to abolish duty-free, that we should undertake a study."
"In Parliament, as has been said, on behalf of the Commission in the clearest terms Mrs Scrivener pledged to undertake just such a study."
"That promise was never fulfilled."
"I deplore and regret the Commission's breach of good faith."
"Two years ago I wrote to Commissioner Mario Monti renewing my call for a study."
"I reject, therefore, the views of those today who argue that this debate is a late attempt to derail the abolition of duty-free."
"Had the Commission been as good as its word, such a study and its consequences would long since have been dealt with."
"Without prejudice to the question of substance - the abolition of duty-free - the call for a study remains as valid today as it was before, and I renew it now."
"For many, the duty-free question has taken on a certain symbolic significance in respect of tax harmonization and the single market, a symbolism disproportionate to its market share and substance."
"This has resulted in proponents and opponents alike paying inadequate attention to the practical consequences of abolition."
"The Commission, with some justification, points to industry's failure to make adjustments."
"So, too, the Commission has a case to answer."
"Not all the questions of abolition relate to industry; they touch on significant areas of public policy, such as regional, tourism and employment policy, and they are not questions for industry alone."
"On revenue and fiscal erosion, a question: can the Commissioner say with legal certainty what will be the state of play in exciseduty terms for vendors, Member States and consumers after the abolition in 1999?"
"Will excise duties vary for on-board sales as ferries and planes cross between territorial waters?"
"Will there be zero excise in international waters?"
"Is there a policy to deal with such chaos in the mind of the Commission?"
"I regret that tonight we have not had a commitment to do a study."
"It is overdue, it is necessary."
"Politically I believe in a political Commission."
"I am sorry we got a bureaucrats' answer tonight."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would not be having this debate if there was not a powerful lobby which has pulled out all the stops to rattle public opinion, and which has even succeeded in mobilizing most of the groups."
"We have known for a long time that the Council and the Commission together proposed to abolish duty-free sales at some point. More than seven years were allocated to this process of abolition, nor does it make any sense in a common market to keep such a scheme."
"Moreover it is clear that most of the duty-free shops will not suffer at all, as people do not buy there because it is cheaper - in fact often it is more expensive, as I know from experience - but because people have time on their hands, and they want to buy a gift, and so on."
"We are behind the Council and the Commission."
"We believe there is something to be said for a study, if only to work out a concrete action plan. Proof can then be established that there will only be a shift in jobs, and that the possible social and transport problems in peripheral regions will be countered in all earnestness."
"This we support; no more, but also no less."
"Mr President, I certainly find the present debate on the future of duty-free ridiculous to say the least."
"If ever we were trying to remove from the public something they want to keep, this is it."
"The vast majority who travel abroad do so either on holiday or on business and they like the availability of duty-free."
"It is the one little perk they have."
"What are we proposing?"
"We are proposing to remove the small advantage they have."
"And what will be achieved?"
"All we will do is anger European citizens who travel, and all in the name of the European Union and the single market."
"On top of that, we are going to put a lot of people out of work."
"I thought our business was about retaining and creating jobs, not putting people out of work."
"I would take this opportunity to urge the Commission and the Council that rather than reply as they have done this afternoon in a very bureaucratic way, as Mr Cox said, they should recognize the deep feeling and concern that is held on this issue by citizens throughout the length and breadth of the European Union."
"This will only increase as many people do not yet realize what is going to happen to them very soon."
"I urge that, instead of letting that resentment against the European Union deepen, we take positive steps to ensure that this does not happen."
"At the close of the debate I have received six motions for a resolution ."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Mr President, I have to live with the name of Piecyk, which is pronounced incorrectly again and again."
"This does not represent a problem."
"Mr President, in contrast to Mr Cornelissen, I am not surprised by the Commissioner's statement."
"It was almost what I was expecting."
"However, Commissioner, I believe that politics must be capable of measuring the decisions it makes against real life, and of having them measured."
"It may be said that a decision was made under certain circumstances and things did not happen as we perhaps expected or intended."
"I have the impression that you are ultimately shying away from acquiring data, under the motto of what the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve over."
"As has frequently been mentioned here, I find it remarkable to have to press for something to which the then Commissioner committed herself in 1991."
"We received this commitment from the Commission several years ago."
"It is also a question of good faith between Parliament and the Commission."
"There is another question. All those people, including myself, who are committing themselves to the retention of duty- free sales, because of their concern about the imminent job losses with which they are confronted, are working with shock figures provided by the duty-free industry and pressure groups."
"That is the real reason for saying that we need a correct, verifiable and wide-ranging survey, so that we can reach a reasonable, rational conclusion."
"I do not know whether 140 000 jobs are really at stake in the Union."
"I do know that several thousand jobs will be lost in the daytrip and ferry crossing business in my own area of Schleswig-Holstein on the Baltic Coast."
"I do not know which airports and airlines will be affected, but I do know that smaller, regional airports, connections to remote areas, and Baltic ferry traffic, especially with Finland, will be particularly affected."
"I do not know what the precise fiscal effects of the abolition of tax- and duty-free sales will be, but I do know very well that assistance for the transport sector in the affected regions and for social security contributions from the unemployed will be back on the agenda, as you have indicated."
"For all these reasons I say that we need a proper, correct survey before we go on arguing about the whys and wherefores."
"I can imagine that you want this."
"However, the Transport Council has demanded it, Parliament will demand it and, if my understanding is correct, we have a joint motion for a resolution tabled for tomorrow morning by many groups."
"For this reason, the Commission should not continue to refuse at this point, but should provide this study, so that we can then hold a reasonable discussion about it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my committee held a hearing and a report by Mr Garosci is available."
"We must make a distinction between the demand for a survey and the abolition of duty-free."
"I share Mr Piecyk's opinion that a survey would illuminate the false stories spread by the lobby, as parliamentary democracy is being put under massive pressure by completely unfair means."
"There can be no doubt that the coastal regions which are particularly affected will receive specific aid if necessary."
"On the other hand, the discussion is really about cancelling the abolition of duty-free decided on in 1991."
"The debate is being dominated by Members from countries in which there are high taxes on consumer goods, or which have borders with such states."
"It thus involves Member States in which extensive use is made of tax advantages, which is not justified within the sense of the entire population of the European Union."
"Weekend speeches emphasize the importance of tax harmonization again and again, but on Monday morning everyone wants their own tax breaks."
"That is why, Commissioner, I share your opinion that duty-free sales must be abolished, because it conceals the concept of cheap shopping - frequently quite blatant consumer deception."
"Those who say that airports are in danger must be asked whether the ordinary citizen should subsidize business travellers, by continuing to give them the opportunity to shop tax-free?"
"I do not think so, and there is absolutely no reason to grant special advantages if we want to harmonize certain fiscal regulations within the scope of the euro."
"We can, Commissioner, discuss this much better, and you will be in a better position, if you commission a survey of the regional effects and take the wind out of the sails of the entire lobby!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a rather odd debate we are having."
"In response to a question by one of my fellow party members in the Lower Chamber in the Netherlands, the Minister of Finance states that the European Commission does not want to conduct such a study."
"Here, the Commissioner is telling us that it is the Council of Ministers which does not want a study."
"And so we are pussyfooting around."
"I am not saying that we should maintain the duty-free facilities ad infinitum , but I do think it is very bad that on the one hand we are saying to society that we are abolishing it, yet on the other hand, the planned tax harmonization - which was supposed to be further advanced than it is at the moment - and the internal market are not yet a reality."
"I think it is extremely bad, Mr Commissioner, that we are facing society, not the Member States and the Commission, with a fait accompli ."
"For that reason alone we should be conducting a study!"
"Mr President, having listened to the Commissioner's speech I am of the opinion that the issue was displaced, since we were faced with a double challenge."
"Mr Commissioner, the first challenge is this: you said that after a transition period lasting seven years we did not need a report, and that we would not draw up a report."
"However, you also admitted that there would be repercussions on employment, on the ports, on travel and on the market."
"The second challenge is this: there will be repercussions."
"Each Member State will face up to these repercussions and rectify the situation."
"However, was it the policy of each Member State individually that caused these repercussions or was it Community policy?"
"This Community policy must be responsible for coming to the aid of each Member State to put these repercussions right."
"In the meantime, Mr Commissioner, the people working in the sector say that 145 000 jobs will be lost, mainly affecting young people who work in the duty-free shops."
"I want to ask you what these young people will do."
"Do you know why you are delaying the study?"
"Do you know why you will never submit it?"
"Because you cannot be bothered to look and see what will happen to these people."
"That is why you are avoiding it."
"If not, it would have been very easy for you to produce evidence to show that such and such would be the repercussions, such and such would be the tax gains."
"You do not want to get involved in the issue of what will happen to the 150 000 people who will be thrown out into the streets. These young people will swell the ranks of the 20 million unemployed, made jobless by your notorious, infamous unified market and the policies you implement to promote it."
"Mr President, first of all I think it is outrageous and very irresponsible of the Commission that it should actually pursue something without first having an independent assessment of its consequences."
"Especially for island states in the EU including Ireland, it really warrants particular attention and I wonder what the Commissioner is actually afraid of by refusing to carry out the study that so many people have called for."
"With its harmonization of the tax system, the EU is gradually assuming all the characteristics of a single state."
"Irish politicians from the main political parties are now queuing up to score points on this issue, but they should be criticized for their unflinching enthusiasm for the single market in the past."
"For example, the leader of our own government in Ireland, Mr Ahern, is only a recent convert to the duty-free cause."
"When he was Ireland's Minister for Finance in 1991 he joined other EU finance ministers in agreeing that duty-free sales should cease by the end of the decade."
"I really think it is irresponsible of the EU to push something through without a proper study being carried out and, as Mr Miller said, any studies done to date have been by vested interests on both sides."
"We need proper studies that are independent and will give us the whole story and it is the responsibility of the Commission to carry that out."
"Mr President, can I start by saying that if somebody was thinking of inventing duty-free tomorrow and they actually came forward with these ideas I am sure they would never be taken up."
"However, we are not in that position."
"The original rationale behind duty-free is clearly flawed and clearly the people who had the idea never envisaged the single market which we are trying to work towards at the moment."
"The same could be true of something like smoking."
"If we could have banned smoking before it started I am sure we would have done so, but clearly all we can do for the moment is try and discourage it."
"So it is there, we have got to deal with it."
"The question is, how do we deal with it?"
"We all know, because many of us in this Parliament travel as often as we do, that certainly ports and airports use the advantages of duty-free to actually reduce the costs of fares and of travelling to passengers."
"In my own region in particular I have two airports, Manchester Airport and Blackpool Airport, that benefit considerably from duty-free and indeed there are jobs tied up in that."
"There is a point which has already been made by many other speakers: there has not been an independent study, and we need one."
"Jobs are tied up in this."
"Whether 140 000 jobs would go, as Mr Ephremidis estimates, we do not know."
"Clearly, some of the people working in those shops will continue to work there; some will not work there because the profitability is not the same."
"What we need to know is what the impact will be, how many jobs will be lost, and then a decision can be made about what to do."
"That decision may incorporate some adjustments of regional funding in order to take account of that fact."
"Like Mr Miller, I do not believe there should be a piecemeal approach to this but nevertheless if extra money was forthcoming from the Commission or elsewhere to take account of this fact, I am sure it would not be refused by the regions concerned."
"We need a way forward, we need to be objective about this, we must not just bow to vested interests."
"What we need is an objective analysis, and I ask the Commission and the Council to come forward with proposals on that basis."
"Mr President, must we remain loyal to our single market principles come what may, or are we interested in people as well?"
"Come to the North Sea spa of Cuxhaven, where I come from, which attracts a lot of visitors, not least because of duty-free."
"Speak to those who will lose their jobs, according to the shipping lines."
"We do not have any other jobs."
"We are fighting for our fishing industry and have just one small shipyard left."
"The hinterland is rural, arable farmland and pasture, without many SMEs."
"All in all it is a rural area experiencing difficulties, soon to be without 5b status or the new Objective II status, Mr Monti. Agenda 2000 does not provide any security."
"The unemployment rate where I live on the North Sea coast is 11 % and rising."
"The position is the same in other areas along Europe's 80 000 km coastline."
"You can see that the problem is not local."
"We are in it up to our necks, though we are working on solutions for the future."
"Our long-term goals are lively networks of small and medium-sized harbours, coastal management, protection of salt marshes, the sustained establishment of maritime information and technology systems and attractive tourist resorts."
"These could be implemented successfully by the coastal states, if Europe helps them."
"We are counting on this."
"Our future depends on it."
"We are currently expanding our harbour in Cuxhaven, with EU assistance, but you, the opponents of duty-free sales, are blocking the entrance."
"A harbour without ships is like a sea without fish."
"The symbiotic relationship between the coast and inland areas, between economically weak and economically strong areas, has been successful with duty-free, though seldom sufficiently so."
"The volume of business has increased rapidly since 1991 and with it the number of jobs."
"Not even a modern economic programme such as the trans-European network has yet provided such economic and social cooperation."
"I know it will take a miracle to overturn the Council decision, but I do not belong to the Council."
"I represent the people."
"What am I supposed to tell the families who are hit by job losses?"
"I do not think that anyone in Europe can be insensitive enough to wilfully destroy these achievements."
"The cost of unemployment benefit and restructuring projects will far exceed the tax revenues lost on duty-free sales, and no fiscal harmonization is in sight anyway."
"I therefore demand further examinations of the regional effects."
"Perhaps there is also a legal interpretation which permits an exemption, as there was for sea travel to Heligoland, the jewel of the North Sea."
"The Transport Council has decided this in the meantime."
"I would like to ask you, Mr Monti, and those Members who oppose duty-free sales, to follow this route."
"Mr President, if the Commissioner says it is possible to get support instead of the traffic which might stop, I would say this to him."
"Firstly, ferry traffic is not eligible for trans-European network support, unless both ports are part of it."
"Secondly, structural support is not operational support."
"I say this in reply to your statements that we should look at the support side."
"Thirdly, you have said a lot about duty-free sales being an indirect form of support."
"But the indirect support which is available today in the form of flagging out rules is much greater and could have much more serious consequences, namely the flagging out which would take place in ferry traffic if duty-free were abolished."
"I still wonder why the Commissioner is so against making this investigation while at the same time insisting that the Commission has information about the ferry routes which are most threatened."
"I am thinking about what lies closest to my heart, namely the most northerly all year round ferry route in the Northern Straits."
"Thousands of signatures were sent in support of this route, well before any lobbying started, Mrs Aelvoet."
"Unfortunately, those signatures were not received by Commissioner Monti."
"The aim is to safeguard jobs in the area, but there are also environmental reasons for protecting the ferry links."
"One study, for example, says that using this ferry link saves millions of marks on the environment."
"Mr President, let me say first of all that I recognize the logic of the eventual abolition of duty-free."
"We must in Europe work to phase out the anomalies in the fabric of the single market and one of these anomalies is intra-Community duty-free sales."
"But in Europe we need to harmonize other things as well, or at least approximate them - levels of excise duty, VAT and other taxes."
"Yet the problem of intra-Community smuggling of duty-paid alcohol and tobacco is probably on a greater scale than the loss of revenue by the continual existence of intra-Community duty-free."
"The question is why is the abolition now, why is it so urgent and why are we doing it in the dark?"
"There have been a number of studies done by a variety of people."
"Many of those on both sides of the argument are possibly flawed but they have indicated at various times a potential loss of something between 112 000 and 147 000 jobs in the EU, with 90 % of those job losses in a period of two years of the abolition of intra-Community duty-free with major impacts on employment in Spain, France and the United Kingdom."
"The European Commission has claimed that duty-free is costing Member States' exchequers ECU 2 billion in lost revenue yet there are some studies that claim that the result of the abolition of duty-free will be that Member States will be worse off because of increased transport costs and other tax losses."
"There have been claims that it will cost the average person taking a charter flight in implicit costs, adding up all the costs together, an extra 14 for each time they travel from their Member State and back again."
"It has been claimed that EU destinations will become less competitive than nearby non-EU destinations, that Turkey will benefit at the expense of Greece, that there will be a loss from the United Kingdom of 635 000 visits a year within the EU, partly offset by a rise of 124 000 extra visits to non-EU destinations."
"So that is the problem we face."
"Now despite what the finance ministers claim to have said, the reality is that on 17 March this year - less than three weeks ago - at the initiative of the Irish delegation on the Transport Council and with the support of eight other Member States, namely Sweden, Belgium, France, Germany, Finland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, there was a demand for a study of the possible employment and financial effects of the abolition of duty-free in June 1999."
"Commissioner Monti says that two wrongs do not make a right; because the promised study was not done at the proper time it is now too late to do it at all."
"It is Catch 22."
"He said Community funding might be available to help alleviate the impact, but the impact is going to be short and sharp immediately after the abolition."
"Yet he refuses to allow for regional employment impacts to be assessed in advance."
"Tomorrow Parliament will vote for the resolution demanding such a study."
"The Council of Ministers is already in favour of such a study by nine votes to six at worst."
"Why is it now that the Commission alone sets its face against such a study that it initially promised?"
"If the case is so powerful for that abolition, Commissioner Monti, why do you not demonstrate it by actually having the study?"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I have to say that you have sorely disappointed me."
"For years now, like many of my colleagues, I have been battling to explain to the various different lobbies that duty-free shopping must be abolished in an internal market."
"Well I must say, the arrogant way in which the Commission has responded to our legitimate questioning makes us literally feel as though we have been stabbed in the back."
"I feel it is important for you to know that."
"The line of argument you used in answer to Mr Cornelissen's question was, if I may say so, quite unworthy."
"You told us two things: firstly, that we would not be doing this study because it had been set for an immediate decision."
"The decision had been put back, therefore the study was not to be done, as if it had become superfluous, as if the analysis of the consequences of a decision become superfluous as soon as the date of application of the decision changes."
"That is the sort of reasoning that says a blind person can drive a car as long as they do so slowly."
"That is simply not the case."
"The second argument you deployed was the lateness argument."
"Many years have elapsed between Mrs Scrivener's promise and your being here today without having honoured that promise."
"Whose fault is that?"
"Under such circumstances, you are not in a position to accuse us of being late in taking part in the debate, when for years you yourself failed to respond. It was also mentioned earlier that you were asked questions during Parliament's Question Time."
"There is a Latin proverb, a Roman law adage I am sure you know, which goes: ' Nemo auditur propriam turpitidinem allegans' - none shall invoke their own turpitude."
"In any case, Mr Commissioner, you do not have the right to refuse Parliament or the citizens of Europe an analysis of the consequences of the decisions you take, simply because a decision has already been taken."
"Mr President, I too am amazed that Commissioner Monti, having had time to reflect on the discussions we had earlier this week at Question Time and having heard the strong feelings that the majority of the House - we, the messengers of the people - have on this issue, is not prepared to relent, even at this very late stage, and give us a more positive response."
"By just saying 'no' he is just burying his head in the sand."
"The success of the Irish minister at the Transport Council has been documented here."
"There are now nine Council members around the transport table who are prepared to ask for a study."
"There is no reason to assume that the same majority, or more, would not obtain, if the Commissioner had a study and allowed the Ecofin ministers to look at the issue again in a clear and factual way. Politicians do not see any shame in this."
"The many thousands of workers who marched in the streets of Brussels recently - airport workers, industrial workers, generally from the duty-free industry - should not have to beg for their jobs."
"They are entitled to look to our institutions to protect their jobs."
"For every measure we take here, we are supposed to have an employment audit."
"So how does the Commissioner reconcile that with just getting rid of all these jobs in one fell swoop?"
"The accusation the Commissioner made here that it is for people in favour of abolition and that we who are against it want to support the hidden subsidies to the alcohol, tobacco and travel industries is not true."
"It is very simplistic."
"What is happening here is that we have looked at all sides of it and we have come down, on balance, in favour of employment."
"I appeal to the Commissioner to give us a more favourable response this evening, because the vote tomorrow will go in favour of the study, and it is time for the Commission to face up to that."
"I would like, first of all, to thank each of you for your remarks."
"The Commission is not making any particular proposal."
"Some of the remarks assume the Commission was making proposals."
"This was a decision taken unanimously by the Ecofin Council in 1991."
"The Commission is not pushing for anything."
"As was made clear, the reference made by my predecessor, Mrs Scrivener, to the study was to the effect of identifying whether or not the decision to abolish duty-free should take effect on 1 January 1993 like all the other measures concerning the single market."
"You know what the outcome has been: no study, but a seven-and-a-half year postponement."
"As to the pretended request of the Transport Council for a study, the outcome of the Transport Council of 17 March was that the presidency of the Council noted the strong support by a majority of delegations for the Irish intervention and decided to report to the Ecofin Council concerning further measures to be decided by the ministers of finance, if appropriate."
"The Ecofin Council has repeatedly stressed its unwillingness to ask the Commission to do this study."
"There were questions concerning the important issue of whether there are clear rules that are going to be applied after June 1999 or not."
"Yes, I can be very positive and reassuring in that respect."
"Rules exist in terms of VAT and excise legislation that apply now and will also apply after June 1999."
"I refer to Article 23(1) of Directive 92/12 and Article 8 and following of the Sixth VAT Directive."
"As to the specific question Mr Miller raised, the mere passage through international waters does not modify the internal market rules."
"They will be modified only if the vessel were to touch land on third-country territory."
"As you can imagine, I am as sensitive as you are to the issue of employment."
"There are serious ways of approaching employment issues."
"Some of them have to do with taxation."
"As Parliament will be aware, the Commission is - and I am personally - working very hard with the support of Parliament and, in particular, the competent Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, to arrive at some form of tax coordination that is the serious response of tax instruments to the employment challenge."
"The Commission is prepared, as you know and as Parliament supports, to consider reduced VAT rates on labourintensive services."
"Even much more important, we are engaged in strenuous efforts to fight harmful tax competition."
"You know, as I do, that the taxation of capital on this continent has gone down by 10 % in the last 15 years."
"Taxation on labour has gone up 7 %."
"What is the reason for that?"
"A lack of tax coordination."
"In December 1997, for the first time, we persuaded the 15 finance ministers to agree on a package of measures against harmful tax competition."
"That is the first step towards eliminating tax havens in Europe so that taxation on labour can be slightly reduced."
"How can I go to the finance ministers and press them for the continuation of this serious fiscal policy for employment that Parliament supports if, at the same time, I were to go and ask them to please consider leaving in existence localized tax havens such as duty-free?"
"(The speaker was interrupted by Mr Cox) No-one can escape logic."
"Believe me, I am deeply committed to making taxation policy in Europe favourable to employment."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you please not to interrupt the Commissioner."
"I am grateful to those of you - and there have been some - who have noted the constructive approach that I brought here this evening."
"A study may have two components."
"One is to identify what specific difficulties a particular regional airport or ferry line might have."
"No one is better placed than the Member State concerned to identify that."
"There is one way in which the Commission can be helpful and that is to identify the appropriate instruments of regional policy, of transport policy that might, in the event that there are serious problems, be helpful."
"I have committed the Commission to do that, not the phantom study which by now in the public perception could be associated with a reconsideration of the deadline for duty-free."
"Finally, it is not for me to judge whether the Commission is an appropriate political body or whether it gave you bureaucratic answers this evening."
"However, I can assure you that the Commission, in its political responsibility, is not prepared to deceive European citizens by doing something that would, in effect, conflict with a serious employment policy based on tax coordination."
"The Commission is not prepared to do anything that would help retain a hidden subsidy, in the sense that it is not transparent, that it is regressive because it is paid by the general taxpayer who is normally less well off than travellers with access to duty-free, that goes to a large extent to subsidize the consumption of alcohol and tobacco."
"Mr President, in his reply to the debate the Commissioner referred to the pretended wish of the Transport Council for a study."
"I should like to read to you a letter from Gavin Strang, chairman of the EU Transport Council, to Gordon Brown, chairman of Ecofin."
"It says: ' Dear Gordon, you will be aware that at the 17 March 1998 Transport Council the Irish Minister raised the issue of abolition of intra-EC duty-free under 'any other business' and called for a study to be undertaken into the possible employment and financial effects of the abolition of duty-free in 1999."
"Eight Member States supported the Irish Minister's request, including Sweden, Belgium, France, Germany, Finland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom."
"In my summary of the discussion I agreed that I would forward these views to you as chairman of Ecofin."
"Ecofin will no doubt wish to take into account the support given by Transport Ministers to the Irish request that the Commission should undertake a study into the possible employment and financial effects of abolition of intra-EC duty-free sales.'"
"It seems to me that is not a 'pretend' decision of the Transport Council, it is a decision."
"Commissioner Monti may not like it, but it exists."
"Thank you, Mr Ford. We shall not be re-opening the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of Thursday 2 April have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, this concerns item 4 of yesterday's Minutes and Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure, on the duties of the Conference of Presidents."
"Paragraph 5 says: ""The Conference of Presidents shall draw up the draft agenda of Parliament's part-sessions' ."
"It does not say that the group chairmen decide whether a report is acceptable to them or not."
"This means that the Conference of Presidents should not judge the reports appearing on the agenda on their contents."
"This was the case with my report on the partsession which was discussed this week, and it was especially the case with your own report on the voting system."
"I really wonder, therefore, whether the Conference of Presidents is in fact blatantly and grossly violating the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Wijsenbeek, you have been chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities for some time now, and you are one of the many people in this Chamber who have a great deal of parliamentary experience."
"You know, as indeed we all do - I do not claim any privilege to this knowledge - that, in the final analysis, the Conference of Presidents is elected by Parliament. When changes are to be made to the agenda, the final word is always left to Parliament, which also votes."
"Therefore, you need never worry that there is an elected organ of the House which was not elected by the House."
"Mr President, this is the text relating to the Randzio-Plath report."
"Yesterday, it was agreed during the vote that the words 'responsabilité démocratique' would be used instead of 'contrôle démocratique' ."
"That change has been made in one of the titles, but not throughout the whole text."
"For example, paragraph 8 still says ""contrôle démocratique' ."
"The words ""contrôle démocratique' must now be replaced throughout the text with ""responsabilité démocratique' ."
"That is what was agreed yesterday."
"I have made a note of it, Mr Herman, and we shall look at all the texts to make sure that it is done."
"Going over the attendance register, I noticed that my name is not on it."
"Perhaps I forgot to sign it, but I did take part in all the votes yesterday."
"Mr Martens, you may have forgotten to sign, but there are a lot of us here and we can vouch for your continued presence in this Chamber which, I think, holds you in great respect."
"Mr President, you just responded to Mr Wijsenbeek and stated that he was chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"May I inform you that my colleague Mr Fayot is chairman of the Rules Committee."
"Mr Corbett, you must remember that Mr Wijsenbeek presided over the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities for a long time, and he knows the Rules of Procedure perfectly."
"Mr President, I would just like to point something out."
"My name does not appear on Monday's record of attendance, although I was present and voted by the electronic voting system, which must be easy to check."
"I should be grateful if you would arrange to have it checked."
"Thank you very much."
"I have made a note of it."
"Mr President, there is an omission in the Minutes."
"On page 19 you will see that Mr Lataillade spoke."
"It does not record his deep concern and compassion for the plight of Mrs Randzio-Plath!"
"We shall be sure to extend similar compassion to him in the future..."
"Mr Falconer, you were here yesterday."
"Several of us were here yesterday."
"Mr President, I raised the following matter on the Friday of the last part-session."
"I refer to the discrimination in terms of television coverage of the Friday morning session."
"We are here to do a job and it should be recorded both for the archives and for television just like any other session."
"What progress has the President made with this request?"
"Mr Hallam, I totally agree."
"I would say there is another reason for Friday morning, and we will look into it."
"But I would add that, on the whole, television coverage is not an issue which is regulated by the Presidency. I wish it were regulated by the Presidency and by the House."
"Television has its own rules and regulations, and we are not in a position to have any influence over it. I am afraid we are often under its influence, and not always to the good."
"Mr President, I was astonished to see that my name is not on the record of attendance."
"I really thought that I had both attended regularly and signed the register."
"But I may be wrong."
"In any case, I think a number of speeches and rollcall votes prove that I was here."
"Yes, I believe you made a speech during the sitting."
"So it really is a bit much."
"Votes"
"Mr President, at the end of this vote in the presence of representatives of the Council I would like to mention something which is very important before the final vote."
"We have had a text conveyed to us by the Council. Mr Buffetaut has worked on this text, we have given our views on it, and we have voted on the committee version today in the final vote."
"During this process, and even before we were able to vote today, the Council has again changed the text which was conveyed to us, which we have worked on."
"In other words, it did this before listening to the outcome from Parliament."
"I consider that a flagrant contempt of Parliament, and ask that this should be communicated to the Council."
"Mr Schulz, I have made a note of your comments, and the Presidency will not fail to take the necessary steps."
"(During successive votes, Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)"
"Mr President, I would like to make two comments."
"Firstly, the committee deleted Amendment No 4 concerning Article 4, paragraph 1(b) of the Council proposal."
"In the meantime, however, we have satisfied ourselves that this Article merely serves to establish that no-one may be punished twice for the same matter."
"In other words, it is a question of the legal principle ne bis in idem , and we therefore ask you to vote against this deletion so that the original text is restored."
"That is the first point."
"The second point I would like to bring to your attention is the fact that the rapporteur's language, the original language, is French, and Amendment No 7, as it is written, is the official version."
"It says that when the person concerned has not had an adequate opportunity to defend himself, ""inter alia ' because of language problems, the term ""inter alia ' which is in the French text, means that it is not exclusive, and other possibilities can be envisaged."
"I know that it is not stated in some other versions, but it is more in the citizen's interest."
"But it is the French version, which is the official version, and I would be grateful if you would arrange for it to be corrected."
"I would ask the House to consider the rapporteur's comments, Mrs Reding."
"Mr President, I strongly urge that Mrs Reding's oral amendment should be accepted."
"We must point out that we made a mistake in committee, which for once might mean us spoiling a good idea from the Council."
"That is why it is imperative that Mrs Reding's oral amendment should be supported."
"Mr Schulz, Mrs Reding did not make an oral amendment; she made oral observations which, I trust, the House will take into account."
"Please do not cause confusion, as we will have problems if you do."
"I am particularly glad that Mrs Reding has noticed this matter, which is important to countries where there is already extensive cooperation between the authorities, for example."
"That is why our group decided to vote as you proposed."
"Mrs Thors, we will not debate this here."
"The rapporteur always has the right to make a comment, indeed many comments. However, we shall not repeat the debate which took place in committee."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I would like to point out that Mrs Thors has introduced a good amendment, by which progress in implementing the rights of the child should be included."
"However, we do not want to place more emphasis on this than on other legal concerns, such as human rights and minority rights. We therefore ask that the text up to 'of the Convention on the Rights of the Child' should be dropped."
"We want to insert that between human rights and minority rights without any additional formulations."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"Mr President, I had not intended to slow down our Friday voting, but a short while ago a Dutch colleague drew my attention to the fact that a mistake has crept into the Dutch version of my report, at paragraph 16."
"The words 'vis-à-vis third countries' are missing at that point."
"I would ask you to check this in all language versions on the basis of the original German text."
"Mr Posselt, I have made a note of your comments, of course, and the Presidency will make sure that the language of this report is looked at."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today for improved legal cooperation in criminal cases."
"This is a necessary element in the fight against organized crime."
"We support better, more effective, practical cooperation between Member States."
"Serious effort should ensure speedier processing, and enable practical difficulties to be resolved more effectively."
"This could be brought about through direct contact between the authorities concerned in mutual legal assistance, for example."
"However, we remain adamant that as far as possible, national traditions and styles of practice should be respected, and law and order should at be paramount at all times."
"Reding report (A4-0121/98)"
"It is good that the question of revoking driving licences is being dealt with in a convention and not through harmonizing legislation."
"However, it is very doubtful whether the home Member State will be responsible for implementing a decision to revoke a driving licence issued in another country under that country's legislation without examining the matter itself under its own laws."
"Posselt report (A4-0107/98)"
"Over the next ten years, the European Union is going to be faced with one of the greatest challenges in its history, when it welcomes the almost simultaneous accession of ten new countries, at a time when the candidate countries are experiencing a difficult transition period."
"In fact, they have to deal with the disorder which has followed in the wake of the collapse of the communist systems - social unrest, disorganization of controls, corruption, organized crime, migration of populations - and they must build democratic states governed by the rule of law."
"It will be particularly difficult for both sides to maintain a balance between this transition period and accession to the European Union."
"To simplify the task, the Europe of the Nations Group some time ago proposed the creation of a Europe of ""variable geometry' , on the basis of several cooperation associations, which would enable candidate countries to join the European Union by moving progressively from one association to another, as appropriate."
"We pointed out at the time that the first cooperation association to be set up, the most urgent cooperation association, should relate to internal security."
"We are therefore delighted that, at their meeting of 30 January, the EU justice and home affairs ministers invited their counterparts from the candidate countries to sign ""pre-membership' pacts on combating organized crime."
"We saw in this a reflection of our position, or at least a certain fellow feeling."
"However, if the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force, it will not simplify matters because it does not encourage flexibility."
"For example, in order to prevent international crime, it would be preferable for the candidate countries of eastern Europe to be able to join Europol now."
"But will the incorporation of Europol into EU procedures not complicate the problem?"
"Similarly, it is difficult to understand the aim of the European Parliament's proposal to create a specialized European service drawing on the experience of competent national services with regard to external border control."
"If this proposal means that a system of financial aid needs to be set up, at the European level, to support Member States which are experiencing serious difficulties with regard to the control of their external borders, we are in agreement."
"We had, in fact, already suggested it."
"But we believe it is essential for each country to remain directly responsible for its borders. Otherwise, an integrated system would not motivate anyone, and in fact, it could have the opposite effect."
"I have voted against this report, as I cannot support the arrogant attitude which the EU is taking towards the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe."
"The EU cannot demand, amongst other things, that the applicant countries modify their visa policies with third party countries to bring them into line with the EU's before they even join the EU, and before the EU's provisions in this area under the Amsterdam Treaty are accepted."
"Not all the EU Member States have ratified the Amsterdam Treaty as yet, so I fail to see how reference can be made to this."
"When it comes to police work, I do not think Europol should develop and charge the applicant countries at all."
"Interpol already exists and is working in the areas which the EU wants to hand over to Europol."
"Instead of Europol, I think we should continue to rely on Interpol in the fight against international crime."
"As for the situation in the applicant countries, in important areas, I believe the EU will have to accept a number of transitional rules if the countries join."
"What I would really like to see is the EU handing over many of its powers in favour of the national parliaments, which would make enlargement easier."
"The way things look now, the EU seems to want to annex the countries of central and eastern Europe, as they would have to accept all the EU's laws without having any influence over their substance."
"I cannot accept this."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mr Posselt's report."
"We have done so in the belief that we must ensure that prospective Member States in central and eastern Europe develop sound, democratic communities based on the rule of law."
"The report sets the scene for closer cooperation between existing Member States in the field of justice and home affairs."
"Denmark has one reservation in this field, but we do not wish to preclude other nations from entering into closer cooperation."
"We do, however, retain the right to remain outside."
"Our most important consideration is to ensure that the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe should be given financial and political backup in their efforts to develop democratic authorities."
"This also applies to supporting projects for the training of administrative officials and police."
"To ensure that democratic measures are upheld, the people who will be administering the new laws must be trained for this purpose."
"The Danish Social Democrats oppose the view that the institutional changes should be in place prior to enlargement."
"Our stance is that Parliament must not put obstacles in the way of enlargement."
"Applicant countries should be assured of their inclusion in the European Union once they have fulfilled the objectives set out in the individual partnership agreements."
"The enlargement process must not be delayed by a stipulation on the part of the European Parliament that the distribution of mandates and weighting of votes should be in place before the first countries can be accepted."
"As the communist regime destroyed every rule of civil life during its rule, the accession to the European Union of ex-communist countries presupposes a type of revival by the applicants, to make their internal structures compatible with the rules and spirit of the European Union."
"This also applies to relations with the police, legal matters, the mobility of goods, services and citizens, civil rights and the protection of minors."
"When this tedious adaptation process has reached maturity, it will certainly be time for these states to join the European Union."
"Joint resolution (B4-0424/98, B4-0426/98, B4-0427/98, B4-0428/98 and B4-0429/98)"
"Mr President, I can happily live with this resolution which calls for a study, if only because a study might actually show that some of the wilder allegations of job losses are perhaps greatly exaggerated."
"In any case, there is no harm in finding this out."
"I admire Commissioner Monti and the way he has resisted the pressure from the alcohol and tobacco industries to try and have this decision reversed."
"I hope that the economic and finance ministers will be similarly resolute."
"From the point of view of a finance minister, there is surely no sense in reintroducing a tax break for the alcohol and tobacco industries: a tax break which curiously is available only to people travelling internationally, usually a group of people who are, on average, better off than the ordinary citizen."
"I hope therefore that this resolution, even if it calls for a study which may provide more objective facts than some of the studies that have come from partisan organizations with an interest in this matter, will nonetheless help confirm the decision taken long ago by the European Union."
"I am satisfied that the positions you have adopted are not just yours but that they are supported by other Members."
"Of course, there are quite a few Members who hold the opposite view."
"Global Satellite Navigation System"
"The next item is the report (A4-0109/98) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the agreement between the European Community, the European Space Agency and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation on a European contribution to the development of a global navigation satellite system (COM(97)0442 - C4-0043/98-97/0231(CNS))"
"Mr President, in the last few years, satellite-assisted positioning and navigation systems have become increasingly widespread."
"The purpose of this technology is the permanent, environmentally compatible, secure and guaranteed mobility of individuals and goods through better traffic and transport management."
"This is not just true of air transport."
"This new technology is being applied in other areas as well, such as local public transport, the railways, and the transport of goods - but also in cars, farming and the fishing industry."
"You do not have to be a prophet to foresee that this technology will progress further."
"It will undoubtedly be used more widely in the area of leisure, for example."
"Sailing and walking enthusiasts may perhaps only pursue their hobbies in the future with this high technology."
"There are already two systems which operate on a world-wide basis: the American ""global positioning system' , known as GPS; and the Russian global satellite navigation system called GLONAS."
"However, neither of them meets all the requirements of civilian users."
"Both systems are nationally controlled, were conceived for military purposes, and have been artificially weakened in some respects for civilian applications."
"The accuracy is inadequate, there is an unacceptably high probability of technical errors, and warning times for system failures are too long. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the system will be permanently available, and no-one is responsible for the functioning of the system."
"All these reasons compel us as Europeans to launch an initiative of our own. This is the background against which the Commission's proposal should be seen."
"As long ago as 1994, the Commission and the Council took the initiative in this area with the support of the European Parliament."
"The agreement on which we have to decide today is a consistent continuation of previous developments."
"Its purpose is to govern cooperation between the European Union, ESA - the European Space Agency - and EUROCONTROL - the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation."
"These three European institutions are to work towards a European contribution to the development of a global satellite navigation system."
"In particular, the plans and projects of the participants are to be coordinated and combined."
"As a first step, the existing Russian and American systems are to be supplemented, to correct the technical defects and inaccuracies I have just described."
"Technical problems can be solved in this way, but the fundamental institutional problem - namely the lack of civilian control and a guarantee for the system - will remain."
"That is why a second step is required, with the objective of developing our own independent civilian system with a guaranteed optimal performance at all times and in all places."
"We are working away steadily at this."
"In a global situation in which the market for satellite navigation could be dominated by the United States, this agreement will undoubtedly help to ensure that European interests are protected, and that it is easier in practice to realize the full potential of satellite navigation technology."
"The importance of state-of-the-art technology for Europe as a location for industry is underlined time and again."
"With this agreement we can recover lost ground and lay down our own European standards for satellite technology in the future."
"Of course, the budgetary aspect still has to be considered."
"That is why I referred in my report to an action plan for the financing of such a project."
"In all honesty, I must admit that future civilian users still regard the project with scepticism."
"It is quite clear, however, that without the participation of European industry and other partners it will be impossible to finance such a project."
"So in order to ensure the involvement of a large number of collaborators in the development of a global satellite navigation system, a coherent strategy with a financial perspective should be formulated as soon as possible."
"The European Union is today called upon to enter into international cooperation, the major advantage of which is a reduction in costs and investment."
"In this connection, potential partners are - and will continue to be - the USA and Russia, whom I have already mentioned, together with Japan."
"Therefore the agreement with which we are dealing today has a symbolic character as well, since it underlines the resolution and the will of Europeans to make their own contribution in this area, and that is why I ask you to approve it."
"Mr President, let me first thank Mrs Langenhagen for the excellent report she has presented."
"New technology is developing rapidly in aviation."
"Used correctly, it will make flying safer and also create an opportunity to deal with some of the constantly recurring delays we have to live with at present."
"What we have to decide now is whether we want Europe to be part of this developing technology, or if we want to remain on the sidelines."
"We are facing a highly strategic choice which could have major consequences for the future development of navigation systems."
"The question is, should we develop our own navigation system or should we simply modify those already in existence?"
"There are a lot of indications that it would be cheaper to be involved in developing the existing system."
"At the same time, it means putting a lot into research and development to try to develop our own system and the comfort of not always being dependent on someone else."
"I think there are reasons for being positive about further development, and hence for entering into this agreement between the European Community, the European Space Agency and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation."
"This represents an opportunity to be in there and influence future developments, which I think is a good thing."
"But there is also good reason to warn that we risk digging ourselves into an incredibly costly project which may not give the results we are justifiably hoping for."
"There are also reasons to be alert."
"So I believe the plan of action which Mrs Langenhagen has included in her report is extraordinarily important."
"Against this background, I would like to mention a letter from the Association of European Airlines."
"This letter, dated 6 March, states amongst other things that 'improvements, if any, could be achieved in a much cheaper way' ."
"I would welcome the Commissioner's comments on whether it is possible to achieve comparable improvements more cheaply than by the route we have to decide on today."
"If that question cannot be answered today, I would be grateful if the Commissioner responsible were able to comment in writing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the GNSS Global Navigation Satellite System is an example of the dual value of technologies for military and civil use."
"Satellite positioning, which arose in a military environment during the Cold War for the surveillance of ballistic missiles, today offers the possibility, in civilian times, of establishing the position of ships, not by means of the stars, lighthouses or radar, but by satellite."
"In fact, the satellite sector is far from being a minor aspect, in terms of value, of the potential services that can be provided on the ground. The satellite signal can be used to help with navigation, assistance, safety, choosing a route by land or sea, and fleet management; even taxis are beginning to use satellite signals on board."
"Today's document is not a strategic document, but it creates a useful premise for a European strategy on satellite navigation which we will be discussing in the near future."
"The document sets out the rules relating to the cooperation agreement between the European Commission, ESA and EUROCONTROL, and so it seems a fairly positive first step to take."
"We are voting on the recognition that the Commission, as a European institution, should provide the political impetus, ESA should play the role of technological architect, and EUROCONTROL should be the first of a number of service providers for those using the air service."
"I think two things still have to be recommended in this organizational architecture, and they are taken up by the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen."
"Firstly, the three-party agreement should remain open to other partners to ensure that satellite positioning services can be extended quickly to all sea and land services. Secondly, a European authority or agency should be set up - you choose the name - to be responsible for certifying the service and approving the equipment."
"With these two comments, which the rapporteur has taken into account, I approve the report and await further debate, which should take place shortly, on the Commission's document on satellite navigation."
"Mr Malerba, I think you are more qualified than most people to speak to us about these issues, from the heights from which you have seen these events."
"Mr President, satellite navigation is a strategic sector which represents, together with the information superhighway, one of the technological battles of the future."
"Europe has a duty, and the potential, to take part in it."
"But Europe must express a political determination to do so, and must make a clear choice of strategy."
"That is the point of Brigitte Langenhagen's report, which proposes an agreement between the European Commission, the European Space Agency and EUROCONTROL for the development of a global navigation satellite system."
"We have a clear choice today between an autonomous, independent European system, at an estimated cost ranging from ECU 400 million to ECU 4 billion, or cooperation based on the existing American GPS and Russian GLONAS systems."
"Why should we entrust our interests to others, in a critical sector, if we have the ability to safeguard them ourselves? Why should we be dependent upon the Americans, yet again, in this technological and scientific area, when we have the means within Europe of ensuring our own independence?"
"There is no doubt that the high cost of a European system means that partnership between public and private industry in Europe will be necessary."
"But if we wish to remain independent, in such an important, essential and potentially profitable sector for Europe, with the prospects it offers, we must not waste any time. We must adopt a real strategic decision quickly, as the rapporteur recommends."
"In this respect, I agree with Commissioner Kinnock, who is afraid that if we do not reach a decision soon, we will remain in the slow lane as far as progress is concerned."
"In other words, we will be excluded from this technological and scientific undertaking."
"That is why we have no time to lose."
"Mr President, the agreement between the European Community, the European Space Agency and EUROCONTROL aims to make a European contribution towards the development of a global navigation satellite system, or GNSS. These parties set certain objectives."
"The first is the introduction of a so-called European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, abbreviated to EGNOS."
"The current GNSS system will be given additional capabilities for geographical positioning with satellites, integrity and wide-area information for its users."
"The second objective is to set up a complete operational version of GNSS-1, and the third is the preparation of a new European navigation satellite system, GNSS-2."
"As far as EGNOS is concerned, the European airlines have announced that they have no need whatsoever for such a product."
"They believe that if improvements are needed, these might be achieved at much less cost."
"I therefore wish to put the following question to the European Commission: which users will benefit from EGNOS, and will these users be prepared to contribute to its operational costs?"
"If there is indeed little interest in EGNOS, would it not be better to concentrate our efforts on developing GNSS-2 further?"
"There appears to be no controversy surrounding the benefits of these new generation navigation satellite systems."
"Lastly, the opinion of the Committee on Budgets merits attention."
"It notes that the financial contribution from the Community has not yet been set, yet large amounts of money have already been spent."
"That is why the Committee on Budgets requested that the Langenhagen report should not be adopted until the financial situation had been thoroughly investigated."
"Nonetheless, the report was discussed and approved in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I would be grateful if the rapporteur could tell us why she dismissed the clearly stated opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, I am a pilot myself and have experienced the change-over."
"The advantages which the satellite navigation systems provide are sensational."
"They represent a significant increase in safety, and the computer capacity and the software which lie behind these systems are also a great advantage for a pilot, because they allow your work in the cockpit to be of a significantly higher quality."
"I am also pleased that the Commission has informed us that the funding will come from existing resources - from budget line B5-700, among other things."
"I believe this decision will have very important implications for competition in Europe, and that competition in this market is urgently needed on a worldwide basis as well."
"We know that economic development in particular is very heavily dependent on three factors, namely education and training, research and infrastructure."
"All three areas are addressed in the best possible way with this system, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Langenhagen on this report."
"Mr Rübig, I see that the House has the good fortune to have at its disposal a lot of experience, which indeed makes its own contribution to the examination of these issues. We note this with great interest."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the Commission's behalf, I gather that Parliament supports this agreement which permits a European contribution to be made towards developing a global navigation satellite system."
"This agreement will be the first formal basis for an agreement to be concluded between the Commission, the European Space Agency and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation, EUROCONTROL, for the joint development of a global infrastructure for satellite navigation."
"A European contribution here is essential for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, global navigation satellite systems will contribute to a viable development of constantly increasing air and sea transport."
"Secondly, such a system will allow major improvements to be made, in terms of safety."
"Finally, the proposal will mean opening up new potential markets for the European industry, which is excluded from these markets at present because of the USA's dominant position."
"Satellite navigation is a promising, dynamic area, but progress in this sector calls for a wide, deep partnership."
"Hopefully, this agreement will create an effective partnership structure designed to make the best use of the resources of each of the parties involved."
"The Commission is preparing another step through the communication which we adopted in January."
"This deals with the general strategy for Europe's contribution to the global navigation system."
"To Mr Stenmarck, I would simply say that I will pass his question on to the Commissioner responsible, and he will then receive either an oral or a written answer. I am not the person to examine the cost aspects on this point."
"The Commission is looking forward to a wide-ranging debate with Parliament on strategy in connection with future discussion of this communication. It is essential that we decide how Europe is to be involved in all this work."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"The global navigation system seeks to organize cooperation between the EU and the European Space Agency and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation."
"It is our determination to ensure that we achieve above all else total safety."
"The existing system permits geographical positioning and navigation control in all modes of transport."
"We are now faced with either developing this new mode of transport control or continuing to stand by all the systems of the past."
"There are no easy solutions to resolve the problem we face, but we must accept the most efficient and secure proposal, to ensure traffic congestion is eased for all."
"Construction of the Chernobyl shelter"
"The next item is the report (A4-0076/98) by Mr Adam, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision (Euratom/EC) concerning a Community Contribution to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund (COM(97)0448 - C4-0499/97-97/0235(CNS))."
"Mr President, the shelter or sarcophagus which was constructed over the No 4 reactor at Chernobyl following the disastrous accident in April 1986 was assembled in a remarkably short period of time."
"It achieved its primary purpose of providing protection for the immediate population and enabled the remaining reactors to continue in operation."
"However, it was recognized that the construction was not adequate in the long term."
"In particular, none of the beams which were put in place to take the roof of the shelter has a reliable support inside the sarcophagus."
"There are problems with radioactive dust in the former reactor hall, and there is an accumulation of radioactive water in the basement rooms of the reactor area."
"Until now there has been no design acceptable to all the parties to stabilize this structure."
"The risk of extremely high radiation doses to workers has been the main problem to be overcome."
"The Memorandum of Understanding, which was signed between the G7 countries, the Commission and the Government of Ukraine in December 1995, provided for the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by the year 2000 and recognized that the structure over reactor No 4 had to be dealt with."
"However, there was no agreed plan, nor an estimate of the cost involved."
"We now have the Shelter Improvement Plan, which has been agreed as a result of detailed technical discussions, and we should note that the TACIS programme has been particularly active in the development of the plan."
"The purpose of the report is to set out the provision of the financial contribution from the European Union, which will not exceed the sum of US$ 100 million, for a total estimated cost of US$ 750 million."
"The Shelter Improvement Plan is unusual in that it arises from a political decision of the G7."
"It will be implemented by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development."
"It is important to note that the final shape will not be known for four or five years, because some aspects of the final design are part of the plan."
"The final shape and nature of the shelter; the question of the removal of the fuel-containing material; how to deal with the dust inside the sarcophagus; and the treatment of the accumulation of water will only emerge during the implementation stages."
"The final shape will also depend on the ability of the G7 countries to raise the estimated funding that is required, and, at the moment, we are only at the halfway stage."
"This report deals with the financial and management issues linked to the construction of the shelter."
"There are associated engineering works, such as plant to handle radioactive material, which are essential before work on the shelter can begin."
"Therefore, it was necessary for Parliament, as part of the budgetary authority, to be satisfied that the associated works are in phase with the shelter project."
"It should be noted, in connection with the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding, that the reform of the electricity market in Ukraine is the most important single issue: whether the electricity is produced from nuclear power stations or thermal power stations."
"Unless the electricity market is operating in a manner which will allow funds to be available to the operators, there cannot be the required level of maintenance and improvement which the situation requires."
"The text of the Memorandum, the framework and all the legal texts relating to this are produced as an annex to my report."
"They are in English only but I hope colleagues will find them a useful reference."
"The plan does not exist in a vacuum: as it has been prepared considerable progress has been made by the Ukrainian Regulatory Authority, under Mr Smyshlyayev, the head of that authority, who will have the responsibility for the safety standards under which the work in the shelter will be carried out."
"The nuclear industry has been reorganized under Mr Nigmatullin, and Energoatom, the company which operates the nuclear sector in Ukraine, in free market conditions, produced 47 % of the electricity last year."
"A high-level working group, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Reform, Mr Tigipko, has been created to draw up a plan for the modernization of the power sector."
"These are not inconsiderable achievements in a country whose economy is still reeling from the collapse of the Soviet Union."
"Paragraph 54 of my report sets out the conditions for Parliament to agree the transfer of funds from the 1998 budget reserve."
"Most of these, and certainly the most important ones, have now been fulfilled."
"Paragraph 55 sets out the information which should be made available to Parliament by the Commission and the EBRD during the implementation of the plan."
"Paragraph 56 lists a number of activities where, in my opinion, the Commission could, and should, give further assistance to the plan."
"I am satisfied that the guidelines in these paragraphs provide a basis for consideration of the budgetary decisions by Parliament in the future years of the project."
"The EBRD have taken positive steps to involve Russian expertise."
"After all, the reactor is of Russian design."
"The Kurchatov Institute, which is known to some of us on the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, will have a role to play."
"This is a very technical and complex report but I wish to conclude with one or two more general political observations, and to point out that the nuclear industry in Ukraine is a relatively young industry, in that many of the reactors have a long-life potential."
"It is absolutely clear that the national policy is to continue to have a nuclear industry, partly to reduce dependence on Russia for gas, oil and coal supplies."
"But we have also got to note that the Russian connection is not something that can be ignored, because through the SYNERGY and TACIS programmes the links between the Union and the Ukraine in terms of oil, gas and electricity are gathering pace and are linked closely with the adjacent countries."
"So, for these reasons, it makes sense that we should encourage nuclear standards which are acceptable throughout Europe as a whole and we should recognize that the Russians are intent on developing their own reactors."
"The recently appointed Minister for Atomic Energy in Russia, Evgeni Adamov, is known to some of us and we know that he places considerable importance on improving the safe operation of nuclear power stations and attaches importance to collaboration between Russian scientists and those in the European Union."
"All these facets of the energy scene in the Ukraine need to be kept in mind."
"While the government is firmly committed to closure of the plant, we should remember that this is not supported by all political forces in Ukraine."
"It is especially true of the people who represent the Chernobyl area where unemployment is already high."
"That is why it is important that in implementing the Plan the EBRD should take every opportunity to ensure that the implementation of the project brings as much work as possible to the local people in Slavutich, the nearby town where most of the workers involved at the plant live."
"It is also important to recognize that there will be no complete closure of the plant until the second reactor at Khmelnitsky and the fourth reactor at Rovno are completed."
"Recently Ukraine has made arrangements for Russian funding to be available and it is imperative that the EBRD makes up its mind as to the G7 contribution to this project."
"To put it bluntly, Ukraine believes that the commitment to complete those two reactors was inherent in the Memorandum of Understanding."
"They see the failure to help with the loan finance for this work by the European Union as a failure to honour that agreement."
"Without that loan finance, K2 and R4 will not be completed to western safety standards, but they will be completed."
"The assembly of donor countries has appointed Dr Hans Blix to be its chairman."
"Dr Blix is the former General-Secretary of the International Atomic Energy Agency and is well respected in that field."
"He has already told me he would be willing to meet the Parliament's committee at a suitable juncture and the EBRD officials responsible for handling the account are also willing to do the same so that we can be kept closely in touch with developments."
"The production of a newsletter by the EBRD which will keep Members informed is a welcome development."
"Parliament has an important role to make sure that this project goes ahead to time and to budget and I have suggested in the report that it might be expedient that two experts might be appointed to help in our assessment of the work."
"That proposal is contained in paragraph 64 and I hope that the Budgets Committee will take this idea up at a later date."
"Throughout all the discussions and meetings related to the preparation of this report, I have stressed that the Memorandum of Understanding should be implemented as quickly as possible."
"There has been no evidence made available to me to suggest that the agreements relating to the Shelter Improvement Plan could be materially changed with advantage at this stage."
"I therefore urge the House to adopt the report in the form in which it was adopted unanimously in the Budgets Committee."
"Mr President, this is not actually my statement. My colleague Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz drafted the opinion of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy but unfortunately she cannot be here today."
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' statement was adopted unanimously by the committee."
"The main thrust of the statement involves not just the financial aspect, but also a whole host of the technical aspects which are so important with regard to this subject."
"The Commission's proposal is of course primarily about funding, in accordance with the donor conference which was held in New York last year."
"It concerns the Shelter Improvement Plan, which aims to build a new concrete shell to seal the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl where the disaster occurred in the spring of 1986."
"That the EU should be included in this project, and help pay for it, is obvious."
"It is also pleasing that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which manages the fund in question, should be supported by the EU."
"However, we still have to decide how much money will be provided from the TACIS funds, as the Commission's proposal merely refers to a maximum of ECU 100 million."
"I hope the Commission can clarify what the amount involved might be."
"Another thing to remember here is that it would be more appropriate and simpler in organizational terms if the Commission could harmonize its internal criteria for awarding the financial resources with the conditions which the EBRD laid down for handling the funding project."
"As far as the reactor itself is concerned, the Commission aims to convert the existing shelter over the destroyed reactor to an environmentally safe system."
"This aim is unrealistic."
"No-one can guarantee complete safety, even if the plan might lead to an improvement in the present disastrous, highly threatening situation at Chernobyl."
"The committee also believes that we must ensure that all the water on the inside of the wrecked reactor is removed as part of the work of building a new shelter, and that steps must be taken to ensure that the new shelter merely seals the wrecked No 4 reactor without affecting the future dismantling work in reactor block 3."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Adam, on his excellent report."
"I would like to point out that he took on a very important responsibility in drafting this report."
"Not least, he went to Chernobyl in person, in order to see for himself both the progress made and the condition of the sarcophagus in situ ."
"That represented a certain personal risk for him, of course."
"We should record that fact here."
"There was excellent cooperation between him as the rapporteur for this report and myself as the rapporteur for the 1998 budget."
"Because once again, a decision has been taken elsewhere about where the European Union should make its financial contribution."
"During the 1998 budget procedure, we were confronted with the fact that the sum of ECU 100 million was to be made available for the safety of the sarcophagus as ""front loading' , in other words immediately."
"In 1997 we held a hearing on this matter in London, together with the Commission and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, where we were informed about the details of the procedure and the project."
"Both from our responsibility for the budget and as representatives of the Group of the European People's Party, we are in favour of the sarcophagus being made safe."
"But we must formulate some conditions, of course."
"We also made resources available as front loading for the reconstruction of the war-damaged former Yugoslavia."
"We know about these problems."
"We discussed them just this week."
"That is why the most important precondition is adherence to the agreement between the Ukraine, the European Union and the USA under the auspices of the G7."
"That means that the agreed obligation to provide financial resources must be simultaneously fulfilled by all the parties, and that, in the case of the ECU 100 million which we now want to make available, we initially assume that this sum will be available for the overall project until 2005."
"Because we know there is a funding shortfall of more than ECU 300 million or US$ 300 million in the case of this overall project."
"We shall undoubtedly be confronted with this shortfall again at some point."
"That is why we have explicitly recorded that the European Union for its part is ready to make ECU 100 million available, as contractually agreed, and to do so in the next two years, 1998 and 1999."
"We have created a special budget line in the budget procedure."
"In so doing, our intention was - as we also informed the Commission - to prevent the Commission from on the one hand redesigning the TACIS programme as basically a nuclear safety programme, and on the other hand reducing the large arrears in the TACIS programme with a cheque for ECU 100 million."
"We want more transparency here."
"At the end of the day, this also offers the opportunity to show the public the value of nuclear safety in Europe, and what we are doing for the sake of achieving it."
"That is why there is a separate budget line."
"Mr Adam has mentioned the fact that it is very, very important for us to receive competent and adequate information about the proper use of the funds in situ ."
"In the knowledge that only coordinated action by everyone in the world will bring genuine progress in improving the nuclear safety of the sarcophagus at Chernobyl, and that the Ukraine itself and those of its people with political responsibility are the key to success in this process, the PPE will vote in favour of this report by Mr Adam, and his amendments."
"The only proposal from the Green Group in the European Parliament which we shall vote for is Amendment No 17, by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the use of nuclear energy and the dangers of a nuclear accident resulting from this use has three dimensions as far as the European Union is concerned."
"The first relates to nuclear plants within the European Union."
"Naturally we speak of these only rarely, and even more rarely do we talk about nuclear waste."
"The second aspect relates to nuclear plants in countries which border on the Member States of the European Union, such as the Koslondooi site. The third concerns those nuclear sites located in distant countries, such as Ukraine, and I refer more specifically to the issue addressed by Mr Adam's excellent report - Chernobyl."
"However, radioactivity knows no borders."
"In the event of a nuclear accident we are all in danger."
"In this sense, therefore, the European Commission and the European Parliament quite rightly decided, together with other donors, to contribute towards the construction of a shelter over the Chernobyl reactor."
"However, in my opinion two problems remain unsolved."
"The first concerns the financial contribution from the other donors who, at least in the past, have not shown the necessary sensitivity and consistency that have been shown by the European Commission."
"In other words, Madam Commissioner, there has been a repetition of what happened in Bosnia, where it appears that the European Commission is the only donor to have so far contributed anything."
"The second problem relates to the proper use of the money that has so far been given to Ukraine because of Chernobyl."
"Total transparency and continuous monitoring are required with regard to the handling of that money."
"Madam Commissioner, there is a suspicion that the assistance provided in the past was not put to correct use by the Government of Ukraine."
"When I put two questions on this matter to the Commission, the reply from Commissioner van den Broek only served to strengthen those suspicions."
"I was far from reassured that the money had been used for the purpose for which it had been given."
"Of course, our ultimate aim must be to close down the Chernobyl reactor, and I would like to remind you all that there was already a shelter, even before 1986 when the accident occurred."
"We are not now going to construct something which did not already exist."
"Nor do I know what political forces in Ukraine Mr Adam was alluding to, which oppose the closing of the reactor."
"What I do know, however, is that whatever these political forces are, they have not contributed a single ecu to the issue of the reactor in their country."
"So we are to remain ignorant of these political forces and, since we are paying - and, I repeat, quite rightly so - our ultimate aim must be to close down the reactor."
"In finishing, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Adam, since it was a technically difficult and politically very sensitive report."
"My political group will support it, together with almost all the amendments."
"Mr President, Mr Adam has produced an excellent report on the EU's involvement in constructing a shelter which will cover, once and for all, the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl."
"I thank him for the report."
"It goes into the matter thoroughly and the result is a clever and justified proposal."
"The report shows just how problematic the issue is."
"Besides the destroyed reactor at Chernobyl there are three other old reactors all in uncertain condition."
"Repairs to them are continually having to be carried out."
"Progress is slow; the work consumes 6 % of Ukraine's gross national income."
"Ukraine cannot meet the cost of achieving even a passable standard of safety, and therefore needs outside help."
"Because Chernobyl presents a risk to the whole of Europe, it is right that the EU should share these costs."
"That is why the report's proposal that the EU should contribute ECU 100 million is justified."
"The overall cost of the operation is going to be pretty enormous."
"For that reason, the report's suggestion that costs should be shared among different agencies is right."
"It is a matter of concern that only half the funding is clearly available. The proposal in the report that the EU should fund the project as it proceeds is thus a safe and reasonable solution."
"In questions of nuclear safety, the best is preferable to the merely OK."
"That is true of the Ukrainian nuclear industry."
"Two new and reasonably up-to-date atomic power stations are nearly ready for use in the Ukraine."
"They are Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4. When they start production the power stations in worst condition could be shut down."
"At the same time, the Ukrainian economy would get into better shape as it could focus on more valuable projects than fixing up old nuclear power stations."
"That is why we should speed up the financing of these projects out of the European Development Fund and get things moving."
"Mr Adam proposes in his report that finance should come partly from the TACIS fund and partly from a specially constructed budget."
"This is an excellent idea."
"It is absolutely right for the report to urge the Commission to examine TACIS funds in this respect."
"On the other hand, it is true that nuclear safety has so far accounted for a full 13 % of TACIS appropriations. This is quite justifiable."
"Possible nuclear accidents could be catastrophic and cause untold destruction."
"TACIS has achieved good results in this area."
"It has supported improved technology and safety."
"Communications have got essentially better, as each power station has someone employed by the EU with direct access to information and expertise in the outside world."
"Communication delays can thus be avoided, and steps can swiftly be taken to put things right in the event of something unexpected happening."
"That is why I should like to express my sincerest thanks to the TACIS body for its good work."
"I support Mr Adam's report."
"Mr President, this matter clearly illustrates the sort of problems any future common foreign and security policy might cause for the smaller nations."
"At the meeting of the G7 countries, the leaders of the largest EU countries drew up a proposal that EU funds could be used to build a shelter over the Chernobyl plant."
"The decision was the right one."
"The problem is that those leaders did not have the authority to take such a decision."
"In the end, the promise lacks a proper legal basis."
"This has led to money for the purpose having to be taken out of the TACIS aid programme, which was not originally meant for the construction of a shelter at Chernobyl."
"The EU's Court of Auditors, according to a special report, says we cannot be certain that TACIS funding to develop the Ukrainian nuclear industry has always had the desired result."
"There has been negligent monitoring of the spending."
"That is why the demands of Mr Adam and the Committee on Budgets are justified."
"A watchful eye has to be kept on spending."
"Because the unofficial G7 resolution is not legally binding we must ensure that other parties honour their promises too."
"We still lack half the money we need."
"If the G7 and the EU stop paying out, where is the other half supposed to come from?"
"The demand that the EU share be a mere ECU 100 million sounds unrealistic, but we have to stick to it."
"From the Ukrainian point of view, they need energy there just like everyone else."
"That is why the realization of the agreement made in December 1995 to close Chernobyl requires other decisions to be taken on energy production."
"Consequently, we have to take a stance with regard to seeing through the construction of the reactors Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4."
"If Chernobyl closes down these new plants will go into production, or else the Ukraine will have to be given a massive amount of energy aid."
"I personally oppose the building of new atomic power plants."
"If, however, we insist that Ukraine shuts down the Chernobyl plant and concentrates on the construction of the two new reactors, the demand seems unreasonable if we do not provide economic aid, which we nevertheless find distasteful."
"As Mr Adam says, Ukraine in any case sees the agreement and the new power stations as being part and parcel of the same thing."
"If new reactors are going to be built anyway, the question is how they can be made safe."
"That means new funding problems, which will have to be solved by the bank."
"If the Chernobyl plant is to be shut down and we give aid accordingly, we are reluctantly moving in the direction of support for nuclear power in Ukraine."
"Mr President, Mr Adam has really put a great deal of work into this report, as is apparent from the explanatory notes."
"However, the Green Group in the European Parliament has formulated a number of amendments, through Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, to make a good report even better."
"The Commission's aim is to convert the existing shelter over the wrecked reactor at Chernobyl to an environmentally safe system."
"As I said before, this aim is totally unrealistic."
"The plans drawn up by the international group of experts may undoubtedly lead to improvements in the current disastrous and highly threatening situation at Chernobyl, but no-one can guarantee complete safety."
"There is no way of establishing an environmentally safe system, as there is radiation involved."
"To achieve this would require a total cleanup, both of the damaged reactor and its very high radiation levels, and of the environment itself."
"This project, which we are forced to employ to improve the safety of the destroyed reactor, is desirable but would be incredibly expensive."
"In order to achieve a truly environmentally safe system we would also need a complete, safe, final disposal method for all radioactively contaminated sections of the wrecked reactor, as well as the shelter."
"This would also involve totally dismantling the other three reactors at Chernobyl, and safe final disposal of everything in the Chernobyl area which has been exposed to radiation as a result of the accident and the operation of the nuclear plant."
"Until now, however, the technology required for this has not been available, either for dismantling the wrecked reactor or for the safe final disposal of the radioactive material."
"The radioactivity is still there."
"I remember when Chernobyl was destroyed in the spring of 1986, and the Swedish Government's nuclear inspectorate said no radiation problems would remain after six months."
"Nothing could have been further from the truth."
"A few weeks ago, a report appeared which showed that radiation levels have in fact increased in some areas of Sweden."
"The problem is enormous and cannot just be swept away somehow."
"When it comes to the funding conditions and handling the financial resources, the EU authorities have once again shown themselves to be masters of bureaucracy and unnecessary expense."
"Quite why a separate item has to be set up for informing the public is also unclear."
"But the exception to precise control of how the funds are used should be that funds are handled in as unbureaucratic a manner as possible, so that large parts of the funds do not get swallowed up in administration but instead go to where they are intended."
"A rapid improvement of the unacceptable security risks at Chernobyl must be the absolute top priority, and the bureaucratic expenses required to achieve this aim must be kept to the absolute minimum."
"The Commission points out that the Community's contribution to the funds for sealing the reactor will ensure that the shelter plan, under the agreement between the G7 nations and the Ukraine on shutting Chernobyl down, will be carried out by the year 2000."
"Apart from the safety of the wrecked reactor being improved immediately, it is essential that the entire nuclear power plant at Chernobyl is shut down."
"The EU's contribution to the funding of a new sarcophagus should also be independent of the building of the two Ukrainian power stations which are under construction."
"We should make it quite clear to the Ukraine that they must expect significant reductions in the contribution unless the promise to close Chernobyl is kept."
"So, even before it is finally closed, we should insist on seeing evidence that the technical and organizational measures required for a shutdown have been taken."
"Nuclear power is not safe, either within the EU Member States or outside, such as at Chernobyl."
"Nuclear power does not belong to the future."
"We need new technology. We must not be negative about the technological developments we can all benefit from, which the EU has so finely stated in the new Treaty of Amsterdam, on the aims of an ecologically viable society."
"Nuclear power is not one of them!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that the technical quality of Mr Adam's report is very high, and I shall vote in favour of the provisions proposed in it."
"I can see that we really have no choice, and with regard to Chernobyl, we are obliged, for essential safety reasons, to provide European Union aid, more or less as a priority."
"However, it is permissible to question the economic and political rationality of the situation forced upon us, and to look at what alternatives we have."
"Certainly, the Government of Ukraine claims that in order to close down Chernobyl, it is necessary to build new power stations as soon as possible."
"We are in a situation where the Ukraine Government could request a quite considerable amount of economic and financial aid."
"It is a pity that the possibility of considering a non-nuclear solution has never really been envisaged at any time."
"However, such a solution exists."
"It is much less expensive and more rational in all respects. But it is dependent on increased cooperation between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, as it is mainly the Russian Federation which could, in the short term, supply the gas and oil which Ukraine needs to operate the thermal power plants it could use to replace Chernobyl."
"It is a pity the European Union, which usually promotes cooperation between the various European countries, does not do so between the Ukraine and Russia, although continuing to respect Ukrainian sovereignty."
"Furthermore, I note that at a diplomatic level some world powers are playing a questionable role by exacerbating the dissension between Ukraine and Russia."
"I do not think this is in anyone's interests, either geostrategically or economically. This irrational policy should be abandoned in order to promote cooperation between Ukraine and Russia, which would help to solve their energy problem, among other things."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Adam for this exceptional report."
"In 1986 we saw the beginning of a terrible tragedy with the explosion of reactor 4."
"The people working on the site and living in the surrounding areas have paid a very heavy price for faulty design, very poor maintenance and a very risky working environment."
"They are still paying that price today."
"Many have lost their children, their health, their homes and livelihoods."
"This experience has shown that the environmental damage from such a disaster knows no boundaries and respects no frontiers."
"Therefore Chernobyl's problems are our problems, too."
"I wish to support the report by Mr Adam on the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and I agree with him that the Memorandum of Understanding between the G7, the Commission and the Ukraine Government should be implemented as quickly as possible."
"The principal purpose of the Shelter Improvement Plan must be to close and decommission the plant completely, as quickly as possible."
"Unfortunately it is clear that nuclear energy will continue to be Ukraine's electricity plan for the future, so high engineering and security standards must be paramount in all other nuclear sites if a repetition of the 1986 disaster is to be avoided."
"Unfortunately, even if all these extensive repairs and the construction of an effective and secure shelter for reactor 4 can be completed quickly, there will be no guarantees and, in my view, no question but the whole project will still be environmentally unsafe because the technology to render the dismantled reactor safe, on the one hand, and to eliminate the radioactive waste, on the other, does not yet exist."
"We need continuous research into safer plant design and a fuller answer to these very difficult problems."
"Otherwise mankind will continue to live with an unacceptable risk."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe we have an exceptionally good report before us from Mr Adam, who shows that politicians will have to keep their finger on the pulse, and will manage to do so through this procedure."
"Mr Adam touches on a number of very sore spots."
"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development may not have enough experience, for instance."
"It remains unclear how the project will be monitored."
"It states correctly that a lot of money is going to Western companies."
"Extremely complex interests are at stake, and for that reason it is crucial that we keep our finger on the pulse. The procedure, as selected by the Committee on Budgets, is a very astute move."
"Nonetheless I continue to have concerns, about liability, for instance."
"Is Amendment No 3 enough of a guarantee that the Community assumes no liability?"
"Nuclear power is difficult to insure, so I assume that if things get out of hand again, it will not be insured, and Western countries will be liable once again since such enormous interests are at stake."
"That is why safety controls and monitoring are so absolutely vital."
"Mr President, I would like to devote my remaining time to the political subject of Ukraine's independence."
"I have been to that country, and it says on the one hand that it does not wish to be independent from Russia."
"That is a reasonable argument."
"But on the other hand, I believe Ukraine is not addressing certain issues sufficiently - energy conservation, for instance."
"Huge amounts of energy could be saved in that country."
"No other country in the world could achieve so much with a method such as the total energy principle."
"During all these negotiations, we did not quite manage to achieve this."
"It is therefore my view that the European Union in particular should argue for a new energy policy for the Ukraine."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Adam for his excellent report."
"The threat of a nuclear accident is a good example of a danger that lurks outside the borders of the EU but nevertheless threatens EU Member States, which would remain defenceless against it."
"I think the European Parliament must make sure the agreement is put into practice as quickly as possible."
"It will also diminish the chances of our nations being contaminated by radiation due to a nuclear disaster."
"The closing down of the plant at Chernobyl is part of the renewal process for the whole of Ukraine's energy sector."
"As the powers that be in Ukraine are obviously not unanimous in their desire to shut down Chernobyl, we should agree with the rapporteur's view on the Commission's responsibility."
"The Commission should make sure that, in return for the EU's money, they get proof on a regular basis from the Ukraine Government that the Chernobyl plant is being shut down in accordance with the agreed timetable."
"I also agree with Mr Adam that the Commission should provide resources only after the other parties to the agreement have used up their share."
"It is reasonable for the European Union's share of the finance to cover the period when the design for the reactor's shelter is being put into practice."
"In this way we will be better able to ensure that EU funds are not continually milked for this important project, but that it is carried out within the confines of the funding agreement."
"Mr Seppänen's remarks on what money has been spent and whether there will be enough for the future are futile."
"The funding situation will most certainly be due for review after 2005, and I think we must share in the responsibility considering the safety risk involved for our countries."
"The report is excellent, and I support it."
"Mr President, there are undoubtedly a lot of people who, like me, remember 26 April 1986."
"I myself was out on an island in the Swedish archipelago, at Sandhamn."
"We heard on the radio that radioactivity had leaked from a Swedish nuclear power station close by in Forsmark."
"I remember it well."
"It was three days before the report was changed, and it turned out to be a Russian reactor thousands of kilometres from the island in the archipelago where I and my friends were staying."
"Those of us in central and northern Sweden were hit particularly badly: mushrooms, wildlife, berries and animals were contaminated with radiation."
"This made many people who depended on natural products in the affected areas realize that nuclear power is an unsafe and highly dangerous source of energy."
"Sweden has decided to stop using nuclear power."
"The decision was actually taken before 1986."
"Every effort has to be made to ensure that the proposals in this report are implemented."
"The shelter, funding, information, training, environmental safety, and so on are all essential."
"Of course, we have to provide resources along with Ukraine and the G7 group of countries."
"Advice, expertise and money must go to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development."
"It is particularly important that openness, information and close contact with employees and the general public are a constant feature of this work, and that no money is used for operating and extending new nuclear power stations."
"Environmental safety, control and monitoring must have top priority for as long as the project lasts, between 1998 and 2005."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner how the Commission proposes handling this excellent report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Adam on a well produced report."
"It supports the Commission's proposals on Community support for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the fund for improving the shelter over the Chernobyl reactor."
"In setting up this fund, international society has taken up its responsibility to help Ukraine put the 1986 Chernobyl disaster behind it and make that nuclear plant environmentally safe."
"Through the Commission's TACIS programme, the European Union has put itself at the forefront of these efforts."
"The TACIS programme will be subject to constant follow-up and reporting back."
"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has also played an important role by taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the project on the donors' behalf, and it has managed to get the project under way quickly."
"It is my hope that, after the Parliamentary elections in the summer, Ukraine will see the European Union's contribution as a sign of our friendly relations and solidarity."
"The Commission can accept most of the amendments, but one important question remains - namely, when the EU will pay its contribution to the Chernobyl fund."
"The Commission is proposing here that the EU's contribution will be paid in the initial years of the project."
"This is mainly because most of the project's costs will arise at the start."
"The Chernobyl fund operation has got off to a rapid start, which also shows that the project itself will be implemented quickly."
"A number of tender procedures for the so-called ""early biddable projects' and project management have already been announced, and so the contract will be signed in the near future."
"What is even more important is that the Ukraine authorities are planning finally to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power station in the year 2000."
"One express political requirement is that considerable progress be made before then."
"Parliament's report proposes that payments should be extended to cover the period 1998-2005."
"According to Parliament, this is because the Community will be paying its contribution at an early stage, and then the other contributors will go back on their promises."
"I believe I can set Parliament's mind at rest on this point."
"Of the US$ 400 million promised to the Chernobyl fund, US$ 178 million of fixed commitments have already been made for 1997-1998."
"After the European Union, the next largest donor is the United States: their fixed commitments for the period 1997-1998 amount to US$ 54 million."
"The cash already in the fund's account amounts to nearly ECU 50 million: this does not include the contribution from the European Union."
"In view of this, the Commission is certain that it is both necessary and appropriate that the EU's contribution should be paid at an early stage."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"I would like to delete the word ""primarily' from the first sentence, so that the text instead reads: ' With the aid of Community funds, the following technical aims will also be achieved as a new shelter is constructed' ."
"This means deleting the word ""primarily' , which I think Mr Adam can accept."
"Ladies and gentlemen, are there any objections to this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, I would be quite happy to accept the amendment with the deletion of that word."
"The important point is that we are approving the plan as a whole and we cannot therefore select particular parts of it as being priorities."
"If the word 'primarily' as it appears in English is taken out that would be very appropriate."
"I would then support it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard the rapporteur's opinion."
"Since there are no objections to the introduction of this oral amendment, I shall put it to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"As Austrian members of the Group of the European People's Party, we set great store, in connection with the Shelter Improvement Plan and the agreement between the G7 countries and the Ukraine, on the closure of Chernobyl by the year 2000. Therefore we have chosen to approach the voting in a way which accords with our consistent anti-nuclear policy within the European Parliament."
"On the basis of the community assets, we resolutely defend all measures to guarantee greater safety in the nuclear sector."
"In this process, however, any link between the closure of old and highly dangerous nuclear reactors and the possible completion of new atomic energy plants must be resolutely rejected."
"In line with these views, we also recognize the need for the European Parliament to proceed coherently in the implementation of the agreement and the solution of the Chernobyl problem, but without thereby supporting the completion of other nuclear construction projects, especially in this region."
"EC - USA competition laws Agreement"
"The next item is the report (A4-0104/98) by Mr Malerba, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision concerning the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Communities and the Government of the United States of America regarding the application of positive comity principles in the enforcement of their competition laws (COM(97)0233 - C4-0559/97-97/0178(CNS))."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the global economy society we live in, there is an ever increasing number of multinational companies and mergers."
"Dominant positions and restrictive market practices are also more frequent and have transnational effects."
"The authorities which protect competition have several instruments at their disposal to combat restrictive international practices, the authority par excellence being the World Trade Organization. However, one of the most widely adopted methods is that of the extraterritorial application of national competition law."
"This means that penalties are also applied when behaviour within the territory of a third country has negative effects on their markets."
"In 1991, the European Commission and the US Government concluded a bilateral Agreement on the application of competition rules between the two parties."
"That Agreement was approved by this Parliament and I reported on it a couple of years ago."
"Section 5 of the 1991 Agreement introduced the concept of comitas gentium - positive comity - for the first time in relations between the EU and the USA."
"This is a rather special concept which should possibly be explained."
"When a party is the victim of anticompetitive behaviour within the territory of a second party, the first party can ask the second to take measures applying the second party's anticompetition laws."
"The Agreement on which the House is now being called upon to vote represents further progress in relation to the 1991 Agreement. Not only does it provide directives on how to deal with requests for positive comity, but it also implies that when a party considers itself the victim of anticompetitive practice in the other party's territory, the first party should generally suspend the measures laid down by its regulations, in other words stop implementing extraterritorial measures."
"The central point, therefore, is the extraterritorial application of competition rules."
"From time to time, the USA and the EU try to apply their rules of competition to behaviour in other countries as well; in particular, the USA claim competence to apply their competition rules even when they are prejudicial to their exports, and not only when they are prejudicial to the consumer."
"This Agreement therefore seeks to replace international cooperation in the methods of extraterritorial application of the rules of competition to regulate anticompetitive practice."
"So the Agreement, even if it is only bilateral, seems to be going in the right direction and I recommend its approval."
"A word of caution and concern has been expressed, however, by the economic circles of the EU on the provisions for confidentiality of information exchanged between the competition authorities."
"That is particularly the case because there is more information available at the European Commission than at the American competition authorities."
"At this point, I recommend that the Commission take this concern into account when drawing up a second-generation agreement, that is in the process of being prepared, as well as the possibility of agreeing to the exchange of confidential information even without the parties' consent."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that issues relating to the new EU-USA relations have been debated in Parliament. On each occasion, serious reservations have been expressed on all sides of the House, since there is still a general climate of mistrust on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Nonetheless, the laborious efforts of the Vice-President of the Commission, Sir Leon Brittan, to push forward the plan for a new Euro-Atlantic market cannot be overestimated, in spite of the difficulties it faces on both technical and above all political issues, as was discovered last Monday at the General Affairs Council."
"However, they put terms and conditions on the promotion of a common Euro-Atlantic market, such as the safeguarding of WTO regulations, and the solution of problems arising from the implementation of the infamous extraterritorial Helms-Burton and D'Amato-Kennedy acts. Naturally, there is also the condition that sectors of the agricultural economy and of audio-visual communication will remain outside the plan."
"As regards cooperation in the implementation of competition laws, which is dealt with in Mr Malerba's report, the proposal of the Council and the Commission is of course constructive, and no-one can have any objections to a framework of regulatory provisions."
"Nevertheless, the Agreement has serious weaknesses to the extent that its implementation is neither obligatory nor does it have a strong legal basis. Rather, it is a political undertaking to cooperate, which in particular excludes company mergers."
"So it is natural that reservations and concerns should be expressed by European businesses, especially concerning confidential provisions and the exchange of financial information."
"European businesses are worried about a possible undermining of legitimate interests if the United States gains free access to all secret information. It is only natural for there to be fear and mistrust, since our partner on the other side of the Atlantic is burdened by a host of international violations, which show that it is no respecter of laws and international agreements."
"At the same time, the United States' insistence on maintaining extraterrestrial laws, despite the recent relaxing of measures against Cuba, is typical behaviour. It is a fact that the United States demands respect from others for the laws of competition and the free market, whilst reserving for itself the right to violate them."
"There is also another serious issue. While we have decided that, in each agreement concluded between the European Union and third countries, there will be clauses to ensure respect of human rights in accordance with European humanitarian values, I have the feeling that this is systematically passed over when it comes to our powerful partner on the other side of the Atlantic."
"I am referring in particular to the issue of the death penalty, which is retained by many states."
"Every now and again public opinion is shocked by an execution, and I am also personally shocked by the public executions in the United Arab Emirates and in the United States."
"As a result, child deaths have risen to 12 million a year. In other words, whereas the European Union currently gives 0.4 % of its GDP as developmental aid, the USA gives only 0.1 %, even less than Japan at 0.28 %."
"It is also a well-known fact that it is a very bad payer with respect to the United Nations Organization."
"These issues do not prevent the creation of a common conception and a common agenda on issues of democracy, international cooperation and a just and viable world order such as we envisage in the European Parliament and the European Union."
"Therefore, in spite of all this, we will vote for the Agreement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to offer sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"The Agreement presented here constitutes a renewed attempt by the two largest markets in the world - the two most important trade partners - to reach an accord where previously there have always been recurrent difficulties."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I should like to say that we approve of this Agreement."
"Admittedly, highhanded US behaviour ensures time and again that US legal regulations are applied in a way which is dubious under international law;"
"Helms-Burton and D'Amato are just two examples of this."
"In international competition law as well, people in Texas or elsewhere believe they can apply their own rules and do not have to take account of international law."
"But none of that should prevent us from attempting, step by step, to persuade the people of the USA as a whole to enter into agreements which they can then comply with too."
"Incidentally, I do not fully understand what the death penalty or insufficient development aid has to do with it."
"If you look at the European budget lines in national Parliaments, you will see that development aid is being reduced bit by bit even where Socialists are in charge."
"The pot should not call the kettle black."
"High-handed US behaviour is one thing we must recognize."
"However, we must also recognize that we and the Americans have jointly achieved a great deal in many areas."
"If the USA and Europe had not stuck together, there would never have been any expansion of GATT-WTO."
"We need to recognize the positive side as well from time to time, not always take a sledge-hammer to the Americans."
"So our idea of competition law must gain international acceptance."
"If the Americans and Europeans reach an accord, we shall have made a significant step forward."
"That is why extension by means of a clear framework agreement is necessary, and that is being attempted here."
"The Agreement itself is no more than a statement of political commitment."
"As a consequence, however, the agreed trade rules will in any case lead to efforts being made to arrive at a rational outcome in cases of dispute, and this should be warmly welcomed."
"That is why there is no need for a special, outstanding effort to give approval to this Agreement here."
"With the Agreement, I am glad to say we are advancing into an area which is of decisive importance for the maintenance of a free world economy at a time of increasing globalization."
"International cooperation in the area of competition will be one of the main tasks of foreign trade and investment at the start of the 21st century."
"Globalization, as we all know, leads to world-wide competition."
"Europe is part of this world-wide competition."
"After the introduction of the euro, we shall play an even more significant role in international competition."
"Our efforts to reach an accord must be all the greater."
"The conclusion of the present Agreement is a step - albeit a small one - on the way to the comprehensive liberalization of all areas of transatlantic trade."
"From my remarks you will see why the Group of the European People's Party gives its support, and I would ask Parliament to give its approval to this Agreement in its totality."
"Mr President, competition and freedom of competition are often said to be non-political matters that global capitalism needs to survive."
"The USA tries to impose its own laws on other countries."
"An instance of this is provided by the Helms-Burton and D'Amato-Kennedy acts, by means of which the USA has enacted political laws."
"They are at odds with freedom of competition."
"So markets and competition are not at all non-political matters and do not represent complete freedom of competition."
"We politicians in Europe must make political decisions and laws: that is our job."
"Consumer freedom means not having to buy US hormone-treated meat or genetically manipulated soya."
"There is a clear conflict of interests between freedom of competition among US producers and the health of consumers in Europe."
"US companies and multinationals want freedom of competition based only on making a profit, with little in the way of social and ecological responsibility."
"Competition can harm or kill, so politicians must take responsibility generally and protect people and the environment."
"In this whole area, I would like to say that non-political competition does not exist."
"The rules can be clarified in the form of the Agreement now being prepared, and it would be wise to approve it."
"However, we are already taking the next step: namely, the MAI Treaty."
"Politicians are gradually submitting to market dictatorship, which is what constitutes complete freedom of competition."
"Thank you very much, Mr Seppänen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, so as not to distract attention from the important things being said here this Friday morning, the Presidency would ask the Members of the House to please switch off their telephones during the debate."
"This is not obligatory, but it is distracting and it would be better if we could manage without them."
"Mr President, Mr Malerba's report recommends the revision of an Agreement negotiated by the Commission in a particularly sensitive sector of our relations with the United States: the extraterritorial consequences of different competition laws."
"But the Agreement does not solve the fundamental problem of the extraterritorial nature of recent US federal and local legislative provisions."
"The main question today is therefore whether the Commission is going to retract the suspension of the WTO panel relating to the Helms-Burton law, which it requested nearly a year ago, in the unfounded expectation of an amendment of Title 4 by Congress."
"The suspension therefore has no purpose today, and if it is not withdrawn before the mid-April deadline the whole procedure carried out by the Commission will be a failure, to the detriment of European interests."
"Violations of international law should not, in any case, be negotiable, as the chairman of our Committee on External Economic Relations, Mrs Castellina, has just pointed out."
"The Commission's attitude is so laxist that you have to wonder how it would handle the negotiations to create a transatlantic free trade area."
"The process would not be unbiased anyway, because a large number of areas referred to in the project fall within EU competence on this side of the Atlantic, whereas in the United States, they are the responsibility of the federal states."
"And how can we expect Washington to relax trade barriers when the legislative and supervisory bodies are independent from the political authority?"
"The United States has always, by various means, tried to obtain a sort of right to take part in the internal operation of the European Union."
"If they support Sir Leon Brittan's personal initiative today, it is because they see an opportunity to enter the European decision-making process, in the era of the euro and enlargement."
"It is not a question of blaming the Americans for defending their own interests carefully and intelligently."
"No, what is surprising is the little resistance to their efforts offered by a divided Commission - which makes you question the principle of collective responsibility - and a timorous Council, which is allowing itself to be led by Sir Leon's personal project."
"Mr President, does that sort of European Union really defend the interests of the European people?"
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the Malerba report is a good one, and well written."
"Nevertheless, I must express some reservations about its whole orientation and also about some speakers' contributions to this discussion."
"I very much value what Sir Leon Brittain has done, because I know he has endeavoured somehow or other to achieve a situation in which we can create a reasonably tolerable community with the USA in this particular area."
"It is therefore a very valuable attempt."
"Nonetheless I have to say that there are many signs that this attempt cannot be very successful, for a simple reason: the Americans are certainly our friends."
"We owe them a great deal of gratitude."
"But on the other hand, it cannot continue to be the case forever that one power asserts itself in the economic area, imagining itself to be outside international practices and laws, and intervening where it has no business to do so."
"I would particularly like to refer to what is implemented time and again by means of extraterritorial legislation."
"The way in which US industrial interests repeatedly manage to find loopholes - the very thing with which the Japanese are reproached - verges on the brilliant. They do this so that in practice they do not have to keep to what they have committed themselves to in writing."
"This situation arises particularly in the matter of international legislation."
"I would like for example to mention here a fact which undoubtedly affects our trade: I refer to the new US measures under which sporting events that take place in Europe can no longer be shown on television because they display advertising for drinks such as wine and other alcoholic beverages."
"That has a very great effect on our interests."
"That eliminates us from competition in advance."
"I believe we should be clear about one thing here - and I would like to endorse Mr Souchet's remarks, although I do not share his views on all matters. Unfortunately the Americans have a strong Government that knows what it wants and has laid down a political line, and we still do not have a real decisionmaking body to guide foreign policy for us."
"If we did, we would be much better off!"
"Mr President, many companies today are in business all over the world."
"Many of them also form strategic alliances to strengthen their position in foreign markets via an international partner."
"However, the economic effects of mergers, anticompetitive behaviour and the abuse of dominant positions often affect countries other than those where the companies concerned are based."
"One way for the monopolies and mergers authorities to deal with anticompetitive behaviour at an international level is to apply extraterritorial jurisdiction."
"This means that a country which is adversely affected by anticompetitive behaviour in another country can try to apply its own competition rules to deal with the problem."
"There are many legal systems which allow this, including that of the European Community."
"The USA makes considerable use of extraterritorial jurisdiction, which, as we know, has generated political tensions between the EU and the United States."
"Using extraterritorial jurisdiction also creates many problems in practice."
"There is no way of exercising jurisdiction over people outside their own country, and it is also difficult to get evidence from abroad."
"In 1991, the EC and the USA signed an Agreement on applying their competition laws."
"Instead, the principle of positive comity was introduced, in other words active civility."
"Using this principle means that one country can combat anticompetitive behaviour in another country without having to resort to extraterritorial jurisdiction."
"Instead, as we know, the country which is being adversely affected can request the country in which the anticompetitive behaviour is taking place to take action."
"Although this principle was introduced in the 1991 Agreement, the USA continues to use extraterritorial jurisdiction to a considerable extent."
"Enhancing cooperation calls for better and more effective application of the principle of positive comity."
"The Commission started negotiations with the United States in 1996."
"The new Agreement mainly contains guidelines for dealing with applications to use the principle of positive comity."
"It also lays down certain terms on which the parties will defer or break off their own investigations and action."
"The country where the behaviour is occurring can be requested to take action instead."
"The Agreement does not cover mergers and concentration."
"Neither US nor EU legislation allows for such procedures to be deferred or broken off."
"Confidential information furnished to the Commission is heavily protected in Community law."
"I can therefore calm Parliament's fears on this point: the Commission can only lift the confidentiality requirement if it first obtains the consent of the company in question."
"The monopolies and mergers authorities must work together to ensure that anticompetitive behaviour amongst companies in the world market can be regulated properly and effectively."
"The Agreement constitutes a commitment by both the USA and the EU to work together instead of using their own anti-trust legislation in the other's territory."
"In this way, the Agreement represents a significant development in relations between the EU and the USA."
"Mr Malerba also notes this in his well-considered report."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr Rübig has asked for the floor pursuant to Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, pursuant to Rule 19 of our Rules of Procedure, I would like to inform you that the deadline for signing the written declaration 'Sign Against Crime' expires today."
"So far 154 Members have signed this written declaration in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, and I would like to offer them my sincere thanks."
"In this respect, I would also like to thank you most sincerely, Mr President, for your readiness to give active support to our concern."
"Brussels must become the safest capital in Europe."
"As you have rightly commented, we particularly need police reinforcements in the Europe quarter, a police station of our own, and an international, multi-lingual emergency number as a contact point in case of criminal incidents."
"According to Rule 19 paragraph 4 of the Rules of Procedure, you represent Parliament in external matters as well."
"I would therefore request your continued commitment to representing our concern."
"I hope you will soon be able to report something positive to the House."
"Thank you very much, Mr Rübig."
"Mr Manisco has asked for the floor."
"Mr President, I simply wish to say that I voted against the Malerba report."
"You only mentioned two abstentions."
"Thank you very much, Mr Manisco."
"I am sorry; I did not look towards the left and in my case, ladies and gentlemen, that is even more difficult to understand."
"So I apologize both to you personally and to the area where you are sitting."
"I looked towards the right, towards the centre and towards the left, but not towards the extreme left."
"I am sorry Mr Manisco, and I note that you have voted against."
"Mr Schulz wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, I have one comment to make in relation to Mr Rübig's remarks, if you would allow me."
"Mr Schulz, that is not a point of order."
"In any case, this could open a debate."
"I would ask you not to open a debate, but that we merely note Mr Rübig's opinions, which were made pursuant to Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure, and record them in the Minutes, as is fitting."
"But if you insist, Friday mornings are very special mornings so I will give you the floor for one minute."
"Mr President, I knew you were an understanding man."
"I am sure you will also find a Rule which makes it possible for me to speak for a minute and a half."
"As someone who deals with cooperation between the police and justice systems in the European Union, I support the concern of my colleague Mr Rübig in principle."
"Please do not clap too soon."
"Mr President, please subtract the applause and the heckling from my speaking time."
"I support it in principle, Mr Rübig, because you are defending the safety of our colleagues in this Parliament."
"I merely want you to bear in mind something I consider to be very important in negotiations with the Belgian authorities."
"Apart from anything else, we play a role in the lack of safety in the Leopold quarter."
"In the eyes of a great many people, including criminals of course, we are people worth attacking. This leads to the situation - you were right to use your hammer in support, Mr President - whereby the people who live in the Leopold quarter on a day-to-day basis are of course victims of crime as well - in other words the Belgians, who suffer at our hands in any case because prices have been driven up because of the European Parliament, as far as rents and land prices are concerned."
"So in future please let us not just mention ourselves, but also the people who live there."
"The police station which is to be established there is to serve Belgian citizens as well."
"I consider it right and proper, Mr Rübig, that we should mention all the affected parties."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you not to open a debate."
"Two opinions have been given."
"I believe we should now get ready to end this part-session calmly instead."
"Parliament has come to the end of the agenda."
"The Minutes of this sitting will be presented for Parliament's approval at the beginning of the next part-session."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me once again the satisfaction I have every Friday of thanking all Parliament's services for their cooperation, especially with the prospect of a few days' rest: rest for our throats, rest for our muscles, but especially rest from the tension arising from the responsibility of our daily work in this important institution."
"At the beginning of this morning's sitting, Mr Hallam gave me another reason to reflect on the value of the work carried out here by Members on Friday mornings."
"On Friday mornings there are no television cameras."
"It is an irregularity that I am going to look into and will try to sort out but, in any case, it is also very commendable that you, ladies and gentlemen, are here without the possible gratification of your images and work being transmitted on television."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I declare that you are the distinguished members of the Friday club."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.35 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 3 April 1998."
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of our colleague Spalato Belleré on 21 April."
"Mr Belleré was a medical doctor and a colonel in the reserves."
"He was elected to the European Parliament in June 1994 and was an active member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the interparliamentary delegation for relations with Kazakhstan."
"Furthermore, as you all know, on 23 April the former President of the Republic of Greece, Constantino Karamanlis, passed away in Athens."
"As a statesman, he was responsible for the restoration of democracy in his country and its entry into the European Union, and he deserves recognition from all Europeans."
"I would ask you all to observe a minute's silence with me."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of 3 April have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, next Saturday, 2 May, in Brussels, we are going to make an historic decision with regard to a number of aspects concerning the introduction of the single currency."
"Whatever my personal opinion regarding the euro, or that of my group, we would like to remind you formally that the Edinburgh agreements confirmed Parliament's seat as Strasbourg and it is thus there that we should be meeting on Saturday."
"As a Member of this House and a native of Alsace, I protest against the choice of Brussels for this extraordinary sitting."
"Yet again, the House is ignoring the treaties and shunning Strasbourg."
"(Applause from various quarters)"
"Mr President, as a European, I would like to say that I am perfectly happy about meeting here in Brussels on Saturday."
"Mr President, I would urge you to press for the release of Vincent Cochetel on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Mr Cochetel works for the High Commission for Refugees."
"Three months ago today he was kidnapped in Russia."
"During the night of 29 January he was taken away by armed men and he has not been seen since."
"Mr Cochetel is 37 years old and has two children."
"He leads the delegation of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Vladikafkas, which is looking after 100 000 refugees and exiles from the Caucasus region."
"I would ask you to intervene and urge you to do everything in your power both here and in the Russian Federation to ensure the release of Vincent Cochetel."
"Mr President, less than three weeks ago an important peace agreement was reached in Northern Ireland, which we should all be very happy about. We should congratulate ourselves and, especially, the people of Northern Ireland as well as all the political actors who have had the courage to reach this agreement, including the former British Government under Mr Major, the current one under Mr Blair, and the Governments of the Republic of Ireland."
"From the Basque Country, a significant majority of the population has watched this agreement with political interest, in the hope that dialogue may soon bring about an end to the sad and violent conflict we are experiencing."
"We hope ETA may have the same courage as the IRA, to renounce arms and use political negotiation to try to reach agreement through their representatives. We also hope the Spanish Government will have the same political courage the British Governments have shown, so as to embark on a process of this type."
"I hope this House will soon be able to celebrate a peace agreement for the Basque people, and I hope the European institutions will offer sincere support in this matter."
"Thank you very much, Mr Imaz San Miguel."
"Welcome"
"It is my pleasure today to welcome a delegation from the Australian Parliament, made up of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, led by Mrs West, the Vice-President of the Senate."
"Our Australian colleagues are in Brussels to take part in the twenty-third interparliamentary meeting between the Australian Parliament and our institution, co-chaired by Mr Nicholson."
"Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen of the Australian delegation, on behalf of the Members of our institution, I welcome you to the European Parliament."
"Northern Ireland"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the recent peace agreement in Northern Ireland."
"It is a great honour to welcome to the European Parliament today Dr Marjory Mowlam, the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr David Andrews, the Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, and Mr Santer, the President of the European Commission."
"It gives us all great pleasure to welcome them here today."
"During my talks in London, Belfast and Dublin, I was able to understand and observe the enormous determination with which both governments committed themselves to the peace and reconciliation process."
"Today we have the opportunity to show our unfailing solidarity with them and with the people of Northern Ireland."
"Like you all, I cherish great hopes that it may now be possible to turn this sad and bloodstained page of modern history once and for all."
"Mrs Mowlam, you have the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and honour to be with you today to talk about the agreement that was reached on Good Friday and to have a chance to thank people here for the help they have given us in moving the peace talks in Northern Ireland forward to what I hope is a stable and lasting settlement."
"Part of that has been the economic help that has very kindly been given by the European Union but just as important is the support given to us by individual Members of Parliament, individual Commissioners, and the Presidents of both Parliament and the Commission over the past year."
"The money is most welcome; it makes a big difference."
"But it also makes a difference when individuals give of their time and their energy to support what is happening in Northern Ireland."
"That makes a real difference."
"So I thank everyone who brought with them some hope, some belief in the future, some vision of where we could go and their assistance."
"I also acknowledge the help that the three Members of the European Parliament from Northern Ireland - John Hume, Jim Nicholson and Ian Paisley - have given by working together in Europe to get support for Northern Ireland."
"I know it is potentially unfair but may I thank John Hume in particular for the work he has put in."
"(Applause) It has to be said that the work he did over the years when this was not a popular issue has made a difference today."
"I am also very pleased to be speaking alongside my colleague, David Andrews, from the Republic of Ireland."
"It is when the two governments have worked together, as people do in the European Parliament, that we have managed to make progress."
"We must never forget that."
"(Applause) Finally, I acknowledge the work of the Commissioners and not just Jacques Santer."
"I say a special thank you to Monica Wulf-Mathies."
"I will refer later to the work she has done for us in Northern Ireland."
"I would also mention Padraig Flynn and our good friend and comrade Neil Kinnock for their support."
"(Applause and laughter) I mean comrade in the 'comradely' way."
"We are all comrades in a certain sense and that is how I mean it."
"I also, in a 'comradely' way, thank the Council for the endorsement they gave to the historic agreement setting out what we hope is a new beginning, the chance to achieve what we hope will be a lasting peace settlement."
"As the Council acknowledged, it is the courage and the determination of the party leaders and the people of Northern Ireland which has been central in making this opportunity for peace happen."
"We have been aided by the courage and determination of those party leaders and by the economic help that the EU programmes have given us."
"The agreement reached is one that is based on the principles - which were very crucial in the agreement - of consent, cooperation, fairness and justice."
"They are the underlying principles that guide the agreement."
"It is a unique agreement."
"It is unique in the sense that it is the result of talks between Nationalists, Unionists, Loyalists and Republicans."
"It is the first time for 70 years that they have been round the table reaching an accommodation."
"There is no doubt, as many in Parliament know, that we still face difficulties in the weeks, months and years ahead."
"In the immediate future we still have some splinter groups on both sides of the divide that have not signed up to a ceasefire and to the talks."
"In fact, they are out to destroy it."
"That is a continuing problem with the violence that it entails."
"Many of you will have seen last weekend the most recent murder victim was a young 22-year-old student on his way home."
"Those are the difficulties we may still continue to see in the future but our response must be, as the President of this Parliament on his recent visit to Belfast said, there will always be attempts to stop the process reaching a peaceful settlement."
"It is necessary to be prepared for that and to have a strong determination not to let things be spoiled by them."
"I echo your President's words on that."
"I do not want to go into a lot of detail about the agreement but just let me say that none of the parties get 100 % of what they want."
"But there are gains there for everyone."
"It both respects everyone's cultural and political identity and paves the way for a fair, workable and lasting accommodation."
"It has been reached because everyone was willing to compromise."
"Everybody has moved a little and as a result everyone - and I mean everyone - can be a winner as a result of this agreement."
"It includes cooperation within Northern Ireland, within the communities in the North, between the North and the South and between the UK and the Republic."
"I want to mention briefly some aspects of the agreement which refer specifically to Europe."
"As part of the overall settlement there will be a North-South ministerial council which will seek to build greater cooperation than already exists."
"It will bring together members of the Irish Government and members of the new Northern Ireland administration provided the referendum goes through on 22 May, with bodies below the ministerial council to implement decisions."
"One of those will be related to the European issues."
"EU decisions of a cross-border nature will fall under that implementing body."
"There will also be a new body bringing together the British and Irish governments with new devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to consider matters of mutual interest, including European Union matters."
"They will also take advantage of what I believe are the radical constitutional changes taking place within the United Kingdom where we have greater cooperation for trade and EU cooperation between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England."
"I will not go into the detail but everybody in this Parliament knows the amount of economic help you have given Northern Ireland over the previous years through various programmes."
"Over the last six years we have received well over £1.3 billion."
"It has made an enormous difference and we thank you for it."
"At times when things have been very tough it has been of great help to know that the European Union has always been there."
"Some people come late to success and I want to acknowledge very clearly today that when things were tough the European Union was there with us."
"I can remember times when, after a particularly horrific weekend, when Monica was due to come over, I would think: ' Will she come, will she cancel?'"
"And she came. And it shows that if you keep going with confidence and determination you can get to where we are today."
"So I thank those who came in person and the help they gave."
"(Applause) The Structural Funds have been, and will continue to be, an important aspect of funding to Northern Ireland."
"Objective 1 status was given to Northern Ireland because of the special political and economic circumstances that we found ourselves in."
"It has made a tremendous difference to us."
"Under the proposed post-1999 reforms we recognize that qualifying for Objective 1 status is going to be harder but I want to stress to you today what a difference it has made across Northern Ireland in helping to build the opportunities for peace."
"I would also take this opportunity to thank people for the special money in the Peace and Reconciliation Fund which is there to help develop socio-economic policies underpinned by working with Community groups."
"It has made an incredible impact in Northern Ireland and one of the reasons it has made an impact is because projects have to be either cross-community or cross-border."
"There have been 19 000 applications to benefit from that fund."
"The fund has managed to meet 11 500 of them."
"What that means on the ground is that many people have benefited from help from Europe."
"There is a trauma centre in Belfast where people who have lost loved ones can go when the pain is very real to talk and discuss and come to terms with the pain that has been created."
"There is a women's centre in Ballybeen."
"That has meant that women can get retraining, can have a future after the children have gone and can also have a voice."
"Their voice is not always heard in Northern Ireland."
"There is the Ballymena Business Development Centre which allows small businesses the chance to grow and provide what is so crucial to the peace working, namely jobs."
"There are some like the Greysteel Community Centre - people will remember the shooting in 1994 in the Rising Sun Pub where six people were shot at random."
"Thanks to the European Peace and Reconciliation money we now have a community centre there where both sides of the divide go and we are beginning to rebuild after that hurt."
"That is the kind of difference that programme has made and I thank all who made it possible."
"I also want to touch on one other aspect of that Peace and Reconciliation Fund which is so innovative and so constructive."
"It developed in Northern Ireland but has an impact across many European countries."
"The money was not handed out by us in central government, not given by Ministers or departments."
"Monica Wulf-Mathies created an environment where partnerships developed - 20 of them across Northern Ireland - bodies made up of community representatives, local politicians, trade unionists, business people who sat round the table and decided for their local community where the money should be spent."
"The difference that made was that when we went through very tough times in the talks and people were not playing and not talking, there were 26 tables across Northern Ireland around which people were talking, people from both extremes and regardless of what had happened they kept going."
"It will not be up to me but up to the parties after the referendum to decide, but I hope that structure is kept and provides a model for others of what is possible."
"We thank you very much for creating that."
"(Applause) Finally, I would just mention the International Fund which the European Union has contributed to over the years: the recent ECU 17 m per annum for 1998 will enable the fund to continue its important work."
"So the message today really is, thank you for the support."
"We would not have got to where we are in Northern Ireland without the help from the European Parliament."
"You have been there for long enough that enough people have benefited from the programmes that have been put in place that they have been willing to support and encourage people to reach the agreement we reached on Good Friday."
"Europe has been an inspiration to people in Northern Ireland."
"You have supported us on a practical level which makes a difference to people and which is what our EU presidency is about: jobs, crime, education; but you have also given us a hope and a belief that we can build a future, that if we work collectively in Northern Ireland we can do so much better than we can as individuals."
"You have shown that if we look to the future and believe and trust in a vision we can get there."
"You have made a difference in the past."
"I know we will continue to work together in the future."
"Thank you one and all for your support."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very honoured by your invitation today to join with my British colleague, the Secretary of State Mo Mowlam, in marking the agreement reached in the multiparty negotiations in Belfast on Good Friday, 10 April."
"It is fair to say, as expressed by Mo Mowlam, that the immense welcome the agreement has received from our friends across the world and in particular from within the European Union underlines its truly historic and momentous nature."
"Like Mo, I would like to express my deep gratitude for your solidarity and for your encouragement."
"Both qualities are deeply appreciated and not taken for granted."
"It is fair to say that the agreement itself is the culmination not just of two years of difficult negotiation but of decades of shared endeavours by the British and Irish governments and by political leaders of vision and courage."
"I must in particular salute a distinguished Member of Parliament already mentioned by my friend and colleague, and 'comrade' from time to time, Mo Mowlam, namely John Hume."
"I would like to place on record the pivotal and crucial role at all stages of the process from beginning to end of my friend and colleague John Hume."
"Throughout the negotiations the Irish Government has been inspired both by the European ideal and by the real and concrete achievements of the Union."
"We are deeply appreciative of the crucial role the Union has played in preparing the groundwork for the agreement."
"Europe, in particular, has shown how age-old rivalries and bloody conflicts can be transcended through new partnership structures."
"We have also learned the lesson that, to adapt the words of the Treaty establishing the Coal and Steel Community, a new Ireland can be built neither through coercion nor through rhetoric."
"It can only come about through practical achievements which will first of all create real solidarity."
"Our experience as a small country within the Union has shown that there are many sectors in which there is a true commonality of interest between the two parts of the island of Ireland."
"In this Parliament, too, the three Members for Northern Ireland - John Hume, Ian Paisley and Jim Nicholson - despite acute differences between them on political issues have been able to work together on many matters of importance to those they represent."
"The EU structures have themselves been a guide to us in the negotiations on arrangements for cooperation and joint action within Ireland, the North and the South."
"The European Union's economic support through, for example, the Peace and Reconciliation Programme and its contributions to the International Fund for Ireland has been vital and critical in making the peace process a tangible reality for many individuals and communities, both in Northern Ireland and the border counties in the south of the island."
"We are deeply grateful to our partners, the Commission and the European Parliament for their consistent and generous assistance."
"I wish to re-echo the expression of gratitude by Mo Mowlam to the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, to Commissioners Wulf-Mathies, Kinnock and Flynn."
"And to all colleagues who, one way or another, assisted and supported the peace process."
"We welcomed the presence of the President of Parliament in Belfast and we particularly welcomed the presence of Jacques Santer."
"As a member of the General Affairs Council of the Foreign Ministers, let me say that his support on Monday was critical to the magnificent declaration which emanated from that meeting."
"It is deeply appreciated."
"The European Union's economic support for the programmes has been tremendous."
"The European example has also been of great moral significance."
"The conflict in Northern Ireland which has led to so many terrible and needless deaths and injuries has been an affront to the values of our shared European civilization."
"But Europe has shown that no society is condemned by some iron law of history to pace the treadmill of its past."
"Just before the agreement was signed the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble spoke about how the accord could represent an epoch-making end to our internal Cold War which would be enormously liberating for the people of the island as a whole."
"Within the past decade we have seen the end of the Cold War in Europe and its replacement by an new era of partnership."
"We have seen the Berlin Wall torn down and the Iron Curtain collapse."
"There are physical barriers between communities in Belfast still."
"There is a border between North and South but the true frontier is that which runs through the hearts and minds of people."
"The real difference lies between those who look to the future, to new ways of peace and cooperation and those who cling to the past, to the old ways of violence and division."
"That is the divide we wish to break down."
"The agreement does not pretend to be a final and definitive settlement but it creates institutions within which a new relationship of trust can be developed and offers guarantees both individual and collective of the fundamental interests and rights of all."
"As Mo has said, the agreement is complex and complicated and contains many elements which must in their practical operation be synchronized and meshed together."
"The transition to the working of the structures and policies contained in it will be a challenging and continual process."
"In that sense the agreement is an opportunity as much as an achievement."
"The continuing support of the European Union will be critical if we are to meet the new challenges presented by the agreement."
"My government, together with the British Government, looks forward to working with the Commission, the European Parliament and our partners and meeting the challenges of peace and reconciliation."
"I therefore welcome Monday's agreement at the General Affairs Council that the Union should continue to play an active part in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland."
"As you know, there will be simultaneous referendums North and South on 22 May."
"When they come to the ballot box the people of Ireland will be asked above all else to vote for peace."
"They should have on their minds the profound example, the triumph offered by Europe's transformation of itself."
"I am confident that the people will together and concurrently endorse the agreement and allow its immense potential to be realized."
"Again, I extend my deep gratitude on my own behalf and that of my government for the invitation by the President of Parliament to be here and thank you and your colleagues once again."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very honoured to address the European Parliament today in this debate of importance and significance for all of us in the European Union."
"Barely two weeks ago agreement was reached in the multi-party negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland in Belfast."
"This agreement required considerable political courage and great determination."
"Today before this House, on behalf of the European Commission, I would like to pay tribute to all those who are playing a part in this peace process: to the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr Mo Mowlam, and to Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Andrews, both of whom we particularly welcome here this afternoon; to the parties in the talks; to the outstanding chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell and his fellow independent chairmen - former Prime Minister Harri Holkeri and General John de Chastelain."
"We welcome the Agreement although it is not our role to pass judgment on it."
"That is a matter for the people in the North and South of Ireland to decide in the referendums on 22 May."
"But we can - as we always have done - continue to support wholeheartedly the peace and reconciliation process."
"Surely in political life there is no more noble a cause than trying to bring people together inclusively in the pursuit of peace and reconciliation - from whatever their backgrounds, rich or poor; from whatever their religious or ethnic origins, and to bridge the gaps of intolerance and hatred, to break down fear and insecurity, to build confidence and a belief in a new future and to offer hope, opportunity, freedom, the chance for happiness, the chance for a decent future for future generations."
"There is no more noble cause than that."
"To try and try again in this task and to be determined to succeed in the end: that is what we applaud today."
"Indeed, does this not mirror the spirit that symbolises the whole history of the European Union itself?"
"As committed and dedicated Europeans is this not the credo of our daily lives - to bring all European peoples together in friendship, peace and reconciliation, in a spirit of tolerance and mutual respect, fulfilling the guiding principles of our Treaty."
"Yes, this is our raison d'être and our lasting success."
"So, today, in this House we rejoice in the progress that is being made."
"During the talks leading to the agreement I believe the European Union has played an important role in three major ways."
"Firstly, the European Union has provided a stable political reference point for both communities, a reference point that has shown how formerly divided communities and divided European countries can work together, trust each other and grow together successfully in the modern world."
"Secondly, because our institutions - this Parliament, the Council of Ministers, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - have all provided important political venues where members of the United Kingdom and Irish governments and politicians from Ireland, North and South, have been able to meet and work constructively together on many subjects."
"But the European political process has shown that these disagreements can be resolved amicably without resulting in malice or recrimination."
"So our institutions themselves have played their part."
"Thirdly, I believe we have played a generous part in a deep and continued European involvement to underpin, practically, the efforts of both governments to bring about peace and reconciliation."
"We have done this by a twin-track approach of assistance for economic and social regeneration and direct support for cross-community reconciliation."
"In 1988 we became a major contributor to the International Fund for Ireland."
"Overall we have contributed ECU 135 million."
"25 000 jobs have been created."
"After the cease-fire in 1994 we launched the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland, a programme that has been unequivocally supported by the MEPs from the Province."
"This has been a big success."
"On my recent visit to Northern Ireland I saw at first hand some of the cross-community and cross-border projects - such as my visit to the Shankill Women's Centre or when I listened to the Ray of Hope Choir."
"They were moving experiences."
"Few people know that the special programme is financing no fewer than 11 000 projects - bringing together more than 2 000 people, one-seventh of Northern Ireland's population!"
"So I am very pleased to announce before this House today that the Commission has agreed this morning in the provisional draft budget to propose a further ECU 100 million for the Peace and Reconciliation Programme for 1999."
"This brings the total for this programme to ECU 500 million over five years."
"I am sure this will be supported by the European Parliament."
"Let us not forget either the role other Community funds have played: the general Northern Ireland programme under the Structural Funds, INTERREG, URBAN and other Community programmes."
"Over ECU 1.3 billion has been earmarked under Objective 1 of the Structural Funds for Northern Ireland."
"Our practical assistance to Northern Ireland has been constant, committed and additional."
"We have provided sustained support for all the communities over a long period of time - and rightly so."
"Let me add that the Peace and Reconciliation Programme has been a laboratory for new forms of cooperation and implementation of our Structural Fund programmes and a source of inspiration for more decentralized implementation in the next programming period."
"In the future the European Union will continue to support social and economic regeneration in Northern Ireland as we have in the past."
"Community funding will be present in the initial phase in 1999 with our proposal to extend our contribution to the Peace Programme, and its effects will be felt for longer still."
"And, in addition, I am confident that by working with both governments, all the political parties and all strands of opinion we will be able to find new, creative ways of supporting the fresh opportunities which an agreement will bring."
"I can assure you of our commitment in that respect."
"Let me conclude my remarks this afternoon by saying that we salute the great courage of the people of Ireland, North and South and all of those who are involved in the peace process."
"We support the huge efforts that have been made on the road to peace and reconciliation."
"And we continue to pledge our support to underpin this bold and courageous process - now and in the future."
"Václav Havel provides me with the words and thoughts I need to express my feelings and conclude my remarks this afternoon."
"He said 'Je crois profondément en la coexistence de communautés régionales au sein d'une communauté globale de tous les hommes ' ."
"So do I."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Santer."
"Mr Hume has the floor, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Mr President, I have to say that I am very pleased that the leadership of my own group has asked me to speak for the group today because I am quite sure that the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland would want me to speak for them today to express their deep gratitude to all of the European institutions for the powerful strength and support that they have given to the peace movement on our streets."
"Could I begin by expressing their gratitude, and my thanks, to you for representing this Parliament and coming to our streets and thereby strengthening the will for peace and the mood for peace by showing the people on the streets, who have been neglected for so long, that Europe and the outside world really did care."
"That strengthened enormously the will for peace among the people."
"In so doing you are building on the strong foundations, already laid by the European Commission, and let nobody underestimate the strength of those foundations."
"When the cease-fires were called, Jacques Delors approached us immediately to ask what he could do to help and he initiated the special programme for peace and reconciliation."
"His successor, President Santer, came to our streets to meet with people at local level and, of course, the fact that the President of the European Commission came to the streets was an enormous statement, not only of goodwill but of positive support for the peace process and of strength for that process."
"The fact that his colleague the Commissioner for regional policy with major responsibility for Northern Ireland, Monica Wulf-Mathies, has come to our streets many times and has gone to the areas of highest unemployment and has brought together people from both sides on their common ground - economic regeneration - has been a very important factor in the healing process that we believe is now under way."
"Of course, the two governments who are represented here today and in particular the two people who are representing them who have been involved in very detailed work during the talks leading to the agreement have put enormous efforts into it, together with previous governments who have also made very strong moves towards peace in our country."
"We have, I believe, an historic opportunity now for a new beginning in which we can leave behind us our terrible and tragic past."
"It is a new beginning in which there will be no victory for either section of our people because in divided societies victories are not solutions."
"What we have is an agreement that underlines and proposes accommodation and respect for the identities of both sections of our people and for the ethos of both sections of our people and creates the circumstances in which both sections of our people can work together in their common interests and by so doing can break down the barriers of the past."
"There again, we see the enormous influence of the European Union because, as I have often said the European Union has been a major inspiration to the philosophy of creating peace."
"People often talk of European Union as economic this and economic that, but fundamentally, as I have often said on my streets, it is the finest example in the history of the world of conflict resolution."
"Just imagine fifty years ago: for the second time in a century, after millions has been slaughtered, who could have forecast we would be altogether today?"
"But we are."
"How was it done?"
"How it was done involves the philosophy I am talking about, not just in Northern Ireland but in every area of conflict in the world because at the end of the day all conflict is about the same thing - it is about seeing difference as a threat."
"(Applause) The peoples of Europe decided that difference - whether it is your race, your religion, your nationality or your ethnicity - is an accident of birth and not something that you should fight about; it is something you should respect."
"Looking at the philosophical principles that create peace, what the peoples of Europe did was to build institutions - and those three institutions are represented here today - which fully respect the differences of their peoples."
"No one in Europe has lost their identity but, and this is the important point, make them work together in their substantial common interests which are social and economic, as I often say 'spilling their sweat and not their blood' , and by doing that we can breakdown the barriers and centuries and the new Europe will have evolved."
"Those are the principles that go to the heart of this new agreement if you read it."
"They are creating institutions within Northern Ireland and between North and South and between Britain and Ireland that respect our differences but which allow us to work together in our common interests based on partnership, on equality, on mutual respect, on consent and agreement."
"As we lay those foundations now, as the two governments have laid those foundations for us by their work for this agreement, let us hope that by working together the real healing process in Ireland will begin and we will break down the barriers of prejudice of centuries and the new Ireland will evolve in the way the new Europe has but with no victory for either side but based on agreement and respect for diversity."
"Indeed, Mr President, as that is happening I have no doubt that the continued support from the European Union and from the European Commission and Council of Ministers in particular, through economic regeneration, will play a major role in strengthening the common ground enormously and in expressing to our people at grass-roots level the massive international goodwill that exists for peace in the offshore island of the European Union."
"The representatives of all sections of our people face the challenge of harnessing that massive international goodwill and translating it into real benefits for our people and in doing it together to break down the barriers of centuries."
"We look forward in Northern Ireland to continuing support from our friends in the European Union and we thank you for it."
"We are very confident, and I know I am speaking for the vast majority of our people from both sectors of our community when I say we are looking forward to laying our past permanently behind us."
"As we move into the next century let it be the first century in our island history in which we will have no killing on our streets and no emigration of our young people to other lands to earn a living."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Mr President, this is a time of great hope and gratitude in Ireland: hope for the future of the two referendums we are facing shortly, gratitude to all our friends and colleagues who throughout the years have given us such wonderful support."
"Congratulations also for those who were directly involved over the last few years and particularly in the last few months in bringing this process to what we hope will be a good conclusion."
"And particular congratulations to those who chose the long and consistent and patient path; notwithstanding the many disappointments and great griefs that they encountered along the way: Thank you, John."
"Throughout this process Europe was there with us."
"It was there not just with the financial aid but also with the human and political aid that we have gained from colleagues who visited us and the very real and genuine concern across all political groups in Parliament."
"This agreement is one great step but we have a long process ahead of us as has already been said by both our ministers and the big process I believe we have to face in the next few years is how we bring the plain people of Northern Ireland in both communities together."
"Not just the communities within Northern Ireland but the communities in the North and the South, between whom there still exists unfortunately a great void."
"It was not just a physical boundary but it was also the boundary of the minds that divided us and that will be our most challenging job for the next few years."
"There is so much we can do together; there are so many great opportunities; let us seize them."
"Finally, I would like in addition to pay tribute to all those concerned, to make a special reference to the contribution the women of Northern Ireland have made, both between themselves and also with the South."
"The Women's Coalition made a significant contribution to this process and I believe they should be recognized as well."
"Thank you all, colleagues and thank you everybody, particularly the Commission and those who worked so hard for this great day for us all."
"Mr President, like the other groups in Parliament, my group has followed with great emotion the agreement signed in Belfast on 10 April by the British and Irish Governments and the parties representing the communities of Northern Ireland."
"We are very pleased to see Mrs Mowlam and Mr Andrews here together today, sharing the same philosophy and the same commitment."
"Their understanding, toughness and commitment mean that the European Parliament can feel proud today."
"Our group showed its commitment to peace in Northern Ireland, during the previous parliamentary term, through the members of the Irish Democratic Left, and also through the work of Vice-President Gutiérrez Díaz in his capacity as rapporteur for the International Fund for peace in Northern Ireland and as member and chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy."
"His work was a sign of our group's commitment, because we are convinced that in Ireland there are many men and women of good will, many men and women who believe in democracy, many men and women who also think of themselves as Europeans."
"So it is easy for them not to fear peace or democracy today."
"As the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, said here: there is no need to be frightened of peace."
"The dangers of peace are always far less than the dangers of violence."
"So, as the European Parliament, we want to make a firm commitment."
"We want to encourage the Commission and the Council to develop all these programmes and plans for solidarity because we want to share the fruits of peace."
"In a few years' time, we want there to be Irish Members of the European Parliament who can greet each other warmly, who are committed to the same political project of democracy for Europe and the European peoples."
"For every problem, in every country, there are different solutions."
"But the philosophy of renouncing violence in Ireland and making a commitment to peace and dialogue applies to everybody."
"We cannot draw any other conclusion."
"We cannot confuse one problem with another and propose a single, general solution, but what is clear is that European commitment, democratic commitment, and the renunciation of violence are applicable to everybody. That is why we are pleased today with this agreement and the fact that all the Irish people, from the North and from the South, can be fully European, by regaining peace and democracy for their children and for the future."
"For too long in Britain and Ireland we have been united only by grief and therefore with all my heart I welcome the Good Friday Agreement and I warmly welcome here today Dr Mo Mowlam, the Northern Ireland Secretary, and David Andrews, our own Minister."
"The Agreement is a development of deep historical significance and must be supported by all those who wish for an end to this ancient conflict."
"Those who continue to say 'no' have no solution other than continued violence."
"There can be no doubt that 'yes' vote in the two referendums is a vote to end violence and that is something we must all wish for."
"The two Governments, together with most of the political parties of the region, have agreed a set of proposals which transcend the narrow confines of nationalism - whether of the British or the Irish variety."
"I hope that in time we can develop a set of political arrangements where identity and territory are no longer the defining ideologies of state-building."
"The political darkness in the North was in a large part due to its standing in the long dark shadows of both British and Irish nationalism locked in a struggle to the death."
"Only movement by the two Governments on the key underlying constitutional issues could move that shadow and lift some of the darkness."
"The Agreements on police reform, prisoner release, victim support, human rights and equality legislation are vital and need to be acted upon with generosity and imagination."
"We are all equal citizens of the European Union and, as my colleague John Hume has said, we must learn to treat each other with equal respect."
"Just one note of caution."
"As currently structured, the decision-making systems of the new assembly tend to reinforce and institutionalize the current divide."
"There is something distasteful about public representatives who, after all, are intended to represent the whole of the Community following rules rooted more in ethnic labelling than in democracy."
"I hope that over time these elements can be ironed out of the arrangement as reconciliation builds, trust grows and a true democratic consensus begins to develop."
"I know that this is an ideal, that the painful move away from conflict has not at present been accommodated but in particular we must not allow the women who have done so much to keep and create cross-community action during the years of conflict to be excluded from building the peace."
"In this context I would like to give a particular thanks to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies for the way she has structured the programme for Peace and Reconciliation that has been deeply embedded in the Community as we have heard from Dr Mowlam today."
"That is a vital and important part of the resolution of this conflict and I could recommend it to anybody, anywhere."
"Mr President, I want to thank my group for giving me the opportunity to speak on their behalf in what is a truly historic occasion."
"Perhaps it is because I represent the nation of Scotland which is near in geography but also in culture."
"We once shared the same language and culture as Ireland and we care deeply for all parts of that noble island."
"We praise those who found the words."
"I once read the words of a British ambassador to Dublin who said: ' This is a land where words can turn into weapons' ."
"Throughout the hard talking that took place I noticed how carefully Mo Mowlam had to choose her words and yet every word was spoken from her heart."
"She had an enormous part to play."
"I have to praise also my longstanding friend from the 1960s, John Hume, who has given his lifetime to the process of patient, peaceful talking."
"All the others, the Prime Ministers past and present, the politicians like David Andrews here today and David Trimble for holding the line when many Unionists panicked."
"War-weariness set in."
"3 600 people dead, most of them civilians."
"I read what an IRA man said: ' I joined the IRA when I was 20."
"I am now in my 40s and I have been to too many funerals' . As the war-weariness set in there began to be a total realization in the minds of everybody that violence was getting nowhere."
"All sides have yielded cherished positions and shed traditional attitudes."
"In the words of John Hume they have drawn and shaped new relationships."
"These magnificent politicians have built a bridge of hope and the optimists have beaten the pessimists."
"Real concessions were made."
"Ireland gave up the claim to the North and Nationalists in the North accepted that there could be a solution for Northern Ireland short of a united Ireland."
"So we praise them all and the European Union."
"British tabloid newspapers are always criticizing the European Union."
"When faced with this, I have to say that if the only thing we achieved was peace in Northern Ireland, the European Union would have been worthwhile."
"We have provided a meeting place for all the parts of Ireland to get together informally and to work together for the benefit of the whole island."
"The silent majority of Ireland want peace; let them now vote for it!"
"Mr President, I should firstly like to identify myself with the tributes paid to yourself, President Santer, Monica Wulf-Mathies and others who have been involved."
"For thirty years the people of Northern Ireland have not been able to enjoy or benefit from a normal society."
"They have suffered grievously over that time from countless evil and wicked acts by terrorists."
"It does not matter what letters of the alphabet the terrorists use to camouflage their atrocities."
"We still have a long way to go for there are still those who wish to keep the people of Northern Ireland at each other's throats."
"I would like today to put on record my admiration for the people of Northern Ireland who have withstood the pressure and managed to remain in control and calm in the face of adversity."
"I would also like to put on record the immense debt we the people of Northern Ireland owe to the security forces and the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Royal Irish Regiment, formerly the Ulster Defence Regiment and the army which on many occasions in the past 30 years stood between sanity and oblivion."
"I have to say that on many occasions they never received the credit they deserved."
"There is still a long way to go."
"Please do not believe that all our problems are over."
"There are many deep scars in both communities which will take a long time to heal."
"Many families will never be able to forget their own personal loss and I hope we can understand that."
"We should not believe that this agreement will be accepted by everyone."
"Many of the people I represent are extremely concerned that those who murdered and bombed for the last 30 years have not decommissioned one bullet nor one ounce of Semtex."
"There are many people who are extremely sceptical of these unreconstructed terrorists' long-term motives and have doubts about their intentions to follow the democratic path."
"The European Union has been very constructive in the support it has provided in recent years."
"It will require sustained and positive action by the European Union to ensure that we can rebuild our divided communities and restore that confidence."
"The future of Northern Ireland and its ultimate destiny lie firmly in the hands of those who live and reside within Northern Ireland."
"This settlement is not and cannot be considered interim; it is permanent."
"I know there will be difficult days ahead."
"The road to peace will not be easy, it never is."
"But there comes a time when one must grasp the opportunity."
"The easy way is always to say 'No' , to demolish and destroy."
"The difficult way forward is to say 'Yes' and to pick up the challenge and build a new future for all the people of Northern Ireland."
"The people of Northern Ireland are a warm and generous people."
"They deserve better than they have had."
"The future is in their hands."
"They will decide, they will vote and I trust they will choose wisely."
"I tried very hard earlier today to obtain consensus on a joint resolution."
"Unfortunately, because of the Socialist Group's attitude, I was unable to achieve it."
"It is a bad start."
"I hope it reconsiders and adopts a better attitude in the future."
"If we cannot have consensus on a joint resolution in this Parliament, we will have difficulties ahead of us."
"Mr President, I rise to speak on behalf of people who have no voice now in Northern Ireland."
"They had a voice when they elected me top of the poll - the position I have occupied at every election for this Parliament with the largest number of voters taking part in the election."
"And why can these people not speak?"
"It is because they have been butchered and killed by the IRA and other so-called Loyalist groups."
"I do not know how many people in this House today have read the Agreement or know what it contains but it does not contain some of the things that have been attributed to it by some speakers today."
"They cannot have read it."
"It is proposed that all unreformed terrorists will be released inside 24 months."
"The Secretary of State says that it is based on justice and everyone is a winner."
"Who is winning and what sort of justice is that?"
"I have not time today to talk about some of the people but let me give you one example."
"In 1993 - which is not long ago - Paul Magee from Belfast was convicted of killing Special Constable Glen Goodman in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire."
"He was also a member of the IRA active service unit, nicknamed the M60 Gang after they killed five security force members in Belfast."
"That is the type of unreformed terrorist who is going to be loosed onto the streets of Northern Ireland."
"I have before me copies of a paper with every police officer they murdered during their campaign."
"Here we have all these young men who gave their lives in defence of both Roman Catholic and Protestant people in Northern Ireland, all murdered by the IRA."
"And those who are serving time for their murders are to be released within 24 months."
"But there is one exception."
"In the South of Ireland where a garda was shot, the government has made it clear that those responsible will not join in the amnesty."
"I say: What is the difference between him and the Royal Ulster Constabulary men who fought and died to guard the people of Northern Ireland?"
"What is the difference?"
"Someone in this House said that this is peace."
"These gunmen, once released, will have access to the greatest terrorist arsenal in the whole of the western world - not one gun surrendered, not one ounce of Semtex surrendered - and when they do not get what they want, they will take it out not on this Parliament, not on the people of Europe, but on the long-suffering people of Northern Ireland."
"Someone said: Do not be afraid of peace."
"Go and tell the widows."
"Go and tell the orphans."
"Go and tell the slaughtered in Northern Ireland that."
"How can they lie in their beds when they know that those who murdered their kith and kin are to be released on to the streets with access to the weapons of murder."
"This is a serious matter."
"Let the people of Northern Ireland speak."
"The government is spending £3 million in order to win this referendum."
"But the Ulster people will not be bullied and they will not be bribed."
"And when they speak we will hear the real Ulster."
"Mr President, at the outset I want to thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to say a few brief words on this historic day for the European Parliament."
"I want to congratulate all of those involved in bringing about peace and the peace accord of Good Friday."
"In particular, I want to welcome to the European Parliament our own Foreign Minister, David Andrews, and Secretary of State Mo Mowlam, both of whom have played an integral role and both of whom have spent long and arduous hours in negotiations, culminating in this accord."
"Parliament, the Commission and in particular the President of the Commission and his Commissioners Wulf-Mathies, Flynn and Kinnock continually lent their support and goodwill to the efforts to reach a peace agreement, responding at all times in a positive and practical manner through the International Fund, through Peace and Reconciliation and I am confident that Parliament will warmly approve the Commission's recommendation of another £100 million before this year's budget."
"I know that the Union will continue to support the process and it is absolutely essential."
"But they should do so now by granting Objective 1 status on a cross-border basis."
"This would ensure priority access to European funding for regional, social, agricultural and fisheries development - on a cross-border basis, I emphasize."
"This will bring much needed jobs to the many unemployed in the region."
"In conclusion as a representative of the border region, I want to pledge myself to assisting the peace process in a positive and practical way."
"I, too, in the short period that I have want to welcome the Agreement and to say that I sincerely hope it will be supported by the vast majority of the people of Ireland, North and South."
"I want to congratulate, of course, especially John Hume for the immense investment he has made in time and sacrifice in this Agreement."
"I want also to recognize the leadership of David Trimble in bringing the majority of the Unionists of Northern Ireland alongside and I want to thank Jim Nicholson, too, a Member of this House also, for giving his considerable assistance and influence in support of David Trimble's effort."
"I want also to remember all the Prime Ministers of Britain and Northern Ireland in the past who made an immense effort and their contribution is, I believe, part of the success of this agreement."
"I want also to recognize the efforts of the American President in this."
"He gave a lot up to the very last minute and I believe what America has done here is an example for Europe as well of what a major power, through its influence and good diplomacy, can achieve throughout the world."
"We would like to especially thank the EU for its quiet and unintrusive role in Northern Ireland, the framework of the European Union which helped Irish and British Ministers to work together the common agricultural policy, the common policies that created the single market where the people North and South cooperate together now without any border to prevent them from growing together and cooperating and trading together."
"Europe has done that for us and it is a big effort."
"I would like to thank Mr Santer and Mrs Wulf-Mathies for being the visible face of the European Community in Northern Ireland and I want to say that I hope we can continue with the assistance we are giving which has meant so much."
"Mr President, having served as a politician in both parts of Ireland I am only too well aware of the difficulties in trying to negotiate an agreement which will be acceptable to all parties to the conflict."
"The Good Friday Agreement is an historic achievement and I wholeheartedly congratulate all those who contributed to it, both Governments and the party leaders, particularly John Hume who has been praised here today, John Alderdice and especially David Trimble who has had the courage to lead Unionism to an honourable deal with their fellow citizens in Northern Ireland."
"Let me say to Dr Paisley, when he talked about the votes he received, one vote for peace and reconciliation and an end of conflict is worth more than a thousand votes for a continuation of the conflict."
"It is inevitable, given the complexity of the problem, that everyone will have some significant reservations about some part of the package."
"However, it is a package and there can be no cherrypicking by anyone - the choice is either to accept the package in total or to reject it."
"If the worst were to happen, and this package were rejected, another 20 years of negotiations would take place, resulting in a similar package and resulting in the same reservations that have been expressed."
"A similar deal was on offer in 1974, 25 years past, and thousands needlessly died and suffered and we must not condemn the peoples of Britain and Ireland and especially Northern Ireland to another prolonged period of violence."
"I passionately support this Agreement, it is a fair and honourable one and should be wholeheartedly endorsed through both parts of Ireland."
"It is appropriate that the European Parliament should have the opportunity of endorsing it; this Parliament symbolically represents the conflict over two World Wars and many other European quarrels and let us hope we can show the way to the people of Northern Ireland."
"(Applause)"
"I am delighted to have the opportunity to express my wholehearted support for this historic Agreement which puts relationships within Northern Ireland, between the two parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain on a completely new footing, based on partnership, consent and mutual respect."
"Since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the European Union has succeeded in providing a forum in which EU members sit around a table to debate their differences without resorting to violence."
"Hence the signing of this Agreement."
"I welcome the historic opportunity for the people of Northern Ireland to resolve their difficulties by exclusively democratic and peaceful means."
"I firmly oppose the use or threat of force to achieve any political objective."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the politicians involved throughout this long and painful process, which has involved successive governments on both islands, and in particular to commend the courage of those Northern Ireland politicians who have taken that extra step which has got us where we are today."
"Furthermore, I wish to acknowledge and to thank the European Union for its constant support and its encouragement."
"I would hope that this support will be continued in practical terms."
"In my capacity as an elected representative, I join with the signatories in commending this Agreement to the people of Ireland, North and South, for their approval."
"I have received 8 motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure ."
"Mrs Mowlam now has the floor."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Mowlam."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"European Group on ethics, science and new technologies"
"The next item is the Commission communication on questions relating to the work of the European Group on ethics, science and new technologies."
"Mr Santer has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to present to you today the new European Group on ethics, science and new technologies, which takes over from the advisory body on the ethics of biotechnology."
"The origins of this initiative are to be found in the Commission's commitment to all matters relating to science and technology which bring up issues of an ethical nature."
"The end of this century has been marked by the spectacular emergence of science and new technologies, mainly in two areas, those of biology and information."
"These developments are bringing about profound changes, both at the level of society in general and in our daily lives."
"The prospects for progress are huge in areas such as employment, growth and improvement of quality of life."
"Nevertheless, these advances create fears due to the speed at which progress has been achieved and the global dimension of these technologies."
"This is why an ethical accompaniment is more than ever necessary to ensure that the progress achieved is in harmony with basic values and human dignity."
"The European Parliament soon set out to provide an ethical dimension to scientific progress in this field and to the scientific application which has accompanied this progress."
"I am convinced that the creation of an ethical group is in line with the concerns of your institution."
"I would like to explain to you the new characteristics of the European Group on ethics, which provides continuity to the work of the previous advisory body."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight the role and competence of the members of the previous body, particularly its chairperson, Mrs Noëlle Lenoir, who undertook their responsibilities in a remarkable way, in particular encouraging dialogue between our institutions."
"Firstly, I would like to mention the characteristics which the former body and the new group have in common."
"These are the characteristics of a classic ethics committee."
"The new group, like its predecessor, is consultative, independent, multidisciplinary and multinational."
"It is consultative in that its main task is to draw up non-binding opinions for the Commission and to prepare the ground usefully for decisions to be taken."
"It is, of course, independent: it represents no particular economic or political power."
"That is why each one of its members is appointed on a personal basis, according to their reputation and competence, and why it is made up of 12 experts, a number which does not correspond to the number of Member States."
"The group is able to organize its work freely."
"Thanks to a new rule, the group will also be able to agree on its own internal regulations next May."
"Finally, the group is multidisciplinary and multinational."
"Each member has a different approach depending on his or her specialization: science, law or humanities."
"This pluralism is a source of wealth for ethical reflection."
"So, what are the main characteristics of the new group?"
"It seems to me that there are three: the first innovation is the broadening of the scope of activity of the group."
"Indeed, historically, the preceding group had been deeply anchored in the sphere of biotechnology."
"This one remains at the centre of scientific development, and thus at the centre of our concerns."
"Cloning is the most obvious example. However, that is not all."
"How can we not be concerned by the development of the information society and the protection of human dignity on the Internet? How can we not respond to the fears that are caused by access to personal genetic information, or human tissue banks?"
"We wanted to reply to these new challenges by giving the group the task of dealing additionally with scientific developments in general, including research and the information society."
"These new responsibilities will require sufficient expertise."
"This is the second new characteristic of this group, which has been strengthened and whose membership has been increased from 9 to 12 members, appointed for three-year terms."
"Finally, and this third innovation is a considerable one, the group must base its work on closer cooperation with the other institutions."
"The group is certainly closely linked to the Commission and presents it recommendations to that body."
"Nevertheless, I understand the wish of the other institutions to have access to the reflections of the group, even to be involved in them."
"The European Parliament expressed this desire in its resolution of June 1977."
"Personally, I want the group to follow the path of dialogue and transparency begun by its predecessor."
"Many debates were organized on its initiative, with active participation from the House, which encouraged the establishment of a climate of fruitful collaboration."
"I also attach great importance to the fact that every opinion should immediately be passed on to both yourselves and the Council."
"In this spirit, and on my request, the Commission has invited Parliament and the Council to specify the different themes which should be the subject of an examination by the group, or even of an opinion from it."
"I would like to underline that this new possibility of referral is an unprecedented innovation."
"Mr President, we need a European Group on ethics."
"Its opinions will be important in the formulation and implementation of Community legislation."
"In this context, I would like to remind you that, since 1991, the previous group enabled a widening of the debate at European level by involving all parties concerned, including the general public."
"It was able to reconcile scientific expertise with the general public's understanding of these issues, which is not easy when it comes to ethics."
"I am convinced that the European Group on ethics will continue this important mission."
"Mr President, may I thank President Santer for personally presenting this European Group on ethics to us, which is, furthermore, attached to the Presidency of the Commission."
"Before moving on to my question, I would also like to thank the advisory body on the ethics of biotechnology, chaired by Mrs Lenoir, for its good work, particularly in the assistance it provided to institutions in order to guide the directive on the patentability of biotechnological inventions to a successful conclusion, through precise, concrete and motivated advice."
"The new group which you have just introduced to us, Mr President, is an enlarged group with extended responsibilities."
"You are aware that Parliament would have preferred a committee with an interinstitutional vocation, in order to guide our overall work more precisely, not regarding individual demands for patents - we never requested this - but in order that this institution would be of a nature that went beyond simply advising the Commission."
"You raised some legal objections to this, which I understand, and which I accept."
"My question is, nevertheless, the following: how, in practice, will Parliament be able to submit questions to this new group?"
"I thank Mr Cot for his question."
"Indeed, we feel it extremely important that Parliament should have every possibility of contacting this group and we thus consider that it can, of course, put questions to the group."
"It is clearly for Parliament to draw up the practical application of this procedure but, from our side, no filter - as you have called it - will oppose requests for referral made by Parliament."
"It is for Parliament alone to decide in what way it wants to submit to the group."
"We will not interfere in this regard."
"But it is for you to formulate a procedure; it is up to you, for I would not want to interfere in your internal procedures."
"In any case, the group is open, and its members have agreed to collaborate as actively as possible with the other institutions, especially with Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to offer an immediate response to the matter just raised."
"Last week at the request of Parliament and its President we formed a working group on bioethics in the Committee on Research."
"I would like to ask how you envisage cooperation between the Commission's Group on ethics and this ethics group which has now been formally set up in the Committee on Research."
"Of course, Mr President, this European Group on ethics is ready to collaborate fully with all the groups which are active here."
"As I said, it is an independent group, a neutral one, which is attached to the Commission, but it will of course be open, in order to assure close collaboration with all other bodies created through other initiatives and other legislative procedures."
"That seems clear to me."
"Coordination efforts must also be ensured in the various groups."
"It will thus certainly examine all of these questions, insofar as it is requested to do so by the more particular and specific groups that have been created."
"At first reading of the patent directive the European Parliament called for the setting up of an ethics committee to assess all aspects of biotechnology and in particular with regard to patents."
"The response of the Commission is not what Parliament demanded; we asked you to submit proposals to the European Parliament but your response has been to expand your previous committee."
"Evaluating biotechnology is not the same as evaluating the ethical implications of patent applications."
"An example is that biotech produces therapeutic treatments which are intended to benefit patients."
"Patenting such treatment may not, however, be in the patients' best interests or may be prohibited on public policy grounds, preserving doctors' rights of treatment without depending on a monopoly supplier or researchers' rights to produce alternative treatments from the same genetic material."
"I would like to ask President Santer: how can the committee act as an ethical scrutiny body on biotechnological inventions as Parliament wants, when its remit is only to look at basic ethical principles and not at individual issues raised by patent applications?"
"How much time and resources will be committed to detailed scrutiny of biotech inventions?"
"What resources will be made available for widespread public consultations on key ethical issues?"
"We have heard about access but access is not what Parliament wanted; we want to request the committee to give a direct opinion to Parliament on specific issues."
"Will the Members have that direct access to the committee to give an opinion on any specific issue, not through the Commission?"
"Thank you."
"Firstly, I would like to emphasize that the group is a consultative body with the task of examining general questions on fundamental ethical principles."
"Thus, it is not intended to systematically give opinions on individual cases such as, for example, the ethical dimension of a patent request or the authorization for marketing of a specific product."
"The group is there to examine all questions, as I said, on fundamental ethical principles."
"Nevertheless, it could also be asked to examine other issues."
"It is therefore possible to give the European Group on ethics responsibility for evaluating all ethical aspects of biotechnology."
"It is already clearly a delimitation of its powers, but we have to ensure that the group is not overloaded with tasks."
"Mr President, I am a little afraid that the task of this new committee may be somewhat vague because its mandate has been expanded."
"I would therefore like to ask whether we could also conceive of the group giving general advice to others, in other words, a fiche d'impact d'éthique , which could be considered in the assessment of all political questions."
"I hope, for example, that we would be able to avoid a situation in which economic arguments are used in assessing human dignity, as has sometimes happened in earlier periods here in Europe."
"How does the Commission intend to ensure that the work is well defined and that ethical opinions are included in other areas, such as through this assessment?"
"Finally, I would like to say that it was gratifying to hear that we will get these opinions from the group immediately and do not have to be satisfied with three-year reports."
"I would like to make sure that we will get the opinions from the group immediately."
"I do not share the Member's concerns at all."
"This group has already proved its experience in the past, under the leadership of Mrs Lenoir, and its work has been much appreciated."
"We have now widened it to deal with other issues and its membership has been increased."
"Its members are independent, of high quality and well known. The expertise of its new members will enable it to cope with the broadening of its remit."
"Furthermore, the pluralism of the group, which is essential, will most certainly enable it to ensure ethical reflection adapted to the range of questions likely to be put to it."
"All opinions are passed on immediately, not just in four-monthly reports."
"The question you are raising regarding closer relations with the European Parliament can be raised at the next meeting to be held between the chairman of the group and the President of the European Parliament. I believe this will be held on 29 April, that is, tomorrow, and it will then also be possible to discuss all of these issues, if you still have concerns as to how this group will function."
"Terminator crops are those crops which when planted are genetically pre-programmed to probably last only one season, at the end of which they die and the farmer in question has to buy new foods from the supplier."
"I believe that raises an ethical issue, President, and can I therefore ask you how I, as a Parliamentarian, can obtain the opinion of this new committee?"
"President Santer, you are aware of my concern about this because of course on Monday of this week I sent you a fax asking you how as a Parliamentarian I could obtain the opinion of the new committee."
"I would like to do that and I am aware that there are no current rules in existence and therefore the situation may be somewhat difficult."
"Nevertheless, your advice would be very welcome."
"I can confirm that you did indeed submit a question on this subject to me and I immediately passed your letter on to the group to give an opinion."
"It is now for the group to organize its work in order to give you a response."
"What I want to ensure is that the procedure is not an overly complex one and that Members of this Parliament may have direct access to the group."
"This is why I replied earlier, in answer to a question from Mr Cot, that it is for the European Parliament to agree on a procedure to enable its Members to contact the group directly."
"We have no problem in accepting such a procedure."
"Mr President, I would like to thank President Santer for his personal involvement in this issue."
"President Santer, we were not entirely happy with the work done by the original group."
"The debate here over the last year provided evidence of this."
"However, I think that by appointing new members and with the increased plurality of the group we will find the work more satisfactory."
"In my view, one problem which was particularly evident in the position on human cloning was that there was insufficient time for consultation with the scientific institutes which work in the areas of ethics and science in Europe."
"My question is this: in future how will the group integrate the work which is done in Europe and is in part supported by the Commission with the work done by this advisory group - will there be a first reading followed by a report from the institutes which operate in this field, and then a second reading?"
"Mr President, from a scientific point of view, the work of this group, like that of the previous group, can certainly be compared to work which has been undertaken by groups on ethics in other countries."
"I hope that it will be comparable to the work undertaken at a national level."
"So we must not demand more from this group than from those at a national level."
"Frankly speaking, some criticism could also be made of those groups but we do not live in a perfect world, so let us limit ourselves to having a procedure and let us allow this group to work in full independence."
"We want an independent group, so let us work to ensure that members of the group have this independence."
"We nominated and selected them."
"I believe there are highly valuable personalities in the group, each specializing in a particular field."
"Let us leave the group to work independently without interference, as otherwise they cannot be independent."
"On the other hand, there is no doubt that the group will avail itself of as much scientific advice as possible, and it will certainly get in touch with foreign scientific institutes."
"Consultation will clearly take place in this respect, and I hope that the results of the work of this group will be useful in enlightening not only the work of the Commission but also that of the other institutions, including the European Parliament."
"But please, do not ask about the group's precise procedures, for it will get bogged down in this and will lose its necessary independence."
"The value of this group lies precisely in the fact, and I will repeat this because it is important, that it will be able to work completely independently, without being subjected to any internal influence on the part of the Commission, or external influence due to pressure from economic or other groups."
"Mr President, President Santer, you are full of praise for the new ethics advisory group in the way that a good father speaks well of his children, even if they have failed."
"Bravo!"
"The range of tasks accorded to the advisory group is impressive."
"It now covers communication technology, information technology and biotechology."
"But there has been no increase in the work to be done."
"Instead, top-class experts have had a muzzle put on them."
"It may look fine, but it remains a muzzle which prevents the advisory group using its teeth."
"Or do you really believe that twelve top-class scientists, men and women, who are used to being very thorough in their work, will be able to carry on working in the same way if the range of their assignments is extended ad infinitum?"
"I do not think we have muzzled this advisory group."
"I disagree."
"It is not a matter either of my being proud of the individuals we appointed."
"We believe we have selected those individuals in various organizations who have a reputation that is good, is scientifically justified and can certainly stand comparison with the various scientific institutes and bodies elsewhere."
"That much is clear from the work they have done."
"Although I am no scientist, recently over the past two to three years I have had to accept various scientific reports."
"Mind you, I must admit that even those scientific reports were not always drawn up in the way I, as a legal expert, would have imagined."
"So let us show some humility, even before great scientists."
"I believe that this group is doing its work."
"Allow it complete independence to get on with its work, allow the individuals to develop fully. I am convinced that then in retrospect you will not only applaud the appointment of this group, but will also appreciate properly the work it has done."
"In any case, I deny that we have in any way put a muzzle on this group!"
"Mr President, of course it has everything to do with the patenting directive."
"We will return to it at length when we discuss it."
"I have made a note of the fact that it will be an advisory and consultative body and that its remit will encompass more than biotechnology alone."
"But because we in this Parliament wish to see a strict and strong advisory group, I would like to argue for the remit to be not too broad, but in fact as specific as possible. If its remit is too broad, the force of the group will be lessened."
"I would be grateful if Mr Santer could give his response to this."
"Furthermore, science is never free from value judgments."
"Has any provision been made for the European Parliament's input into the composition of this advisory, consultative body?"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Your comments thus bring this question and answer session to a close."
"Convergence and the single currency"
"The next item on the agenda is the report (A4-0130/98) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the opinion of the European Parliament on the Convergence Report of the European Monetary Institute (C4-0201/98) and the document from the Commission entitled ""EURO 1999-25 March 1998 - Report on progress towards convergence and its recommendation with a view to the transition to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union' (COM(98)1999 - C4-0200/98)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in December 1991 it was agreed in the Maastricht Treaty to introduce a single European currency."
"In this Treaty the latest date for implementation was set at 1 January 1999."
"However, only those Member States with an already stable currency would be members of the inner circle of monetary union."
"To ensure that this would be the case, firm criteria for stability were anchored in the Treaty."
"Right from the beginning, these criteria were the subject of vigorous debate."
"To some they appeared too weak and ineffective to achieve sufficient stability. To others, however, they were much too harsh and restrictive."
"As events have unfolded in the years since Maastricht, the criteria have proved to have fulfilled their role superbly."
"There is a culture of stability developing in the whole European Union which is of fundamental significance to the success of the single currency."
"On the recommendation of the European Commission, 11 countries have qualified for entry into monetary union on 1 January 1999."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy we have looked at this recommendation in great depth."
"The report by the European Monetary Institute provided us with a very important basis for our work."
"I have aimed to produce as balanced a report as possible, one in which indisputable successes are acknowledged."
"However, in doing this, critical points were not neglected."
"The actual measurement for the stability of a currency is the rate of inflation."
"Even the most strongly stability-orientated central banks assume that inflation rates of less than 2 % actually mean currency stability."
"I believe that the public is not yet sufficiently aware that all 11 candidate countries have rates of inflation below 2 %, and therefore have stable currencies."
"In 1997, four of the candidate countries had an inflation rate of 1.9 %: these were Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain."
"Two countries had a rate of 1.5 %: Belgium and Germany."
"One country, Luxembourg, had an inflation rate of 1.4 %; another, France, had an inflation rate of 1.3 %; and three countries reached 1.2 %: Finland, Ireland and Austria."
"The average inflation rate for the 11 candidate countries in 1997 stood at 1.5 %."
"This shows that, with a view to monetary union in the entire European Union, a culture of monetary stability is already developing."
"Long-term interest rates show clearly that the markets are reckoning on the continuation of this trend."
"Interest rates in all 11 candidate countries are markedly below the reference value of 7.8 %."
"A year ago, the European Mortgage Federation still held that 10-year fixed mortgage rates would increase around the time of the introduction of the euro."
"Its assertion has not been borne out."
"This, too, indicates that the financial markets are counting on a stable start for the euro. Consequently the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy believes that, for its launch in January 1999, the stability of the euro is guaranteed."
"However, to ensure that the stability of the euro is sustainable, it is very important that the Member States provide a stable environment in terms of their budget deficits and levels of debt."
"We were particularly careful to check that these criteria had been met."
"In all the candidate countries, budget deficits are below 3 % of GDP, and budget plans and forecasts would suggest that a further reduction is likely."
"The level of public debt is not so easy to evaluate."
"This view is also held by the European Monetary Institute."
"Here we should assess whether the reference value of 60 % of GDP has been observed, or whether the total debt of a given country is moving towards this quickly enough."
"We must also ask the important question of whether debts are largely financed from within the country itself, or whether it is a matter of short or longer-term debt financing."
"It is worth noting here that in the two countries which are most heavily indebted there is also an above-average savings ratio and that debts are largely internally financed."
"This was important for our assessment."
"Furthermore, it is possible to distinguish an improvement in structural debt with the result that maturity periods are slowly but surely increasing."
"The report which I am presenting to you calls for firm undertakings from the governments of these countries to continue the process of consolidation."
"The proposal presented to Parliament also requires all participants in European monetary union to observe strictly the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has taken these facts into consideration and has come to the conclusion that the European Commission's positive assessment of the ability of all 11 countries to meet the debt criterion should be approved."
"One further formal criterion for participation in monetary union is the independence of each country's central bank."
"The legislative procedures required for this have not yet been completed in all the candidate countries."
"However, I am confident that the necessary measures will be in place by 1 July 1998 in time for the establishment of the European Central Bank."
"Unemployment trends may not be a formal criterion of the Maastricht Treaty. However, this is the greatest challenge facing the countries of the European Union today."
"For this reason we included questions about employment in our total assessment and we call for consistent implementation of the resolutions adopted at the Luxembourg Summit."
"After careful consideration of all these trends, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy agreed by a large majority that all 11 candidate countries should take their places at the starting line for monetary union on 1 January 1999."
"On 1 January 1999 the European Central Bank will take over sole responsibility for monetary policy."
"However given a single monetary policy, it will be all the more important to increase cooperation in economic policy."
"The budgetary policies of the Member States, the shaping of fiscal policy, the decisions of tariff partners on wages and earnings, labour market policies and decisions taken on certain social and ecological conditions will have ever greater effects on growth and employment in all the Member States of the Union."
"The European Parliament is the appropriate and democratically legitimate forum for a public discussion on the formulation of European economic policy."
"We feel, therefore, that it is our most important challenge to deepen the existing dialogue on these issues with the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the Economic and Finance Ministers of the Member States, and to develop a dialogue with the President of the European Central Bank."
"The European Parliament has already submitted our proposals on this issue."
"Now we await this weekend the Council's appointment of a candidate for the Presidency of the European Central Bank, and we hope that the candidate will be appointed for the full eight years of office, as stipulated in the Treaty."
"The introduction of the single currency is a milestone in recent European history."
"The resolution which we are debating today will prepare for the opinion of the European Parliament on this epoch-making decision, as stipulated in the Treaty."
"Appropriately for a decision of this significance, broad Parliamentary agreement must be reached, for only then can we make it clear that the directly elected European Parliament is equal to its responsibility for the future of the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the resolution in the name of Karl von Wogau represents a package and paragraphs 24 to 33 in that resolution form an integral part of that package."
"It is a mark of the good working relationship between our two committees, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, that the opinion from my committee has been incorporated as a whole into this resolution."
"That shows our joint concern and our concern as an institution to stress the importance of linking sound macroeconomic policies on the one hand with greater coordination of economic and structural policies on the other."
"Clearly that needs to be reflected in the overall management of monetary union."
"I see the recognition of the importance of growth and employment alongside stability in the resolutions of the Council, and the incorporation of an employment chapter and a new employment guideline procedure in the Treaty of Amsterdam, as good clear signals that the importance of this overall linkage has been recognized for the management of the Union's affairs as we move into monetary union."
"In our own opinion we call on the Member States to intensify coordination between economic policy and active labour market policies and to speed up the implementation of the provisions of the employment chapter and the initiatives agreed at the special employment summit in Luxembourg last November."
"In particular, we see the need to create a favourable framework for conditions for the strengthening of internal demand and investment as being of paramount importance."
"Monetary union cannot be achieved or sustained at the cost of continuing high levels of unemployment."
"This Union is founded on the principles of sustainable development and a high level of employment."
"The central importance of these principles is clearly recognized in this resolution and, as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am happy to recommend its acceptance to the House."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his report and for the work he has done in committee."
"The vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and also the negotiations we have been able to engage in ensure that when we vote on this report tomorrow we can get a commanding majority across the House."
"This is a very important time for the European Parliament."
"Over the next two or three days the European Parliament will be the only democratic body to be able to express opinions on the very important subject of economic and monetary union."
"On behalf of the Socialist group, I should say at the very beginning that we warmly welcome the recommendations by the European Monetary Institute and by the Commission that 11 countries should join the first wave of EMU on 1 January 1999."
"When you look at the convergence criteria set down in the Maastricht Treaty, it is a remarkable success story for the European Union."
"Many people who saw the convergence criteria within the Maastricht Treaty supported it because they believed it would be impossible for the countries of the European Union to achieve this level of convergence."
"The 15 Member States, and certainly the 11 that will join the single currency, have proved the doubters wrong and it is a testimony to what can be achieved in the European Union when the political will exists for us to work together as a Community."
"We now have a historically low level of inflation and we have price stability."
"That means that when the single currency is created we will have opportunities to address a wider agenda."
"My group wants to ensure that when the European Central Bank is established and when the 11 countries create the euro zone, without prejudice to that price stability, we begin, with some urgency, to address the wider issues within the European Union, not least the question of growth and unemployment."
"It is essential as a means of convincing the citizens of the European Union that this has been a worthwhile project, the project of consolidation in terms of our economies, that we can demonstrate that the EMU project is not just a monetary union but an economic union and a social union that will bring about reductions in long-term, structural and cyclical unemployment throughout the European Union."
"We also have legislation for a balanced budget - the Pact for Stability and Growth."
"I would say to Commissioner de Silguy that we achieved our balanced budget legislation with far less hype and excitement than the United States of America."
"That means that we will have sustainability in convergence."
"We will maintain price stability and we will maintain budget deficits within containable levels and I hope a balanced budget over the economic cycle."
"However, on behalf of my group I give a warning that in accepting the strict application of the Pact for Stability and Growth, we accept the pact that was first proposed during the Irish presidency."
"We will not accept new terms and conditions that emerge from any particular Member State either on Friday night when the Ecofin Council meets or at any subsequent point."
"We have a Pact for Stability and Growth and we will accept the strict application of that pact but no further measures to place the economies of the European Union in a straitjacket."
"That would be unacceptable."
"Finally, in relation to the presidency of the European Central Bank, the Socialist Group expects that this weekend a president for the European Central Bank and an executive board will be nominated."
"We expect that president will operate for eight years and no less."
"I give notice that if a candidate is presented to us next week who cannot give a commitment to serve a full eight-year term, then there will be a question mark over whether or not my group would wish to support that nomination."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr von Wogau, we all know that in the long term only a stable currency can guarantee prosperity and jobs."
"The European Parliament, therefore, must state unequivocally today that it takes seriously all the provisions and criteria set out in the Treaty and that these must be strictly and closely observed."
"The requirement in the von Wogau report that two Member States consolidate their total debt in accordance with the Treaty is, therefore, correct and necessary."
"Close observance of the Treaty should equally be one of the requirements for the appointment of the President of the Central Bank."
"If the Treaty states that the period of office is eight years, then this must be the case."
"To construe the requirements of the Treaty differently or to manipulate them is wrong and must be utterly rejected by the European Parliament."
"The undignified tug-of-war concerning the new President must also stop immediately."
"Europe needs confidence, Europe needs clarity, particularly in the sensitive questions about monetary policy."
"We know that these days the whole world is watching to see how Europe is dealing with these very issues."
"Strict observance of the Treaty is the best visiting card the euro could have."
"Not only has the euro earned an excellent start, but it has also earned the right to serve as a long-term global anchor of stability for everyone, first and foremost for Europeans."
"This will be possible if we adopt the von Wogau report today with as few amendments as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Karl von Wogau has known since 15 April that our group supported his excellent report and that consequently we approve of the Commission's recommendation which provides for the beginning of the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999 with 11 Member States."
"Thus, without dwelling on this extremely interesting report, and after offering well-deserved congratulations to President Jacques Santer, Commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy and all of the Commission, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, I would like to return to the issue of the absolute necessity for the European Parliament to be closely involved in the European Central Bank's process of democratic accountability."
"The euro is the culmination of efforts undertaken since the appointment, by Antoine Pinay on 21 July 1952, of Jean Monnet as the first President of the European Coal and Steel Community, the embryo of a Europe which has constantly improved over the years and whose culmination can be seen in the introduction of the single currency."
"But the end of this cycle is also a beginning."
"The single currency opens a new era in the monetary, economic and social policies of Europe."
"That is why our group has been requesting a new European economic order for a number of years, because with regard to overall economic and budgetary balances, nothing will be the same again."
"For this reason, I would like to highlight two extremely important facts regarding French policy towards the euro."
"Firstly, for twenty years there has been great continuity in this policy, which has always overshadowed partisan differences."
"Thus, whether by the adoption, in October 1986, of the Single European Act or by the plea for ratification of the Treaty on European Union, through the referendum in September 1992, the President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, has firmly committed France to the process of implementation of the single currency and, from my point of view, he will have given as much to Europe on this issue as many politicians who have now passed into posterity."
"This is why I am happy to propose that the House should make the French National Assembly's recommendation, made on 21 April of this year, its own. This recommendation was made at the request of Valéry Giscard-d'Estaing, himself a great European, for in June and July 1978 he played an essential role which is at the root of our reality today."
"He proposed, in fact, providing the Community authorities with a parliamentary committee on the euro, half of which would be composed of Members of the European Parliament and the other half composed of members of national parliaments, members of the finance committees in the member countries of the euro, appointed through proportional representation."
"This committee would give regular opinions on the directions of the European Central Bank's monetary policy and would thus successfully complement the triptych which has been behind the success of the construction of Europe. By this I mean: firstly, a high-level technical team responsible for implementing the common policy initiated by the Council of Ministers; secondly, the specific case of Ecofin in its improved form, known as ""Euro X' and whose composition is currently being formulated; and thirdly, parliamentary control which, since the creation of the ECSC, has always enabled those elected by Europe's nations to be involved in European policy."
"This measure is essential in order that parliamentary representatives of the eleven European nations participating in the euro, along with their representatives - in Strasbourg as in Brussels - elected via universal suffrage to defend the point of view of the people of Europe, may be deeply involved in this historic act of the introduction of the euro."
"Mr President, I must say that I cannot help being somewhat bemused by the suggestion from Mr Giansily about what Mr Giscard d'Estaing would like."
"I have heard precious little from him since having presided over the Liberal group he got political asylum in the EPP Group some years ago."
"I am glad to hear that he is alive and well."
"On the issue we are debating here today, I would like to say that we face a weekend that is immensely important for the Union."
"We stand on the threshold of realizing a shared strategic political goal in the form of launching EMU."
"I agree with Mr Donnelly that the convergence achieved is a powerful recognition of what political will and shared political will can bring about."
"As we stand on the threshold of launching this irreversible project, it is important to take stock of some of the unresolved issues."
"I want to state, in the clearest possible way, that the Liberal group not only notes with regret but with growing irritation the failure of the Council to resolve the controversy surrounding the nomination of a president for a future European Central Bank."
"The Treaty is clear."
"The terms of the appointment are clear."
"The length of the appointment at eight years is clear."
"To interfere with this for political reasons would be an appalling start to this major irreversible strategic project."
"We expect the Council to build confidence into this system and not undermine it."
"The way to demonstrate that is by making a clear strategic choice this weekend in line with the rule of law and the Treaty in terms of the length of appointment."
"What is not at stake is the question of national pride."
"What clearly is at stake is the successful launch of the currency."
"We have had an interesting debate in producing this report in committee."
"My own group has studied with great interest the work of the European Monetary Institute."
"It has signalled politically that we need to be concerned in the medium term about some of the pension systems and we share that concern politically."
"It has signalled that the need for budget consolidation has not ceased but rather that now, on the threshold of this new system, it has deepened."
"We in the Liberal group share that view."
"Politically we cannot avoid taking strategic responsibilities."
"I like the current shape of the von Wogau report."
"I salute the balance and leadership that Karl von Wogau has brought to it."
"When we come to vote on this report tomorrow, we will support the candidature of the 11 candidate states."
"We want to have a deal that has everyone on board but not at any price."
"Mr President, this weekend the ruling powers of the European Union are entering the final strait in the realization of the most important choice of the Maastricht Treaty, the introduction of the euro, the common currency, from 1 January 1999."
"Unaware of the dramatic, harmful repercussions - unemployment, poverty, social exclusion - on working people and on the broad strata of the population, the European Commission report and the report by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy alike celebrate and welcome a convergence that has been achieved in name only."
"They are aware, however, that the people and the workers are not celebrating, and that they are not even applauding."
"Perhaps from Monday the celebrations will be taken up by others - financial market speculators, international stock markets and those representing large financial institutions, who will see that, by sacrificing the people and their rights, they have gained a strong new currency with which to play their speculative games."
"Working people cannot but be worried, especially about the next steps."
"The spokespersons of financial institutions, encouraged by the visibly imminent inception of EMU, demand further hardening of fiscal policy, the immediate implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, and measures for the immediate adjustment of the labour market and the commodities market, in order to further strengthen the euro."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament is reserving this role for itself by adopting many of the proposals of the von Wogau report, a report which insists on placing stricter conditions on EMU than not only those of the European Commission but also those of the Treaty itself."
"We are all sure about one thing however: the people of Europe will not sit with their arms folded."
"Mr President, the vast majority of the Green group agree with the basic view of the Commission that 11 countries can now start the formulation of a common currency."
"This view excludes the idea that some kind of European nucleus is going to be created that will keep an important section of the Union on the outside."
"We have never supported that and we are happy to see that the euro is starting off on a very broad base."
"We do realize just how huge this project before is."
"We do not want to create illusions."
"There will certainly be problems, but we also recognize the opportunities that a single currency will provide."
"We want Europe to grow, socially and ecologically, and we would like to see the euro used to enhance monetary stability on a global scale."
"Mr von Wogau's report is a very positive one, particularly with regard to employment and the economy."
"It appears that the extreme neo-liberalist economic ideas have become somewhat mollified, and this brings with it the hope that we really can create a social Europe."
"It is vital to tighten economic cooperation, to act as a counterweight to convergence."
"There are, however, problems with the report."
"We cannot accept that new demands are suddenly to be made on countries adopting the euro."
"Nor do we think it wise or at all acceptable that some should be saying that the Stability and Growth Pact must be strictly applied."
"Either it is applied or it is not, but we should like to enquire as to what ""strictly applied' actually means."
"We do not think these are the sort of signals we should be sending out."
"Furthermore, we do not see that the trend in Belgian and Italian public debt is a matter for concern in itself, as the report suggests."
"We believe the trend is in the right direction and we trust that things will continue that way for Belgium and Italy."
"Another problem is that the report fails to mention the fact that economic development can happen on quite different time scales among the various regions of the Union."
"Shock waves occur from time to time that put Member States in difficult situations."
"For this reason, it is vital to install mechanisms whereby Union action can ease the burden on Member States in situations such as these."
"And finally, monetary policy can in no way be entirely separated from economic policy."
"We wish to stress that we need dialogue on these both, and the European Parliament has a very important role to play here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, provided with two reports on convergence, that of the EMI and that of the Commission, the main task of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was to give its opinion on the outline of the first circle of euro participants, and with regard to this central question, the committee's analysis is completely unambiguous."
"There is broad agreement in noting, firstly, the Member States' performance in relation to the convergence criteria and, secondly, in approving the immediate introduction of the euro in 11 countries which want it and which satisfy in general the criteria established by the Treaty on European Union."
"Mr von Wogau's report expresses clearly this broad agreement on the fundamentals and this is already a sufficient reason for us to approve it."
"The discussions which have consequently arisen have only dealt with incidental elements, which have perhaps been overemphasized due to the fact that agreement had been reached on the essentials."
"In any case, it seems vital to us that, by tomorrow, all efforts should have been made to ensure a clear position on the part of the House on what is, once again, the most fundamental issue: the introduction of the euro in 11 countries."
"Apart from this, on the occasion of this debate, we would like to note a few concerns."
"The first relates to what is called the democratic accountability of the European Central Bank, a subject which was mentioned during the debate on the report presented by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"We had the opportunity of saying that the European Parliament was the appropriate body to undertake this supervision, which should be exercised while respecting the principle of the Bank's independence."
"On the other hand, we are worried by the prospect of a multiplication of the places and control procedures which transpired on reading a number of the amendments to be submitted to us tomorrow and which state that the European Central Bank must be answerable to national parliaments."
"Such a levelling down of democratic accountability, apart from being impractical, would change that principle itself and threaten, in reality, the construction of a single and independent monetary policy."
"It is perfectly desirable that the national central banks should fulfill their duties of informing the national parliaments."
"But it seems essential to us that the democratic control of the European Central Bank should remain a matter for the European Parliament."
"Our second concern, which I will speak on only briefly since it has already been mentioned, is the issue of the presidency of that Central Bank."
"All we would say is that, in order to be a legitimate and effective instrument of a common European future, the European Central Bank must not appear to be something shared between only a few right from the very start."
"This is something we hope will be taken into consideration on Saturday."
"Other concerns are mentioned by Mr von Wogau in his report."
"It is a question of counterbalancing the single monetary policy with other instruments for economic action."
"In this respect, we hope that our Parliament and the Commission go a little further than the stage at which common reflection has arrived today and will envisage that, alongside the introduction of a common monetary policy, instruments for joint economic action other than purely monetary ones should, in the near future, be made available to the Union. These must involve taxation and budgetary measures."
"Mr President, in the whole of its history, France has never entered into a coalition where it found itself in this minority position."
"To claim that Europe is increasing France's power in the world is nothing but a miserable attempt to dress up as politics the outpourings of vanity and the need for personal glorification."
"This illegitimate and artificial construction which is known as the European Union is a planned attack against France, against the sovereignty of the people, the state structures and the society."
"But all is not lost, for sooner or later, when the revolutionary forces come to power, a referendum will give a voice back to the people to confirm the superiority of French law over the European treaties."
"And justice will be served, for we know the disregard for, or even scorn of, the treaties with which Eurocrats from all quarters claim that the convergence criteria are being satisfied."
"Little importance is therefore given to applying the criterion relating to overall debt to Belgium and Italy, or applying the criterion relating to annual budget deficit to Italy, which would have fallen from 6.7 % to 3 % in one year, with a growth rate of only 1.5 %."
"Unbelievable, is it not?"
"French people are still unaware of this plot, which is the biggest hold-up of the century, and the fact that the franc could disappear completely in 2002 has been completely hidden from them."
"This is an accident of the calendar, in the middle of a presidential election!"
"The French will thus sanction this President who, instead of raising France up, will belittle her, thus betraying the mission confided in him by universal suffrage."
"This will be true unless, in a sudden burst of dignity, he puts to a referendum the issue of the concrete introduction of a currency which, until that date, will essentially be only the unit of the external accounts of the State."
"Mr President, the possibility that monetary union will begin on 1 January 1999 is the realization of a dream: the people of Europe have said yes to more Community spirit and to a degree of cooperation which goes beyond that of previous structures."
"Following the promised strict examination of the prerequisites for participation in monetary union, and after checking the convergence reports from the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission, the European Parliament will quite rightly proceed on the basis of the report by Mr von Wogau to follow the recommendations of the European Commission in supporting a broad monetary union."
"With 11 Member States, this will be a broad union which will facilitate the smooth running of the internal market; 300 million people are bound together in a strong economic force with considerable economic output which will make up 20 % of global trade and 20 % of the global GNP."
"It is important that it is a broad union; this European Parliament has always been in favour of European Economic and Monetary Union starting with a large number of Member States."
"Mind you, on occasion we doubted that so many countries in European monetary union could achieve the stability required to join."
"Fortunately, the European concept of progress within the framework of European integration proved its worth again: we lay down conditions and set a timetable for meeting them."
"This concept has ensured that many Member States can meet the convergence criteria, and we can check this."
"This means that the European Parliament can tell Europeans today with optimism and on the basis of a reliable assessment that this European monetary union will be a stable community. The historically low inflation rates are not a nine-day wonder."
"Their development over a number of years can be demonstrated. The acceptance of this process by the markets can be seen in the low long-term interest rates; the exchange-rate stability emphasizes how seriously the Member States are taking their commitments and how great have been the political, economic, financial and monetary efforts in recent years to achieve a result culminating in this broad monetary union."
"This process was not fixed on 31 December 1997, but this date became the obvious one at the first convergence check, when we had to say that monetary union could not start on 1 January 1997."
"Even then we knew that Europe would pull together, that Europe knew it would be a challenge, that we are a small area of the world and that only a united effort, the combination of all our efforts will lead to success and render us fit for the coming century, for the coming millennium."
"So today we can confidently say that the European Community will be a stable community, and it is clear that processes which were started in the past are justified in the present."
"In particular, those Member States which had to make special efforts because their monetary policy was not as stable as others have undertaken to prove once again through medium-term financial planning that they take not only monetary but also fiscal convergence criteria seriously."
"In this way, the European monetary union is uniting us in a community of solidarity with a common destiny."
"The success we have achieved so far must be continued."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on the subject of the public debt: this is an important subject as its level is directly linked to the aim of ensuring that the euro area allows the financial markets to operate well, particularly with regard to the public component."
"This is essential to give the euro stability and credibility to ensure that the single currency has the positive effects we are all hoping for."
"The question should therefore be seen from two aspects: the fact that the debt should not interfere with the requirements of euro in terms of stability and credibility; and the fact that it allows the euro area to be characterized by great development."
"I therefore believe that we should assess the overall financial balance of the various countries and the prospects in question, which, in addition to the public debt, comprise the financial situation of the private sector, the trends in saving, the net external debt position and the recent performance of their financial markets."
"I therefore believe that the single currency does not require a static and purely accounting, almost Manichaean, vision of public finance, but the ability to combine fiscal rigour with prospects for development, which is still the basic reason for Economic and Monetary Union."
"Moreover, with high rates of growth and a trend towards reducing debt, the criteria for reducing the ratio between debt and GDP will soon be met."
"I wanted to illustrate these concepts because I have proposed three amendments, included in the von Wogau report, to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15."
"To conclude, Mr President, I wish to insist on the fact that the most important challenge we are faced with at the moment is that of proving that the fiscal rigour and stability that will characterize the euro area will form the basis for establishing a development policy which continues to be the main purpose of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those who have supported Mr von Wogau's report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I believe that, despite the narrow vote, this report deserves full consent on all the fundamental points."
"I support the formal confirmation that the European Parliament is preparing to give to the choice of the euro to 11 countries as from 1 January 1999, not only because this includes Italy but also because I believe in the political significance of this very broad participation in monetary union."
"Today's Herald Tribune maintains that, by taking this step, the European Union is now something of a federal state: perhaps it is exaggerating, but the political message is clear."
"The political impulse of monetary union should now spur on the governments of the states to faster structural reforms, to a reduction in public expenditure, to a lightening of the tax burden, to a reduction in the excessive rigidity of employment and to an effort to make services efficient, and here I am thinking of the banking system in particular."
"If these guidelines adopted by the Member States complement the objective of price and currency stability set by the Central Bank, companies will begin to invest again and so create jobs."
"Preparation for monetary union has benefited from the virtuous cycle of lower interest rates, which it began itself."
"I think that, even without definite orders, all countries, particularly those that have benefited most from the fall in rates, should continue to operate strictly."
"Finally, it seems to me that, while expressing satisfaction over this historic stage for Europe, we should not forget the need to strengthen democratic control in the balance of the European institutions, by reviving the Union's institutional reforms and policy."
"Mr President, I share in the joy expressed here that Economic and Monetary Union will now be created on an extremely large scale, but there are three issues I would like to mention that are necessary for EMU to be a success."
"First of all it is important that the EMU project brings with it a considerable increase in prosperity and employment."
"This is something the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its report."
"The guidelines from the Luxembourg Employment Summit cannot be allowed just to stew: they must be put into action."
"Secondly, it is essential that the role of Parliament as a democratic body that will monitor the actions of the Central Bank is given weight, and that we maintain that stance and ensure that the Central Bank justifies its decisions publicly."
"Thirdly, it is vital that EMU does not merely remain a tool for EU Member States alone but that it should extend to other nations including those who are at present negotiating membership."
"We have to be flexible on this point."
"But I would like to express my concern regarding the talks over what sort of new conditions are going to be imposed in respect of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Parliament is unfortunately out in the cold when it comes to these discussions, and we know that the Council will incorporate into their own recommendations the declaration stressing the serious problem of public debt, while we should be talking about growth and employment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the labour pains have started, the birth of the euro is unstoppable."
"This undeniable assertion should not blind us to the fact that the single currency is still an infant at risk. It urgently needs time if not in the incubator, then in the beneficial environment of a socio-ecological reorientation of European economic policy, instead of growing up into a neoliberal, monetarist monster of a supposedly unpolitical currency whose real and exclusive interests are those of the financial asset holders."
"This is a highly political decision."
"But we need to differentiate politically between two very different questions, that is, the plan to complete the European internal market using European monetary union, and the monetarist, neoliberal plan of the dictates of the financial markets."
"Fortunately, we can see that the first phase of the neoliberal monetarist project has largely begun to flag."
"The social struggles which in different Member States have produced new governments with new European agendas and sparked off a new debate in Europe had a lot to do with this."
"The reforming French government should be given special credit for having placed the debate on an entirely new basis."
"The original monetarist convergence criteria are actually being implemented with a great deal more sensitivity."
"Tietmeyer thinking has not been setting the tone in Europe."
"The idea of a core Europe has foundered in reality."
"That is the good news."
"It makes it possible for us to agree to launching the euro with 11 Member States."
"But we must counter all attempts to say what a wrong-headed German Deutsche Mark-nationalism wants to hear by playing an eleventh hour European poker game."
"Belgium and Italy should have no further requirements to meet, and the crazy proposal to reserve the windfall profits to reorganize debts and to forbid the French and others their employment policy must also be thrown out. To act otherwise would mean the euro was really being introduced on the backs of the unemployed, and that is something we cannot tolerate!"
"As we all know, some corrections must be made. We need an employment policy and effective coordination of macroeconomic policy."
"The European Central Bank must have a democratic foundation, and this will probably require the Treaty to be revised. We must speak plainly, Mr Friedrich."
"The Treaty must be applied, and no arguments!"
"And no qualifying amendments!"
"Pacta sunt servanda does not provide carte blanche for a late game of poker!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for this report, and at the same time express just one criticism and one recommendation to him and to those of you listening to me."
"I have allowed myself this small criticism, although I am aware of the difficulties of the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We have obviously reached an historic point in the building of Europe."
"We are faced with a transition which seemed impossible and inconceivable a few years ago, even a few months ago. We are faced with an effort made by many countries to try and catch this train, to try and give life and substance to this hope that Economic and Monetary Union might - necessarily for those who believe in us, for those who think that this is the plan for the future - lead to the political union of Europe."
"From this point of view, some countries have had to make greater efforts, while others, and here I am also talking about Mr von Wogau's country, have had to deal with a 3 % ceiling that suddenly became difficult, even for the countries that seemed to be the champions of monetary virtuosity."
"At a time when the European family is faced with this fact, and there will certainly be opportunities for insisting on this point, we should not spoil this opportunity, disregarding and maintaining criticisms, doubts and uncertainties that may give rise to difficulties, in respect of one country or another."
"I believe we should make an assessment - which we can do better than the European Council because we can give an opinion independently - for all countries, taking into consideration those countries that may not have acted in an entirely crystal-clear manner to arrive at the 3 %."
"However, this cannot be done in a document that rightly or wrongly has to give a feeling of strong acceptance and also of recognition of the efforts made by the Eleven, for two countries - and one in particular, it would seem - to be more fiscal-orientated than others: not because it is wrong to say this but because there may be other ways."
"Moreover, we want this Parliament to be the arbitrator, or at all events the privileged judge or interlocutor of the Central Bank on the policy to be implemented."
"To conclude, I believe that the recommendation, or the hope, that I give with my amendment, that will lead Parliament to ask the Council to appoint the President during this European Council, a President in office for eight years, is the recommendation to be made and the request we can make to the people we represent."
"Well, now that we have heard Mr Martinez' prayer - sorry, speech - it is time for Mr Metten to speak. He has the floor for three minutes."
"Mr President, today, as all the speakers have said, is a solemn occasion; somebody said it is almost religious."
"And the von Wogau report underlines that solemnity with elegance and simplicity."
"But above all, the von Wogau report highlights the fact that the euro is a leap forward, a big bang, in this process of continental political integration which began 40 years ago."
"The von Wogau report thus invites us to preserve the culture of stability, to engage in institutional dialogue - centred on this Parliament -, to coordinate economic policies, to reduce fiscal differences and - more importantly - to do whatever may be necessary to preserve the welfare state, creating jobs and maintaining the social security benefits which are the trademark of the European social model."
"But, Mr President, if I believe and hope in religious terms, I also want to say - and I am sure you will let me make a special comment here, since I am the first Spaniard to speak - that for our country, for my country, today is an extraordinarily important moment."
"Historically, when Spain stopped looking towards Europe, she turned in upon herself and became selfabsorbed, and a long process of civil conflicts began, creating the image of the two Spains in the eyes of the world."
"When Spain once more looked towards Europe - following the teachings of Ortega, among others -, we were able to achieve a peaceful transition, a national reconciliation, culminating in our incorporation into a democratic Europe."
"Less than two years ago nobody expected to see Spain in this small family of the single currency, but today our country has made the religious effort to join, because if you believe, you can do anything."
"I am glad about that and I will conclude by saying that as a Spaniard I believe in what we are doing and I hope and I pray. And as a Christian by religion, I know just as much as Mr Martinez."
"Mr President, only eight or nine years ago, anyone thinking of a week like this would have been taken for a day-dreamer."
"Today we have managed to guide the ship carrying all the essential products for a single currency into port: trust, stability, common commitment and a collective logic that goes beyond the individual."
"As on all ships that have made a long voyage, a few germs have got on board, such as uncertainty and scepticism, which we are overcoming with the great medicine of hope."
"To paraphrase slightly the words of Mr von Wogau, whom we thank for all his work, who states in his report, ""For the first time since the Roman Empire, Europeans from the Irish Sea...' - and today Ireland was fortunate enough to be congratulated in this Parliament for the peace achieved - ""...to the Mediterranean will be using the same currency' , to my Mediterranean. The praise for all this, although much remains to be done, does not just belong to us, but belongs in particular to those who have believed in us and who have worked from the outset."
"Like the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our group will support Mr von Wogau's report, recognizing in the work of the chairman of the committee the sum total of the work carried out over all these years by all the European institutions but also, and above all, by thousands of unknown people in our daily lives."
"The summary of Commissioner de Silguy's thoughts, whom we thank for his hard work and his patience, is as follows: we have made the euro and now we have to make Europe."
"We obviously agree with him, but we also have to take all possible measures to combat the major problems faced by the Community; we have to make the citizens understand that Europe today is about the single currency but tomorrow it will be about political union."
"Finally, we have to set up the Bureau of the European Central Bank, in the most logical and complete form possible, to ensure that all the necessary preconditions for granting the ECB total and independent supremacy on economic policy as from 10 January 1999 are created as soon as possible."
"Today we have achieved the single currency. This is a lot, a great deal, but it is not everything."
"European citizens are now expecting great and urgent things from us."
"They are asking us to fight to achieve these victories we are winning in the economic field, as well as in the social field, so as to help solve the major everyday problems."
"But today, for now, we can calmly quote what Gandhi said: ""One step at a time is enough for me' ."
"Mr President, the von Wogau report examines the capacity of the Member States to fulfil the various criteria."
"However, there is one criteria which is not mentioned, but which should be the most important, the main reason why my homeland, Sweden, is not joining EMU, that is, democratic support."
"The citizens' scepticism towards EMU should make every politician and every member of parliament, finance minister and head of government wonder what they are in the process of doing."
"The report says that EMU is perhaps the biggest step since the signing of the Treaty of Rome."
"It is a step which is being taken without the support of the citizens."
"I do not think this is a test of political will, but rather a simple demonstration of power."
"A change in the Member States as radical as that entailed by EMU should only be possible if there is strong support from the citizens."
"In Germany at least 60 % of the population is opposed to the euro and EMU."
"In Sweden the percentage is even higher than in Germany."
"The citizens are afraid that the centralization of economic and political decision-making will lead to a policy with increased unemployment and increased difficulty in developing a fair, publicly-financed welfare system."
"The report also says we should not forget the political significance of EMU and that it is the first time since the Roman Empire that Europeans from the Irish Sea to the Aegean will use the same currency."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, you cannot have forgotten what happened to the Roman Empire, its rise and fall?"
"EMU is a very risky political prestige project which could create great tensions in Europe."
"The fact that 11 countries appear to be joining EMU is said to guarantee that there will not be a division of the Union, but will we not get that in any case?"
"What will happen with the enlargement towards the east?"
"Does the single currency not create new tensions, just when negotiations have started?"
"Dreams of the Roman Empire or the 'EU dollar' which will make Europe big and strong are being placed above democracy, the will of the people, the demand for jobs, welfare and a good environment."
"That is why, amongst others, we Greens are going to vote against EMU."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports from the Commission and the European Monetary Institute on the transition to the single currency are prisoners of the financial criteria defined by the Maastricht Treaty and for this reason they present a completely superficial analysis on convergence between European countries."
"We need to examine more closely the underlying national realities in order to distinguish, over and above financial convergence criteria, three great criteria for divergence."
"Firstly, there is the divergence in the economic needs of the different countries. Levels of unemployment, labour costs, levels of tax and social security deductions, social and tax structures and the phases of economic cycles all differ greatly from one country to the next."
"At the beginning of next year, for example, the future Central Bank is to apply the same universal interest rate to economies which are about to overheat and to others which are in a state of slow growth."
"This seem completely impossible to us."
"Secondly, there is the divergence of political conceptions."
"On the eve of the launch of the single currency, essential questions regarding the management of the future monetary union have still not been resolved, such as those regarding its democratic supervision."
"Some want very little control, as stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty, under the pretext of the independence and even the sovereignty of the Central Bank, according to the extraordinary statement in the von Wogau report."
"Others want to put in place a form of control which was not anticipated in the Treaty, at the level of the European Parliament, others still would like that control to be carried out by national parliaments."
"Which view will prevail?"
"We are jumping into monetary unification with our eyes closed."
"Finally, and above all, there is the divergence of public opinion."
"The single currency project does not enjoy massive consensus within Europe, something which would be absolutely essential in order for it to succeed."
"Even in some crucial countries, public opinion is clearly hostile."
"That is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations is calling on the Council to take a global view of the situation and not to be limited by financial criteria, as stipulated in Article 109j of the Treaty."
"We call on the Council to realize that today monetary unification is not possible in an area such as Europe, where a number of different peoples co-exist, without running major risks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Karl von Wogau's report comes within the perspective of a forced march towards the euro which has been imposed on the people of Europe."
"You congratulate yourselves on the success of convergence, but you have to consider at what cost, in terms of unemployment, these results have been achieved."
"Monetary union between countries disparate in terms of productivity will cause an increase in unemployment in the less productive countries and will oblige the other countries to pay considerable sums of financial solidarity, thus causing an increase in fiscal pressures."
"This model has already been historically observed in Germany: unemployment in the East and an increase in taxes in the West in order to subsidize the East: that was the result of German monetary unification."
"In its report of 25 March 1998, the Commission was forced to recognize this."
"I quote: ""the exceptional costs linked to German monetary reunification continue to be widely felt' ."
"Thus, monetary reunification was desired, for political reasons which I will not judge, in the knowledge that it was having perverse effects on the economy."
"Similarly, in Europe, the euro is the result of a political desire to remove anything that is national, without consulting the people in a referendum, and regardless of the economic cost of the move."
"This will create a political situation which will be difficult to handle."
"When French citizens understand that the power to create unemployment in their country will be situated in Frankfurt, it will be detrimental to the cohesion of our peoples."
"What is more, we are playing with democracy."
"Our colleague's report says clearly that monetary sovereignty - he uses the word sovereignty - will reside in Frankfurt."
"Fiscal and budgetary sovereignty will be curbed by the Stability Pact put in place elsewhere."
"Unemployment and technocratic power, that is what this gives us."
"I doubt that people will accept such a policy."
"You are proclaiming prosperity and democracy, but you are going to exacerbate the injustice of unemployment and maintain the fiction of a democracy, which increasingly hides the real power of stateless technocrats."
"The great Greek orator, Demosthenes, once said that no unjust and untruthful power can last for long."
"This is what I foresee for the current governments, who want to force the hand of the peoples of Europe by taking their national sovereignty away from them."
"Mr President, I think we are in a good condition to embark on this great adventure which the people of Europe have been waiting for."
"However, there remains much work ahead of us."
"This is the task that we must commence today."
"We are in a good condition, firstly, because we are introducing the euro in 11 countries."
"Who would have thought such a thing possible a few years ago?"
"It could have been more countries, if some had not requested the possibility of an opt-out clause, or if others had not put themselves in a situation which made it impossible for them to participate."
"My second observation is this: I note that, in the end, these famous criteria have been interpreted as they should be and, as the von Wogau report quite rightly states, not in a strictly quantifiable manner but in trends, although I am a little surprised that some of them have, on occasions, been able to change in the hierarchy of values."
"My third observation is that we have modified the direction of our economic policy."
"It is true that everyone recognizes today that monetary policy has an effect on the real economy and that the success of the third phase of Economic and monetary union assumes economic and social cohesion and respect for the objectives set out in Article 2 of the Treaty."
"This is undoubtedly where the building site of tomorrow commences."
"I would like to insist on two points."
"The first is harmonization in the fiscal, social and environmental domains."
"If we want this harmonization to be an upwards one, there must be a will for it, guided by political power."
"If not, it will take place via the market and we know that it will be a downwards harmonization."
"Without threatening the capacity of Member States to pursue budgetary policies for labour and employment which correspond to the democratic options chosen by their citizens, such a harmonization must be initiated."
"In this respect, I am naturally thinking of the policy initiated in my country regarding a reduction in working hours."
"But it is also and above all the coordination of economic policies that is important so that, in the future, we may have greater growth in Europe, greater domestic demand, investment and jobs."
"For this, and I come to my fourth observation, Mr von Wogau's report rightly states that the procedures and tools which we now have available must be improved and strengthened."
"A first stage has already been initiated with the establishment of the euro Council, the forerunner to an economic government, but this is still in the future."
"There is then, of course, the role of our Parliament."
"I am one of those who thinks that a federal authority - as the Central Bank will be - and a European policy - as monetary policy will be - can only effectively be controlled by a European authority."
"If those who want to establish other forms of control wish to cause the death of this authority, the European Parliament, then they should say so."
"Under certain conditions, which will have to be developed, there are parallel forms."
"It is here that democratic responsibility regarding Economic and Monetary Union must be exercised."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before it is even achieved, monetary union has already produced two spectacular results."
"It has forced Member States to put their public finances in order."
"This was not so easy to begin with."
"It has also protected the European Monetary System from the financial disturbances that have affected the countries of the Far East."
"It is the first time that a crisis on such a scale has not resulted in an attack on weak currencies such as the pound or the French or Belgian franc, or in a rise in the Deutsche Mark, a currency of refuge on such occasions."
"Besides the numerous arguments which are regularly repeated in favour of the euro, there is one that is rarely mentioned, and I have not yet heard it today. It is the recovery of the use of the monetary instrument which is now completely frozen due to the need to maintain stability of intra-Community exchange rates under the punctilious supervision of the markets."
"The impact of these rates currently affects half of Europe's GDP."
"After monetary union, it will only affect 10 %."
"That which has been the unique privilege of the United States will also become that of the Europeans, if they want it."
"The best way of facing up to the challenge of globalization is to give the political powers the means to escape the tyranny of the markets."
"That the communists and the National Front find themselves united today in a nostalgia which turns its back on the state of the world should not surprise us."
"Our gifted public entertainer, the political satirist Martinez, deserved the line given to him and which I draw on now, from an editorial by Claude Humbert, ""the old enemy accomplices now find themselves amongst the nationalist odds and ends under the overturned effigies of Marx and Déroulède."
"Red and white, it is the time for cherries and the old France of borders and the bugle' ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are asked to give our opinions on, irrespective of the aspect of greater or lesser rigour in respect of one Member State or another, involves the approval of the forthcoming intergovernmental decision on the entry into force of Economic and Monetary Union."
"The electorate I represent have shown that they are against this Europe that is about to be born and believe that is a real swindle for manufacturing in Padania."
"At the time, the establishment of convergence criteria gave rise to a race to balance the books, which was often more apparent than real within the individual states."
"Italy, in particular, managed to make its fairly contrived accounts credible, thanks to a marked growth in tax revenue, brought about by increasing the tax burden to the detriment of manufacturing industries."
"Staying in Europe will now require further belt-tightening and this will weaken the competitiveness of the system even further."
"Our competitors, both outside and within the European Union, are rubbing their hands at the thought that businessmen in Padania will be forced to fight in an increasingly competitive market, with the burden of the welfare state, the Italian national political class and the South on their shoulders."
"Obviously, in Padania, that is within a self-confident community, tensions will arise with unforeseeable consequences and it is no secret that Padania has already started on an institutional path that will lead it to independence."
"I therefore believe that these peoples, who no-one consulted on this monetary union, will soon make the weight of their own opinion felt."
"Mr President, we are about to take an historic step in the true sense of the word, that clearly separates the ""before' from the ""after' ."
"It is also a step that is beset by problems, not those that a certain type of bigotry sees in the debt of countries that have for several years undertaken a credible, irreversible financial recovery with no miracles - Italy achieved its miracle when, from being a poor, backward country, it became the fifth economic power in the world -, but rather the problems of a political vacuum between the transfer of monetary supremacy and the strict conservation of national fiscal and political supremacy. We will have to fill this vacuum."
"Following the adoption of a single currency, nothing in Europe will be the same again."
"Today we can measure the dramatic rift that would open in the Union between core countries, which virtually coincide with the Deutsche Mark area, and countries driven back into an anxious and unstable periphery."
"Now they all have to move along the lines of development indicated by monetary union: the consolidation of stability, the guarantee of democratic responsibility taken by the European Central Bank, the construction of a Union macroeconomic policy, the democratic strengthening of its political institutions."
"One eminent American economist, known for his mistaken predictions, has seen in the future of the euro the threat of civil war between the European countries."
"While preparing to vote for the euro, we see a future of solidarity between the nations of Europe and a more reasonable balance in relation to the domination of the dollar."
"I congratulate Herr von Wogau on the efforts he has made in this report."
"British Members of the Group of the European People's Party greatly admire his chairmanship of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee."
"It is with regret, therefore, that we will abstain on his report."
"We do so in the first instance because the United Kingdom is not going to be a founder member of the monetary union. That is a fact, as Members know, which I personally very deeply regret."
"But I believe it right to demonstrate that the hope of the British Government that it is possible to be both at the heart of European affairs and evade the resolution of British Membership of EMU is a dangerous illusion."
"We also wish to demonstrate that while we understand the desire in this Parliament to achieve the broadest possible political support for this report, that has been achieved at the cost of denying the serious future difficulties that participating governments will have in running their public finances in line with the stability pact."
"Let there be no doubt, British Members of the Group of the European People's Party want monetary union to succeed."
"I personally have devoted a large part of my time in this Parliament to the creation of the euro."
"It is from this standpoint that we support the efforts of Finance Minister Waigel in wishing further undertakings from all Member Governments to run balanced budgets over the cycle and reducing historic debt to 60 % of GDP."
"I wish the Parliament had supported Mr Waigel more."
"It is a pity that there are those in the Socialist Group and elsewhere who have attacked the absolute independence of the Central Bank which was the cornerstone of the Maastricht Treaty but who are reluctant to enhance our overview of Member States' budgetary arrangements."
"This is a particular pity since it would open up the possibility of serious cooperation between the European Parliament and national Parliaments."
"Therein lies the best chance of correcting the democratic deficit."
"I myself am absolutely convinced that the euro of eleven will succeed in the long run."
"That success may be a rougher ride in the markets because we have chosen softer words today than we should have done."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place at the end of a process which has engaged the greater part of the European Union's energies throughout this whole decade. The road has been long."
"It began with the signing of the Treaty on European Union, or even earlier, with the preparatory work of the Delors Committee. The efforts on the part of the Union's institutions and Member States, in order to create the right conditions for entry into the third stage of monetary union, have been considerable."
"Today we are witnessing the moment when success will be announced."
"Eleven Member States, comprising about 300 million people, will participate in the single currency from 1 January next year."
"Thus a broad and balanced monetary union is born, which will allow a solid and stable single currency to be launched, to be joined over the next few years by the other four Member States. That is a complete certainty."
"At the moment, votes are being taken and resolutions passed in the parliaments of the various Member States, and tomorrow we will vote on this report here in the European Parliament, as a sort of prologue to the solemn vote on 2 May."
"As regards the present vote, I want to stress the following aspects."
"Firstly, this vote, like the one on Saturday, has the value of taking place in the only institution of the Union whose legitimacy arises directly out of universal suffrage."
"Secondly, as a consequence of what I just said, this vote will allow people to see which of the European political forces support this momentous step in the building of Europe."
"As a Socialist, I want to say that I am glad our group is voting positively. And as a Spanish Socialist, I would like to add how pleased I am with the Socialist Party's contribution to Spain's incorporation into the third stage of union, first in government and then in opposition."
"Thirdly, I want to emphasize that the resolution we are voting on today is a balanced text, which sums up the fundamental reasons behind Parliament's support for the introduction of the single currency."
"I will conclude now, Mr President."
"I started my speech talking about the end of a process."
"I want to end by saying that we are also at the start of a new epoch, in which the role of this Parliament - as the monetary authority's partner for dialogue, and the guarantor of control over its performance - will undoubtedly be strengthened."
"Mr President, the single currency has had many critics, not least in my own country."
"Some have said that it is an impossible project which can never be carried out."
"Others have said that only a few countries are going to be in at the start."
"These critics have been proved wrong."
"In fact, 11 countries are going to be in at the start."
"Everything now points to this being a successful project."
"My own country, Sweden, is not going to join from the beginning, which I personally regret."
"However, that does not mean that we are not going to work actively to ensure that this is a successful project."
"Nor does it mean that my country is not going to join in the future."
"I myself am going to work actively for that."
"In addition, if you participated in the first two stages of EMU, that was important too."
"When Sweden became a member of the European Union just under three years ago, we had a large budget deficit and high interest rates."
"Today we have a balanced budget, low interest rates and a stable economy."
"That gives us opportunities for the future."
"It was therefore important to have participated in the first two stages."
"However, I would like to say that we need more than EMU."
"The fight against unemployment also needs to be coordinated."
"In that respect the Amsterdam Treaty and the Luxembourg Summit are a success."
"I can also reveal to you that the Swedish parliament has just voted for the Amsterdam Treaty with 226 votes in favour and 40 against."
"But even that is not enough."
"We need greater coordination of macroeconomic policies, greater coordination of tax policies and more investment in infrastructure."
"The fact is that if we are to make EMU and other aspects of economic policy a project of the people, we must see results."
"So far, the people have not seen these results."
"Finally, I think the Bank should be independent, but at the same time be under democratic supervision."
"The natural place for this democratic control is the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr von Wogau, ladies and gentlemen, as I was travelling from Strasbourg to Austria following the last sitting in Strasbourg, I was delighted to note that the frontier barrier between Germany and Austria had been removed."
"This time, when I return from Brussels to Austria, there will be a fixed exchange rate between the Deutsche Mark, the schilling and the Belgian franc, and in fact throughout all the 11 states."
"This brings great immediate advantages for our companies."
"The risks of the exchange rate are removed, and we can make more precise calculations more easily; we will be able to enjoy these advantages next week."
"On January 1, we will have a single currency."
"That too will bring with it huge advantages, not only for company balance sheets, but also in the comparability of the various deals on offer. As a result, Europe will become more competitive."
"Who would have thought back at the beginning, when discussions about the euro started, that 11 countries would be involved right from the start?"
"The more pessimistic among us thought there would be 6 or 7 countries."
"Today there are 11, and I forecast that by 2002, there will be 15!"
"It is my belief that countries will not be able to afford to stay outside, and we must think about how we can help those countries who are willing to join. We have many tasks ahead of us, and I am proud that Europe is able to cope with them!"
"Mr President, on entering Brussels at the moment, you can see a large poster with the slogan, ""Let us be concrete and positive' , with regard to a Belgian political party."
"I like this slogan because it is reasonable and moderate."
"It is, I think, the spirit that we should have with regard to monetary union, in the face of the nationalist demagogy and the gloom-mongering of the extreme Left who rant and rave against monetary union."
"I, too, would like to take up this slogan."
"Yes, let us be positive with regard to monetary union."
"As you know, the Socialists voted against Mr von Wogau's report in committee, not because of the work of the rapporteur, which was excellent, but because of certain amendments which were voted for in committee and which have weighed the issue down."
"I do not think that the European Parliament should be more orthodox than the most orthodox of central bank presidents."
"The Stability and Growth Pact must be respected; we add ""rigorously' to this in our report."
"I could propose any number of adverbs to you: formally, absolutely, clearly, sincerely, exactly, and so on."
"These are just differences in style, nuances which add nothing."
"The socialists want to be positive and want to vote for Mr von Wogau's report, on condition that a serious and reasonable approach with regard to respect for stability is approved."
"I think this has finally been achieved."
"We also want to be concrete."
"On a financial and monetary level, the current situation is full of potential."
"This is due to the movement towards the euro. The euro has already created, and will create, new potential to respond to the hazards of the economic situation and to create jobs."
"It will also deepen political union and curb warlike nationalism."
"Mr President, let us therefore have a firm desire to put this potential to good use."
"Let us be positive and concrete in the face of the enormous opportunities with which the euro presents us."
"May I rebut John Stevens' suggestion that the Socialist Group is soft on the independence of the ECB."
"We are not but we are equally passionate on ensuring that bank's democratic accountability."
"On the brink of historic decisions for Europe and the introduction of the euro, we should step back and contemplate and celebrate the remarkable achievement of eleven Member States qualifying for EMU."
"The benign scenario of low inflation and low interest rates is a resounding tribute to the countries entering EMU."
"Sometimes commentators do not see the wood for the trees - two countries in particular have been singled out for fevered attention on the sole question of the viability of their public debt to GDP ratios."
"A strict reading of the Maastricht Treaty does permit them to qualify, as verified by the Commission, EMI and by the German Federal Court, an August body indebted to no one."
"Moreover, we have the back-stop of the Stability and Growth Pact which will ensure sustainability of this fiscal rectitude and the promise of Belgium and Italy themselves to continue to consolidate their public debt ratios."
"Now is the time for us to raise our heads from the minutiae of the convergence criteria."
"Let us gaze on the sunlit uplands of the euro which beckon ever more strongly."
"The golden prize which is ours for the taking is a dynamic single European market, quickened by the introduction of the single currency."
"It is that market, the world's biggest market, which will offer jobs and prosperity for our people and let us never forget we have the market to create the currency for the benefit of the people of Europe and not the other way around."
"In the not too distant future, when Britain is emerged from the slough of despond of the Thatcher and Major years, the United Kingdom too will join the long march of Everyman to the city on the hill."
"We, too, will apply a single currency in a single market in our singular Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his competent, if brief, extract."
"I wish to move the European Economic and Monetary Union in a direction which is more socially just."
"A common single currency will strengthen our position in the world, economically and politically."
"The euro will become a major currency, but from a major currency like this I urge that we get the opposite of what we did from currency speculation and from certain banks."
"Unemployment is our greatest problem, as the report states, and the European Central Bank simply cannot ignore it."
"The Bank will be independent, and no one will be able to dismiss its management, no matter what mistakes it makes."
"No organization with so much power can be exempt from responsibility."
"We in Parliament have fortunately taken a decision to get the ECB to accept democratic responsibility and agree to open negotiations."
"It is absolutely vital that common European solutions are applied to any country in economic difficulties."
"Hopefully, it will aid the struggle for a worldwide economy based on social fairness."
"The single currency of democratic countries will make demands on democracy."
"It is not enough for markets to have confidence in the euro: our nations must share that confidence, and that will come about by seeing to the needs of our citizens."
"The tone of Mr von Wogau's report is very monetarist."
"He takes a harder and less flexible line than many Member States do."
"Mr von Wogau does, however, deserve to be praised for the optimism he expresses in his report regarding employment."
"That is precisely why an inflexible position on following the Stability and Growth Pact to the letter seems gratuitous in a report that deals with the introduction of a common currency."
"Mr President, as we have seen, the decisions which will be made in Brussels in the next few days will be observed by many of us with excitement, and by some with enthusiasm."
"However, a great number of citizens of the union are sceptical and concerned about the introduction of the euro."
"The fact that in figures for total debt, only three candidate countries were under 60 % and two were over 120 % is in fact deeply worrying."
"This makes it all the more important to stress, as does Mr von Wogau's report, that the strict observance of the Stability and Growth Pact by all participants in the European currency union is imperative."
"The European Parliament must call for a guarantee that the euro will be as stable as the most stable of those currencies which it will replace."
"I would like to use the brief minute I have at my disposal to express in all objectivity my personal congratulations to Mr von Wogau on his well-balanced report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of an historic European Council, given that the Heads of State or Government are going to take a decision on the launch of Economic and Monetary Union, Mr von Wogau's excellent report enables us to measure the distance covered."
"For once we can be delighted with this, and I am pleased with the extremely favourable response that the Commission's recommendation for the 11 Member States has received."
"Indeed, throughout this long debate, in which some 40 of you have spoken, I have heard no criticism of the quality of the Commission's work, nor of the actual content of its proposals, even if the debate on economic policy is a wide and open one, as is normal in a democracy."
"I agree with Mr Giansily, Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mr Rübig, Mr Harrison and Mrs Berès, who have put the debate into perspective, an historic perspective I believe, since in effect it concerns the culmination of the great achievement which Europe has now been working towards for more than 40 years."
"It gives me great satisfaction to see what work has been accomplished."
"Who could have imagined such an achievement even a year ago, perhaps even in this distinguished House itself?"
"This is not the result of chance, or even of the Member States' remarkable efforts regarding convergence. This success is the result of a common political will to respect the conditions and the timetable laid out in the Treaty on European Union."
"On this subject, and since the debate has been a general one, allow me to reflect for a few moments on the method which has led us to this success and which is worthy of some consideration, before I make a few comments and provide some information on the no less important task ahead of us."
"Indeed, we should not now be concentrating on 2 May, but on what lies ahead after that date."
"The euro must not be a problem child, but tomorrow it will be a new-born baby, and we must take responsibility for its harmonious and balanced development."
"First of all, the arrival of the euro is the success of a method based firstly on political will."
"Without this political will, such a venture could never have succeeded."
"It has been the essential guarantee of an achievement unique in European history."
"Every European Council since 1995 has, in spite of everything, expressed this unshakeable will on the part of the Heads of State or Government."
"They have been able to use the political and practical consequences for each of them in order to proceed, for example, - and this is important - towards improving their public finances, and to reducing their deficits to less than 3 %."
"I believe it is this very political will which enables me to inform you today that the statutes of the national central banks, mentioned less than a month ago in the convergence report as still not fully in conformity, are so today."
"The four countries in question, Austria, Spain, Luxembourg and France, have completed or, in the case of France, should complete this evening, the parliamentary legislative procedures enabling compatibility of all of the central banks' statutes."
"With regard to the European Central Bank, since many of you have mentioned this, and in order to dispel any misunderstanding, I would like to say that it is the Commission's position that the Treaty should be strictly enforced."
"The Council cannot cut a mandate in two, they must appoint a President for the length of the mandate provided for in the Treaty."
"Nevertheless, the less said for the moment regarding the problem of the European Central Bank, the better."
"Let us leave it to the Heads of State or Government to do their job since it is they who must decide."
"Mr Friedrich earlier said on this subject, ""Europe needs confidence' ."
"Well, I believe that this will come naturally in the meeting, when the Heads of State or Government unanimously appoint the President of the Central Bank and members of the Executive Board."
"The second important factor in the method is convergence."
"Since you know the figures as well as I do, I will give only one example: improvements in public deficits."
"Let me nevertheless remind you that in 1993, the average public deficit recommended for the 11 countries was 5.5 %. This was reduced to 2.5 % in 1997."
"I really have to say, especially to those Members situated on the extreme right of this House, that these figures have not been fiddled. They have been verified, they are correct."
"As a representative of the Commission, I cannot accept the slightest suspicion regarding the quality of work that has been carried out, particularly with regard to statistics and with regard to the information which has been made available to you to enable you to make a judgement."
"This result, which is all the more impressive given the unfavourable economic climate, thus means that improvements in public finances have essentially been achieved through an effective reduction in expenditure: given an overall reduction of 3.7 % for the 15 countries, the reduction in expenditure has been 2.8 %."
"You can thus see that it is largely a reduction in expenditure which has enabled the reduction in public deficit to be achieved, rather than the economic climate or one-off measures which have become long term measures, or an increase in revenue."
"It is this which leads us to say that the improvements in public finances are lasting ones, and the markets have recognized the lasting nature of convergence."
"I have heard little mention of the durability of convergence during the debate, and this seems to me to be an essential factor in the transition to the single currency."
"The markets have noted it, since interest rates are today at an historically low level."
"This permits me to say that from now on there exists a true culture of stability in Europe which now needs to be consolidated, meaning that the commitments undertaken, in particular in Amsterdam, must now be implemented without delay, and without taking on new commitments, I can assure you, Mr Donnelly."
"The third element of the method is a systematic preparation for the introduction of the euro."
"I would, however, like to remind you, as we have worked closely together for three and a half years now, of the wonderful work that we have accomplished together with regard to technical legal regulations; meticulous work, essential for the proper functioning of Economic and Monetary Union."
"Indeed, to ensure a good currency from the start, a good legal framework was required, a good regulatory framework."
"This was an essential factor in its credibility and to do this we needed to ensure, with necessary prior warning, the visibility and readability which companies needed in order to prepare themselves in good time."
"This is now an established fact, and the House contributed greatly to this."
"Within this preparatory work I must also mention the remarkable work carried out by the European Monetary Institute, which will become a reality in a few days from now as a result of the decisions to be taken by the European Central Bank."
"Finally, the fourth element of the method, and I am surprised to have heard so little about this this evening, is the mobilization of the life blood of Europe."
"Would we have achieved such a mobilization without the initiative taken - primarily by this House - to develop informative action within all the Member States as from 1996, without further delay?"
"Today, if the European, national, regional and local public administrations, banks, companies and social partners are mobilized, it is largely due to this initiative which was jointly undertaken by Parliament and the Commission."
"I say all of this because I believe that we should be proud of ourselves."
"And why not, for once?"
"The achievement of the euro has been a model of interinstitutional cooperation."
"This must continue as soon as the European Council has come to an end, in order to ensure the democratic accountability which many of you mentioned earlier, and to bring about growth and employment as effectively as possible, for that is indeed the objective of EMU, but also of the Union, on the eve of the birth of the euro."
"It is on this second point that I would now like to concentrate a little, to share with you my thoughts on what I think our plan of action, our agenda, must be for the coming months."
"Firstly, there is the continuation of budgetary improvements."
"The return to a balance in public finances in the medium term is the only way to free up savings for job-creating investment and to find budgetary leeway once again."
"That is why this is the central objective of the Stability and Growth Pact, although you should be aware that, in relation to the current level of deficit in the European Union as a whole - 2.5 % -, to find a balance once again means freeing up nearly 150 billion euros for investment."
"I believe that the current period of economic growth must thus be put to good use in order to speed up budgetary consolidation."
"We must not spend the money before we have it; efforts at budgetary improvements must be maintained."
"The hardest part has been achieved and Europe is already reaping the benefits, so we must not relax our efforts now."
"Similarly, within this framework and in answer to Mrs Berès, I want to emphasize the importance of coordinating of economic policies, not only with relation to budgets but also in the fields of employment and competitiveness."
"We have the tools: the broad outlines of economic policy, the stability programmes."
"We have the bodies: Parliament, the Ecofin Council, the euro Council."
"It is now important for our governments to prove their political will by implementing all of this."
"The second absolute priority for economic policy is the challenge of employment. To Mr Hughes and Mr Paasilinna, I would say that EMU does not necessarily mean more unemployment."
"This is why, through the Luxembourg Council - Mr Thomas Mann mentioned this - the Union made employment an issue of common interest, a priority for our economic policy. Beyond the development of a healthy macroeconomic policy, only adequate and concerted structural reforms will be able to reduce unemployment in Europe in the long term."
"In this respect, the euro must be the catalyst in the fight against unemployment."
"Tomorrow, we will be discussing the broad outlines of economic policy."
"This year, a common strategy for employment will be at the heart of the Commission's overall work."
"Similarly, the Commission is currently examining national plans which have just been presented and will give its conclusions in Cardiff."
"There are two other issues which are important for the future."
"I will only mention them in passing, given the lack of time to go into any depth. One is the international dimension of the euro, on which we have said little this evening."
"How, with the euro, will Europe be able to speak with one voice?"
"This is also a major challenge to be taken up, if we want to derive all the advantages and benefits that the introduction of its own currency will give to the number one economic and trading power in the world."
"Finally, the last challenge is that of ensuring acceptance of the currency by all."
"On one point, at least, I am in agreement with Mrs Schörling, that is, the importance of people."
"We cannot ignore them, and within this framework each person must be able to familiarize himself rapidly with the new currency and use it comfortably and with confidence."
"That is the reason why communication strategies must be accelerated in all Member States."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me once again to say how pleased I am with the excellent collaboration we have had over the past three and a half years, which has been one of the keys to the success of this historic project."
"I would personally like to thank Mr von Wogau, in particular, as well as Mrs Randzio-Plath, for their tireless commitment and their support of the euro throughout these last months, which have not always been easy."
"I now believe that the European Parliament is going to see its role extended, whether in relation to the process of coordination of economic policy, in relation to the democratic accountability of Economic and Monetary Union or in relation to efforts to convince public opinion."
"I am very happy with our collaboration."
"I am also very happy with your sense of responsibility and since Mr Garosci said earlier, ""We have made the euro and now we have to make Europe' , I would say that this is a fine ambition to have."
"Mr Fayot said, "" Let us be positive and concrete' . This, too, is a fine attitude."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"1998 annual economic report"
"The next item is the report (A4-0133/98) by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, on behalf of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on ""Growth and Employment in the Stability-Oriented Framework of EMU - Economic policy reflections in view of the forthcoming 1998 Broad Guidelines' (COM(98)0103 - C40135/98) (Annual Economic Report)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wanted to say thank you for all the collaboration I received while working on this report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and for the fact that it was approved almost unanimously in committee."
"So the report was produced not by me but by the committee. It reflects a series of points which were mentioned during the previous debate, but focusing on what must be done - and I stress that - after the euro."
"I also want to point out that when my report was being discussed in committee we already had the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and their main proposals have been included in the report."
"That was not the case with the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, which arrived later."
"But as rapporteur, I would have no objection to that committee's proposals being incorporated into the report's conclusions under the Hughes procedure."
"To make sure that Commissioner de Silguy does not complain that we have taken no notice of the Commission's report, I shall point out that, obviously, the report I am defending here refers to the Commission's Annual Economic Report. This annual report is slightly special because it does not conform to the normal structure of that institution's annual economic reports, but is a response to the specific situation of what we could call ""the year of the euro's constitution' ."
"So it focuses on two aspects - growth and employment - and uses a methodology we have accepted."
"However, our report points out that it should be different in future."
"It should consider and offer a different type of analysis from that used in this year's report, introducing, for example, a medium-term analysis a methodology - which exists in economics - based on scenarios; it should not just envisage a linear development of the European economy, but take account of the effects of what we call ""asymmetric shocks' , not just at Member State level but also at regional level."
"Having made those points to show the Commissioner that we have paid attention to the European Commission report, I want to use the few minutes left to reflect on two aspects."
"The first of these is growth."
"Growth is a basis - not the only one - for progress, and also for employment."
"The present report mentions some aspects which have perhaps been marginalized by the very line of stability and solvency demanded by monetary union and the euro, but which need to be taken up again."
"For example, we have to bear in mind the need to boost public and private investment for productive purposes - an essential aspect of increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the European economy; we must pay attention to and strengthen essential aspects of research and development, education and professional training; and, obviously, we must take account of all those aspects which can make this Europe, strengthened by the euro, competitive at an internal level - or in other words, see that it offers more opportunities for the economies which can adapt to the new demands. This is also true at international level, because I agree with Mr de Silguy's statement about the importance of the euro's international dimension."
"The second aspect I want to mention concerns employment."
"In our report we have been very conscious, based on the European Commission's report, of the euro as a driving force for employment."
"We have also talked about the need to make the labour markets more flexible, decrease the indirect costs bearing on the creation of a new job, and take account of the fiscal climate. Obviously, this whole process needs to result in renewal within the business sector, and we especially stress the role of small and medium-sized enterprises as an engine for development, progress and job creation."
"Mr President, this is in fact the first annual report since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Luxembourg Summit."
"In itself it is understandable that the employment guidelines envisaged there receive little or no attention in this report."
"I hope that in future reports they will always form an integral part of the report, as well as benchmarking in the sphere of labour market strategy."
"One of the important objectives of the Amsterdam Summit and also of the Luxembourg Summit was to create coordination, a balance, between macroeconomic policy and employment policies."
"I must confess that I do not really understand why scarcely any attention has been paid to this balance, this coordination, in the annual report before us."
"You will see in our report that we urge that proposals for coordination are made as soon as possible."
"The Ecofin and Social Council should discuss this subject together - I am not saying how often, but it should be at least a few times a year - and not stay put in separate camps."
"An article in the European Voice shocked me. In it, a statement to be put to the Summit this weekend was leaked in which government leaders are asked to say that reducing public debt levels rather than reducing unemployment is their main priority."
"The argument often used is that this leaves more room to do something about unemployment in future."
"I wonder if you could tell me, Commissioner, when this future will start?"
"Recently, last weekend, appalling elections took place in Germany, in which the right had an unexpectedly huge result."
"If you do not link this to the unbridled unemployment there, than you must be wilfully blind."
"I would like to stress this emphatically so that you will finally understand that for many people the future must start now. I would like to stress emphatically that it is madness to expect the euro to mean something if we do not start to take concrete measures which will allow people to gauge whether the authorities are addressing unemployment."
"This report does not meet these criteria at all, and in this regard I think that what I have read about the proposals for the end of this weekend is a disgrace."
"Mr President, I welcome the report of Mr Gasòliba and congratulate him on the content."
"As he has said, it is the result of collaborative work and we in the Socialist Group are largely very happy with the content."
"Perhaps even more important today, can I also thank the Commissioner and his services because we in the Socialist Group have long been calling for a better type of annual economic report from the Commission which addresses the real problems facing our citizens."
"I am glad to say that for the first time in recent years we now have a report which can not only be read sensibly by people outside the European institutions but which also reflects their concerns."
"I would like to thank the civil servants in the Commission for the work that they have done on this."
"In particular, I want to draw attention to a number of points that have been highlighted by the Commission and which Mr Gasòliba has taken up in his own text."
"The first question is in relation to investment."
"The Commission have recognized in the Annual Economic Report the fact that during this period of consolidation we have seen a very serious fall in the level of investment, and in particular public investment, within the European Union and the Commission themselves recommend that Member States must be very cautious that during the period of consolidation not to completely undermine public investment."
"We should seek ways to boost that, in particular, by public-private partnerships."
"I hope that Commissioner de Silguy will press this point when he meets the Finance Ministers to discuss the conclusions of the European Parliament's report and the Commission's text."
"In particular, in relation to monetary policy, we made the point earlier in the debate on economic and monetary union, that under Article 105 of the Treaty when price stability is guaranteed then the monetary authority can address the wider objectives of the European Union."
"We want a monetary policy that will help to promote employment and growth within the European Union."
"The Commission have mentioned this in their text in a very clear way and we want to make sure that the monetary authorities in Europe, particularly the European Central Bank, address this point too."
"In addition, for the first time in the Commission's report they also highlight the fact that the European Union is largely an internal trading community."
"90 % of our GDP is generated by internal trade within the European Union."
"For the first time the Commission have said that the macroeconomic policy of the European Union must be based upon stimulating internal demand within the fifteen Member States."
"In the broad economic guidelines we want specific proposals from the Commission on how we stimulate internal demand within the European Union."
"It is not a question of international trade, it is a question of internal demand."
"Let me say, finally, I particularly welcome the fact that we have held these two debates today."
"I believe we are not only looking at a monetary union but we are looking at an economic union and it is right today that we should address the process of establishing a monetary union at the same time as we deal with the Annual Economic Report of the European Union."
"First I would like to welcome the Gasòliba Report on the Annual Economic Report from which I believe it is clear that within the European Union there has been stable economic growth since 1996."
"Investment growth is estimated to be about 4.7 % in 1998 and, hopefully, 5.5 % in 1999."
"2.5 %, of course, of the domestic demand is forecast for the next two years."
"A small but stable growth in unemployment has been registered and 1997 is at a new level."
"The macroeconomic pillars for the future coordination of national economic policies would, of course, be based on a monetary policy for the stability of prices and reduction of public debt."
"What is important about all this is that we can be assured of low inflation and interest rates and in my own country, Ireland, the public deficit has been reduced by 11 % of GNP since the 1980s and the public debt has been reduced from 115 % to 65 % in the same period."
"But it is also true, thankfully, that the situation is improving elsewhere within the Union."
"It is clear for Ireland that EMU will result in continued growth, job creation, low inflation, low interest rates and elimination of transaction costs."
"It is good for mortgage-holders, businesses and a country like Ireland exporting a substantial percentage of our goods to other parts of Europe that we will now have the same currency."
"It will be helpful, of course, for tourism which is also so important for our country."
"It will stifle, of course, currency speculators and we recall only too vividly the situation which we had a few years ago."
"In conclusion, congratulations to Mr Gasòliba on the presentation of a fine report in the Annual Economic Report."
"Mr President, the Annual Economic Report for 1998 should have been an opportunity to evaluate the roads we have travelled along and to correct strategies and policies."
"Those opportunities have been missed, because the road to the euro has acquired such real and symbolic significance that it has dented, if not destroyed, our ability to evaluate, and, a fortiori , to correct and retrace our steps."
"The Gasòliba report adopts the stance that has virtually become dogma, namely that the euro and the Stability Pact are essential tools for growth and job creation, and that the obstacles preventing these tools from doing their work are non-labour costs, lack of adaptability on the part of workers, and over-regulation."
"If we could dispose of those obstacles, uncouple the ECB from the economic situation and co-ordinate economic policies under the iron collar of the budget, we would be in 'euro-Eldorado' ."
"That is not the way we see it."
"We are worried about the emphasis placed on wage differentiation in this scenario, in the way it is in the United States."
"There is a clear tendency for gaps to widen - and the American 'model' would accelerate that tendency."
"That is why we are pleased to note that the rapporteur considers the American case too extreme to be used as a model."
"We also want to draw attention to our amendments: a tax on speculative capital profits, a reduction in working hours without loss of pay and an evaluation of how the development of EMU will affect unemployment."
"Mr President, this is a question not only of economic growth, but of economic growth which makes sense."
"A European economic policy means a socio-ecological market economy."
"This requires not only the rapid introduction of the energy tax - and here I would thank Mr Monti for his energetic work - but also a social and environmental situation and also a Union."
"What has the annual report to do with the frightening percentages achieved by a right-wing party in Germany?"
"A great deal."
"Unemployment and youth unemployment create helplessness, and the right wing parties in Germany and throughout Europe benefit from that."
"On 2 May we will celebrate the historic creation of a single European currency here in the European Parliament."
"This is good and I am delighted about it."
"In conclusion, I would like to say that I am happy because it will be an historic fact and because monetary union, which in ten years' time will be taken for granted, will be rid of its doom and gloom merchants, including those in my own group!"
"Mr President, I congratulate you on the Gasòliba report on the Annual Economic Report because it showed clearly, on the basis of the Commission's information, major obstacles to European economic growth and employment. Excessive tax and administrative burdens borne in particular by SMEs in the face of increasingly fierce international competition, inadequate vocational training, excessive rigidity of the labour market, preventing the development of new job opportunities and high non-wage labour costs reduce companies' capacity to invest and grow."
"I cannot entirely agree with several points made in the report, however, particularly the assessment of the reduction in working hours, dealt with in paragraphs 39 and 40 of the report."
"While in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity paragraph 39 confirms the inadvisability of a compulsory reduction in working time throughout the European Union, the following paragraph 40 provides a series of reflections."
"In the first part of the text of paragraph 40, we read that Parliament ""is in favour of reductions in the working time...when suitable' ."
"Obviously, such a definition lends itself to more than one interpretation."
"In fact, the general and abstract formulation of a principle of a need to reduce working hours seems destined to generate misunderstandings and ambiguities, for not only is it absolutely general but there is no specific reference in the report to the assumption of a reduction in working hours as a matter of necessity."
"In short, paragraph 40 can be read as meaning it is the prerogative of each individual state to identify a general principle of need to impose an indiscriminate reduction in working hours over the entire national territory."
"This latter assumption contradicts the considerations expressed in the Commission's report which, indicating the risks of the so-called statutory 35hour week, limited itself to admitting reductions in working hours only at microeconomic level or through negotiations between the social partners."
"To conclude, owing to its general nature, paragraph 40 seems to be the result of a confused political agreement."
"Consequently, on the basis of the considerations listed, I call on Parliament to vote against paragraph 40 of the Gasòliba report."
"In addition to this, I would like to hear Commissioner de Silguy's assessment."
"Mr President, those who believe that the euro and the uniform monetary policy which we will have from 1 January next year will automatically yield all sorts of benefits, are seriously mistaken."
"A monetary policy requires a coordinated and intelligent economic policy."
"Without this a great deal can go wrong."
"In short, the lack of commitment to a coordinated economic policy really must be brought to an end."
"I would like to give you an example. The European Central Bank will in practice direct its monetary policy at the average rate of inflation within the euro area."
"For each individual country this means that internal low inflation coupled with rising inflation elsewhere could lead to higher interest rates, and could act as a brake on economic development."
"In short, every country taking part in EMU has an interest in other euro countries keeping their inflation down, otherwise the independent ECB will punish them unrelentingly, with negative consequences for the low inflation countries as well."
"Fortunately, the Member States have sufficient instruments at their disposal to keep inflation down, for example by taking specific tax measures when the economy threatens to overheat."
"Sometimes pressure will be needed to take these undoubtedly unpopular measures in good time, in the interest of the others as well."
"The global guidelines for economic policy covering the policy mix at European level and within the Member States will thus be given overriding importance."
"If this is to become successful it must have political support."
"This means that parliaments must be able to exert genuine influence."
"In order to close the existing democratic gap, an interinstitutional agreement, as requested by this Parliament two weeks ago, is urgently needed."
"An important characteristic of the Europe of the single currency is that it is dependent on a mere 10 % of external trade."
"This means that we can determine our own prosperity or lack of it."
"The policy mix at European level should take into account that the euro area must take care of its own growth impulses."
"Export growth will make a contribution, but in a very limited way, and this year it is actually zero."
"The core recommendations of the global guidelines of recent years, namely continuous cutbacks, strict monetary policy, and wage restraint whereby the wage increase remains 1 % behind productivity increase, cannot continue unchanged."
"A time schedule must be set for the cutbacks, or the monetary policy or wage restraints must be relaxed."
"Without suddenly breaking with the existing policy, the political message should be that growth and employment are now being given priority."
"This will mean in practice that every country must be recommended its own particular policy mix , so that Europe as a whole is able to pursue a policy aimed at growth and job creation which does not jeopardize inflation."
"Mr President, I wish to say that the economic policy of 1998 has been sealed by the introduction of the euro and I think that the move towards the euro is pervaded by a broad conflict."
"On the one hand, we have the unilateral adherence of the leaders of the Member States and of the European Union to the financial criteria, the public debt."
"This is now reaching gigantic proportions. We are talking of stability agreements that will last ten years."
"On the other hand, we have the anguish of the European communities concerning employment, which, I believe, was expressed with a very strong warning during the elections in Saxony, and we have to take account of the fact that one out of four young people voted for the extreme right."
"From this viewpoint, we are in total disagreement with the position of the Commission."
"In the report by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm I can see that there is an orientation towards issues of development and employment, but I fear that this positive orientation of the rapporteur is being sacrificed in the name of consensus."
"In this sense, there are blatant contradictions: in paragraph 40 we are for the reduction of working hours; in paragraph 39 we are against; in paragraph 25 we do not want a reduction in the wage of unskilled workers; in paragraph 26 we do."
"I think that a clearer orientation is called for, that this unilateral policy should be broken and that we should endeavour to make the euro popular rather than detested by the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, the report from the European Commission and the report by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm clearly emphasize that we are making preparations for using the opportunities of globalization and of European integration to favour growth, investment and employment, and to contribute to an increase in prosperity and social justice in the European Union."
"It is clear both in this Annual Economic Report and in the report by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm that we have come through the period of confrontation, with supply-side policy on the one hand and demand-orientated measures on the other."
"We believe that in the European Union we need measures both in the areas of macro and micro policy, and also supply-side and demand-orientated policies."
"A range of measures is on the table which ought to be used. We know that we can only follow this approach through to ensure a high level of employment, as is rightly required and emphasized by Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union - as well as through the employment chapter in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the resolutions of the Employment Summit and the strategies during the British Presidency of the Council and the forthcoming Austrian Presidency which we hope will point the way - if, together with structural policy and measures in the labour market, education and training policies, a further basket of measures makes economic growth of 3 % to 3.5 % possible."
"The introduction of monetary union on time is certainly indispensable, since exchange-rate fluctuations in the internal market which are economically damaging will then cease, a better policy mix will be possible and it will also be possible to avoid conflicts between budget and monetary policies."
"However, above all, and I would again like to express my support for this, at last it will be possible to devise coordinated economic policies worthy of their name."
"Up to now, the fundamentals of economic policy have required nothing from any Member State."
"I hope in the wake of this Annual Economic Report and this debate in the European Parliament that the coordination of economic policies in the European Union will finally make it plain that political union also means joint economic policy which is in the common interest and which stimulates growth, investment and employment."
"I would like once more to stress that the extent of the reduction in public investment is irresponsible!"
"We must, therefore, take more account of the stimulant of public investments for private investments and move forward in this area; otherwise, it will be impossible to achieve the growth in employment which we urgently need in the European Union."
"Mr President, even before it has come into force, monetary union is a success."
"It accelerated necessary debt rescheduling which is now leading to increased growth in the European economy, and which has also increased self-confidence in the EU."
"In order to take full advantage of EMU and to strengthen our competitiveness and the conditions for prosperity in Europe, policies must be directed at structural reform."
"Budget reorganization has affected the everyday lives of the citizens."
"Now a correctly designed structural policy can create better conditions for the EU and its inhabitants."
"The remarkable thing is that structural reforms which cost nothing appear to be more difficult to accept than budget reorganization, probably because they challenge strong special interests."
"That is why I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on a courageous document which discusses the importance of reformed labour markets which work better."
"I am pleased about this and would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, whose report shows that we in Parliament are prepared to accept and make a constructive contribution to the essential debate and to accelerate the decisions which need to be taken in order for people to be able to reform inflexible markets with far too many left over monopolies."
"I also think that the Commission's report is worth drawing attention to as far as the annexes of statistical information are concerned."
"The aim of the report is not to assess the development of individual countries, but the columns speak clearly."
"We can see how countries whose political leadership has neglected and delayed modernization of the labour market in particular have increased the tax burden and thus reduced levels of employment and reduced common resources."
"On the other hand, we can see how other countries which make proper use of the new conditions are able to increase growth, employment and prosperity."
"Let these figures and the Commission's reasoning represent both alarm bells and carrots when the work on the economic guidelines is completed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Gasòliba for listening when he prepared his report."
"Despite our differences, even our divergences, he has made great efforts to bring Parliament largely together on a position, a common and strong economic analysis."
"This is also what I am trying to do with my report on European industrial competitiveness, which will be considered in Strasbourg in a couple of weeks' time."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and to say how pleased I am with the development of our institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, in this field."
"In effect, our institutions are now reflecting and working together to bring a strong European economy out of the multiple conditions, avoiding simple but entrenched confrontations, and limited to two or three solid points."
"Today, finally, the strengths of the European economy are recognized, the weaknesses are clearly analysed and, consequently, everyone is making an effort to search for solutions to strengthen the former and reduce the latter."
"I therefore largely recognize my own views in the Gasòliba report, as amended by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"I participated in these amendments, and I voted for the final report."
"I would this evening therefore simply like to highlight five points."
"Firstly, I would mention the importance of European research."
"It is a basic condition and sufficient appropriations must therefore be given to the Fifth Framework Programme, in any case, more than ECU 16 billion should be set aside."
"Secondly, there is the social dimension of Europe, which is not a brake on growth, whatever some may say."
"It is, on the contrary, an asset."
"A worker who feels good is more competitive and makes his company more competitive."
"In any case, if social aspects are devalued, Europe will always lose in terms of world competitiveness."
"The third aspect concerns initial and ongoing training, which must be ever more closely linked to technical, technological and economic developments."
"The fourth point involves our necessary adaptation to technical developments, to developments in the market, in needs and in society as a whole, which does not boil down to the flexibility of labour."
"Finally and fifthly, I must mention job sharing and the reduction of working time which are necessary in order to give more time for life and so that the increase in productivity is not translated into further unemployment."
"This is why, as a socialist, I am in favour of a reduction of working time in France, and I hope that our positive results in terms of jobs will lead to its rapid extension to the rest of Europe."
"This is why, personally, I am prepared to support Amendment No 5 tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I wanted to say on Mr Gasòliba's report, which I support."
"I hope that, in the wake of this report, in the wake of the euro, which is a fantastic vector for federalist integration, we will now be able to develop a political Europe and a social Europe."
"Some will say: that is another story."
"For me, a diehard federalist campaigner, it is at the heart of today's debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the Commission's 1998 report is entitled for the first time ""Growth and Employment in the Stability-Oriented Framework of EMU' is very important. I also want to underline, as some of my colleagues have already done, the historical importance to all European citizens of the momentous decision we the representatives of the European people are going to adopt in this Parliament on 2 May to introduce the new currency."
"It is also true that the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Luxembourg Summit marked a ""before' and ""after' in the employment policies of each Member State."
"But we have to realize that the people of Europe are hoping that our political debates will materialize into concrete deeds, so that our young people, our women, our long-term unemployed and disabled - the sectors suffering the worst unemployment - see a fulfilment of their logical hopes of being able to work and develop personally and socially in the new Europe we are all building."
"It is also important, ladies and gentlemen, that we have almost achieved a general consensus on the measures to adopt to improve the worrying unemployment figures suffered by the European Union as a whole."
"But along with the nominal economic convergence already achieved, we also need much more progress in the social convergence which facilitates the strengthening of the internal market, the breaking down of language and cultural barriers which hinder worker mobility and the harmonization of social security systems. These, together with a far-reaching reform of education and training systems, can allow our citizens to adapt to the demands not just of the national job markets but of the whole European market."
"At the same time, the new European society also has to adapt with almost breathtaking speed to the new technologies which surprise us daily and which call for a radical change in the traditional concept of work and business."
"For example, teleworking, electronic commerce, telemedicine or the development of the Internet itself call for a major effort on the part of the Member States so that our young people in particular can adapt to this mutation within society."
"In short, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us ensure that the Europe of the euro is the Europe of work, solidarity and wellbeing."
"If these objectives fail, it will be the failure of we who on Saturday will be turning European history on its head."
"Mr President, the Commission's annual report states that a long-term economic revival has begun."
"Exports are increasing and the euro will have a favourable exchange rate with the US dollar."
"It is now up to us to shape a European Economic and Monetary Union which is based on employment, public investment and increased competitiveness in Europe."
"Although the Commission's annual report ignores the difficulties the crisis in Asia is causing for the European economy, the Commission has succeeded in compiling a very competent and comprehensive document."
"It is, however, rather rash to discuss the five-year economic situation without, for example, carrying out detailed cost analyses."
"I only hope the future proves as rosy."
"The rapporteur says it is important to create a means of making comparisons in investment and employment throughout the Union."
"I think the level of public investment at present in the Union is totally insufficient to improve European competitiveness."
"Actually, it is quite obvious that public investment gives encouragement to private investment, for example in infrastructure financing."
"The Commission's proposal to reduce VAT in labour-intensive sectors is most worthwhile."
"I myself have often spoken of a transaction tax on currency trading, which is a very lucrative business."
"Furthermore, Jacques Delors and many others have proposed this."
"In this way we could introduce tax relief systems for sectors that employ large numbers of workers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to add my congratulations to those being expressed generally to my colleague and good friend Carles-Alfred Gasòliba I Böhm for his report and for the flexibility with which he has incorporated the amendments."
"This is a balanced report, which properly identifies the main lines of action in economic policy at Union level and makes well-placed comments or clarifications in relation to the Commission's report."
"I want to add a few comments to back up what I have just said."
"Firstly, there is the reference to employment, which is treated at length, with the accent placed on growth, investment and structural reforms, including an interesting reference to the concept of employability which was popularized by New Labour - Tony Blair's Labour Party - and is becoming a keyword in the employment debate."
"Secondly, the report insists on the need to coordinate the economic policy of the Member States within the monetary union."
"We would like to deepen that coordination to the point of having a real economic government of the Union, to serve as a counterweight to the monetary authority."
"However, it is not just a question of a counterweight, but also a matter of achieving an economic government able to extract the full potential of the new panorama being created with the introduction of the single currency."
"Thirdly, I think it is important to stress the insistence on investment as an essential element for growth and to improve competitiveness."
"On this point, I completely agree with what Alan Donnelly said a little while ago."
"Fourthly, another point in the Gasòliba report which deserves mention is its strong support for maintaining the European social model, as set out in paragraph 25."
"Finally, although I could add more, I will conclude by saying that I am pleased with the realistic approach to the question of reduced working hours, that is, the 35-hour week."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"The Commission report was extremely optimistic."
"It talked about a renewed upturn in the spring of 1996 which is gathering momentum and is expected to turn into a self-sustained expansion."
"I would like to err on the side of caution."
"The Commission talks about this being driven by demand from outside the EU and clearly it has taken into consideration the recent developments in Asia."
"The developments in Asia have not stopped and Japan, in particular, is in difficulty and I predict its difficulties will increase."
"I do not know exactly how much the Commission has revised its growth figures as a result of what has happened in Asia but the potential for catastrophe has not gone."
"The Commission also claims a virtuous circle in terms of the economy for three reasons: the favourable monetary conditions, strengthened internal demand and improved confidence."
"My criticism of the report from the Commission is that it does little in the form of positive policy support for the strengthening of internal demand."
"How can we tackle unemployment if we do not create the conditions for internal demand, in particular at a time when external demand from Asia may be significantly reduced."
"The Commission is relying on endogenous growth and it is a leap of faith which I fear many European citizens will not make."
"I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 when the Delors report was all the rage and we had a quest to reduce unemployment by 15 million by the year 2000."
"We are not being totally honest with the European public because unemployment in the European Union has not been reduced by anywhere near that amount."
"People have memories and while we accept that 2 to 3 % growth will take place, it is not near enough to the 4 % that the US has consistently experienced to create the millions of jobs that it has to."
"I want to see Europe create millions of jobs, too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all my congratulations go to Mr Gasòliba I Böhm on his excellent report inviting us to reflect on the options to be considered for the broad guidelines of 1998 economic policy, which the Commission will present on 13 May this year."
"The broad guidelines of economic policy will be the first post-euro guidelines and for this reason they are important."
"They are also the first to fall within the framework of the Luxembourg European Council's conclusions on employment."
"Thus, the Commission's Annual Economic Report is presented this year as a first stage in the formulation of these broad guidelines."
"It is an important exercise and I am glad that you organized a meeting with economic experts on 17 March to prepare this report."
"I can assure you that the Commission will take your observations and suggestions duly into account when drawing up its proposal."
"Since it is getting late, I would like to reply very rapidly to the questions which have been raised and say a few words on the state of the European economy before reminding you of, or outlining, the Commission's principle recommendations."
"With regard to the state of the European economy, the recovery which commenced in the spring of 1996 is gaining momentum and should lead to a process of self-sustained growth."
"This will have a favourable impact on employment which, nevertheless, remains one of our main concerns, as you know."
"Mr Hendrick, I could say to you that we are not over optimistic."
"Our growth forecasts correspond in general to those laid down by the large international institutions. Last March we revised them downwards slightly, to 0.2 points for 1998 and 0.1 points for 1999, in order to take into account the effects of the Asian crisis."
"Having said this, growth will nevertheless be 2.7 % in 1997 and 2.8 % in 1998. This is already an improvement."
"The Commission is following the situation in Asia closely, particularly with regard to Japan, international trade and sectoral aspects of the crisis, where we have identified eight sectors in particular which seem to be the most exposed."
"We are following this closely."
"I would like to echo here one of your rapporteur's requests, in collaboration moreover, with what I believe Mr Paasilinna mentioned."
"You must not believe that the Commission does not consider the risks which could threaten its central scenario."
"On the contrary, the Commission has taken serious note of your suggestion for an alternative scenario and a medium-term analysis."
"I can assure you that it will make an effort to reply to this over the coming years."
"But today, Europe's growth is based increasingly on its own strengths, on internal demand."
"This issue was raised by Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mr Paasilinna, Mr Pérez Royo, Mr Donnelly and Mr Metten amongst others."
"Private consumption is increasing, from 2 % in 1996 to 2.6 % in 1998 and 1999."
"It is reassuring for the development of domestic demand."
"Similarly, investment levels have been supported above what was forecast and capital investment will increase from 6.4 % in 1998 to 7 % in 1999."
"This is compared with 4.4 % in 1997."
"These figures are the result of a return of confidence."
"On this point, I would like to clarify to Mr Donnelly that it is true that public investment as a percentage of GDP has fallen from 2.9 % in 1990 to 2.2 % in 1997, and that this trend must not continue."
"The Commission has taken every opportunity of stating this and, in particular, we will insist on this point in the new broad guidelines for 1998 economic policy."
"This said, do not underestimate the impact of investment because of the cofinancing of certain investments in the private sector, which can give a slightly distorted view of the figures."
"Finally, on this aspect of demand, I will say to Mr Metten that demand must not, all the same, be artificially stimulated by new budget deficits or overly rapid increases in salaries."
"This would pose a threat to the recovery which our economy has benefited from over a number of years, and we would lapse into a situation of deficit, with the consequence of higher interest rates and the ensuing negative effects on growth and employment."
"Thus, the economic strategy advocated by the Commission, which is also advocated by the monitoring which Member States have been carrying out for a number of years, is beginning to bear fruit, particularly in terms of job creation."
"In reply to Mr van Velzen: look at the figures."
"Europe created 600 000 jobs in 1997."
"On the basis of our forecasts, another 2 800 000 should be created in 1998 and 1999 meaning that, in total, we will have created 3 400 000 jobs over three years."
"It is encouraging, even though I am aware that it will not compensate for the 4 500 000 job losses registered throughout the 1990s."
"These figures illustrate the need to promote more sustainable, employment-creating growth."
"Mr Gasòliba suggests using benchmarks for this."
"Allow me to remind you that the Commission's recommendation for the first guidelines on employment contained quantifiable objectives, and it was the Council which did not accept them and which did not follow the Commission in this matter."
"But to promote growth which provides more jobs remains the essential objective of the broad guidelines of economic policy and it is the second point I would like to touch upon very rapidly with you now."
"At the request of the Amsterdam European Council, the broad guidelines for economic policy for 1998 will emphasize the need for better coordination of macroeconomic policies and structural measures."
"These two policies are inseparable if you want to promote growth and employment, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out."
"With regard to macroeconomic policy, we had the opportunity of discussing this in the previous report and so I will not go into the details."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath is right. We must avoid confrontation between a supply policy and a demand policy."
"The Commission has always tried to do this."
"I have noted over the past few years that the broad guidelines of economic policy advocate a stable macroeconomic framework within Economic and Monetary Union, of which the three pillars are, naturally, a monetary policy based on price stability, the durable consolidation of public finances and a salary policy compatible with price stability and a return on investment."
"EMU and the euro will strengthen this stable economic framework for all the Member States."
"In this respect, I am glad the European Parliament supports that strategy."
"But beyond this macroeconomic policy, in order to produce the maximum effect in terms of jobs, this framework must be complemented by structural reforms, reforms firstly at the level of the market for goods and services."
"In order to invest, businessmen must not be discouraged from the start by overly bureaucratic regulations."
"Similarly, greater growth should also bring about greater demand for labour."
"There still exist too many administrative rigidities, too many administrative formalities, access to the capital markets is still too difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, as the rapporteur noted."
"I remember, nevertheless, that on 31 March the Commission proposed an action plan on access to capital investment on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This action plan will be implemented as from autumn 1998 if, of course, the Heads of State or Government approve it in Cardiff."
"Reforms are also necessary in the labour market."
"A number of options must be examined including the reduction of non-wage labour costs, it being understood that, for budgetary reasons, only a reduction in non-wage labour costs targeted at the bottom of the salary scale is possible."
"In any case, this is only realistic if accompanied by a containment of social expenditure."
"The second option is salary differentiation. Is it right that the unemployment rate in 25 regions of the European Union should be less than 5 % whilst in 25 others it is more than 22 %?"
"This leads us to consider the problem of salary differentiation depending on productivity levels and according to regional skills, even sectors of activity."
"The final option which has been mentioned, and I must say a word about it, is the reduction of working time."
"I believe it was Mrs Angelilli who particularly questioned me on this matter."
"We must beware of ready-made slogans and ideas on this issue."
"A reduction in working time could have complex and contradictory effects on employment for, contrary to a generally accepted idea, employment is not a fixed quantity."
"It is, on the contrary, an endogenous variable in the economic system, which fluctuates according to all the other variables."
"We therefore have to be careful and to weigh up all the consequences of the measures to be taken."
"A reduction in working time may encourage employment, but only under certain conditions."
"Here, too, we must remember that it must not have consequences for the recovery of public finances and it must be neutral from the point of view of the cost borne by companies."
"We must, in fact, avoid a reduction in company profitability, as this could cause a reduction in investment, with negative effects on employment in the long run. It should also be avoided if such a reduction implies a lowering of salaries within the companies concerned."
"In any case, with regard to a reduction in working time, I would say that this subject cannot be dealt with in a general manner nor out of context."
"It must be assessed within the overall context of work organization."
"This issue is for negotiation between the social partners at a microeconomic level - the branch or the company - as I think the rapporteur mentioned."
"But beyond a particular interest in specific measures, a reduction in unemployment can only be achieved through the steady continuation over a period of time of global, coherent and specific policies which, as Mr Caudron highlighted, cover aspects of research, education and training."
"In conclusion, I would say that this exercise of drawing up broad guidelines for economic policy is set within the structure of the issue of employment, and the objective is clearly to define a framework which is propitious to growth and employment, whilst assuring the smooth running of Economic and Monetary Union."
"All of this is not contradictory."
"Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission thanks the House for its contribution to these reflections and I can assure you that it will take your recommendations into account in drawing up the broad guidelines for economic policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the link has been made twice or even three times here between unemployment, lack of hope and right-wing voters, to the applause of the House."
"May I ask you kindly what your response to this is, for I believe that you are just as frightened and troubled as we are at the German result of 13.6 % for the German People's Union, financed by one person, a right-wing party without an agenda."
"I would like to hear your opinion on this subject."
"I can answer very clearly that unemployment is the scourge of Europe."
"The problem of unemployment will not be solved by increasing deficits, indeed past experience has demonstrated the complete opposite."
"The greatest growth has been experienced in those countries which have reduced their deficit, thus enabling the creation of more jobs."
"Take the example of the Netherlands or Ireland."
"But this is not sufficient to solve the unemployment problem. The very roots of the problem also have to be tackled."
"That is why coherent structural policies must be pursued."
"On a political level, it seems to me rather easy, for populist aims, for the aims of politicians, to look for scapegoats, to look for people responsible where there are none."
"Let us not try to lay the blame on Europe when, at the moment, it is through Europe, through greater Europeanism, and through more concerted actions at European level that we will manage to conquer the scourge of unemployment."
"But it will take time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Textiles and the clothing industry"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Council and to the Commission on textiles and the clothing industry, by the following Members:"
"Soltwedel-Schäfer, Hautala and Wolf (B4-0273/98 and B4-0274/98), on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament; -Puerta and Ribeiro (B4-0275/98 and B4-0276/98), on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left; -Ferrer (B4-0277/98 and B4-0278/98), on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party; -Gasòliba i Böhm (B4-0284/98 and B4-0285/98), on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party; -Pasty, Azzolini, Kaklamanis, Podestà, Donnay, Girão Pereira, Viceconte, Arroni, Gallagher, Garosci, Mezzaroma and Guinebertière (B4-0386/98 and B4-0387/98), on behalf of the Groupe Forza Europa; -Sainjon (B4-0462/98), on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance."
"Mr President, this will now go forward to the Council and the Commission."
"You have before you my motions for an amendment."
"Briefly, they concern increasing the ecological awareness of the whole textile industry."
"This is not the first time that I have raised this topic."
"There are detailed debates and discussions on this subject, including some with Commissioner Bangemann."
"So I would ask what plans the Commission has and what procedure the Council intends to implement in terms of urgently increasing the ecological orientation of the textile industry, for example, in relation to the removal of pollutants in textiles themselves which can lead to allergies, and in relation to the danger to employees in manufacturing these products, as well as the danger to the environment through air, soil and water pollution?"
"Mr Bangemann told me here a year ago that there was a working group dealing with this issue."
"Guidelines were being drawn up."
"That is one thing."
"My various inquiries to the Commission - in writing, too - have produced no response, in other words, there is no answer to them."
"I would like to hear what you have to say about this."
"I have one final point about child labour."
"As you know, child labour in the clothing and textile industries, particularly in Portugal, is mentioned in a wide range of opinions by the European Parliament."
"This is a dreadful phenomenon in Europe, and I would ask you to clarify your position on this too."
"Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, the oral questions, and the resolution that has come from them, are an attempt to send a clear signal from this House to the Industry Council on 7 May, which, we hope, will be assessing the Commission's proposal on a 'plan of action to increase the competitiveness of the European textile and clothing industry' ."
"The purpose of this regulation formula is to tell you that neither by omission nor by mere observance of a ritual abandon will Parliament abandon its duty to state its opinion on the competitiveness of a major industry like textiles and clothing, which is of vital importance to the economy and jobs in some Member States."
"It is also intended to express our dissatisfaction with what the Commission has called a 'plan of action' , which it is not."
"It may be a strategic reflection document, but if it is to be a plan of action it needs projects, timetables, and the allocation of funds."
"Furthermore, it would have been sufficient to give it that status, and allow it to be debated as such, if some of the recommendations expressed by our social partners in their reports had been approved."
"Then again, it amounts to a declaration of those things Parliament regards as necessary and urgent."
"For our part, we want an approach that is neither fragmented nor unbalanced, one that covers the industry as a whole, as a production line , with special attention to labour-intensive activities."
"We want competitiveness in the industry in order to fight against unfair and unbalanced competition, especially where social conditions are concerned, and that means we have to adopt ILO-based social clauses in our bilateral and multilateral planning."
"We want certification of social and environmental conditions, and we want national certificates recognized at European Union level."
"To make the industry competitive we also want incentives for new products and technology, better access to foreign markets, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, more training, particularly for female workers, but the list and details of these matters, and others, will be found in the report we are in the course of preparing."
"Finally, this regulation formula is intended to tell you that we in Parliament are drawing up a report based on the Commission's document."
"This is being taken seriously because it has the weight of an institutional statement demanding the right to participate in processes of this kind and have its work taken into account; if only because this 'construction of Europe' would be a poor thing if a matter as important as the competitiveness of the textile and clothing industry went no further than the document the Commission has submitted."
"The process must go on, and the European Parliament must take part in it. That is Parliament's duty and it is what the industry demands and needs ."
"Mr President, I want to begin by saying that I regret the fact that the Industry Council planned to make a statement on the Commission communication about measures to favour competitiveness in the textiles and clothing sector without waiting to hear Parliament's position on that communication."
"So the purpose of this debate is very clear: to indicate the main lines of action that Parliament thinks should be proposed to increase competitiveness and thereby guarantee the survival of the European textile and clothing sector."
"In contrast to what some people might think, this sector is neither in crisis nor headed towards extinction."
"In fact, thanks to the reorganizations which have taken place, the quality of its products and designs and its ability to respond rapidly, the textile and clothing sector is today ready to confront the great challenge of international competitiveness and face the future with optimism."
"Therefore, the Group of the European People's Party thinks that the Commission and the Council should place more emphasis on effective reciprocal access to third-country markets."
"The accompanying action plan does not go far enough in this respect. Do the Commission and the Council realize that in total it is estimated that there are 600 tariff barriers hindering the free export of Community textile products?"
"If the Council and the Commission really want to favour the competitiveness of the textile and clothing sector, they should demand that third countries respect the rules and disciplines of GATT, propose effective and flexible coordinated measures to combat fraud and the falsification of certificates of origin, protect industrial property, and get third countries to respect basic social and environmental rules."
"It is true that many other measures are needed - in the area of research and development, for example, and in training - but no measure will be effective if there is not real access to the international markets and respect by everybody for the same rules of play."
"To conclude, Mr President, I want to say how frustrated my group is at the draft conclusions prepared by the Council, which absolutely fail to respond to the needs of a key sector. So I beg the Council to think again and take account of the opinions of this Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is significant that the whole political spectrum represented within this Parliament is worried about the future of the European textile and clothing industry."
"I believe that the fact that different political views are united in expressing this concern shows the importance of this sector which, on the one hand, has a very long tradition in European industrial development and, on the other hand, is characterized by something so important at the moment that it has not escaped anybody's attention - something we have addressed in our earlier debates this afternoon: the ability to generate employment."
"So the social dimension of the textile and clothing industry should also be taken into consideration."
"The crux of the various speeches is a request to the Commission and the Council to do something to guarantee the continuity of the textile industry, under the best possible conditions."
"It is not a question of maintaining it in its current situation."
"It is not just a question of helping it to survive."
"It is a matter of providing it with a series of mechanisms to guarantee its competitiveness in an open market which is becoming increasingly competitive in the global economy in which we operate."
"So we are putting a series of proposals to the Commission."
"Firstly, we need to ensure that technological innovation, technological improvements and access to new technologies - basically, information technology and electronic commerce - can be applied correctly within the textile industry, and that the Commission analyses it."
"Another very important aspect is that the whole production chain should be considered, not just a few specific subsectors of the industry."
"And thirdly, it is also very important to ensure that people receive the appropriate training so that - I repeat - the competitiveness of the European textile industry can allow it to survive and maintain the employment level we all want."
"Mr President, the textile industry is very important to the European Union but is also very delicate, as my companions have already said."
"It is important because it is a basic industry in many Structural Fund Objective 1 regions and provides work for more than two million citizens of the European Union."
"And it is delicate because of its disheartening statistics."
"More than 600 000 jobs have been lost in the sector over the last six years and, according to forecasts, more than 800 000 will be lost in the short term."
"This is a dramatic time for the sector."
"We in this Parliament should denounce the situation and announce urgent remedies."
"No matter what sector we are talking about, we cannot continue to have unfair competition and constant dumping in the European market, with adverse effects on our businesses and, finally, our people."
"The current state of the European textile sector has partly arisen as a result of infringement of international and Community market rules, such as those relating to respect for the environment, and social and intellectual protection."
"I have already mentioned the importance of the textile industry in most of the Objective 1 regions, the least developed of the European Union."
"Perhaps for that reason, those regions are very vulnerable, not just to the effects of dumping we are complaining about here, but also to the Community market policy itself, with the recent entry into force of agreements with third countries such as Turkey, or liberalization with regard to countries in the east."
"The entry into effect of the second phase of the WTO textile agreement is particularly important, since it opens the way for a greater liberalization of the market."
"All these factors are hitting our Community textile industry."
"At least the Commission's document on textiles in the European Union is necessary and important."
"However, it lacks a real plan of action which takes account of all the difficulties currently being experienced by the textile industry and the Objective 1 regions and does not include a real policy of economic and social cohesion."
"And this is where we must insist and call upon the Commission to implement a Community policy which meets the needs of our textile industry and, above all, the needs of the regions involved."
"It would be a good move for the Commission to increase the funding in Agenda 2000 and provide continuity for the Retex programme, which is so important for the sector."
"That could only improve the competitiveness of our textile industry and of the regions concerned, while making a positive contribution - as we have already said - to economic and social cohesion within the European Union."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank the five honourable Members for tabling and speaking to their questions and the five other honourable Members who have stayed to hear the replies and for giving the Council the opportunity to reaffirm its support for this vitally important European industry."
"The Council is very aware of the challenges which face all European industry in a world of increasing globalization and new technologies."
"It has recognized that competitiveness in European industry provides the very foundation for growth, creating jobs and raising living standards for us all."
"The European clothing and textile industry is a key economic sector in Europe in terms of production and employment."
"The Council has always recognized the need for Community support to ensure the competitiveness of this sector of the economy."
"In this context it might be helpful if I set out some of the background to the current initiatives."
"The guidelines governing the Community's policies in this area were defined by the Council in 1994."
"These guidelines established a general framework for European industrial strategy in the textile and clothing sector."
"The strategy was devised to take particular account of the specific features which characterize each industry."
"These guidelines established a general framework for European industrial strategy in the textile and clothing sector and the current initiatives in the textile sector can be traced back to the conclusions of the Industry Council of 28 March and 14 November 1996."
"These concerned, respectively, the impact of international developments on the Community's textile and clothing sector and also on the competitiveness of subcontracting in the textile and clothing industry in the European Union."
"These conclusions were followed up on 3 November 1997 by a Commission communication entitled Action Plan to increase the Competitiveness of the European Textile and Clothing Industry."
"That communication was prepared in the context of the dialogue which has been taking place at the Commission's initiative between the parties involved in the textile and clothing sector and, in particular, the national and Community public authorities and the social partners."
"The Commission's action plan defines a number of priority areas on which the actions of different parties concerned should focus."
"It is currently being examined within the relevant Council bodies and it is on the agenda of the next meeting of the Industry Council on 7 May 1998."
"At this stage the presidency envisages that the Industry Council will make an initial response to the Commission's communication in the form of conclusions."
"These would spell out the Council's position on the initiatives identified by the Commission as areas for priority action."
"All the issues raised by the five honourable Members today are highlighted as areas of activity within that plan."
"In particular, the Council will want to consider five key questions: jobs and training; the development and dissemination of new products, methods and equipment in the communication and information technologies; the proper operation of the internal market; access to the markets of third countries and strict compliance with the rules and disciplines freely accepted under international agreements; and regional development."
"Honourable Members and in particular Mr Ribeiro have raised the question of the precise resources required for training if the competitiveness of the textile and clothing industry is to be improved."
"The Commission's action plan does not contain details on which to base an assessment of its financial consequences."
"The initiative suggested will be funded from within the current budgetary framework."
"I commend the excellent document prepared by DG III in conjunction with Eurotex, the European Textile and Clothing Federation, which details in 91 pages and by sector where in each Member State funds can be accessed."
"Although there is no suggested timetable for the initiatives under the action plan we hope to make steady progress."
"We would also expect the continuation of the Commission-led dialogue with all those involved in the sector, including the Member States and the social partners."
"This would help to ensure constant monitoring of progress and allow us to adapt measures to structural and economic developments."
"I will turn now to some of the more specific questions tabled today and which are not directly covered by the action plan."
"Firstly, the question by Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer."
"The matter of child labour is covered by many ILO conventions to which all Member States of the EU are individual parties, in particular Convention No 28 on forced labour and No 138 on child labour."
"This question has also been dealt with at Community level by Council Directive 94/33/EC on the protection of young people at work, Article 1 of which states that Member States shall take the necessary measures to prohibit work by children."
"Ensuring the correct implementation of this directive is a matter for individual Member States and the Commission."
"Honourable Members have also raised concerns about health and safety and the environment."
"These are matters which the Council is concerned to take into account in all its policies."
"Any measures taken to modernize the textile and clothing industry in the European Union will need to comply with the Community's current rules on workers' health and safety and on protection of the environment."
"These would include, among others, the framework directive 80/1107/EEC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to chemical, physical and biological agents at work, and all the subsequent individual directives."
"Framework Council directive 89/391 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work and all the subsequent individual directives are also covered."
"Two other points were raised to which I want to respond directly."
"There was a suggestion and a concern that the European Parliament has not been given an opportunity to give its opinion."
"I know this Parliament will pass a resolution tomorrow and I will ensure that the Council considers this carefully before it considers its action programme at the Industry Council on 7 May."
"Members were concerned about market access."
"This is a key target for the action plan which asks for strict compliance with rules and disciplines under international agreements."
"In conclusion, the Commission communication has had the valuable effect of instigating a broad discussion around the idea of a genuine European strategy for the textile and clothing industry requiring the full participation of all Community institutions and bodies as well as Member States and social partners."
"In that context, the Council will not fail to take account of the opinions delivered here by the European Parliament on this subject."
"I look forward in particular to hearing your views during the course of this debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to be able to explain to you the Commission's position on the overall policy it is pursuing, or attempting to pursue, with regard to the textiles and clothing industry."
"I will reply successively to the different aspects of the questions which have been raised, either verbally or in writing, whilst trying to be as general as possible."
"Firstly, concerning the evaluation of financial aid given to the textiles and clothing industry, this sector does not receive aid from any arrangement which would be specific to it."
"We currently have a number of horizontal programmes: Retex, SME, ADAPT and Emploi , along with actions in the field of the targeted technologies and in traditional industries."
"The number of applications which are approved depends on the quality of the projects and the capacity for coordination between the industry and the social partners."
"With regard to all the Community initiatives, evaluation reports are currently underway, which should enable us to examine the impact of these initiatives on the modernization of the industrial fabric of the regions concerned and of the coherence of these objectives with industrial policy."
"Secondly, I want to mention sectoral adjustments, on the eve of the liberalization of world trade."
"I would first of all say that this liberalization has already occurred, and it resulted in a deep restructuring and modernization of the sector. However, overall, increases in productivity, the strengthening of competitive advantages, know-how, a high value added and innovation all allow the textiles and clothing industry to safeguard its dominant position in world trade, since the sector is the world's largest exporter of textile products and the third largest exporter of clothing."
"With regard to the measures envisaged to alleviate, at regional level, the social and economic consequences of restructuring efforts, let me state that numerous instruments are available to accompany and support transformations in this sector."
"I am thinking in particular of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, which play an important role in regions where the investment and social costs of restructuring are particularly high."
"That is the role of Retex, the role of the frameworks for Community initiatives or Community support frameworks."
"In addition, there are programmes for training workers to adapt to industrial change, which enable stable jobs to be preserved within the Union."
"On this subject, for the new programming which will cover the period 2000-2006, the Commission approved a draft regulation on 18 March, relating to general measures for the Structural Funds."
"In this draft, the Commission proposes, in particular, the implementation of a new Objective 2 which should support the economic and social redevelopment of regions faced with restructuring, especially those particularly affected by textile restructuring."
"These actions, which are currently being carried out through the framework of the Retex initiative, could be renewed in the context of the new Objective 2."
"The fourth issue is child labour."
"Let me remind you that Directive 94/37, relating to the protection of young people, forbids child labour in Member States."
"According to this directive, the minimum age is set at 15 or 16, according to the education system in place."
"Member States have had two years to transpose this directive into their national legislation."
"The Commission is currently examining the notifications of each Member State to see in which states this has been carried out and how the transposition has been effected."
"Furthermore, within the framework of social dialogue, the unions and management have signed a charter of good conduct relating to working conditions in the European textiles and clothing industry."
"The social partners have committed themselves to assuring the promotion of this code of conduct and to following up its progressive accomplishment, particularly through an annual evaluation."
"The fifth matter is the environment and public health."
"Clearly, they constitute a key factor in the modernization of the textiles and clothing industry."
"Nevertheless, it is appropriate to ensure that national legislations, which are sometimes different, do not create new and possibly unjustified technical obstacles to the running of the Community market."
"That is why the Commission is carrying out an examination of this issue, taking the greatest account, of course, of consumer protection and the environment."
"In certain cases, harmonization at Community level is insufficient, for example, this is the case with azo dyes."
"In other cases - I am thinking especially of heavy metals - the pursuit of analytical work is still necessary, and an evaluation of the health risks which could occur through the use of these dangerous substances is underway."
"Sixthly, can we quantify the necessary financial resources required for training in order to improve the competitiveness of the textiles sector?"
"The amount needed to restructure the sector cannot be specified by the Commission."
"Indeed, it is for the companies themselves to specify their financial needs for new investments and to use the amounts which are set aside for this purpose in the Structural Funds or within the framework of research and development programmes, or within the framework of Community initiatives such as ADAPT - ECU 1 400 000 000 - or Emploi , with the same amount."
"All of these programmes can provide close support to the changes in this industry, especially with regard to training."
"My seventh point concerns the questions by Mrs Ferrer and Mr Gasòliba to the Commission concerning the timetable set within the framework of Community initiatives, and concerning the action plan."
"In its action plan, the Commission described the initiatives which have been taken, and which are going to be taken, as a whole."
"May I remind you that these actions are the responsibility of Member States and the social partners, and thus the Commission cannot impose a precise timetable."
"The Commission is also in the process of establishing a set of performance indicators which will cover specific actions."
"On the basis of these indicators, the social partners, the Commission and the national political powers will evaluate the progress achieved, within the framework of a meeting which will be organized by the Commission's services at the end of this year."
"Developments in the sector over the last few years have highlighted a number of strong points and a number of weaknesses."
"The problem is integrating this new sector into the technological revolution and giving it a modern character."
"That is why, in its action plan, the Commission is convinced that the competitive advantage linked to innovation, creation, quality and know-how enable it to play the role of leader in the international markets, although over the last few years the sector has shown remarkable competitive performance."
"It holds the future, and that is why the strategy of industrial policy must take account of the specific characteristics of the textiles and clothing industry, whilst integrating it into an overall industrial strategy."
"And I will reply to Mr Novo Belenguer that its impact and its running have been widely discussed within working groups with all the economic operators involved in Europe."
"It is on the basis of these results that the Commission has drawn up a communication which outlines the guidelines of an action plan."
"This communication has been submitted to Parliament, to the Council and to the Economic and Social Committee, accompanied by an analytical table of the specific actions to be carried out between now and the year 2000."
"Finally, the last question involved financial action and support for research and development."
"With regard to Community activity, several areas are concerned. One of these is the social domain."
"In this aspect, it is clear that respect for basic labour law standards is essential."
"The Commission underlines the necessity of respecting these basic standards, whilst of course rejecting the protectionist purposes which some could be tempted to use them for."
"Finally, with regard to the environment, discussions are underway in the WTO's Committee on Trade and Environment."
"The Union is involved and is in the process of commencing an analysis of the environmental effects of trade liberalization and of the commercial effects of legislation in areas of concern to this sector."
"Lastly, in conclusion, let me say that, in the field of intellectual property, the Commission is currently participating in discussions concerning the application of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights agreements under the auspices of the World Trade Organization."
"Pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a joint motion for a resolution from seven political groups on oral questions relating to competition in the textiles and clothing industry."
"Can I say, Commissioner, that certainly the very rosy view that has been written for you by the textile unit in DGIII is not my personal experience of the textile sectors within my region and I am sure Mr Caudron will also have a different view from the French region that he represents."
"Indeed, every day I hear of job losses in the textile sector in the East Midlands which I represent and only last month I learned of another 350 jobs that have gone in a women's clothing and child wear sector in Huthwaite in Nottinghamshire."
"I have to say that the majority of these problems and restructuring come indeed from the strength of cost competition from developing countries."
"The cost advantages that these countries have will not go away."
"Markets are becoming increasingly liberalized as has been said by other Members in the debate, and this inevitably means that overseas competition will intensify."
"We cannot rely in the EU on traditionally high levels of tariff and quota protection."
"The European textile industry has global advantages and these must be developed and strengthened."
"Unfortunately, the Commission action plan does not go far enough in this direction."
"A recent study by the UK Government, which I am sure the President-in-Office may like to comment on, looked at benchmarking and our partnership with business with the textile industry."
"We looked at the world-class strength of the UK, we looked at fashion, design, IT, just-in-time techniques, and supply chains as Mr Ribeiro said, and we discovered that we can actually learn from other countries."
"For example, the Italians have successfully moved into overseas markets, based on their strength and customer service, and they have actually avoided competing head-on with low cost imports."
"Let me finally say that I believe that the Commission has an inconsistency in policy."
"I am very disappointed that the Commission, in its anti-dumping policy, does not always comply with Community interests."
"I feel that there must be more coherence by the Commission in how it approaches the needs of the textile industry."
"You must listen to the industry and when you take your decisions on anti-dumping you must listen to the Member States."
"When Members States vote 10 to 5 against anti-dumping procedures, which they believe will not be in the interest of the industry, then you and the Commission must accept those decisions."
"Therefore, I ask Council to take on board those issues in the Industry Council on 7 May."
"That is why we, as Socialists, have asked for the European Parliament to be associated with the anti-dumping investigation, for Parliament to have a role in terms of transparency and accountability, and not for the Commission to take unaccountable decisions counter to subsidiarity."
"Mr President, neither the Council's nor the Commission's comments correspond to reality, as one of my colleagues has said."
"Indeed, since 1992, 100 000 jobs have been lost every year."
"The crisis in the textiles industry is due essentially to management decisions to relocate and to an increase in imports, which as well as causing job losses have contributed to significant backwardness in the areas of training, research and equipment modernization."
"It is so much more practical to produce in a country with low salaries and a large supply of labour than to make improvements in machinery."
"A lack of purchase power has also led to a drop in consumption."
"However, the textiles industry is still an industry of the future, with more than two million people employed in 120 000 companies throughout Europe."
"Steps must therefore be taken, at both national and Community level, to put a stop to the haemorrhage of jobs and to contribute to the development of the textiles sector."
"The support planned for restructuring which Mr de Silguy mentioned does not reassure me."
"First of all, we must put a stop to the trend towards relocation, imports must be reduced, for they risk increasing even more with the Asian crisis and the progressive dismantling of the Multifibre Arrangements between now and the year 2005."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left proposes the establishment of social clauses within trade agreements."
"They could be in the form of a social anti-dumping tax on products reimported into the European Union by firms established in low wage countries, something which is rightly mentioned in paragraph 5 of the joint resolution."
"In any case, national and European public aid must be withdrawn from those companies which relocate."
"Indeed, if I have understood correctly, existing subsidies make up redundancy payments, which we cannot accept."
"In its communication, the Commission unfortunately follows the employers' recommendations, since its proposals aim at improving the competitiveness of companies, essentially, and finally, by putting pressure on the cost of labour and by developing flexibility, a solution which has been proved ineffective, as tax gifts also have."
"Thus, whilst eliminating distortions in competition and combating social dumping - and I would like to have the opinion of the Council and the Commission on the precise measures which are being envisaged in this area - it is also necessary at European level to commit substantial sums of money to encourage investment, research and development, training and equipment modernization."
"Preferential loans for those companies creating jobs should be established, European regulations, in particular the OPA, must be reviewed, and clearly at national level, an increase in purchase power would allow for an increase in consumption and would thus be a means of reviving the textile industry."
"In response, I would therefore like to have the Commission's opinion on these proposals and also on the level of funds committed, because we have not been given many details in this respect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I personally noted in my report on European industrial competitiveness that, in spite of everything, the textiles and clothing industry remains, for me, an important factor in European industry, in its power and its future."
"If I add to this the fact that this sector is established in areas which are beset by many serious difficulties, which began with the restructuring of the mining industry, the steel industry and now textiles, you can see how important this issue is and thus how serious this debate is in our regions."
"Before Mr Ribeiro's report on a textile action plan is even discussed in the House, we need to know the precise intentions of the Commission and the Council with respect to this industry and, by way of consequence, with respect to the regions which are struggling to find a way out from a deep economic and social, if not moral, crisis."
"The Commission's response to this question is vital, since we are told that hundreds of thousands of jobs are still under threat, in spite of the past loss of more than 600 000 jobs."
"Our regions have today reached their limit."
"And under such conditions, strong, clear, specific measures need to be implemented in favour of this sector to reduce the costs which weigh on jobs with a low added value."
"I will say this once again, it is also necessary to fight against the savage and economically unjustified relocations which are taking place."
"I know there is reluctance on the part of the liberalist purists, alarmed by the prospect of such aid."
"But it is the only way to combat the social dumping being practised by certain countries, which constitutes unfair competition for the European Union, its industry, its jobs and its social model."
"I am sure Mr Ribeiro's report will be an important document."
"It is just as important that the Commission and the Council move in this direction from now on."
"It is also a question of putting all the resolutions of the Luxembourg Employment Summit into practice, as well as the necessary and vital fight against unemployment which, we all know very well, strengthens a little the position of anti-European extreme right-wing nationalists throughout Europe."
"Mr President, facing the requirement to provide a positive answer to the problem of employment, the Luxembourg Employment Summit last November, and the Ecofin Council in the same period, pointed out, among other things, the possibility of intervening by lightening the tax or contribution burden in the highly labour-intensive sectors."
"In the manufacturing industry, textiles and clothing certainly constitute the most highly labour-intensive sector, particularly in terms of female labour."
"If we want to protect employment and the manufacturing sector, we need to be consistent with our declared objectives, without penalizing the workers and their wages."
"The Commission's action plan should therefore provide answers on how to meet the serious implication of the cost of labour on the overall costs in this sector."
"We also need to help highquality products by adopting a policy to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector, to increase the fashion content and the quality of the raw materials used."
"For this purpose, an integrated policy for spinning should be implemented in the areas involved and in the textiles and clothing districts such as the Carpi region, where I come from."
"We have often talked about equal opportunities in this Parliament."
"If we really want to promote employment, particularly for women, this is a sector to be defended and consolidated by the extension and positive administration of the Multifibre Arrangement, as well as rigorous controls at specialist points on the frontiers, to avoid the abuse of outward processing traffic."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have started discussing the Commission's action plan with regard to textiles and clothing, a plan which seems inadequate to deal with the problems in the sector."
"The proposals should be revised, improved and made more specific and feasible."
"Mr President, this resolution must not be interpreted as an open or covert demand for protectionist measures to reduce the EU's import of textile products."
"During the 1960s and 1970s Sweden's textiles and clothing industry, for example, was exposed to competition which led to an extensive shake-up and demands for change."
"The countries responsible for strong rises in exports included Portugal, Italy and Finland."
"These exporting countries demanded free trade in textile products and did not tolerate any departure from trade commitments, and Sweden also resisted domestic demands for trade restrictions."
"If the EU now resorted to trade barriers, such as by referring to social clauses or the need for anti-dumping measures, this would also damage EU countries which have already reformed their textiles industry to benefit from free trade."
"It would also reduce the scope for poor developing countries to participate in international trade."
"In the long term the whole of the EU would lose from protectionist intervention."
"If the EU resorted to import barriers, it would be met with counter measures from other countries."
"This would then hit the kind of production in the EU which has a higher processing value than textiles and which will provide more jobs for EU countries in the long term."
"Certainly there are cases of anti-dumping, but this argument is often misused when the real motive is pure protectionism. The same applies to social clauses."
"It is important to see the challenges for the regions exposed to demands for change."
"Coping with competition from new countries requires dynamic companies and flexible labour markets."
"The ability to implement changes and create new industries is the dynamic process which provides increased prosperity."
"That is our mission, Mr President, not trade barriers."
"Mr President, I will be brief, given the time and the fact that my earlier longer response anticipated a certain number of the questions which have been put to me."
"It is clear that the textiles industry is a highly sensitive sector."
"You do not have to tell me, Mrs Moreau, I am as aware of this fact as you."
"It is also a sector which has experienced considerable restructuring but which has subsequently greatly strengthened its competitiveness and is now making sure it is the world market leader."
"This said, of course, the future is not all rosy, I agree with you."
"That is why efforts must be continued, based principally on the establishment of an environment favourable to the development of businesses, in order to enable them to adapt and to draw on their assets, assets which include a high added value, innovation and quality."
"It is therefore up to the public authorities, essentially at national level in this respect, given the lack of content, at least in the French sense of the word, of the so-called industrial policy at Community level."
"Secondly, it is important that at European level the single market, the domestic market, is effectively put in place, for it is the size of the market alone which will finally enable each company to have greater potential for outlets at their disposal."
"Thirdly, and this seems important to me in relation to third countries, a policy which is both aggressive yet fair must be followed."
"When I say aggressive, I mean that when exporting, we must use all our abilities in international negotiations to ensure that the obstacles to trade which our companies encounter when they export may be removed."
"This is the challenge of past, and above all, future negotiations."
"With regard to imports, it is also vital to ensure that the rules are uniformly applied."
"I can assure you that in the area of antidumping, the Commission enforces the rules strictly and takes the decisions that it has to take."
"Mr Chanterie, you mentioned Russian carpets earlier."
"I seem to remember that not so long ago, measures were taken."
"I believe that with regard to Brazil, the Commission is examining the situation."
"Apart from that, I would refer you to what I said earlier regarding the means available within Community programmes."
"I am not going to discuss this again."
"Within the different aspects mentioned, the Community programmes enable the necessary support to be given to those European companies who so desire it and who fulfil the conditions, for them to continue their modernization efforts, which will enable them to develop and to make the most of their assets."
"I will end on a point concerning international organizations, that of the social clause."
"The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to this."
"My colleague Padraig Flynn knows this much more than I, particularly within the framework of the International Labour Organization and, as far as environmental clauses are concerned, as I noted earlier, these are currently the subject of in-depth studies, within the framework of the World Trade Organization's groups."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Apprenticeship training in Europe"
"The next item is the report (A4-0135/98) by Mr Castagnetti, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the promotion of European pathways for work-linked training, including apprenticeship ((COM(97)0572 - C4-0064/98-97/0321(SYN))."
"Mr President, this decision essentially has two objectives."
"The first is to promote the mobility of trainees, and in this sense it is included in the subject we are dealing with in this session: the euro helps us to integrate Europe even further, to bring the European Economic Area even closer, to consolidate the internal market, and therefore to consolidate an area in which the free movement of people and, in this context, the free movement of trainees, should actually be promoted."
"The other objective is to direct training increasingly at market and industry requirements, to provide answers to the changes requested, to make training a real start in the world of employment, and in this sense I believe that this measure also answers the numerous actions identified by the European Summit held last November in Luxembourg on combating unemployment."
"How can these objectives be promoted?"
"Through mobility: mobility between school and work, training mobility between one country and another, mobility between one occupation and another."
"Who are the people for whom this mobility is intended?"
"It is aimed at workers, young people in training and the training officers themselves, and through the promotion of mobility among young people in training, training officers, workers who lose their jobs and who must, and in some respects want, through training, to find another occupation, we will also achieve mobility, not only of training models but also of cultures and industrial techniques."
"Everyone, every young person, every apprentice moving from one country to another, from school to a company, also takes with him skills and cultures that are beneficial to the person taking him on."
"Articles 126 and 127 protect the independence of the academic and training regulations of the individual countries and in this sense this European pathway is seen as a means of training that is applied to existing programmes. It is not a new programme, it is a type of work-linked training, it is a means offered as an opportunity to the Member States and therefore implies voluntary acceptance."
"The preparatory work we have undertaken in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was first and foremost a discussion, to find out whether this decision answered the demand put by the social parties."
"We have discussed the matter with other Parliamentary committees, we have discussed the matter with other Community institutions, with the Economic and Social Committee, with Chambers of Commerce, with Craft Chambers in various European cities, with trade unions and with manufacturers' associations, and we have received a positive response."
"The Informal Council of Ministers of Education and Employment, held in London last March, confirmed this direction, in the sense that it confirmed the commitment to promote work-linked training through partnership experiences."
"In this spirit, the committee almost unanimously presented a series of amendments which I hope can be approved unanimously that substantially aim to create synergy between the incentives the Commission will have to produce and the actions of the national states, not in the spirit of a Commission that is not watchful and is limiting itself to recording what the Member States are doing but one that is encouraging and asking them to accept this proposal."
"These amendments aim to monitor, through the EURES network, the experience acquired in the past, its effectiveness and the existence of a network of companies prepared to accept young trainees."
"In short, we should use all the means the Community has established over the years."
"With these amendments, we also want to encourage an initiative taken by the Commission and the Member States to identify the most receptive production structures, in terms of the workforce, so that vocational training becomes increasingly more effective in creating actual jobs."
"With our amendments, we want to promote the actual application of this decision by urging all Member States to take part, even those that have not yet provided for training in their regulations."
"We want to guarantee security, the protection of these experiences in work places that are healthy and welcoming for our young people who adopt this system of work-linked training."
"We want to guarantee a minimum three-month period for this experience to ensure that there is no breach of the spirit of work-linked training and that it does not turn into educational tourism."
"We need actual workplace experience."
"In short, with this decision taken by the Commission and Council, our ambition is to start a process of modernization, of real Europeanization of knowledge and training processes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think in German the existence of the two words ""Lehrling ' , apprentice, and ""Auszubildender ' , trainee, in itself shows how diverse the reality is."
"We have expressions which apply to very different sets of circumstances."
"In fact, all that they have in common is that they do not involve a largely theoretical university qualification."
"However, despite this difference, we can define a few common areas."
"A European dimension will be required for all countries and European vocational training is a necessary doorway to mobility within the internal market, especially for those who have not gone to university."
"We must create incentives; we need a certificate that people can carry with them and produce when necessary, a Europass."
"We must have examinations and assessments to move ahead with this process."
"My colleague mentioned a whole range of other problems."
"As yet there is no common legal framework, but only a decision to promote one."
"We still have to achieve a guarantee of transparent quality."
"And, most importantly, we still have to mainstream the process and to guarantee equality of opportunity without discrimination. The Commission is also responsible for providing a regular report on this initiative to guarantee a minimum of progress."
"We all know that as long as practical and theoretical training are not integrated - and this may eventually come about - for the time being they are at least complementary access points."
"Implicit knowledge acquired through practice does not simply disappear, but it reinvents itself again and again hand in hand with technological progress."
"To this extent it is of key significance to offer training qualifications for those who do not graduate from university, and to provide these qualifications with a European dimension in the European internal market."
"There is a good deal of merit in what the Commission has so far achieved, but here in Parliament it is up to us move it forward and provide a structure for this process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal has the potential to encourage the development of apprenticeships with an added European value."
"It aims to provide opportunities for those who are taking part in work-linked training and their employers to benefit from the trainees or apprentices receiving part of their training in another Member State and for that training to be accredited."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, when considering this proposal for legislation, sought to make significant improvements and in his speech our rapporteur Mr Castagnetti has already explained some of the thinking behind his very helpful proposals."
"Perhaps I could highlight some of the issues which we would like the Council and Commission to consider."
"We think that this proposal should be seen and implemented as part of the whole package of measures that the EU is engaged in to encourage employment, education and training."
"Several amendments refer to the need for synergy between this measure and other Community programmes and initiatives."
"It is also very necessary to ensure that such European pathways are open to all groups and that there is real equality of opportunity built in."
"Since it is very likely that the majority of those who take up these opportunities will be young people, it is particularly important that health and safety aspects are considered."
"Young people at work or training in another European country will need a level of protection."
"We would also like to see the involvement of the social partners and small and micro businesses in this initiative."
"We want to see the provision of training for the mentors themselves and an agreement on the minimum period for placements of training."
"We certainly need effective systems of monitoring and evaluation and last, but by no means least, a Community budget."
"With the suggested improvements that have come forward from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, this scheme could improve both the mobility of apprentices and the quality of work-linked training received by apprentices and therefore make a contribution towards raising skills levels in the EU."
"Mr President, almost two years ago the Florence European Council called for a report from the Commission on the value of dual vocational training."
"In my country, this form of training has a long tradition."
"Knowledge is acquired, skills are learnt through training, social behaviour and the ability to integrate are learnt through practice."
"The very practical nature of dual training qualifies young people for the ever more complex demands of the labour markets and helps to reduce youth unemployment considerably."
"The basis for this is cooperation between schools and businesses."
"If it works and is constantly checked for new challenges from the point of view of education, organization and content, then the dual system has a future and offers a future to others."
"However, within Europe, dual systems are still different, as indicated by Mr Castagnetti in his excellent report, so we must bring them closer together, aiming for European vocational training channels whilst actively involving employers and employees."
"Measures in the Member States acquire a European added value at the same time as subsidiarity and responsibility for vocational training are preserved. This is made possible through intensive exchanges of information and experience, through implementing model projects and promoting mobility and trips abroad, tailor-made for individuals and financed by Community programmes such as the Leonardo da Vinci programme."
"Today we are debating and tomorrow we will adopt two important issues simultaneously."
"Firstly, there is the convergence report on the euro and the Member States."
"But we are also looking at part of the future of vocational training."
"If everything goes according to plan, from 1 January 1999 we will have a single currency and a common vocational training programme."
"The path from the internal market to the European domestic market involves small steps as well as large ones."
"Mr President, I too would like to welcome the Commissioner to the House and to pay tribute to him and to Mr Castagnetti for their initiative on this proposal for the promotion of European pathways for work-linked training including apprenticeship."
"There are 18 million long-term unemployed in Europe at the moment."
"Yet, in any country in Europe there are employers and businesses crying out for staff and they claim they cannot get them."
"This is not just because of low wages nor just because of lack of social protection."
"It is because of a lack of skills and a lack of work-related skills."
"We are in the process of ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty which includes a special chapter on unemployment and we are introducing this new coordinated path of having national employment plans submitted to Brussels to be assessed by the Commission and evaluated at the end of the first year."
"So we must guarantee that we can deliver real skills and real training to people to allow them to get real jobs, not simply massage the figures to take them off the unemployment statistics for a few months."
"Between 1994 and 1999 the state-training agency in Ireland received £428 million for vocational training and education."
"This had a dramatic impact on improving the available workforce to the growing industrial base and services base in Ireland."
"From an Irish point of view it is essential that this funding continue after the year 2000 and up to the year 2006."
"It is also essential that we look at new models and new ways of training, and that we create this synergy between the employers, the trade unions and the unemployed themselves to develop the best models for coping for them."
"In Ireland at the present time there are 14 000 apprentices of which about 11 400 are in the new system of standard-based apprenticeship and roughly 2 600 in the old system which was time-based."
"It is essential that we in Parliament and the Commission, keep our minds, and our ears and our eyes open, for new ways of tackling the unemployment problem."
"Finally, I should like very briefly to quote the following: ' Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for life' ."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Castagnetti on his excellent work and also express my appreciation to the Commission for the initiative taken."
"One of the problems faced by all Member States in attempting to promote employment among young people is that of promoting and encouraging closer cooperation between schools and businesses, and this is also one of the objectives contained in the White Paper on the learning society."
"The Institute of Apprenticeship, while operating under various procedures in the various Member States, is considered a privileged meeting place between these two worlds and therefore a sector for priority intervention by the Union."
"The mobility of students, workers, teachers, training officers and trade unionists throughout Europe has had a great boost in Europe on account of the Commission's incentives, provided through programmes such as PETRA, COMETT and FORCE in the past, or Leonardo and Socrates today."
"This trend should be supported, or rather encouraged, with particular reference to the placement of students in industry and the requirements of work-linked training for apprentices."
"However, alongside the essential quantitative increase in mobility, we also need to provide a counterbalance in terms of quality in the consensual determination of rules and behaviour able to guarantee the educational efficacy of placements and exchanges."
"We should therefore welcome the proposal we are debating today on the establishment of the ""European pathways' programme and the ""EUROPASS' certificate intended to establish specific quality standards for the promotion and achievement of placements and to introduce the practice of certification within a modus operandi that is currently too deregulated and lacking in guarantees for those taking part."
"However, this proposal is not enough in itself to resolve all the problems and remove all the obstacles connected with mobility in the area of work-linked training."
"The Commission has recognized this and has announced that, within the context of the new Leonardo programme, it wants to create an ERASMUS for apprenticeship to facilitate mobility in this area."
"Not only do we need to create an ERASMUS for apprenticeship, but we also need to provide the social security resources to enable the mobility of apprentices and set up a monitoring system, as the rapporteur said in his speech."
"As the European Parliament, we will ensure that the Commission keeps its promises, in the context of the proposed training and educational programmes for future generations."
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that the superb report by Mr Castagnetti is a milestone on the way to better youth employment. The report highlights two core elements."
"One is the mobility of young people, which must be increased in order to increase their opportunities."
"The second is the actual qualification and the quality of training. This must generally be raised, especially in the area of qualifications for skilled workers, and this is an issue that has been mentioned here many times."
"Without doubt, mobility will be increased by the proposals, by means of mutual recognition, documenting vocational training in a Europass and pulling down bureaucratic barriers."
"The other element is dual training which will increase quality."
"One problem is the fact that we are training far too many young people for the wrong careers."
"In my country, we train up to 80 % of young people for only eleven careers, so the chances of finding an adequate job are correspondingly low."
"I would, therefore, like to add a proposal to this excellent report, a proposal which might bring us one more step forward. We should request that the Commission draws up an annual qualitative occupational needs analysis, which highlights what the labour market really requires in the medium and possibly also in the longer term."
"This information should then be made available to countries as a service, to give them something to use on a voluntary basis as a point of reference."
"This would mean that they could adjust or convert their vocational training systems so that later, young people would really be trained to meet actual demand in the labour market."
"That could be an additional incentive: to train young people to meet precisely this demand and give them the opportunity to find their first job."
"This would open up a whole new approach."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Castagnetti for the excellent work he has done in preparing this report."
"There are two dimensions to sandwich courses and apprenticeship training: the financial and the socio-economic, and they complement each other."
"On the other hand, it is important to stress that small and medium-sized companies have a special role as employers."
"The viability of this sector will have large-scale effects on European prosperity and the employment of the young."
"That is why common resources must be put into this sector, enabling it to offer apprenticeships and places for young trainees."
"Mr Castagnetti also outlines a process for linking this with the work of the labour market organizations."
"The Commission should mention in its proposal just how important the role of the employers' associations is."
"This latter has been underrated for a long time now as a fully-fledged participant in social dialogue within the Union."
"Harmonizing apprenticeship systems also means broader aims for harmonization in examinations."
"Successfully getting the young into work and making the free movement of the workforce viable will require exams to follow a pattern that is common to all Europe in terms of their structure, length, content and degree of difficulty."
"The main responsibility for the harmonization of exams and the training and apprenticeship periods that go with them belongs to the authorities in the Member States of the Union."
"Only through direct cooperation and sharing information can the necessary confidence be created to form a basis for the general responsibility of the European nations for exams."
"It is no advantage to European educational systems that so-called reliable standards have always been, as it were, handed down from on high."
"Mr President, let me straight away thank Mr Castagnetti for his great efforts on this report and all those who contributed to the debate."
"The aim of the proposal to the Parliament and the Council for the decision on the promotion of the European pathways for work-linked training, including apprenticeships, the Commission's objective is to promote mobility of people in training in Europe whatever their age ."
"This was particularly remarked upon by Mr Castagnetti and I support him."
"This corresponds to three major thrusts of Community policy: completing the internal market, building a citizens' Europe and creating a Europe of knowledge."
"In all of these three aspects mobility of people under-going training is so very important."
"The Community's experience of bi-lateral and multi-lateral cooperation between Member States, demonstrates clearly that there is a keen demand for training at all levels, including higher education."
"Between 1995 and 1997 the Leonardo da Vinci programme has enabled 100 000 people to receive support for a period of training in another Member State."
"On this basis of the experience which has been build up and in view of the strong growth in need and demand, it is important for us now to increase this mobility and to ensure that it is as fruitful as possible."
"To do this we must agree at European level on a common quality framework to develop real European pathways of training and to increase their visibility."
"The proposal which is based on Article 127 of the Treaty has a two-fold purpose."
"Firstly, it seeks to define the content and shared general quality principles for periods of work-linked training in another Member State, linked to the training which the person concerned is following in country which she or he comes from."
"Secondly, it aims to ensure that the training is more easily understood and has a higher profile thanks to a certificate known as the Euro Pass Training which validates the work or training experience acquired."
"As Mr Castagnetti has pointed out, it is also linked of course to the European Union's employment policy and the guidelines which were agreed at the Job Summit last November."
"I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the Members of the House, and especially Mr Castagnetti, rapporteur for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, for your suggestions."
"The Commission has noticed, the interest which this proposal has generated in other committees: the Committee for Culture, Youth, Education and the Media for which Mr Kerr was the rapporteur; the Budget Committee with Mr Bösch and the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy with Mr Skinner, all of whom I would like to thank."
"Parliament proposed 28 Amendments, 26 of which can be accepted including Amendment No 28 in part."
"These amendments improve our proposal and in some cases even reinforce it."
"I would mention in particular the amendments which highlight the role of SMEs and crafts in developing work-linked training, because the specific character of these types of business requires particular conditions, and those which stress the social partners and the other parties involved in the apprenticeships."
"Then there are the amendments which aim to promote good information and wider based support systems for those European pathways such as health care, safety in the workplace and languages."
"I would like to thank Mrs Waddington, who drew our attention to this element which is a key factor for their success."
"Thirdly, there are amendments which stress the voluntary character of the implementation of the European pathways."
"The Commission is conscious of the diversity of polices in the Member States and this proposal does not seek to modify either the organization or the content of training systems and machinery in the Member States."
"On the other hand, the two Amendments relating to duration could pose some difficulties."
"I have in mind Mr Castagnetti's Amendment No 19 which specifies that the overall duration should not be less than three months and Mr Ettl's Amendment No 21 which seeks to ensure that the pathways should not lengthen the period of training provided for in the Member State of origin."
"I understand the concerns underlying these Amendments, no one wants these European pathways to amount to mere tourism, as was referred to in the contributions."
"We must be sure that they provide periods of real quality training."
"This is why the Commission proposes that their duration should be closely linked to the objectives of the European pathway and to the skill to be acquired."
"All this must be specified in advance in an agreement between the sending partner, host partner and the beneficiary."
"The diversity of systems, the specificity of particular branches of activity, but also the wide range of durations suggested in the course of the debate, show the difficulty of fixing a minimum duration."
"To conclude Mr President, I can assure you that what you propose for the future, particularly regarding the new programmes, and with a special emphasis on the Leonardo da Vinci programme, will be very carefully considered."
"This latter programme must increasingly promote mobility for people engaged in work-linked training and become as my colleague Edith Cresson has said on more than one occasion an 'Erasmus for trainees.'"
"Thank you, Commissioner Flynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Supplementary pension rights"
"The next item is the report (A4-0134/98) by Mr Ettl, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the European Union (COM(97)0486 - C4-0661/97-97/0265(CNS))."
"Mr President, I am speaking instead of the rapporteur tonight."
"Sadly, he cannot be with us. He has to attend to important business in Austria."
"That is a pity because he has produced excellent work in the form of this report."
"In fact, it is a mark of the success of his work as rapporteur that the report was adopted unanimously in committee."
"Just one point of difference remained which had not been adequately addressed in the vote and that is now covered here in plenary in the form of Amendment No 18 with the full backing of the Socialist, EPP and Liberal Groups."
"That degree of consensus is not arrived at easily; it requires hard work, and I should like to congratulate Harald Ettl for the success of that work."
"The proposal concerns the safeguarding of the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed workers moving within the European Union."
"As such, it concerns an important practical step towards giving realization to freedom of movement."
"That freedom of movement for workers is enshrined in the Treaty but in practice a mass of real practical difficulties stand in the way of its proper realization."
"One such practical difficulty concerns the shortcomings in the coordination of supplementary pension schemes between the Member States and the fundamentally different weightings of state and supplementary social insurance systems in the various Member States."
"These pose very real obstacles to freedom of movement."
"This proposal will not remove all the difficulties by any means."
"Those difficulties have to be seen against the backdrop of the Commission's 1997 Green Paper on supplementary pensions; that itself arose from the failure of a proposal for a directive on the freedom of management and investment of pension funds which was submitted in 1992 and then withdrawn."
"That was followed by a 1995 directive attempting to tackle some of these difficulties."
"That was itself stalled after reaching the Commission, much to Commissioner Flynn's frustration at the time."
"That in turn led to the establishment of a high-level panel of experts on the freedom of movement of persons chaired by Mrs Simone Weil."
"All of these various attempts have focused on three main difficulties facing workers in relation to freedom of movement and supplementary pensions."
"The first is the long qualifying periods which are necessary in some Member States for acquiring pension rights."
"It is clear that several years' employment in a company is required before an employee acquires rights, that is an obstacle to free movement."
"The second is the transferability of pension rights and the third is the issue of double taxation."
"An interim report of the Weil Group in November 1996 focussed on an approach which offered at least a start to the solving of some of these difficulties."
"The approach suggested in that interim report is followed in the proposal we are considering here tonight."
"It restricts itself to securing the principle of equal treatment for migrant workers."
"It places emphasis on the preservation of rights of migrant workers as opposed to the transferability of rights from one scheme to another."
"There are four main component to the proposal."
"The first is in Article 4 which ensures that the vested rights of members of a scheme are preserved when the member of the scheme moves to another Member State."
"Article 5, the second component, ensures that members of the scheme who live in another Member State receive payments in respect of all benefits to which they are entitled under the scheme."
"The third component concerns the situation of workers posted abroad. That is dealt with in Article 6 and 7."
"The final component - which will be very important - is contained in Article 8. That requires the managers of pension schemes to provide all relevant information for scheme members wishing to exercise their right to move to another Member State."
"All these provisions are important."
"The main amendments submitted in the report from Harald Ettl, is Amendment No 4."
"It draws attention to the fact that this directive can only be seen as a first step towards the regulation of the supplementary pension system within the Member States of the Union and says that where necessary the Council in future will need to adopt further acts on waiting periods and the general and cross-frontier transferability of vested pension rights."
"This proposal is a step in the right direction."
"I hope the Commission will take particular account of Amendment No 4 and I congratulate the rapporteur on his work."
"Mr President, I believe that, as Mr Hughes said, this proposal can only be considered to be a first step because it is a proposal for a restrictive directive in relation to the significance of the problem, which is to ensure effective mobility of workers, according them status of some importance."
"It is true that Amendment No 4 aims at pension rights held, that is, acquired rights; unfortunately, however, one amendment proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has not been accepted. This lay somewhere between the long periods laid down by some states, and the overly short periods laid down by others, and adopted the solution of the high-level panel, chaired by Mrs Simone Veil, which proposed five years."
"However, the Commission's proposal takes its idea from an amendment, or rather adopts it, of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the interpretation of Regulations Nos 1408/71 and 574/72, that is Amendment No 1."
"This is very important because it offers an additional framework, from the legal point of view, between this proposal and the regulations the Commission had interpreted too rigidly, providing an interpretation connected with the compulsory pension schemes."
"In fact, by replacing ""only' with ""primarily' , Amendment No 1 opens the way to supplementary voluntary, contractual pensions and therefore an integration that harmonizes the legislation fairly adequately."
"In my opinion, this is therefore a positive proposal overall, which we should naturally see incorporated into the Green Paper which this Parliament will soon receive and which will constitute the mosaic in which the central problem will be situated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to explain the position of the Socialist group."
"As our chairman has already said, this report was adopted unanimously in committee and there is broad consensus amongst all the groups in the House on this issue."
"I would, therefore, like to start by thanking Harald Ettl for his very hard work on this very complicated issue."
"And we should not forget the panel of experts chaired by Simone Veil which deserves thanks for its excellent work for Parliament and, I hope, also for the Commission's legislative proposals, as we are particularly keen to hear these."
"At the moment, around 300 000 men and women are working within the Member States of the EU in a different country from the one they previously lived in."
"Actually, this figure is much less than we once thought, and we have assumed from the beginning of the internal market that it would increase."
"There are many reasons for this, certainly some individual, but also some political ones."
"It is our task to look at the political reasons."
"They are an issue which we have covered in great depth in recent months, especially in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Women's Rights."
"The issue has been debated in detail in recent months in Parliament, and we are becoming ever more aware that national regulations and provisions raise an incredible number of obstructions; I would almost go so far as to say they amount to harassment."
"This is one of the political reasons for the situation."
"The second reason, Commissioner Flynn, and I will say this openly, is that in the past the Commission was somewhat hesitant and sluggish in dealing with this issue; any progress made was blocked by the Council - the same old story."
"However, a small step has been taken and it is a good one."
"In any case, it will ensure that employees in Europe will not be worse off if they make use of the freedom of movement which they have been guaranteed."
"Of the three pillars of pension provision, the company supplementary pension scheme is still relatively small, especially in my country; in Germany it makes up less than 5-7 % of contracts."
"But we know that in future these supplementary schemes will have a more important role than they had in the past."
"What must be important to us is that..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I welcome the proposal of the Commission."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Ettl for his objective and balanced report."
"He describes clearly the issue of migrant workers who under certain circumstances face reduced entitlement to supplementary pensions if they work in different Member States. This naturally has a negative impact on the freedom of movement and often on necessary mobility."
"In past years there were repeated calls for the supplementary systems to be assigned to Regulation No 1408, which previously only applied to the statutory social insurance schemes of migrant workers."
"The multiplicity of supplementary pension schemes simply does not permit a straightforward addition of periods of contribution payments, as is the case under 1408."
"This proposal for a directive contains only some initial steps - as several speakers have indicated - towards a common approach to supplementary schemes."
"I would prioritize their urgency and the need for them as follows: firstly, protection of entitlement already acquired from company or supplementary pension schemes; secondly, transnational payments of pensions from company pension schemes, in other words, exportability of benefits as envisaged in Regulation No 1408; thirdly, the establishment of special arrangements for short-term employment postings to other Member States."
"Mr Ettl's report sets out the objectives of the directive better and replaces imprecise definitions."
"The directive contains some of the measures proposed in the Green Paper on supplementary pensions."
"In addition, the Green Paper places particular emphasis on enabling transnational investment in pension funds, thereby improving freedom of movement."
"This type of fund already plays an important role in several EU Member States."
"In my own country, Germany, we have just started to develop these. However a key to the new asset policy which so many parties are striving for is to make shares in this kind of unit trust attractive, particularly to employees with lower incomes, by extending the statutory range of investment facilities beyond asset formation by employees."
"In my view, profit-sharing from property ownership for employees is an important way forward, if not as a second pillar alongside statutory pensions, then as supplementary income in old age."
"The Ettl report does not cover this perspective of course, but rightly concentrates on the proposal for a directive from the Commission and improves it in some important points."
"For this reason, the Group of the European People's Party will vote for the report."
"Mr President, this report deals principally with the cross-frontier transferability of pensions, and it has been rightly pointed out by a number of my colleagues that it is a first step and that the directive is in fact a rather limited one."
"I was actually rather taken by what Mr Ferri said in his report on the free movement of workers, that this requires a completely different approach to the transferability of pensions."
"I think we will have to sort this out when we are dealing with the Green Paper, as the entire issue will obviously come up again there."
"Nonetheless, in his written contribution Mr Ettl has pointed to problems, such as double taxation and in some countries the long qualifying periods for pensions, which should be consigned to the past."
"You cannot tell workers that their behaviour should be more flexible on the one hand, and tie them down on the other - and I say this to Mrs Menrad in particular - with extremely long qualifying periods."
"To be honest, I think this is a form of theft from the worker."
"We should have the courage to resolve this from within Europe."
"A number of issues have been improved by this report, in particular with regard to the definition of posting, I believe good proposals have been made."
"I hope the Commission will want to adopt them."
"I would also like to thank Mr Ettl sincerely for his admirable cooperation, and I hope our chairman, Mr Hughes, will pass this on, because I believe that the cooperation in this case has been excellent."
"But, again, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, Commissioner, this is really only a first step on the way to solving an issue which we have to solve with regard to pensions."
"The Commission can expect a great deal from us if we are able to cooperate as we are doing in this Parliament at present."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Ettl in his absence for a good report."
"In general, I can surely say that I believe the pension system is something which is being discussed in all Member States, in view, among other things, of the rising proportion of elderly, which means that more or less all pension systems need to be revised, especially state ones."
"We are not discussing that here today, but these systems are the most important, and I would like to emphasize that for our citizens."
"It is the supplementary pensions that are being discussed here."
"As a previous speaker said, they are becoming increasingly important."
"The problem with supplementary pensions is, above all, the difficulties with regard to the single market and the restrictions which exist in terms of the freedom of movement."
"This is discussed in part in the Commission's proposal, which says that workers who are sent abroad by their employer should be able to belong to the system which they belonged to before."
"Guarantees are also given that they will be informed of their right to a pension and the rules which exist in the EU when they move."
"These are of course, as several others have said, important proposals."
"However, they are not enough and are only a first step."
"The difficulties which Mr Ettl has pointed out, the long earning periods, the problems of transferability and the question of double taxation are issues which must be raised in future and supplemented in future proposals from the Commission in order for freedom of movement to be realized."
"Meanwhile, I am of course supporting this proposal, which is a good one, but it is important to emphasize again that this is a first step."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have contributed."
"I should preface my remarks by saying that you are all quite right."
"This is just a start, a very small start, and it must be followed up in due course by further proposals."
"In that context I should like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"Even though he is absent, Mr Hughes has done an excellent presentation on his behalf."
"I thank all of you for the excellent work done here."
"We are all allies in the task of removing obstacles to free movement related to supplementary pensions and making progress towards achieving a fundamental principle of the Treaty."
"The purpose of this proposal for a Council directive on which your opinion is requested is to provide protection as regards supplementary pension schemes for the pension rights of workers and members of their families who move from one Member State of the European Union to another."
"This proposal takes into account the conclusions of the high level panel on free movement chaired by Mrs Weil."
"It constitutes a first step in removing identified obstacles in this area."
"The proposal will have a positive affect on labour market mobility since workers will be less hindered from going to work in another Member State."
"Similarly, the proposal will make it easier for companies who wish to second workers within their organization to work in another Member State."
"As emphasized in the 1997 Green Paper on supplementary pensions and the single market, supplementary pension schemes play an important role as a second pillar of social security which complements the protection provided by the statutory schemes."
"As more and more Union citizens turn to these supplementary pension schemes as a way of guaranteeing adequate income in their retirement, protection of the rights in these schemes becomes more important."
"In this Green Paper the Commission looked at several issues, a number of which are intended to deepen the analysis of obstacles to free movement and are outside the scope of this present proposal."
"In particular, it addressed the question of long vesting periods, difficulties with transferability of vested pension rights and tax difficulties linked to acquiring pension rights in more than one Member State."
"The proposal before us today, once adopted, should form the basis for renewed political effort to remove the remaining obstacles."
"And that is the key point."
"This is the start."
"It must lead on to further efforts to remove the obstacles."
"I can accept eleven of your amendments in the belief that this will enable the Commission proposal to go ahead and to be adopted by the Council."
"We hope this is going to happen in June under the United Kingdom presidency."
"The amendments the Commission is willing to accept are as follows: Nos 2 and 3 in principle, part of No 4 and Amendments Nos 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, 13, 14 and 17."
"These amendments clarify the existing provisions and reflect the concerns of Parliament about legal certainty and its commitment to further action to be taken to remove the remaining obstacles to free movement."
"Amendment No 1 raises some technical legal complications that require further consideration."
"So I must reserve the Commission's position on this amendment for today."
"I must also reserve our position on Amendment No 18 which I have seen for the very first time tonight and which would seem to require some very careful consideration."
"I cannot accept Amendments Nos 10, 11, 12 or 15 because these restrict the scope of the proposal."
"Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 12 restrict the personal scope of the directive."
"Amendment No 15 restricts the material scope of the directive since the trans-border affiliation for posted workers provided for by Article 6 should be limited only in schemes of comparable entitlement in the host Member State and in the country of origin."
"As far as Amendment No 16 is concerned, it cannot be accepted at this stage because it goes beyond the aim of Article 7 to which it refers."
"You will note that Article 7 deals with taxation aspects of supplementary pensions contributions made on or behalf of a posted worker."
"This is the most sensitive aspect of the proposal for which a political agreement in the Council is going to be very difficult to achieve anyway."
"The tax aspects of supplementary pensions need a broader approach in order to find suitable solutions to the existing problems and by avoiding additional and simultaneous double taxation for persons moving within the European Union."
"These tax aspects are under discussion with all involved parties in the context of the Green Paper."
"I trust that on this basis we can consider that we have a political agreement and that the Commission proposal can go forward for adoption by the Council, as amended following the adoption of Parliament's opinion."
"I look forward to making further advances on this matter at a later date."
"Thank you, Commissioner Flynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Mr President, you have chaired this evening's sitting very fairly, so I would again like to point out that my group applied for three minutes for me, otherwise I would have planned my speech very differently."
"Secondly, there was no red light after two minutes were up."
"I would be grateful if you could take note of this."
"I should explain, Mrs Weiler, that according to my notes here your speaking time was two minutes."
"So far during this debate, you are the Member who has gone furthest over the allotted speaking time."
"That is why I had to interrupt you, because you were already over your time-limit by a third."
"We are probably both right, but that is what happened and I wanted to explain it to you."
"Judgments in matrimonial matters"
"The next item is the report (A4-0131/98) by Mr Verde i Aldea, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the draft Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (13245/97 - C4-0063/98-97/0918 (CNS))."
"Draftsman of the opinion: Mrs d'Ancona, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs (Hughes Procedure)."
"Mr President, 30 years ago the then European Economic Community realized that increased international trade meant that the Member States of that Community had to reach a convention to determine competence and how to implement sentences in contractual matters."
"Contracts were - and are increasingly so today - international contracts, especially in the Union, and that convention was absolutely necessary."
"It was drawn up in the form of a convention because the Community had no competence in that area."
"Thirty years later, we can say that that 1968 Brussels Convention, under the jurisdictional tutelage of the Court of Justice, has progressed satisfactorily during that time."
"Having reached this point, the Member States have realized that there is another area too - that of the freedom of movement of persons - which has given rise to a situation of transfers and contacts between the different countries within the Union, which has led to increasing numbers of marriages between nationals of different Member States."
"At the same time, another phenomenon has arisen - maybe not parallel, but also on the increase: the phenomenon of marriage breakdown, with sentences of divorce, separation, annulment and so on."
"The Council has realized this and has now presented this draft convention on matrimonial matters, under the guidelines of what is beginning to be a Community competence - judicial cooperation - which so far involves Articles K of the Treaty on European Union."
"The Council is not here for this debate, so I do not have to make any very profound remarks to try to convince them of the value of our amendments. However, I will say that Parliament and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights have been inclined to accept this convention."
"We know it has been debated at length in the Council because this question has given rise to tensions between Member States, - especially between the Nordic countries, which also have a convention and have done so for a long time, and others. The effect has been to make this an extremely delicate text, and any amendment could once again call into question the whole convention."
"The amendments presented by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights - where they were approved almost unanimously - do not attempt to make any great change to the convention."
"There was a proposal from the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to try to achieve a new convention, with a view to the forthcoming implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"But obviously, the Amsterdam Treaty is not in force, so it is better to base things on the current competences of each of the institutions."
"So I have restricted myself to accepting some of the amendments from that committee."
"Mr President, the amendments are certainly not an attempt to change the convention."
"They try to clarify some important points."
"I will only mention one of them, which would create a special article concerned with questions of language and how these declarations have to be notified."
"And on that point, which may seem the most innovative, I want to mention that there is a Commission proposal along almost the same lines, which refers to the Brussels Convention."
"It seems to me that if the innovation is valid for that convention, it would be a good thing to make use of it for this one too."
"Those are the outlines, Mr President, of this convention. I hope the Council will take account of the thoughts we have expressed verbally and in writing - they are thoughts rather than amendments - and that one way or another, and as quickly as possible, the convention will reach a happy conclusion and can be published in the Official Journal and enter into force as soon as possible, because society really needs it."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Verde i Aldea for his studious and thorough work."
"This is an important plank in judicial cooperation and a major subject of human interest."
"The proposal seeks to alleviate the difficulties experienced by couples in seeking to extract themselves from failed or unsatisfactory marriages and other legal relationships where there is a cross-border element."
"It also covers children of such marriages."
"This draft convention known as the Brussels II Convention applies to civil proceedings with divorce, legal separation and marriage annulments and civil proceedings relating to parental responsibility over a child of both spouses."
"Like the Brussels Convention, it assures that a court order obtained in one Member State should be recognized in another Member State without any special procedure."
"Similarly a child parental authority judgment given in one Member State can be enforced in another Member State."
"It is especially important with increasing cross-border marriages and mobility of people and the need to protect children of such marriages."
"Finally, I should like to thank the UK Presidency and. In particular, a former colleague on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, now a minister in the Lord Chancellor's Department, Mr Hoon, and the Lord Chancellor for piloting this important judicial cooperation reform."
"Like Mr Verde i Aldea, in the name of my group I should like to support the amendments he has proposed."
"I thank him again for his work."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to thank Mr Verde i Aldea for this very important piece of legislation, in particular as it relates to a very human issue and, one which is increasing and poses problems for many of us."
"On behalf of my group I should like to say that my group congratulates Mr Verde i Aldea for his report."
"I give my group's official position first, after which I will make a couple of points myself as the President's mediator for transnationally abducted children."
"The group considers Amendments Nos 3, 6 and 10 as very important."
"They refer to points D, E and F. The group is against the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs because it was adopted without formal procedure."
"It was announced as a letter even on the agenda of the Civil Liberties Committee on the day of adoption and no deadline was fixed for amendments."
"It is against Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 8 for legal reasons."
"The two previous speakers have outlined the history and need for this Convention."
"I hope very much that it will get unanimous support from Parliament."
"The reason why I have asked to speak particularly tonight is because one of the amendments refers to my role as the mediator for the President of the European Parliament on transnationally abducted children."
"Amongst the many difficulties we are facing in this area is the very frequent refusal of courts from one Member State to recognize judgments made in another."
"This has a two-fold effect."
"It often prolongs very real human misery but as far as I am concerned one of the major problems it provokes is that of the abduction of children."
"There is a genuine human fear at the heart of many of these abductions of a child."
"We must be able to reassure both parents, either the custodial parent or the non-custodial parent, that they can rely on the support of the courts in their own country and the courts of the country where a child may be living to ensure that they will have access to their children."
"Very often this fear of the loss of a child results in an abduction."
"Sometimes there is not just one abduction but even two and, in extreme circumstances, even three."
"That is to say, one partner abducts, the other abducts and then the other abducts again."
"We must arrive at some form of genuine cooperation between the courts; there are a great many areas in the legal systems in all of our countries that need to be carefully reassessed in the light of this very difficult and growing problem."
"That having been said, I accept that not only do we need the legal underpinning that your excellent report gives us but we also need considerably more training for the judges in all our countries."
"Obviously I would very much like to see it in non-Union countries as well, where we experience very considerable difficulties, in particular in the North African countries, when children are abducted."
"The report recognizes pragmatically the realities of a very recently introduced divorce law in Ireland and also historical realities which relate to the annulment of marriages and agreements with the Holy See."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and congratulate him."
"Mr President, we are all familiar with the difficult situations people find themselves in when they become the victim of separation, divorce or annulment lawsuits, if they are the respondent and do not share the nationality or residence rights of the plaintiff. Then there are those distressing situations caused by the failure to comply with resolutions accompanied by provisional and precautionary measures, the effectiveness of which depends on the speed with which they are implemented."
"Such situations mean that the respondent is put in an almost defenceless position when the plaintiff makes use of their own law, and there is real injustice when the resolutions not complied with involve alimony."
"It is our duty to put an end to that situation."
"It is necessary and even urgent to put a stop to it as soon as possible. Very well-argued doubts have been expressed about the urgent need for this draft convention, but I do not go along with them."
"But even recognizing the urgent need to resolve these flagrant problems, it has to be said that this draft convention is ambiguous and limited, although I think it has been markedly improved by the amendments approved in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, especially those by Mr Verde i Aldea."
"It could be said in its favour that ""half a loaf is better than none' . However, it would have been better to have been more ambitious in this case, not just clarifying things but extending the scope, to include for example the financial obligation between marriage partners, and between them and their children."
"It is regrettable that this has been a wasted opportunity, in part. Nevertheless, I congratulate Mr Verde i Aldea."
"Mr President, it could be argued with the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs that this is not an appropriate time for this Council initiative in view of the ongoing ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam and in view too of the current revision of the Brussels Convention of 1968."
"However, I take a different view and thank the rapporteur for showing us the merits of this initiative."
"The draft has a clear legal basis in Article K.3."
"Its definitions are narrow and rigid, but clear, and despite the tight framework - here I refer to Mrs Banotti's speech -, it takes account of children's rights which are particularly worthy of protection."
"As it aims to replace existing conventions, it represents an important step towards Union civil law."
"Parliament, therefore, should follow the proposal of the Committee on Legal Affairs and its motions for an amendment and support this important Council initiative for a European Union civil law."
"Mr President, I am one of those who has long argued that it is unreasonable for it to be possible in the European Union to be regarded as married in one Member State and as divorced in another."
"I therefore warmly welcome the report by Mr Verde i Aldea on the Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters."
"The convention is a concrete example of what we at EU level can achieve to improve the quality of life of citizens, families and children within the Union."
"It is natural that questions of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement are brought to a head when countries move closer together."
"Closer cooperation leads to increased contact and relationships between individuals, institutions and companies."
"Consequently, there is also an increase in the number of disputes which cross the home country's borders."
"In 1968 the Member States of the Union decided on a convention which regulates the question of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of civil law judgements."
"It is aimed, above all, at companies and other financial operators."
"However, matrimonial and custody questions were entirely excluded."
"Since then, developments have gone towards citizens coming increasingly into the centre of the cooperation."
"The free movement of persons is an objective which today has largely become a reality."
"More and more citizens are marrying citizens from other Member States. More and more are like us in that they choose for various reasons, for longer or shorter periods, to live or work in a Member State other than their own."
"This is of course a welcome development."
"It is therefore natural to also develop the framework for international civil law."
"An objective for us must be that disputes between individuals which involve the legal systems of more than one Member State can be resolved quickly and efficiently."
"Matrimonial and custody disputes are both often heart-rending for all those concerned."
"It is therefore particularly important that these disputes can be resolved without being complicated by procedural difficulties."
"The European Parliament knows better than most the problems which rules of procedure for matrimonial disputes can cause for individual EU citizens."
"A large number of petitions have been sent to the European Parliament on this issue."
"In practice, the current situation means that a decision on divorce in one Member State is not automatically recognized in another Member State."
"This can have serious consequences."
"A couple can thus be legally divorced in one Member State while at the same time being regarded as married in another."
"For the individual concerned this is of course entirely unacceptable."
"It has particularly serious consequences if either of the parties wants to enter into a new marriage."
"The result can then be that the new marriage is regarded as bigamy in another Member State, which is a punishable offence."
"The draft Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters sets clear and exhaustive rules on who shall have jurisdiction in a particular case."
"The basic principle is that jurisdiction is decided according to where the parties have their permanent place of residence."
"In exceptional cases, nationality or place of abode may decide."
"The convention also includes a number of rules which simplify and speed up the procedures for recognition and enforcement."
"In practice, the rules mean that a ruling in a matrimonial case will automatically be enforced in another Member State."
"In the event of divorce or separation, the children are often the most vulnerable."
"Therefore, it is important, as far as possible, to create conditions for the children to maintain close contact with both their father and their mother after a divorce."
"When more than one Member State is involved, the rules must be formulated so that the question of custody can be resolved unambiguously."
"The starting point must always be what is best for the children."
"In this regard, the convention is a considerable improvement compared with the current situation."
"In future, the court which decides on matters of divorce will also be qualified to make decisions on the question of custody if the children have their permanent place of residence in the Member State."
"The court will also be able to decide questions of custody if the children are resident in a different Member State on condition that at least one of the parties has custody of the children and that both parties accept that the court shall have jurisdiction."
"In his report, the rapporteur raises the question of the role of the Court of Justice in the interpretation of the convention and finds that it is limited."
"A preliminary ruling can only be requested by a court of appeal or by the highest legal authorities in a Member State."
"I share the rapporteur's view that it would have been good if the Court of Justice had been given greater scope to give preliminary rulings."
"I note in particular that the limitation is more extensive than is the case with the 1968 Brussels Convention."
"The Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters is an important step towards the Europe of the citizens."
"It is my hope that the formal decision on the convention is taken at the Council of Ministers for justice and home affairs on 28 and 29 May."
"It is therefore important that the Member States also ratify the convention afterwards."
"Thank you, Commissioner Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Aspects relating to world trade"
"The next item is the report (A4-0125/98) by Mr Pimenta, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on environmental, health and consumer protection aspects of world trade."
"Mr President, I should first like to endorse the latter parts of what Mr Pimenta said."
"I hope not to repeat them."
"More and more often we are seeing results of appeal decisions at the WTO which have negative effects on the environment and, despite the provision of Article 20 of GATT, environmental protection seems to be far to the back of the minds of many of the international trade lawyers involved in this work."
"In our own work in this Parliament we have watched decision son baby sealskins, leghold traps, animal testing for cosmetics, all coming to grief simply in the face of threats of the WTO, let alone actual cases."
"For instance, I do not know if the officials who are developing the post-Kyoto policies and measures are taking precautions against future WTO attacks from, for example, the oil-producing nations."
"But I certainly hope they are doing this."
"The tuna dolphin and shrimp turtle decisions have increased the anxiety amongst NGOs and the public that the WTO is a threat to socially and environmentally sustainable development."
"Yet, none of these cases are intrinsically trade disputes and ought to have simply been mediated."
"If we had had more strong multilateral environment agreements, some of these problems could have been avoided."
"It would be very sad if NGOs totally lost faith in the WTO because they could use the WTO tools for instance to battle for reductions in tariffs on environmental goods and services."
"My group wholeheartedly supports Mr Pimenta's excellent report, including paragraph 8."
"It should be an essential input to the main ministerial meeting on WTO and I hope that the Council of Ministers will listen to our concerns about the need to strengthen the WTO committee on trade and the environment."
"The Commission has floated this idea of a high-level trade and environment meeting in Geneva in the autumn bringing together top-level policy-makers to push forward the debate on how to strengthen the CTE's work."
"This could well be a useful initiative."
"Mr Pimenta worries that this might be a delaying tactic and in many ways the work needs to be done beforehand by high level officials."
"Nevertheless, it could be a useful step forward."
"We are in a world where, to look at one area, increasing biotechnological innovations are threatening farmers' livelihoods in developing countries."
"Natural herbal medicines from these countries are being pirated and patented by rapacious multinationals who then want to sell these products back at prices which cannot be afforded."
"The Multilateral Agreement on Investment is being negotiated which may not yet contain sufficiently strong social and environmental clauses."
"All these problems have a bearing on world trade and the way in which the WTO needs to develop and cope with them."
"The WTO must be made to evolve so as to be able to work in a way which respects these important areas."
"Mr Pimenta's report contains some very important and sound points and I commend it to the House."
"Mr President, starting where Mr Eisma left off, I also hope that Mr Pimenta's report is approved tomorrow. As he also said, it was approved unanimously at the last meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"We hope it is approved because, as the rapporteur rightly says, the WTO summit in Geneva in May will really be the last chance to adopt binding, essential political decisions to prevent the constant conflicts between environment and trade, health and trade, and social rights and trade."
"We cannot have a repetition of the frustrating situation at Singapore in 1996, of flagrant non-compliance with what was agreed at the 1994 WTO summit in Marrakesh."
"The reports by Mr Spencer, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler and Mr Pimenta on a different occasion, as previously debated in this Parliament, all repeated the same questions as this one."
"Trade rules cannot be given priority over those required to protect health, the environment and the future of our natural resources."
"So we are going to support the Pimenta report and, as Mr Eisma said, let us hope it will be approved tomorrow, if not unanimously - which is a very complicated matter in the House - then at least by a large majority which will allow the European Commission to take a clear and forceful stance at this Geneva summit so that, before the end of this century, we can have rules to defend every area we are fighting to protect: environmental rules, health rules and rules for a fairer society."
"Mr President, I will not have the chance to say much in one minute, but in any case I will say that Mr Pimenta's report is excellent and we will vote for it without hesitation."
"Indeed, Mr Pimenta clearly highlights the shortcomings of the current WTO and the fact that the values given priority at the moment put free trade before environmental and health protection."
"The three best-known conflicts which have been settled by the WTO since the adoption of the Marrakech Agreements, those concerning hormones, bananas and fuel in the United States, are all conflicts which have given rise to decisions which are detrimental to both public health and the environment. This seems to me to be a vital point."
"If we want this destructive process to end, we must get to the heart of the problem at all costs and not hesitate to challenge the very statutes of the WTO, where clear evidence of the principles of pernicious decision-making can be found."
"I am thinking particularly of the fact that, when an individual state, or the European Union, wishes to adopt more rigorous measures in the areas of health or the environment, it is up to them to justify it."
"Uncertainties regarding the harmlessness of certain products or processes are not sufficient to justify more restrictive measures, and this is not acceptable to us."
"The beginnings of a change must be adopted in Geneva."
"Mr President, may I first make a comment for the benefit of the Parliamentary staff: paragraph 4 is wrong in all languages."
"It should not read 'the caution principle' , but the 'precautionary principle' ."
"I would ask the staff to correct the error, because this is an important matter."
"Turning to the Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank him for being here, and tell him that I know him well and know from his background and his lifestyle that he is sincere when he speaks on environmental matters and participation in civil society."
"Nevertheless - and I hope I can rely on your vote, Commissioner Oreja, as an ally of ours in defending these causes - I would like to make sure the whole Commission knows, first and foremost, that there must be a declaration on the environment in Geneva in May, because there was none made in Singapore."
"Because in Singapore, as you know, the Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) report was not even ratified, and if there is no declaration in May it will mean another year will be wasted on discussions at official level."
"We need a political initiative at the highest level, within the WTO. Otherwise the debate will not be resumed."
"Secondly, a high-level meeting should not be a meeting of senior officials."
"It should be a ministerial initiative, because it is not the Director-Generals who answer to their national parliaments on policy and receive policy directions, however well qualified they may be technically; it is the ministers."
"It is the ministers for trade, the ministers for the environment, as it is the Commissioners here."
"I would ask the Commissioner to properly forward to the Commission the fact that this House is seriously interested in political initiatives, and raises these questions at political level, without wishing to detract from the excellent work that has been done by technical experts, and especially European technical experts, in this field."
"Mr President, I have certainly taken note of what Mr Pimenta said."
"I will make sure I remember it and convey his opinion to the Members of the Commission."
"Thank you, Commissioner Oreja."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"European City of Culture"
"The next item is the report (A4-0083/98) by Mr Monfils, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a Community initiative for the European City of Culture event (COM(97)0549 - C4-0580/97-97/0290(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1985 the choice of the European Cities of Culture has been left to the Union's Council of Ministers."
"Decisions were not always based on the cultural value of the projects submitted."
"Furthermore, in the year 2000, Europe has made no choice since it has accepted the designation of nine cities as Cities of Culture."
"The directive presented by the Commission is aimed at giving greater importance to European cities and greater objectivity to the choices made."
"At a procedural level, the directive proposes setting up a Selection Panel."
"On the basis of its opinion, on the proposal of the Commission and after consultation with Parliament, the Council will designate the European City of Culture by a qualified majority."
"The directive furthermore extends the choice of cities to the countries of the European Economic Area."
"It also strengthens the demands relating to the content of the projects to be presented."
"After a particularly in-depth debate, for which I would especially like to thank the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, some of whom are present today, I can say that this committee approved virtually unanimously the amendments presented to you here, which are furthermore in line with the suggestions I made in my report."
"There are seven points worth highlighting."
"Firstly, with regard to the choice of city, we are proposing to replace the previous intergovernmental method with a Community method."
"Thus the cities will submit their applications directly, without going via their national government."
"I am aware that there is clear opposition to this method within the Council of Ministers."
"There are even some who would like the European City of Culture to be designated in turn by each Member State, or by the state holding the Presidency of the European Union."
"Thus, after Great Britain, an Austrian city would be nominated by Austria for six months, then a Swedish one, then Danish, then Belgian and so on."
"To do this would be to ruin completely the idea of a European capital of culture, which must not be designated by a State for reasons of circumstance or opportunity, but as the result of a proper cultural analysis of a project presented by the city and an appreciation of the capacity for influence within Europe of the candidate city's cultural project."
"I am convinced that a very large majority of this House will share the virtually unanimous view of the Committee on Culture and will not accept the cheap selling-off of the very idea of the European City of Culture."
"Secondly, we wanted to strengthen the independence of the Selection Panel and place the emphasis on quality, in particular at the level of cultural expertise."
"Thirdly, on a procedural level, we are proposing to implement fully the codecision procedure for choice of city, which implies close participation on the part of Parliament in designating the city, and not simply giving an opinion."
"Fourthly, we consider that a candidate city may present a specific cultural project in association with other cities, even if a state does not belong to the European Union - maybe to the European Free Trade Association or the European Economic Area, for example - but that the city presenting the project would be solely responsible to the European Union and would hold the title of European City of Culture."
"Fifthly, the Committee on Culture wanted to add depth to the content of the projects to be presented by cities, by placing emphasis on the development of artistic creation. This implies not being satisfied with a simple show of cultural events imported from other countries or cities, but demanding that the cultural project should be rooted in the social fabric of the city, encouraging maximum participation in the cultural project on the part of the city's citizens and groups and insisting that conditions for a follow-up to the year's cultural events be presented in the project."
"Sixthly, the new importance given to the designation of European City of Culture and the fact that stricter conditions for eligibility have been set mean that greater financial support is required."
"We are proposing a sum of ECU 2 million, obviously without wishing to influence the possibility of receiving other benefits, in particular via the Structural Funds."
"Finally, my seventh point, we stand by the proposal for a European Cultural Month for the countries which are not part of the European Union but who would have an undeniable interest in this if it were to be made more dynamic."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Culture and the European Parliament have worked quickly."
"As I said, we wanted to make the designation of European City of Culture one of the strong points of the Union's cultural policy."
"We obviously want to insist that the procedure should not be delayed, so that everything can be in place by the end of the year and we can thus apply the provisions of the new directive to the designation of European City for 2002. This is also what the European Commission hopes for, and in particular the European Commissioner, Mr Oreja, whose company we have the pleasure of here today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that I have been invited to be the first speaker on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, because I think the European City of Culture is a brilliant idea, a real stroke of genius."
"I therefore hope we shall not strangle it at birth."
"In 2002 this programme must stop being an extended intergovernmental pilot scheme and unreservedly become a Community initiative for which Governments, the Commission and Parliament share responsibility."
"This is a change we consider fundamental in order to invest it with a highly important threefold function; the representation of national, regional and local culture, which is naturally dear to governments' hearts, the demonstration of a common European culture, which is naturally dear to the Commission's heart; and the expression of the vital forces of society, which is naturally dear to Parliament's heart."
"The future of this important programme will be put at risk if we do not move forward towards the communitization, the codecision-based selection procedure proposed by Parliament."
"The proposals in the Monfils report amount to an important signal to the people."
"They prove that when a programme demonstrates its worth, European institutions are capable of recognizing it, in this case by proposing to increase the budget and extend the number of participants to enable the programme to realize its full potential."
"Let us see whether the Commission and the Member States will match the generosity of Parliament, which is proposing a reference amount of ECU 2 million."
"Since the event was first instituted in 1985, the European City of Culture has taken various forms, and in the last few years has shown a maturity which has been apparent not only in the consistency and innovation of most of the programmes suggested by the cities, but especially in the extent to which those cities have in some cases been transformed."
"This is a fundamental way of guaranteeing the effect of an investment going beyond the festival year."
"After 2002, if Parliament's proposal is accepted, the European City of Culture can no longer be an event that has nothing to do with the people who live there, or with other cities, inside and outside the Union, with which it is called to join hands. It must not fail to be a link between the past and the future, making good use, as the report suggests, of the relationship between the continued exploitation of its heritage and contemporary creative work."
"It must also seek to ensure that local initiatives are publicized so that they reach other cities and regions of Europe."
"The future City of Culture must submit itself for selection directly, without having to go through central government. It must be selected by an independent consultative Selection Panel, and must finally be approved by the three European institutions."
"In proposing this, Parliament is giving its clear backing to the initiative and responsibility of the cities themselves."
"This may help to advance the claims of medium-sized and peripheral cities which would be unlikely to be put forward for selection if they were to rely upon being chosen by their Governments."
"Parliament has had the courage to add to this excellent proposal by the Commission."
"Let us hope Member States will be able to see the potential of this means we are offering them to achieve our common objective: to reinforce the cohesion of the European fabric through cultural cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of my group I would like to thank Mr Monfils for his splendid report."
"The notion that Melina Mercouri put forward thirteen years ago regarding the City of Culture event has been an undoubted success."
"By the year 2000 all Member States of the Union will have their own City of Culture year planned."
"Actually, Finland is the only country that is having to share its designated City of Culture year with eight other cities."
"There is nothing there can be done about this in itself, but I seriously think that Finland too, and perhaps especially, given her status as a relatively unknown new Member State, should have had her own individual City of Culture celebration."
"Helsinki should have got her own City of Culture year considering her internationally respected, and at the same time totally indigenous, contribution to the Arts, as well as the cultural arrangements that are now being undertaken in preparation for the year 2000."
"Sharing the City of Culture among many only serves to water down each city's visible contribution to cultural development."
"In future programming the City of Culture status must clearly only be awarded to one city at a time."
"The most important contribution the City of Culture project can make is, in the end, its permanent influence on society, and it is therefore necessary to try to get the community as a whole involved in events, to take part in them and get something out of them."
"It is then that the influence the event has will carry on in an active and creative way long after the year in question is over."
"The City of Culture year must be mainly based on the city's own resources and special features, its history and its challenges in the face of change."
"You can then build a selected theme on that individual cultural base, taking advantage of reciprocal action and cultural offerings on an international basis."
"The birth of lasting cultural cooperation is one of the key goals of the Union."
"Although cooperation among different cities is to be aspired to, it is the essential responsibility of just one city, and, if it likes, that city can adopt a natural partner to help in the formulation of its City of Culture year, a partner that has something in common with its geographical situation, history or culture: one of the applicant countries, for instance."
"I hope the Commission will continue to develop the European City of Culture notion, which is a splendid opportunity, for example, for associate countries to develop their cultural heritage and creativity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a common market, common political institutions and a common currency which we are seeking to set in motion today, are all the results of a European accord."
"They should lead to the people within the European Union growing closer together and combining their energies."
"Yet the foundations upon which the States in the European Union have been building their Community for almost a half century, and the soil in which it will thrive derive from something which has linked the peoples on this continent for several thousand years: their common culture."
"The Community European City of Culture initiative is based on this thinking."
"It takes the very thing that could persuade Europeans to consider seeking a political accord in the first place, and uses it to strengthen this accord."
"From time immemorial, European cities have been centres of culture."
"Art, music, literature, dance, theatre, film, architecture in the past and now thrive best where people meet and are culturally active."
"The ""European City of Culture' programme should awaken new interest amongst the citizens of the Union for the cultural heritage in our cities, and focus their eyes more keenly on their beauty."
"However, in the quest to become European City of Culture there is no place for cities that are inwardlooking."
"Cities only have a chance of gaining this distinction by placing their own culture in a European context."
"Where are the city's European influences, and in what way has it influenced Europe?"
"It is the task of Europe's cities to illustrate this by means of cultural events."
"And, in terms of the initiative we are to adopt today, this will be all the more successful the more cities cooperate with other European cities on their projects and involve creative artists from other cities in their campaigns."
"All Member States of the European Union basically agree that, in order to maintain the cultural diversity of Europe, it is imperative to preserve the cultural sovereignty of the Member States."
"Yet, in terms of the European City of Culture, it is a question of being aware of the riches generated by this diversity whilst keeping in view its common roots."
"The great opportunity of this initiative is that it can reach all citizens of the Union, for everyone can be culturally creative and take pleasure from culture. Precisely because culture has such a strongly integrating effect, we in the European Parliament would re-emphasize our call as a legitimate democratic body to participate in the decision on the European City of Culture from the year 2002 and to make available ECU 2 million as an annual contribution to finance the initiative."
"Finally, I offer my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur for producing a sound report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Monfils on his excellent report."
"""European Cities of Culture' is amongst the few projects which appeal to everyone's imagination, yield considerable economic benefit for the city concerned, and can look to the business community for support."
"The rapporteur rightly stresses that neither the size of a city nor its political importance within a country is of overriding importance."
"In the past we have focused mainly on capital cities."
"This new directive intends to give smaller cities a chance."
"One condition is, however, that the candidate cities present a clear project which is aimed at the future of the city and which has as its premise its individuality and its role in European history."
"An important point regarding the participation of smaller cities in the programme is that Europe provides sufficient resources."
"My city, Bruges, for instance, candidate for the year 2002, does not have the facilities and infrastructure which capitals have; this is why I support the amendment which provides for ECU 2 million."
"In conclusion, I agree with the proposal that candidate cities should be able to submit their candidature directly to the European Commission, and not to their governments."
"If added to this there will be an independent panel and a Parliament which can have the final say in the choice of the city, I can see a true democratization of the selection procedure."
"We hope that the approval of this directive can be finalized this year, so that from 2002 the selection can be made according to this new directive, as planned."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Monfils for the successful work he has done in drafting this report."
"It is important to stress that the City of Culture programme ought also to be used to bring capital cities outside the EU to the attention of the public."
"Lasting cultural cooperation can be furthered not just by concentrating on one city but through regional and cross-border projects."
"One city should, however, bear the responsibility of coordinating the work."
"Sufficient community funding must be found for these programmes, but even more important is the link between business and the events themselves."
"The weighty contribution which business can make will guarantee publicity for the events and the region in question, and financial tie-ins can also help to promote the development of sustainable projects in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate both Mr Monfils, on his excellent report, and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media."
"Parliament attaches great importance to the inclusion of the European City of Culture within the Community framework and demonstrates the need to support this event, which has met with increasing success ever since it was launched."
"The purpose of the initiative presented by the Commission is to highlight the richness and cultural diversity of European cities and, at the same time, as Mrs Vaz da Silva reminded us a moment ago, draw attention to our common cultural heritage."
"And that is in keeping with the spirit and the letter of Article 128 of the Treaty."
"The Commission is pleased to accept most of Parliament's amendments, which undoubtedly improve the text markedly."
"However, there are some amendments which we would prefer not to incorporate into the initial proposal: specifically, Amendments Nos 7, 10, 12, 13, 14 and part of No 9."
"Let us consider Amendments Nos 7 and 14 first."
"The funding for the European City of Culture initiative is provided for in the Commission proposal on the framework programme, which has not yet been adopted by the Commission."
"So at this stage of the procedure the Commission cannot accept amendments with regard to funding since the budgetary provision has to form part of the framework programme."
"As for Amendment No 8, insofar as it concerns the presentation of candidates, the Commission believes that the support and initiative of the Member States is indispensable for the event's success."
"This is to avoid what we see as a potential waste of effort and money by cities with no real chance of being selected right from the outset, because of a lack of venues, for example."
"In reference to the last part of Amendment No 9 and Amendment No 10, the Commission proposal certainly makes no attempt to marginalize Parliament. On the contrary, we want it to have a greater role in this activity which, from being intergovernmental in nature, is turning into a Community initiative."
"The selection procedure proposed by the Commission tries to involve the Community institutions fully, and is flexible enough for the decision to be adopted quickly, allowing the selected cities enough time to prepare for the event."
"The legislative procedure of codecision, provided for in Article 189(b) of the Treaty, is generally required when establishing measures to promote the cultural sector, but it does not seem the most appropriate method for the specific designation of the city. Given its complexity and length, it could stop the programme working properly."
"As for Amendments Nos 12 and 13, the Commission does not consider their approach to be in keeping with the Community's commitments to associated third countries as regards the possibility of their participation in Community programmes and activities."
"Finally, the Commission wants to stress the need for us to conclude all the procedures connected with the implementation of this initiative as quickly as possible. In that respect, I can tell you that the Commission will spare no effort and will do what it can to try to get the different institutions to adopt a similar position, so we can reach a satisfactory solution which preserves or even increases the vitality and success of this event."
"To Mr De Coene, who said a moment ago that the Council had adopted a decision, I want to say that the Council cannot adopt any decision until you have adopted yours."
"And at this point, allow me to put on my institutionalist's hat."
"The Council can exchange opinions, but cannot decide, because first of all there has to be a first reading - which is what you are doing now - and then the Council will make a statement. There will be an opportunity for that on 28 May, which is when the Council will be able to examine a common position, if it wants to, and possibly adopt it."
"Very rapidly, Mr President, I would simply like to say to the Commissioner that I am extremely disappointed by his response, in three respects."
"I will pass over the problem of financing, one to two million, when the European Union's budget is ECU 900 million or 1 billion - what am I saying! - 100 billion per year, the issue is clearly ridiculous."
"But there are two points to which I would like to draw your attention, Commissioner."
"Firstly, you cannot accept Amendment No 8, which is the amendment enabling cities to submit their projects directly to the Commission."
"I thought you were the defender and the promoter of cultural development in the European Union."
"To hand the choice of cultural city over to the Member States is to trivialize completely the role of European City of Culture and, my apologies for saying this, but you are playing into the hands of the Member States and not that of the Community that you should be defending."
"Secondly, when you say that codecision will slow things down, Commissioner, may I remind you that you submitted your report to us a little before the New Year."
"I commenced my report around 10 January."
"By 20 January it was being translated."
"Any delays involved in this report have been through administrative reasons or reasons of timing only."
"The Committee on Culture has completed everything in the shortest time possible."
"To tell me that we are not capable, at the level of the European Parliament, of giving an opinion on a European city, that is, of saying yes or no to Brussels, Salamanca, Helsinki or elsewhere, is clearly to make a mockery of the work of Parliament."
"We have proved that in less than three months, and with a series of delays which were not of our making, we have been able to draw up a report, discuss it, amend it and vote on it."
"Consequently, Commissioner, I have the feeling that in this respect you are making a mockery of the work of Parliament."
"I would like to end, Commissioner, in a word, by saying this to you: in your directive, you wanted a sign, a strong symbol for the European Union, in terms of culture, and we agreed with you."
"Not only did we agree, not only did we propose it, but we also reinforced it."
"Commissioner, do not destroy cultural symbols in a world such as ours."
"They are essential in order to experience our culture in all its diversity."
"Commissioner, I do not wish to call into question your expertise regarding institutional issues."
"I know that you are a specialist on the matter."
"I would merely like to say one thing, namely that if, in the common position, the Council was to amend the date the directive enters into force, and say 2005 or 2006 was laid down instead of 2002, this would in fact amount to the same thing. Promises have already been made to cities, and to countries at intergovernmental level."
"Everyone knows this, and it has even been published in non-official publications."
"So let us not be naive."
"I know that you oppose this."
"I know that you do not accept this because as Commissioner, you want to oversee the actual procedures. But let us be honest."
"Simply through this simple amendment, the Council of Ministers for Culture can undermine your intentions and what we want."
"This is what is happening at the moment."
"So let us be sensible and let us react immediately and say that this is out of the question."
"I only wanted to issue a warning about some demarches happening at the moment."
"I really did not want to teach anyone a lesson."
"Mr De Coene, I think there has been an interpretation problem."
"Since I understood you to say that the Council had decided, all I wanted to say to you was that the Council had not been able to decide, because the Council cannot decide until you have done so."
"It was a question of principle."
"I was not referring to any other problem."
"Obviously, like you, I have read rumours about the positions the Council is currently trying to adopt."
"But I just wanted to deny those rumours, because it is an institutional matter which affects me."
"The Council cannot decide until you have done so."
"That is all I was referring to."
"However, I know as well as you that there are rumours at the moment about certain intentions along the lines you mention."
"We shall see what the Council says on 28 May, and immediately afterwards - as soon as you invite me to the committee - I will come and tell you what has happened in the Commission and in the Council."
"Secondly, I would like to say to Mr Monfils that the Community nature of the initiative does not depend on whether it is the cities themselves or the Member States who present the candidates."
"It is a question of preference."
"I respect your opinion very highly and you can rest assured that I will look into it."
"At the moment, I am not going to accept the amendment, but that does not mean I will never accept it."
"I will think about it and study it because I greatly value what Mr Monfils has done."
"I am not going to accept it today because I think it is a good procedure for the Member States - not to decide on the city - but to present the cities, and for firstly the Commission and then the panel to decide on the city."
"You say the cities should compete directly."
"I have my fears about that."
"I want there to be some sort of security, and a country provides more security than any city."
"There are many cities which would not pose any problem for me, but one or two might do so, and I prefer the procedure based on Member States."
"But I am not inflexible on this issue."
"It is not a question of theology."
"You have presented me with an observation, and I am not able to accept it at the moment."
"What I can promise you is that I will think about it."
"As for the second matter, I believe - and again this is a question of principle - that the general rule has to be adopted by codecision, which is what you are doing now."
"You now adopt decisions by codecision."
"On the other hand, I think the choice of city is an implementational measure and in such cases I do not think codecision should be used."
"It is debatable."
"You know that the boundaries between what can and cannot be submitted to the codecision procedure are not always very well-defined."
"I am in favour of extending codecision as much as possible, as I said in the intergovernmental conference."
"My opinion is well known."
"I expressed it in this House after the European Council in Amsterdam."
"But in this case, I think we are dealing with an implementational measure."
"I was here in Parliament yesterday and spoke at length on the subject of comitology, which is also an implementational measure."
"So I have made a note of what Mr Monfils said."
"I am in favour of making a distinction between general and implementational aspects, and that is why I have not accepted your amendment."
"Thank you, Commissioner Marcelino Oreja."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)"
"I rise, Madam President, to seek your support and in fact the support of the President of the Parliament for relief for the devastating floods and the effect of those floods in my constituency over the Easter weekend."
"Some two thousand homes were affected and hundreds of families are now living in temporary accommodation."
"To make matters even worse: in Northampton, alone, the area that was affected was a socially deprived one where people basically have very little insurance coverage."
"I know that you will be aware of these floods; they hit the whole of the Midlands."
"I have already written to the Commission seeking support and I seek your support too for some disaster fund alleviation of this really very tragic situation in which there was not only loss of property but tragically also loss of life."
"So I seek your support this morning on this very serious matter."
"Thank you, Mrs Billingham."
"I am extremely saddened by this disaster and will, of course, take careful note of your comment."
"Naturally, I will inform the President and the necessary steps will be taken, you have my word."
"Madam President, I rise on a point of order that I referred to this House back in September of last year following the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales."
"I said this raised the issue of a possible intrusion by the press into the privacy of individuals."
"At that stage, following a motion from Mrs Pauline Green, it was suggested that the matter should be referred to committee."
"I raised the item again, earlier this year; that is a matter that to my knowledge has not yet been referred to any committee of this House although it was the decision of the House, as I say, in September of last year."
"I wonder whether you can give us any information at this stage whether there is any intention to honour the wish of the House and refer this to committee, or whether there is somebody attempting some sort of cover up?"
"In general, Mr Perry, I can tell you that we have the greatest intention to respect Parliament's wishes."
"That is quite clear."
"As regards the precise matter you are raising, I cannot give you any information at this precise moment, but we will look into it and ensure that, in this instance, the wishes of Parliament are followed."
"I will make sure of it."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of 29 April 1998 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, my name is not on the register of attendance for yesterday, through nobody's fault other than my own."
"I was present at the House and I contributed to the debate on Northern Ireland."
"I would appreciate the fact if my name could be included among those who were present."
"Of course, Mr Collins. It was a mistake."
"We did note your presence and the matter will be rectified."
"Madam President, I should like to enquire when the results in connection with the declaration on crime in Brussels will appear in the Minutes."
"According to the Minutes, Mr Schulz said that we are concentrating only on the protection of employees of the European institutions."
"I should, however, like to stress that we are, of course, equally concerned with the protection of all citizens in Brussels."
"Absolutely, Mr Rübig."
"If a declaration was made but not recorded in the Minutes, we shall look into the matter."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Services based on, or consisting of, conditional access"
"The next item is the report (A4-0136/98) by Mr Anastassopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access (COM(97)0356 - C4-0475/97-97/0198(COD))."
"Madam President, I cannot see a representative of the European Commission in the Chamber at the moment and I would not be prepared to proceed with the debate if there were no Commissioner present to follow it."
"I would like to make a request to wait for perhaps a moment or two until the Commissioner arrives, since it is impossible for us to have a debate without a Commissioner here."
"Mr Anastassopoulos, I had certainly noticed the Commission's absence."
"I was hoping their representative would arrive during the procedural motions but that has not happened."
"I am extremely sorry, and not very pleased about this."
"It must surely be some problem with the planes."
"Communication is not always easy everywhere..."
"(Mr Martens: ""The Commission is in Brussels' ) It was a joke, Mr Martens."
"Mr Anastassopoulos has made a request which I personally approve of, if there are no objections."
"We shall suspend the sitting for a few minutes, while we wait for the relevant Commissioner to arrive."
"I hope we shall be able to resume the sitting as soon as possible."
"(The sitting was suspended at 9.10 a.m. and resumed at 9.15 a.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we can resume the sitting."
"Commissioner Monti was delayed due to a strike on the part of the officials at the Commission."
"Mr Commissioner, there is no need to apologize."
"Given your punctuality and the fact that you are always available to the European Parliament, we were not really worried and we were sure that the reason for your delay was of a pressing nature."
"The rapporteur, Mr Anastassopoulos, has the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of conditional access is a central interface for the whole range of services in our information society."
"What we have here in fact is the question of what are the conditions under which conditional access should be introduced."
"It is, therefore, a matter of defining the conditions for conditional access, and this poses a series of fundamental questions."
"Firstly, the relationship between fee-payment and private acquisition must be determined, because we could not, of course, allow someone to acquire Shakespeare and subsequently demand a fee whenever Shakespeare's work is performed."
"The fact of the matter is that our culture is always a combination of individual and joint achievements."
"Corresponding lines of demarcation need to be drawn here."
"Secondly, it is a question of the relationship between the information-rich and the information-poor."
"We must not allow conditional access to lead to a situation in which essential elements of our culture, essential elements which are public property, are accessible only to privileged minorities who can afford to pay for them."
"Ultimately, we are dealing with a segmentation of the public which can indeed restrict people's freedom to form their own opinions."
"The appropriate conditions must be imposed here so that, if private acquisition is necessary and sensible, it can indeed take place and rights can indeed be properly exploited as well."
"We just need to bear in mind that we shall keep coming back to convergence, and there would certainly be a connection."
"But basically, we have here a first opportunity to talk about the problem of convergence at this interface as well."
"I have also complained about the regulatory minimalism which the Commission has displayed, instead of using this interface aggressively."
"We have been particularly struck by two points."
"Firstly, the fact that national boundaries and technical ranges do not coincide. This leads to all sorts of inconsistencies in practice which have not been satisfactorily addressed."
"If, for example, you use a decoder for Sky television as an English-speaking viewer in Belgium, is that structurally illegal?"
"Surely not!"
"Secondly, there is a very dangerous tendency for those who exploit rights to put themselves in the position of the copyright holders or of the originators, and to some extent to give these rights a subordinate character."
"We must ensure that the originators and copyright holders are also protected."
"That seems to me to be a necessary condition."
"When we talk about conditional access, we are at the same time talking about the conditions that we want to impose on private industry for the introduction of conditional access."
"With that in mind, I think that this ought to be our fundamental approach to the subject."
"Madam President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and his colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee who have brought this matter to our consideration today."
"It is our view, on the Culture Committee, that we are quite properly here looking at issues of delivery and not at issues of content."
"There are many concerns about content and I will refer to them in just a second."
"But, essentially, today we are looking at the protection of certain services from the point of view of the delivery of the signal to the individual consumer."
"It is for that reason that we cannot vote for the latter part of Amendment No 20, despite all the real concerns about copyright."
"They are legitimate concerns but we need a copyright directive to address them and we need it urgently to move in parallel with the subject we are debating today."
"We all agree that the problem of piracy is substantial and it grows day by day."
"In the end, content matters in this directive because the funding of content, the provision of the programmes for the increasing number of digital services, essentially relies for many broadcasters on the revenues from remunerated conditional access."
"If you allow the pirates to flourish that revenue will be diminished."
"If the revenue is diminished there will be fewer services available for the public at large."
"Nevertheless, we want to make sure that in attempting to tackle this question of pirates, we very carefully delineate precisely what the actions are that we are prescribing."
"We are not in favour of restrictions on the citizen and draconian punishments for the mere possession inadvertently of a smart card published for other reasons, perhaps in another state."
"We are in favour of pursuing those who deliberately manufacture these instruments for profit."
"That is why we support the phrasing of Amendment No 22."
"My final point is that in all of this we need to have regard to the area of public broadcasting and broadcasting which is free to air."
"Nothing in this directive should force broadcasters into encryption and into measures of protection not necessary in terms of the purposes which they serve."
"That is the point of Amendment No 25 and of many of the preambles which I believe have been properly addressed by all the three committees that have looked at this matter."
"I would certainly commend the directive to the Parliament."
"Madam President, I think the word ""piracy' has been used too much in this morning's debate."
"The rapporteur, Mr Anastassopoulos, is Greek and knows that a pirate was a sailor who burnt boats belonging to other countries or other people. This caused people to die, and was a terrible thing to do."
"At the moment, people seem too ready to use the term ""piracy' ."
"There is no piracy here: we are dealing with the protection of certain economic interests."
"Economic interests deserve to be protected."
"On the other hand however, there are other rights which must also be protected, such as the right to information or the right to privacy."
"I am saying this because it seems that, at least in the discussions in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, there has been a temptation to protect encoded communications as if they were a fundamental right."
"But there are other fundamental rights."
"All we are doing here is providing a certain amount of protection, to enable that activity to develop and the providers to be remunerated."
"It is a simple question of economics."
"In that respect, I think the Commission's proposal is good and well-balanced, because it protects those economic interests but without restricting people's rights."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur for being so understanding during discussions on this subject, because I think the 20 or so amendments which have finally been adopted are reasonable and balanced."
"However, in the Group of the Party of European Socialists we have objections to the second part of Amendment No 20 and the second part of Amendment No 22."
"As regards the former, Mr Whitehead has already mentioned the difficulties of protecting content which, in the end, might end up as the justification for protecting more than just remuneration."
"Secondly, we object to the second part of Amendment No 22 because, in referring to the ""sole intended purpose of enabling unauthorized access to a protected service' , it weakens the protection, because it does not cover the case of an instrument with a useful purpose."
"In other words, with the exception of the second part of Amendment No 20 - specifically the words ""or its content' - and the second part of Amendment No 22 - ""for the sole intended purpose of enabling unauthorized access to a protected service' - the Socialist Group agrees with the amendments and, of course, we are in favour of approving Mr Anastassopoulos' report in its current terms We also congratulate the Commission on having achieved a balance in the proposal it has presented to us."
"Madam President, I must start by saying - and it is not just rhetoric - that it is an honour for me to be the first member of the Group of the European People's Party to speak following a rapporteur from our group."
"It is an honour because the rapporteur has followed in the best European Parliament traditions of Members defending their ideas - their ideas about protecting citizens' interests - with all the energy they can muster, with no effort spared and, at the same time, eager to reach conclusions by means of dialogue."
"Madam President, as the rapporteur rightly said, we are faced with a Commission proposal which we in this Parliament see as a response to a resolution passed in this House."
"And in that sense, we have to agree with the rapporteur when he says that the Commission has not done everything this House requested. In other words, it has not dealt with the problems of non-remunerated encoded services or the possibility of offering more protection for authors' rights."
"Having said all that, Madam President, and speaking now in a personal capacity - since the Group of the European People's Party will vote according to the rapporteur's voting list - I am going to mention a few doubts."
"Madam President, I do not agree with some of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"The reason is very simple: in Europe at the moment we want to ""legislate less to legislate better' ."
"There is a declaration in the Treaty of Amsterdam which says that legislation must be clear, concise and aimed at a specific problem."
"The Commission proposal meets those criteria."
"It is true that the title of the proposal should have specified that it refers to remunerated encoded services."
"That reference to remuneration should have appeared in recitals 5 and 12, in Article 1 and elsewhere, to make it absolutely clear which problem was being addressed."
"And for the sake of that clarity we advocate, those recitals should also have mentioned that there are other large problem areas, such as non-remunerated encoded services, which should be addressed in other normative instruments."
"Having said that, some of the approved amendments are not going to have the effect of harmonizing legislation or solving the existing problems. Rather, if they were included in the final text they would create even bigger problems."
"I am not going to repeat what has already been said about the ""sole intended purpose' , but blank tapes are not prohibited and, in that sense, there is no reason to think of banning an instrument which has a general use but can also be used for illegal purposes."
"To pass on to other things, in Spanish we have a saying that: ""He who attempts too much ends up doing nothing properly' ."
"And by including concepts such as direct or indirect profits, or content, we are creating margins for discretion, to be interpreted in the last analysis by the courts in each Member State. That could give rise to greater differences, if that were possible, in the very matter we are trying to harmonize."
"So I hope, Madam President, that along this normative journey, we may reach a good solution which meets the criteria set out by the rapporteur - doubtless in other normative instruments."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, the starting point is important with this directive, namely that we are trying to provide legal protection for the economic values associated with intellectual activity."
"That is what should be important, not obstructing access to information, as one of our colleagues also said."
"We should recognize that protection of services also creates an interest in developing high-grade products."
"The liberal point of view is that private services should in principle have the same protection as public services in this sector."
"We should not experience what happens in some places, namely that people are prepared to resort to repressive measures if the public service licence has not been paid, but not to protect commercial television."
"The committee and the rapporteur have rightly pointed to the freedom of speech aspects, which are important."
"I hope this directive really helps to create a single market for products which are needed for the information society."
"We have a problem with the fact that there is no functioning market today, such as in the case of encryption to protect private interests."
"It is important that we create rules which do not represent obstacles for the future."
"The change we are proposing in Amendment No 22 is so that we can get such a development."
"That is why my group is going to support it."
"But just as someone from the Group of the Party of European Socialists said earlier, we cannot support Amendment No 20, because it would create confusion and not clarify the directive."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur and my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and also the draftspeople on this rather complicated directive."
"In particular, I should like to thank Phillip Whitehead whom I have worked closely with on this subject."
"This is an important subject for the citizens of Europe as television is such a popular pastime."
"The directive recognizes that new technology is coming into the industry and that it will be moving towards digital technology."
"It provides for protection for the smart cards which will allow access to pay TV."
"The proposal is intended to protect the providers of these services."
"I have had a huge postbag on this proposal and the reactions to it have been very mixed."
"Essentially we need a balance between protection and access to service for the consumers."
"The rapporteur has endeavoured to achieve that."
"Some of the particular points of concern raised in correspondence from all sorts of sources - individuals as well as firms - has been that the possession itself of a smart card should not be illegal and I agree with that."
"There has also been concern on the civil liberties aspect of this directive and some writers have felt that the proposal is draconian."
"I hope the Commission has received similar correspondence."
"It is important that ordinary citizens' voices are heard in this Chamber and by the Commission."
"Another point of concern - and I have not had an adequate response from the Commission so perhaps Commissioner Monti could address this in his reply - is why the directive only applies to pay TV."
"Some public service broadcast services are remunerated and, consequently, there is going to be a problem with litigation on which services are provided for remuneration and which are not."
"In the interests of good law-making we should avoid unnecessary litigation."
"In conclusion, I broadly support the proposal and the amendments although I may have some concern about particular aspects."
"Madam President, I would like to express my respect for the rapporteur and thank him for his excellent report."
"Still, there is one point I would like to draw attention to and that is the protection of the rights of artists and authors."
"They need strong legal protection, and they are entitled to it."
"That is why I wholeheartedly support Amendment No 20 in its entirety."
"Piracy must be combated forcefully."
"It is not enough to forbid instruments which are specifically designed and made to give unauthorized access."
"It is sometimes also possible to infringe copyright with legal and seemingly harmless software. This should also be combated."
"Amendment No 22 limits this protection to equipment with the sole intended purpose of enabling unauthorized access."
"This amendment must therefore be rejected, and most certainly the words ""with the sole intended purpose' ."
"The European cultural world must not only be protected in special directives on copyright, important as this is, but must be protected in all cases, and therefore also in this directive."
"That is why I ask the House to support Amendment No 20 in its entirety, and to vote against Amendment No 22."
"Again, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, and could I ask Commissioner Bangemann and Commissioner Monti, present here today, to bear in mind the cultural dimension in their policy."
"This is an extremely important issue."
"It determines the cultural diversity of Europe, and that is Europe's strength."
"They have to bear that in mind in their policy."
"Madam President, I am one of the admittedly small number of members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights who voted in committee against some of our rapporteur's amendments, and subsequently also against the directive that had been amended in accordance with his proposals."
"I should like to make it clear here that this rejection did not relate to all the changes."
"I do give my full support to all the amendments which are aimed at protecting not only those services which are subject to restricted access for commercial reasons, but also to those which are restricted for reasons to do with the security and integrity of the information transmitted."
"However, I believe that, for systematic reasons, the right of originators to bring an action, proposed in the report, ought to be dealt with not in this directive, but in the copyright directive which is also currently being dealt with by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and that it should be considered by them at the same time as aspects which are essentially legal."
"Otherwise we shall end up with a proliferation of requirements in a range of different directives, which would be of very little assistance to originators."
"However, the greatest substantive problem I have relates, however, to the more or less clearly expressed demand that Member States should also criminalize private ownership of smart cards and similar devices."
"This encourages more snooping around in people's homes, and on the whole I also believe that too little consideration is being given to the rights of free access to information."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to apologize for the delay this morning, owing to difficulties on this particular day. I am very sorry and I would like to thank Madam President for being so understanding."
"I would like to thank the draftsmen of opinion of the various Parliamentary committees and in particular the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs, Vice-President Anastassopoulos, for the complex and very thorough work done on this proposal, which is both important and difficult."
"The proposal for a directive aims to protect radio and television broadcasters and the suppliers of new services in the information society from piracy, that is from the production and distribution of equipment that enables services normally provided for payment to be received free of charge."
"It should be remembered that the start of pay television was also the start of a flourishing industry in commercial piracy which, by providing users with pirate equipment, caused huge losses to the service providers and hindered the development of this emerging sector."
"Some Member States reacted by introducing a specific legal protection against piracy, while others did not do so for various reasons."
"Moreover, the national legislations recently adopted are extremely varied."
"Consequently there is no equivalent level of protection, and the Union is thus becoming a refuge for pirates and offers several possibilities for eluding the legal protection guaranteed in some Member States."
"The proposal for a directive seeks to resolve this problem by introducing harmonized regulations within the scope of the single market."
"I am pleased that the report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and the amendments proposed are generally in favour of the Commission's proposal. It should not be forgotten that this is the answer to a repeated request from Parliament, last made in Mr Anastassopoulos' previous report on the Commission's Green Paper of 1996."
"I am also pleased that the Anastassopoulos report, in the same way as the reports from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, contains numerous amendments that mainly help to clarify or reinforce the Commission's proposal."
"I am referring in particular to Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 23, 24 and 25 which the Commission will accept in full, if not to the letter at least in spirit."
"However, following a careful examination and taking into account the opinions of the various parties concerned, there are several amendments the Commission cannot accept."
"This is the case, for example, with Amendment No 20, which aims to extend the scope of the legal protection to services using conditional access systems for reasons other than those of ensuring appropriate remuneration."
"This type of amendment goes beyond the aim of the proposal, which is to deal with the fundamental problem of piracy, that is, the desire of certain users to obtain services they would normally pay for at reduced or no cost, and the interest of the pirate industry in satisfying this demand by providing users with illegal equipment."
"These amendments, however, seek to extend protection to services using conditional access systems for reasons other than that of guaranteeing payment, such as the requirement to ensure observance of contractual agreements arranged between service providers and content providers, seeking to make it impossible to receive a service in territories other than those for which the rights were requested."
"This goes beyond the scope of the proposal and cannot be accepted in the context of this proposal."
"In this connection, however, I would like to point out, Madam President, and to the rapporteur, that personally I am convinced of the interest and need to examine this matter. I think it would be useful, for that purpose, to begin a study to establish more clearly the terms of the question, its compatibility with Community law and the possible means available to offer an appropriate solution that takes due account of the interests of all parties involved."
"One further amendment the Commission cannot accept is Amendment No 22 for, by restricting the definition of illicit pirate devices, it risks creating loopholes and weakening the protection considerably."
"The Commission cannot accept several other amendments which, in our opinion, are not sufficiently clear and could give rise to confusion or incorrect interpretations."
"I am referring to Amendments Nos 5, 9, 11, 18, 21 and part of 23."
"However, I wish to point out that despite the fact that several amendments cannot be accepted by the Commission, the agreement between the institutions on the objectives and the reasons for combating piracy and on the need to react urgently is broadly based and very encouraging."
"I am sure that constructive cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council will make it possible to achieve the objective, and I hope that every effort will be made in this connection."
"Just one word, Madam President, on the point raised by Mr Pex, to reassure him that the Commission has taken maximum account of the cultural dimension, the value of cultural variety in Europe. This spirit is reflected in the fact that we accept all the amendments made by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media."
"Finally, with regard to the point raised by Mr Oddy, I have already partly explained that the Commission's proposal only guarantees protection for services using conditional access to guarantee payment, as it is only in these cases that there is a legitimate interest and a real requirement for protection."
"I would like to add that intellectual property rights are not prejudiced, as simple reception, without reproduction or retransmission, cannot constitute a breach of an intellectual property right."
"Moreover, when the service is not paid for, the service provider cannot sustain any direct financial loss as a result of unauthorized access."
"This is a subject that should be examined further but, given the time constraints, I will stop here for the time being."
"Madam President, I would particularly like to thank the Commissioner and all those colleagues who took part in this difficult debate on a very difficult issue, which has occupied those of us on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights - you yourself are aware of this as you are a member of that committee - for many months, with many opposing views and many sides who, in fact, maintained their views right up to the present."
"Following Commissioner Monti's speech, I would like to highlight two points."
"There is still a fundamental disagreement between us concerning the limits of legal protection."
"This disagreement was expressed in the Commissioner's speech and also in his opposition to the basic Amendment No 20, or at least, as I heard, to a section of this amendment, which somewhat attenuates the disagreement."
"But I would like to mention the Commissioner's statement, which bore witness to his good intentions, that together with his colleagues in the European Commission, he was prepared to launch a study aimed at discovering whether, in the future, he could go beyond the scope which the Commission itself determined and which, of course, Parliament seeks to broaden."
"As a result of the Commissioner's statement, I do not have a problem in allowing the report to be adopted, whereas I would have had a problem had there been no such statement. Perhaps I should ask Parliment to refer it back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"We shall see how we can solve the problem of disagreement before the second reading."
"I must point out of course that the Commission accepted 16 to 17 amendments, which is a detail I cannot overlook. Of course, I think that the efforts of all of us are aimed at finding syntheses that will serve every possible balanced outcome."
"We always bear in mind that rights are affected, and one way or another we endeavour to find the best solution. I wish to point out that, for my part - and I have stressed this repeatedly - my intention is that public broadcasting services be covered by legal protection, since I place great importance on public broadcasting channels, for many reasons."
"Having made these observations, I would like to thank you, Madam President, since we are now in a position to have a complete picture of this extremely difficult issue, which we shall be voting on at 11.00 a.m.."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m."
"The internal market in natural gas"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0140/98), on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the common position established by the Council (C40103/98-00/0385 (COD)) with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas (Rapporteur: Mr Desama)."
"Madam President, the vote which will follow today's debate brings to an end a file which has been open for six years, that of the internal market for energy, with its two components, electricity and gas."
"I would like to highlight the continuity with which this has been handled within Parliament, since during these six years a single rapporteur has been dealing with this issue, yet during the same period we have seen three different commissioners and even more presidencies of the Council."
"Having said that, how should we judge this gas directive, and the proposal for a common position which is put to us today?"
"Firstly, it should be recognized that, as with the electricity case, we find in it the main essentials of what Parliament voted for at the first reading in November 1993."
"I will not list these points here. I would merely like to mention a number of essential points which give real structure to the future directive."
"Firstly, of course, the creation of the new concept of negotiated access to the network."
"It was, in fact, the European Parliament which came up with this idea. It is taken up in the directive, and we are very pleased about that."
"The second important factor is the desire for a progressive opening up of the markets, to take into account the large differences in the way the systems are structured. This we also find in the directive."
"The third element is the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity, which is necessary not to protect national interests but to give the desired time for a rapprochement in organization and systems, as they are so different within the European Union."
"The fourth element, finally, is public service mission."
"I think that in the directive on energy, for both electricity and gas, we have probably reached the best solution with regard to the protection of the public service mission."
"In any case, these are far better solutions than the ones we jointly came up with for telecommunications."
"So we are very pleased with this."
"In the compromise which has now been reached, two positive factors can also be highlighted, for which I would like to congratulate both the Commission and the presidencies which persevered with the issue: the Dutch, Luxembourg and British presidencies."
"These two compromises are important factors in the safety and supply of natural gas within the European Union, firstly that of the storage and use of installations and also, above all, that of the application of take or pay contracts, that is, long term contracts which guarantee the security of supply to a Union which is heavily dependent on external supplies of gas."
"Of course, whether we see ourselves represented in this directive at an 80 % or an 85 % level, there is still a small margin with which we do not agree, but then, as Alfred de Musset said: ""The pleasure is all the more intense for not being complete' ."
"It would be complete if we had today secured the eligibility of distributors and the eligibility of cogeneration."
"It is not surprising that a certain number of Members have tabled amendments on this point."
"It is a strong demand from the European Parliament that should undoubtedly be answered when the directive is reviewed in a few years' time although, by then, times will have changed and attitudes will undoubtedly be more mature."
"With regard to the amendments which were retabled at the second reading, there are essentially three, since two of them are identical."
"The first relates to the time-scale within which we are asking the Commission to give an assessment of the development of the issue."
"We wanted to remind the Commission of this necessity, but I am perfectly willing to call on my colleagues to vote against these amendments if Commissioner Papoutsis can give us the necessary guarantees with regard to this."
"Secondly, the eligibility of distributors."
"We had already defended this point of view with regard to the electricity directive."
"Today, although in essence I share this desire, as rapporteur I am called upon to recommend you to vote against this amendment, since it could also have the effect of threatening the balance of the compromise and thus preventing both the legal security and the necessary links with the electricity directive."
"It is for the same reason that I am opposed to the amendment on cogeneration, even though it has been tabled by my group, for on this issue too it has been difficult to reach a compromise."
"To challenge this issue would be to challenge the whole directive, so I obviously call upon you to vote against these amendments."
"Mr President, firstly heartiest congratulations to Claude Desama for achieving this uncompleted business for us over the time-scale involved."
"Of course he has the support of the Socialist Group."
"That is quite obvious."
"We shall be pursuing the amendment on cogeneration and I will explain why in a moment."
"The timelag is, indeed, very long and during this period of years several things have happened."
"For example, the United Kingdom experience of a very rapid liberalization of the market within that country demonstrated that there is some benefit in doing it more progressively, in doing it slower."
"The United Kingdom experience was so rapid that the large loss of jobs and the difficulties associated with unbundling came over far too short a period."
"That is not going to happen with this directive."
"Nevertheless, the experience with the gas directive, as with the electricity directive, will be a faster liberalization than the directive actually demands."
"In some ways the six years have made it a little anachronistic and there will be developments which are not foreseen in the directive."
"The other thing that has happened in those six years is the development of environmental concerns, in particular expressed in the agreements made at Kyoto where cogeneration plays an important part, as one of the resolutions."
"That is why we are representing our amendment."
"The majority of the Socialist Group does not believe that Article 18.2 is appropriate."
"Indeed, we believe it directly contradicts the Commission's communication on cogeneration."
"We will therefore give people the opportunity when we vote to make it clear that they support cogeneration."
"Nevertheless, like everyone else, we want the directive speedily."
"We do not want to be obstructive."
"Madam President, after three legislatures, believe it or not, we are today reorganizing the last large sector of industry in the Union."
"The Member States have given the Union the task of bringing their markets together into a single internal market, and of enforcing the freedoms of the Treaty, namely the freedom to trade and the freedom of settlement, in all sectors."
"The gas sector must surely be the last one where these two legal objectives have not yet been enforced."
"This directive thus represents the keystone of the internal market."
"I would remind you of the lesson we have learnt from our knowledge of economics: wherever there are monopolies, it is easier for mistakes to be made because the costs have to be met by captive customers."
"On the other hand, competition forces mistakes out into the open, because it puts companies which make the wrong decisions at a competitive disadvantage."
"As a result, competition puts pressure on prices and provides a motive for suppliers to come up with the best solutions."
"But when does competition arise?"
"At the point when the consumer can choose the same product from different types of supplier."
"And that is what this directive achieves, by establishing that state of affairs - namely freedom of suppliers and thus freedom of choice for the consumer."
"A different directive achieved this at the level of production at an earlier stage."
"The gas directive achieves it in the area of transport and distribution, on a step-bystep basis, by abolishing legal monopolies and making it possible in practice to circumvent pipeline monopolies, since branch pipelines can be constructed, and there is a right to the freely approved construction of parallel infrastructure."
"As a result, however, it is clear and important that practical monopolies will be abolished since, by being opened up to everyone, the pipelines can be used by third parties, with adequate protection being given to the owner as he receives a payment which covers his costs, and since the long-term supply contracts are given adequate protection."
"A great many Member States were concerned about this point. In my opinion, the degree of protection it receives in the directive is in fact exaggerated."
"Finally, there is also protection for Member States who set particular store by the ability to impose public service obligations on the companies."
"After three years of discussion, the Council has unanimously agreed a highly skilful compromise, a very wellbalanced and sensitive compromise."
"We have decided - I speak for my group in committee and here in Parliament - to approve and support this compromise, because the way to construct Europe is to advance step-by-step."
"What could have been improved?"
"In my opinion, the distributors have not been dealt with sufficiently well - but that is not the opinion of everyone in my group - and it could have been further improved in the area of combined heat and power."
"However we recognize that important interests on the part of the Member States justify the arrangements proposed."
"Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what happens next?"
"Firstly, we expect clear statements from the Commission about regular and early reports, so that further steps can ensue."
"Secondly, in those cases where states make use of the exemptions in relation to combined heat and power, we expect a report to Parliament so that that, too, can be discussed by it."
"Parliament would like to follow this issue."
"Thirdly, without further delay, we expect Commission reports on the need for harmonization in the areas of the environment and tax."
"Fourthly, I want to make it clear that with this directive we are agreeing a level to which the applicant countries of the former Communist bloc in central and eastern Europe will have to adhere, and for which they must now prepare themselves."
"Fifthly, I would like to voice my hope that the reformed and more efficient firms in the gas market will also become capable, as a result of this reform, of tackling the world market, where in my view they have so far been inadequately represented."
"I thank the Commissioner, I thank the entire Commission, and I thank all the Members - first and foremost, Mr Desama - who have shown such a commitment to this directive over the years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to announce the favourable position of our group, the Group Union for Europe, with regard to the directive on the natural gas market and Mr Desama' s report."
"This favourable position is the result of agreement with the other political groups in the European Parliament and also of mediation within our group."
"I would have preferred the directive to be more ambitious, to provide more space for decentralized production, to introduce some more ambitious elements of competition promoting the districts and associations of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular."
"However, we have listened with satisfaction to the undertakings given by the Commission in the discussions within our Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy. Consequently, the outstanding aspect that leaves us with most uncertainty is the treatment of the cogeneration plants, in which regard the directive still seems to be ambiguous and retains complete discretion on the input thresholds."
"Nevertheless, I have listened to the reasons put forward by the various parties involved and the rapporteur's analysis, and, to conclude, it seems to me that the guideline of good in relation to better should prevail, as in the electricity directive, and that the gas market should be re-regulated well as soon as possible, rather than fight with the Council again, possibly for years, for something better."
"Moreover, the amendment introduced by Mr Pompidou and accepted by the Desama report, which requires an assessment of the results of this directive over a certain number of years, offers the European Parliament a certain pathway along which to pursue our objectives."
"I would like to conclude by congratulating Mr Desama and the Commission on their excellent work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, my group, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, is very pleased with the directive on natural gas."
"At last there will be an internal market for gas with the attendant market functioning and natural competition."
"It means prices that conform to the market - in other words, lower prices for European companies and in future also for consumers."
"I obviously congratulate Claude Desama on his result."
"Although the market opening is still extremely limited, my group can agree with the Council's common position."
"We support Mr Desama, apart from two issues on which my group has tabled amendments."
"It is our job after all to ensure that Europe has effective legislation."
"The European Union Member States are becoming increasingly dependent on gas for heat and electricity."
"Although gas is a relatively clean form of energy, CO2 is released when it is burnt."
"In view of the agreements made in Kyoto concerning CO2 reduction, it is important that we use our gas as efficiently as possible."
"A technology which makes a contribution is cogeneration."
"Combined heat and power stations have an output of 80 % to 90 %. This is almost twice as much as a conventional gas-fired power station."
"Cogeneration should therefore be promoted and should benefit from the liberalized market."
"The Council's position gives only the big combined heat and power stations the right always to buy gas freely."
"Yet in reality, more and more small combined heat and power stations are being built, for example for companies which generate their own electricity and use the heat for an industrial process."
"In the Netherlands combined heat and power, as well as CO2 from combined heat and power stations, is used in market gardening, a totally closed circuit which is efficient and environmentally friendly."
"Did we not agree with the Council that energy-efficient technologies ought to be promoted?"
"My group believes that all gas-fired combined heat and power stations should be entitled to buy gas freely."
"We oppose Article 18. 2 and, with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, will support the amendments on this."
"My second amendment concerns the position of distribution companies in the gas market."
"Distribution companies are able to stimulate initiatives such as the construction of combined heat and power stations at local level."
"It is therefore important that these companies can be considered full market players, and are able to buy their gas freely."
"Only proper market functioning under equal conditions will ensure that energy is used as efficiently as possible."
"If we wish to comply with the Kyoto agreements then this is a necessary condition."
"On principle, our group will persevere with this as well."
"To conclude, Mr President, the fact that the Council is somewhat casual in curbing the use of fossil fuels, and therefore CO2 , is made particularly manifest by the budget for the ALTENER programme which is being debated after this."
"My group fully concurs with the opinion of the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz. The budget is so low that all statements from the Council about greater efforts towards climate protection seem almost laughable."
"Mr President, in spite of the absence of a common energy policy, we receive directive after directive adapting the energy market to the principles of free trade and competition."
"After electricity, as has been said, it is the gas market which is to be liberalized."
"Certainly, a compromise agreement was reached between the different governments on 8 December 1997, a compromise which the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy has not wanted to threaten with amendments, judging the Council's common position to be balanced and reasonable."
"I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Desama on his work."
"Nevertheless, the opening up to liberalization is progressive and not as strong as the Commission initially proposed."
"Long term supply contracts are safeguarded and measures relating to public service obligations are recognized, in particular with regard to distribution."
"But even if it is progressive and controlled, the opening up of the market to competition is no less real and will not fail to weigh ever more heavily on the development of this sector."
"Manufacturers will benefit from price reductions due to competition between suppliers and, in compensation, domestic users will suffer an increase in prices."
"This is, moreover, exactly what the president of Eurogaz admitted when he spoke to the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"Market pressures will be exerted on the principles and mission of public service, which risks being progressively dismantled in the face of attacks from competition."
"Thus, before the directive has even finally been adopted, the French Government has challenged the monopoly of Gaz de France by opening up the market to the private sector in districts which are not currently served."
"Furthermore, owing to a rapid return on investment, liberalization risks leading to preference being given to electricity production based on natural gas, to the detriment of other sources such as nuclear energy."
"For all these reasons, the majority of our group, in particular the French Members of Parliament, are opposed to this directive to open up the gas market to competition."
"In our opinion, in the absence of a common energy policy, there is no justification for the liberalization of the energy market, be it the gas or the electricity sector."
"Our position is based both on Article 90.2 of the Treaty, which recognizes the possibility of each Member State organizing its public services contrary to the rules of competition, and also on the principle of subsidiarity, which must enable the special nature of energy to be taken into consideration. It is not a product just like any other and must not therefore be subject to free competition."
"Mr President, I am happy with this compromise, which I would describe as a flexible one. It will enable each Member State to move still further towards the creation of an internal market in natural gas whilst enabling a controlled opening up of the market and recognizing the obligation of public service as essential."
"This compromise takes into account the different comments made by all the actors in this affair since 1993."
"Parliament has greatly contributed to this outcome and I do not think, as some Members wish, that we should move towards conciliation at any cost."
"This procedure is a last resort which tends sometimes, it is true, to show Parliament's importance and determination. Nevertheless, a weapon is never truly dissuasive unless used sparingly."
"With the issue of gas, it can be said that we have reached a satisfactory balance at second reading."
"It is essential, for example, that Member States designate eligible customers."
"As with the electricity directive, the future gas directive leaves this problem to the realm of subsidiarity."
"It is also essential that this agreement is, as I said, flexible - that is, that the Member States are able to move at their own pace with regard to opening up their respective markets, some wanting to move much faster than others."
"Differences in the structure of consumption between countries must therefore be taken into account, and the minimum degree of opening up that is decided upon in the agreement consequently seems acceptable to me."
"The Group of the European Radical Alliance would like to thank Mr Desama and approves of his report, which will give rise to a directive enabling clear rules to be formulated for such a strategic sector."
"Let us not forget that although Europe is going to find itself in a position of surplus supply in the short term, with greater competition between the traditional suppliers, new resources will be necessary from around 2005 and the Union's dependence on external gas sources will increase."
"Mr President, I should also like to offer sincere thanks to Claude Desama."
"Following on from what he said earlier, we might also say that Council presidencies come and go, but the rapporteur Claude Desama goes on forever."
"He has certainly worked on these matters for a very long time and has ensured himself a place in the history books of European politics."
"The real problem we have in this case is Article 18.2."
"It is our intention that it should be possible for combined heat and power to purchase gas as cheaply as possible, in other words to be accepted as a customer, everywhere, in every country."
"Now the objection that arises is that people say: ""Well now, that calls the Council compromise into question."
"They went to a lot of trouble in the Council, so why should we now extend the procedure by means of a process of negotiation?'"
"I am sorry, but I cannot accept this argument."
"If we accept this argument, then all proposals from the Council are reasonable as a matter of principle, and we can give ourselves a relatively easy life."
"Translating this to national Parliaments would mean that, if the government makes a legislative proposal, it clearly will have had a reason for doing so, and consequently the Parliament would have to give its agreement."
"I cannot go along with that, although I concede that the procedure will, of course, be extended as a result."
"But there is also a second point in relation to this matter."
"At the same time as we are debating this gas directive, the Commission has presented a paper, an interesting communication on combined heat and power."
"We, the Parliament - the rapporteur is Mrs Estevan Bolea - shall also demand that the contribution of combined heat and power within the European Union should be doubled or trebled."
"What Parliament is doing here is a contradiction."
"On the one hand, we are calling for a doubling or trebling of the role of combined heat and power; on the other, we are afraid to write into our directive that they may buy their gas wherever they like."
"If Parliament behaves like this, we shall lose credibility. That is the worst thing that can happen in politics, and we are being severely punished for it at the moment in some places in the Member States."
"That is why I ask you to support the Socialists' amendment, and then we shall see what happens."
"After all, we are dealing with sensible people!"
"Mr President, after almost ten years of debating the issue, the natural gas markets are now being deregulated."
"I would like to thank Claude Desama for his excellent work on this matter."
"The proposal for a directive is a good one, but I wish to point out one weakness in all this, which is that in the gas directive the status of combined heat and electricity production is inferior to that of other means of energy production."
"Electricity producers will be allowed to pipe gas regardless of the size of the company, but if the company is a producer of combined heat and power, Member States may determine the minimum size of the gas company allowed to pipe gas."
"I do not think this is right."
"Combined heat and power production is surely one of the best ways of achieving the aims of the Kyoto conference, as it will lead to a reduction in greenhouse emissions as companies increase their overall efficiency."
"Besides, I think it is very important that the implementation of the directive in Member States is monitored and that the Commission also shares its experiences with the European Parliament and Council by means of a report."
"Mr President, this may not be in keeping with what has gone before, but I feel obliged to say that I am against the directive and the recommendation, and of course I cannot congratulate Mr Desama."
"The reason for this is that both the directive and the recommendation operate within the framework of privatization, the most extreme liberalization, and free competition within an unregulated free market."
"The directive is targeted towards the gradual exclusion of the public sector while, on the other hand, encouraging and promoting a private monopoly over natural gas in the shape of the integrated enterprise, whether vertical or horizontal."
"If integration is horizontal, enterprises trading in other sectors, such as electricity, may enter the natural gas sector. Thus we will have enormous monopolistic business conglomerates which will rule in tyranny over society, holding in their power this most crucial element - energy - which is vital for growth and development, for the provision of social services and for the protection of the environment."
"A private monopoly is incompatible with these three factors because it seeks profit and nothing else."
"It will therefore rule in tyranny over the whole of society, which will be obliged, through taxation, to pay for structural work on behalf of these enterprises, and even for safety and protection."
"For these reasons we will not vote for this action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we are all aware, the proposal for the internal market in natural gas is extremely important."
"The gradual liberalization of this market, which has an annual turnover of more than ECU 100 billion, is inextricably linked with our aim of increased competition in the European economy, and also of reduced unemployment."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for its decision, first and foremost, to speed up the examination of the common position on natural gas in order to enable the timely submission of the second reading to the Energy Council to be held on 11 May."
"The common position on the internal market in natural gas, which is being submitted to the European Parliament for second reading, is the fruit of intense negotiations."
"During these negotiations we succeeded in laying the foundations of the new competitive electricity market, as well as those of the corresponding natural gas market, which form the fundamental pillars of the internal energy market."
"These important results would not have been possible without the personal contribution of your rapporteur, Mr Desama."
"I would therefore like to thank Mr Desama for his excellent work throughout those years."
"It is true that the landscape of the internal energy market has changed radically."
"The issuing of the electricity directive demonstrated the determination of Member States, the determination of industry and consumers, and also the determination of market forces, to open up the energy sector to competition."
"In reality, as is clear from the recent Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council, Member States are opting for the fastest possible opening up of the market, with the widest possible range, in relation to what is called for by the directive on the electricity market."
"This fact justifies the choices we made in issuing the electricity directive."
"I believe it is in the interests of industry and consumers alike to put the gas directive into effect and not to delay it in relation to the directive on the electricity market."
"The opening up of the natural gas market to competition must not be delayed."
"The common position on the gas directive, which was adopted unanimously by the Council on 12 February, is a significant achievement and reflects the general agreement that has been established between the Member States."
"It includes a large number of common rules which must be implemented by the Member States, in accordance, however, with their own idiosyncrasies."
"In accordance with the intentions of the European Commission and Parliament alike, the present directive provides a common framework for the whole of Europe, leaving the definition of the relevant provisions to the principle of subsidiarity."
"More especially, it provides for the existence of minimum levels of competition in the natural gas market."
"The directive also guarantees that, from the outset, a large number of industrial consumers, as well as all electricity producers, will be free to choose their own natural gas provider."
"This eligibility also includes combined electricity and heat producers and is therefore fully in line with the priority that is accorded to this sector."
"Only in very special and exceptional cases is it possible for a Member State to institute reduced ceilings, which in any case will be communicated to the Commission and, in consequence, will be carefully monitored by the Commission as to the actual justification concerning the imbalances of the domestic electricity markets."
"There are already indications that many Member States will restrict themselves to the basic demands of the directive, but they will open up their markets to competition."
"According to these indications, the results of liberalization will be more significant than previously anticipated."
"The directive also provides for the protection of obligations to provide a service, which Member States can impose on natural gas companies in their market in the broader economic interest."
"Nor must we forget that liberalization of the market does not mean privatization."
"Liberalization of the market means that public state enterprises and private enterprises alike must operate within the framework of the internal market, and respect the principles of healthy competition."
"These obligations will be defined by the Member States in the context of the community framework and will subsequently be communicated to the Commission, which will monitor them on the basis of the provisions of community legislation."
"This mechanism will allow Member States to counterbalance competition with public service whenever it is judged to serve the broader public interest."
"As regards storage, we believe this cannot be regarded as part of a natural monopoly, since it is a commercial activity. For this reason, the Commission considers that there is no cause for special provisions in addition to what is already included in the proposal."
"As regards the important issue of take or pay contracts, I am very satisfied with the unanimous and widespread support for the solution that has been achieved."
"This solution allows the Commission to carry out effective control on the basis of clear and objective criteria."
"I am determined to set up an efficient method of cooperation between the Commission and the Member States on this issue."
"The Commission and the Member States are now called upon to play a very important role in this regard."
"The common position incorporates a large number of amendments which were tabled during the first reading by Parliament and which had already been taken into consideration by the Commission in its amended proposal."
"I have to say that these amendments contributed to the clarification of a number of important points, and also to the broader balance of the text."
"I especially appreciate the work of Parliament's Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy in this second reading and I would like to stress that, in principle, the balanced structure and the value of the common position has been acknowledged."
"As regards the amendment on the submission of a report after the directive has been in force for three years, I would like to say that the European Commission is willing to accept this amendment if Parliament considers it to be really necessary."
"I would like to make it clear that, in any event, the Commission intends to submit reports to the European Parliament and to the Council whenever this is deemed expedient and a de facto imperative."
"More especially, it will provide a good opportunity for a regular review of the possibility of implementation by the Member States of the special provision relating to the cogeneration of electricity and heat."
"I would also like to emphasize that the Commission recently drafted its first report on the monitoring of the electricity directive, although the directive itself does not provide for this obligation."
"I can assure you that what we do for electricity we shall of course do for natural gas."
"These reports are of vital importance for the preparation of the next stages in the development of an internal energy market."
"And I would like to add that the presidency fully shares this approach."
"It is clear that it rests with Parliament to decide whether such an amendment is necessary after what has been said."
"In any case, I consider the close monitoring, on the part of the Commission, of the implementation of the gas directive, in close cooperation with Member States, to be absolutely vital."
"Moreover, it is the only way to avoid misinterpretation of the various provisions of the directive and to ensure the full, timely and effective realization of this important initiative."
"In the case of the electricity directive, we successfully followed this approach, which proved to be effective and received a warm reception on the part of all the Member States."
"As regards the other amendments which have been tabled, the Commission is not in a position to adopt them."
"We cannot adopt the two amendments which have been put forward in relation to cogeneration since, as I have already explained, cogeneration is already eligible, except under very specific conditions which must always be communicated to the Commission."
"As regards the amendment which has been put forward on distributors, this touches upon one of the most sensitive issues which have been debated in the context of the overall compromise."
"Distributors are already eligible as regards the supplying of their own eligible customers, whether industries or electricity generators."
"Any freedom of choice beyond this falls within subsidiarity, and this touches on the very essence of the compromise, especially in relation to the possible obligation of public services."
"For these reasons the Commission cannot accept the amendment."
"The Commission considers it vitally important to approve, as quickly as possible, the present directive, which is supported by consumers and industry alike."
"Today's debate has clearly shown that this position is shared by the European Parliament."
"I would like to finish by once again expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Desama, to all the Members of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy of the European Parliament, and to all the Members who spoke today in the context of the debate in this Chamber."
"I wish to thank them warmly for their constructive contribution to this extremely important process, which we are completing today."
"Thank you, Commissioner Papoutsis."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m."
"ALTENER II"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0143/98), on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the common position established by the Council (C40032/98-97/0106 (SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Decision concerning a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community (ALTENER II) (Rapporteur: Mrs. Bloch von Blottnitz)."
"Mr President, the ALTENER programme is a typical example which illustrates the yawning gulf in politics between demands and reality."
"I would simply remind you of the resolutions in Berlin, Rio and Kyoto."
"We committed ourselves to a reduction in the emission of pollutants and CO2 ."
"It was said that this was one of the most important tasks that we face in the coming years."
"In its deliberations on ALTENER II, the Council itself says that by the year 2000 we shall have an increase of 3 % in CO2 emissions, not a reduction."
"It goes on to say - and I regard this as cynical - that ALTENER II should make a significant contribution to the increased use of environmentally friendly, renewable energy sources, and that it should represent a principal component of the Community strategy for the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"I have to say, that strikes me as frankly outrageous when I see that only ECU 22 million have been provided for it."
"What on earth can you do with ECU 11 million per annum?"
"The Council goes even further than this by restricting our budgetary authority, not de jure , which it cannot do, but de facto , and it even wants to prescribe how much we have to allocate in the budget next year."
"That is not on, and under no circumstances can we can put up with it!"
"ECU 11 million this year, and next year we shall see."
"Moreover, what we might call the last straw in this outrageous behaviour is the fact that the Council has not planned to put the issue on the agenda of the Energy Council meeting on 11 May."
"This would mean that we would have no more money at all this year, that we would have no ALTENER II programme at all and once again would do nothing for renewable energies."
"I would just like to remind you once more of the shameful fiasco - since there is not enough money - of SAVE, JOULE and THERMIE."
"We all know that we are dependent on imports of raw materials."
"And so of course all my nuclear friends come along and say, well then, what about nuclear power?"
"I tell you that is utter rubbish, we need uranium for nuclear power, and we have to import that as well, so let us just be clear on that point!"
"In addition, it creates many jobs."
"It is an export opportunity for the next millennium."
"It is environmentally friendly."
"It is the only way we shall achieve a reduction in CO2 ."
"The Council says so, we know that, but there is no money for it!"
"I would just like us to get as much money for these programmes - only for four years - as we chuck at the nuclear industry each year, for fusion for example."
"In that case, we blithely spend ECU 250 million, and sometime, possibly in the year 2050 ..."
"But in the case of something that is necessary, that creates jobs, is good for the environment, and contains enormous innovative potential, we simply do nothing!"
"I have to ask myself, where am I, what sort of play are we performing here?"
"Is it a comedy?"
"It is no comedy; it is tragic."
"I would also like to point out again that, on top of everything else, it is envisaged in the programme that domestic waste should be accepted as renewable energy."
"This, of course, makes me wonder what it is all about."
"Domestic waste, I ask you!"
"That is not renewable energy."
"Of course, it is quite clear that a number of industries have a good deal of interest in this, namely the waste incineration plants."
"The point is that they are now in the hands of the large electricity supply companies. Because these companies were able to build up such large reserves for the disposal of nuclear waste, and they were able to put away billions in taxpayers' money, they were able to take over all the waste incineration plants."
"And now we are expected to subsidize them as well, and allow domestic waste to be accepted as renewable energy!"
"What we ought to be doing is finally to put all the knowledge and all the money that we have into photovoltaics, into hydrogen, into geo-thermal technology and so on, in order to achieve some success in these fields for once."
"What we also ought to be doing as a matter of urgency is to have at our disposal firm regulations on feeding electricity into the grid, otherwise we may as well not bother."
"And of course, at the end of the day, the price would have to take account of how environmentally friendly they are."
"That means we would have to tax the other energies to some extent because at the end of the day, the environmental costs and costs of illness are being imposed on society, while the profits are privatized."
"Fine, I do not object to that, but we really must ensure that there is a fair division here."
"All of this is lacking, and no country wants to introduce taxation."
"We are all ducking and weaving our way around the issue."
"We all continue to muddle through as we always have done in the past, and then we stage enormous international conferences, like the recent one in Kyoto, and say, of course, yes, CO2 reductions, we commit ourselves to 10 %."
"Then the Council says, well, in fact we shall have a 3 % increase, but ALTENER is getting 11 million, and really we would prefer not to do anything; and since we are arguing, we had better quickly get it off the agenda of the Council meeting on 11 May 1998."
"And, at best, suddenly we hear that we should be applying subsidiarity!"
"They fall back on that then, and every country is left to fend for itself."
"If I look around at the individual countries, I discover that none of them is doing anything."
"Each one says it just cannot afford to act because unfortunately it is part of the internal market now, it is in a competitive environment and so on."
"I hope that at long last matters are being taken seriously, and we endow these programmes sensibly."
"The Commission had proposed ECU 30 million."
"Even that was too little in my eyes, but by comparison with what the Council is now dangling in front of us it is little short of a gigantic amount."
"For that reason I would like to ask the House to approve the amendments which have been proposed by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, which Parliament in any case approved at first reading."
"At the end of the day, the Commission was also in agreement with these amendments, although it always makes a few very diplomatic changes."
"I am more in favour of clear words, so there can be no excuses."
"If this is not achieved, there is just one thing I want to say to you: the costs of our sloppy behaviour, in failing to act, are so great in the health and environment fields that we shall simply be unable to pay them in the next millennium."
"At the end of the day, we do have a certain responsibility towards future generations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, I think I can very largely associate myself with the very clear words of the rapporteur."
"The ALTENER programme is the only programme we have in the European Union that is available exclusively for the assistance of renewable energy sources."
"By the year 2010, the proportion of total energy consumption to be contributed by renewable energy sources is to double, according to the European Commission's proposal in its White Paper on renewable energies."
"They know that in calling for this, they are knocking at an open door as far as the European Parliament is concerned because, in the Mombaur initiative report, in my report on the Green Paper, we called for a significant build-up - at least 15 % - in renewable energy sources because of our profound conviction that, from the viewpoint of climate policy, from the viewpoint of environmental policy, from the viewpoint of import dependence, with regard to rural areas, and with regard to additional jobs, the European Union needs to do a great deal more in this respect."
"I also know that it is not only - perhaps not at all, when it comes down to it - a question of European assistance programmes which will determine whether the desired goal is reached."
"Political decisions which lead to genuinely fair competition conditions through fair access to the grid, and which lead to the internalization of the costs of different ways of generating energy through European energy taxes, are fundamental preconditions."
"A political strategy which leads to a restructuring of taxes in energy policy needs to pervade almost all Community policies, and needs to be implemented through coordination between the Member States and the European Union."
"Nonetheless, facilitating the use of new technologies for energy generation from renewable energies through financial incentives and through concrete assistance will be of exceptional significance if genuine market penetration is to be achieved."
"The Commission has proposed a breakthrough campaign in its White Paper."
"One million photovoltaic roofs and house fronts, 10 000 megawatts from wind, 10 000 megawatts from biomass."
"ECU 4 billion of public funds are required for this."
"I know that a good deal needs to come from the Member States as well."
"But I also know that the 22 million envisaged for two years here is at best a drop in the ocean, and perhaps not even that."
"That is why it has to be quite clear that there has to be some room for manoeuvre over the budget at least for next year, and that we can top it up."
"Secondly - and you, Mr Commissioner, can be sure that you will hear from us when the time comes to consider the successor to ALTENER II in the energy framework programme. We expect that there will be a significant increase there as well."
"Thirdly, and on this point I give my full support to the rapporteur, it is absolutely necessary that the Council really does reach a decision on 11 May so that measures can begin during the current year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party is also going to support all Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' amendments, which have already been approved in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"I have to say, Mr Commissioner and Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, that most of them are nothing but good intentions and an academic exercise similar to the squaring of the circle. Not only is there no money - because there really is not - but, as we are always saying in the Energy Committee, where we talk about renewable energy every day, all we are being presented with by the Commission are good intentions far removed from reality."
"Perhaps in some cases we do not just need money to support renewable forms of energy, Mr Commissioner, but political decisions too."
"If you look at the current renewable energy production figures for the European Union, you will see that we stand at 6 %."
"In Spain the figure is 8 % because that country has made a great effort."
"But of that 6 %, 90 % is conventional hydraulic energy, which means we have just 0.4 % from other renewable energies, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz."
"You are trying to use biomass in your house and you know how difficult it is."
"I think the Member States must make political decisions to favour hydroelectric energy, although most of the groups are opposed to it because they do not want dams. It is the cleanest energy we have; it is truly renewable; and it is the only renewable form which allows us to store electricity."
"The rest cannot do that."
"We will be laying great stress on research into renewable energies in the framework programme on research and development. I think that is the first step."
"Obviously, that includes photovoltaic energy."
"I think the future of renewable energy lies in solar photovoltaic energy, but not yet - it is still very expensive."
"How can we help renewable energy?"
"Obviously, from the financial point of view, with investment - because all these forms of energy only work for very limited periods of time."
"Wind energy is very interesting, but it only operates for 1500 to 2000 hours each year, and sometimes it works at night when we do not need electricity."
"So we will need to support investment."
"And I do think subsidiarity is important, Mrs Rothe and Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, because each Member State should make the greatest possible effort if they really believe in renewable energy. Otherwise, it is all just words."
"In any case, Mr Commissioner, we support the ALTENER programme. We think it has very little funding."
"We think Directorate-General XVII has very little money for all its programmes. However, there is something I want to say to you: maybe you do not just need money."
"Maybe what you need is more courage and fortitude in your political decisions and more results and clarity with the Member States. Because, by the way, we have a liberalized electricity market which is working very well, and a gas market which is not going to be liberalized to such a great extent because - except in the UK, Holland and a bit in Denmark - nobody produces gas, so it is a very special type of transport liberalization."
"That is why this directive was easier than the electricity directive and, in the end, no effort is too great."
"Mr President, the continuing debate on renewable energy highlights again the importance of a coordinated and integrated approach to all EU development programmes."
"The importance of alternative energy policy is widely accepted in this House."
"To the extent that energy based on renewable resources is of significant importance in the utilization of our land resource and, therefore, offers potential to farmers and to job creation in rural areas, I would urge the Council and the Commission to coordinate their efforts in the formulation of long-term energy policy with the development of agriculture and to do so - and this is important - in the context of Agenda 2000."
"In my view there is far too much fragmentation of EU policy and certainly not sufficient appreciation of the importance of developing the full potential of our European land resource."
"The inevitable reform of the common agricultural policy highlights the importance of producing non-food crops."
"Alternative energy programmes based on renewable resources offer a profitable alternative for our farmers and for rural dwellers and rural development programmes."
"As I have already said, we have prioritized the importance of rural development."
"We have identified the European model of agriculture based on the retention of the maximum number of farm families on the land of Europe."
"That is widely accepted and supported in this House."
"However, if we are serious about achieving our objectives under both headings we must coordinate energy policy with the development of agriculture and with employment in rural areas."
"The technology for the production of alternative energy based on agricultural crops is clearly established."
"The technology is there."
"We now need a coordinated approach and a willingness at EU and national level to adjust policies and create the economic environment for the sustainable development of alternative energy closely related to, and based on, the development of our land resource and agriculture and with the central theme of retaining the maximum number of farmers on the land of Europe and the maximum number of people employed in Europe's rural areas."
"So, if we are serious, we must adopt this coordinated approach and I appeal to the Commission and the Council to work more closely together in terms of the final production of European and national policy in the context of Agenda 2000."
"Mr President, I want to say that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left agrees with Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' report too. In addition, I would like to express our satisfaction at our constructive cooperation with the Commission - with the Commissioner, Mr Papoutsis."
"I think the Council's position with regard to the annual ECU 11 million basically places the ALTENER programme in cloud-cuckoo-land and thus deprives it of any real significance."
"It is something which we, as a Parliament, must fight against and challenge, especially during the budget procedure."
"It is very important that these inconsistencies be stopped."
"We can see that there are opportunities for the vast exploitation of gentle forms of energy, such as wind power in the Cyclades, for example, and in the Islands of the Aegean."
"And in spite of the few steps that have been taken, their exploitation will be much less than could be achieved. I would like to put this question to the Commissioner, Mr Papoutsis: what could be done here - in the context of course of the difficult financial possibilities which exist?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, for her report."
"There is no doubt that the ALTENER programme must continue because it is the only programme in the EU in which people are dealing exclusively with renewable sources of energy, and also in view of all the money which the EU gives to other sources of energy."
"The least we can request is that renewable sources of energy also get money."
"So it is laughable that the Council is only able to agree to ECU 11 million per year."
"But what has happened to all the fine words from the Council, including from the Kyoto Conference?"
"What do these words mean?"
"Nothing in reality."
"How is the goal of reducing CO2 emissions actually being achieved?"
"How did the Council see this?"
"Is the Council going to start performing magic or are people going to start juggling the emission figures?"
"There does not appear to be any other explanation."
"The ECU 30 million which the Commission is proposing is also low, but it is still acceptable."
"However, the Council's figures are totally unacceptable."
"You cannot give less money to renewable sources of energy under these conditions when CO2 emissions are constantly rising."
"If the emissions were to decrease sharply, then you could perhaps talk about stabilizing the programme, but not in this case."
"Furthermore, the amendments are important, particularly Amendment No 3."
"If you pollute nature you should also pay for it."
"However, if you have a good environmental policy, then you should also pay less."
"In that case it is important for the different figures to estimate the emission costs to be calculated in different ways too."
"What is cheap should also be good for the environment, and what is bad should be expensive for companies."
"Mr President, allow me to give a practical example."
"At home, in my local area, just behind my house in fact, a windmill construction project is planned and a private developer is ready to invest between 150 and 200 million Belgian francs into it."
"Curiously enough, opposition to this project has come from a cultural association, concerned about the beauty of the landscape and the fact that the nearby castle would suffer visually from the windmills on the plateau behind."
"In this context, the ALTENER II project is a very appropriate means to carry out an impact study, enabling it to be proven by computer simulation that, from the castle, the windmills will not be seen and there will therefore be no visual impact."
"Of course, I am more worried about the noise, and it is for this in particular that the ALTENER project will give us the means to finance these impact studies."
"If you consider that an impact study for a project costs 1.5 million Belgian francs, then the ECU 22 million granted by the Council is exactly enough for 500 projects throughout the European Union."
"I find this amount ridiculous and that is why the Group of the European Radical Alliance will vote for the amendments presented by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, whom I would like to thank for her excellent work."
"Mr President, like the rapporteur, I would first like to say that waste incineration has nothing to do with the issue of renewable energy."
"There is no connection."
"It would be a fine example of cynicism to keep waste incineration in this report since it would be a question of a real misappropriation of funds to the benefit of large companies who could not care less about renewable energy sources."
"Apart from this, ""experiments' - I put the word in quotation marks - ""experiments' in the field of renewable energy have been going on for years throughout the western world."
"For years we have been told of such experiments and the Member States grant a handful of pittances in order to fool public opinion."
"I think there have been enough experiments and not enough large-scale efforts."
"Apart from hydraulic power stations, renewable power sources continue to be nothing but gadgets designed to amuse people."
"You might think this incapacity on the part of countries to pursue an active policy of renewable energy development - an incapacity which is explained particularly by the large economic interests of the energy lobby - would lead the European Union to compensate for these failings, to have an approach far more in keeping with the general interest, to climb above all these mercenary interests."
"But no, we remain at a level of pious wishes, fine words and declarations with no follow-up."
"Just a few months after the Kyoto Conference, which timidly indicated the path to be followed in order to preserve the balance of our planet, it would seem logical for the European Union to affirm a certain priority for renewable energy, which protects the environment and brings real potential in the areas of employment and technological development."
"So, what has become of this priority that the Union should be showing? ECU 22 million, or rather two times nothing, not even a pittance."
"In fact, I am truly embarrassed by this report."
"I am embarrassed because I think Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' work is remarkable, and I thank her for it."
"The issues are expressed well in the document and it is clearly only the budget which does not match up."
"To ensure that this work has not been in vain, I will of course align myself with the rapporteur's recommendations, but I am still convinced that we will be a long time yet in this energy Stone Age, especially as we will not have internalized all the indirect costs of conventional energy sources."
"Given that the calculations are distorted, distortions in competition remain and no progress is made."
"My wish is that there might be a new tax system, as soon as possible, in which as well as economic criteria, social and environmental parameters are finally taken into account within a rigorously accountable dimension."
"We will vote for Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz' amendments."
"Mr President, rarely do we hear a subject discussed in this Chamber which brings so many groups together in enthusiasm."
"That subject is renewable energy."
"Renewable energy enables us to keep our promises, the promises made at Kyoto."
"It creates jobs, it fits in with our priority of job creation."
"I support wholeheartedly the report of Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz; except that I do not agree with her omission of domestic waste and will vote against it."
"Colleagues, if you want Europe to matter to the people in your constituency, choose subjects which interest them."
"Renewable energy interests European citizens."
"We have a multi-pronged approach, we spend millions and millions on research into renewable energy."
"We need, at the same time, to create the legal framework through access to the grid which enables it to prosper and we need a programme like ALTENER."
"In every single Member State of the European Community ALTENER promotes renewable energy."
"I know from the excellent work done by the South Midlands Renewable Energy Centre, the only one in the United Kingdom, that if we go out with the message that renewable energy helps the environment and helps jobs, we get public support."
"Comrades and colleagues in this Parliament, we need public support for the European Union."
"We need to look at the circumstances relevant in every geographical part of this Union, from Lapland to the Greek Islands and we need the renewable energy that is appropriate for every part of the EU."
"The minister representing the United Kingdom presidency, John Battle, is one of the enthusiasts for renewable energy and he has personally reassured me that he will not allow ALTENER II to slip away until it is too late to implement."
"He will do everything in his power to ensure that something of interest to all Europeans gets through an appropriate Council."
"I believe that the budget in the preliminary draft budget has been much improved."
"That is an encouraging sign."
"It seems to me that when the European Union started it looked at coal and it looked at nuclear energy; the energy to look at now is renewable energy and I therefore am delighted that the ALTENER II programme will receive support from every party in this Parliament."
"Mr President, the Commission's goal to raise the share of renewable energy sources in total EU energy consumption to 15 % by the year 2010 is in keeping with the aims decided upon at Kyoto and Parliament must give it the support it deserves."
"Actually, this target has been well exceeded in Finland."
"With further development of the markets, the right training and guidance, and the existence of the ALTENER programme, we will be able to promote the use of renewable energy sources throughout the Union."
"Owing to geography, circumstances in different countries vary."
"According to proposed national quotas, an additional reduction in gas emissions will cost Finland more per ton of CO2 than any other EU country."
"We have already begun to adopt all the easiest ways of reducing emissions, such as district heating, using wood for fuel, setting up combined heat and electricity production plants and following energy saving programmes."
"It is only the expensive alternatives that are left."
"High technology in Finland has a place in nearly every walk of life."
"For example, our homes are built for our cold climate, and heat does not escape from them like it does in many other countries in the Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to specially thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, for the work she has put in regarding the ALTENER II programme."
"Before I come to the amendments that Parliament is proposing in this second reading, I would like to mention some more general developments."
"You will of course remember that during Parliament's sitting of November 1997, when I presented the ALTENER II programme to you, I outlined to you the framework for the programme, and I also outlined the aspirations we had to strengthen our policy."
"Just five months later, I have the pleasure of referring to the positive developments which ensued."
"I announced to you then my intention to propose as soon as possible for approval in the European Commission the White Paper on renewable energy sources and the framework programme for energy."
"Both these important proposals were unanimously adopted by the Commission and are now being debated by the institutional organs."
"As regards the White Paper on renewable energy sources, it is anticipated that a resolution will be adopted by the Energy Council on 11 May, which will support our proposals."
"This is important because the ALTENER II programme is an essential vehicle not only for the implementation of Community strategy but also for the implementation of the action plan, which is outlined in the White Paper."
"At this point please allow me to refer to two specific issues, which were brought up by several honourable Members who spoke today."
"But first of all I have to say that I fully share the view of Mr Alavanos, that we must strengthen wind power even more."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, although I understand why there is a certain restlessness in the House, because the debate has been delayed through circumstances completely beyond our control, I must once again request Members to abstain from private conversations for a few minutes and treat speakers with a modicum of respect, enabling them to be heard with all due dignity, whether the speaker is a Member of this House or the Commissioner."
"Thank you Mr President."
"I was saying that I fully share Mr Alavanos' view that we must strengthen wind power even more, especially in regions where conditions are favourable, such as the Cyclades, as he himself mentioned, but also in other regions of Europe."
"I assure you that we will make every effort in this direction, in collaboration with Member States. I would like to take this opportunity to stress that the Commission proposes that, from the year 2000, the Regional Fund should include actions for renewable energy sources."
"And I hope the European Parliament will support this proposal."
"As regards the issue raised by Mrs Rothe and Mr Pinel with regard to waste, in the context of the ALTENER programme and in accordance with Community policy on waste, priority is given to ecological management, such as biomass, chiefly of the organic part of the waste."
"I must say, I am especially satisfied that the Council and Parliament alike declared on behalf of the Commission proposal for ALTENER II and approved practically without amendment all the actions provided for in the context of the programme under review."
"The importance of ALTENER II is thus confirmed, as is the need for its immediate approval at the Council on 11 May, with a view to its immediate implementation from 1998."
"I would also like to highlight something which I mentioned during the first reading: in the opinion of the Commission, the substance of certain amendments places them within the framework of the Community strategy for renewable energy sources rather than within the ALTENER framework."
"More specifically, as regards the amendments which you propose, the Commission accepts, in principle, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7 and 9."
"However, as regards Amendments Nos 1 and 2, in accordance with the position it outlined during the first reading, the Commission considers that it is more suitable to place the fundamental principles which are introduced with the respective explanatory statements Nos 20 and 19."
"As regards Amendments Nos 7 and 9, they are already covered at other points in the ALTENER II proposal."
"The content of Amendment No 6 is better placed with, and is covered in, the proposal of the White Paper on renewable energy sources."
"As regards Amendment No 3, the Commission considers the reference to indirect costs and their inclusion in tariffs to be premature."
"This possibility must be analysed and it could be introduced in a possible legislative proposal to be submitted later."
"Amendments Nos 5 and 8 concern the amount which is entered in the budget."
"In this regard, the Commission inserted in the minutes of the Energy Council of December 1997 a communication in which it opposed including in the text of the resolution any amount concerning the budget."
"Moreover, the Commission considers that the budget which was approved by the Council for the two years is inadequate."
"In consequence, we also consider the budget which was approved by the competent budgetary authority for the year 1998 to be inadequate."
"Therefore the European Commission can accept Amendment No 5."
"On the other hand, it cannot accept Amendment No 8."
"Nor can the Commission accept Amendment No 10 concerning committee procedures."
"The Commission has made every effort to incorporate Parliament's proposals as far as possible and as faithfully as possible into the legal text of the proposal we are being asked to decide upon."
"I would like once again to thank you and your rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, as well as the Members of the Parliamentary Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, for your support throughout this endeavour."
"Thank you, Commissioner Papoutsis."
"I apologize on behalf of the House for the way in which this debate was conducted."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m."
"Air pollution by motor vehicles"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0126/98), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position adopted by the Council on 23 March 1998, with a view to adopting a Directive of the European Parliament and Council relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles and amending Directive 70/220/EEC with regard to light commercial vehicles (C4-0177/98-96/0164B(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr. Lange)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in February we took a decision in relation to the Auto/Oil Programme on air quality in Europe."
"One small component was missing, namely light commercial vehicles."
"These are the vehicles which make deliveries in towns - postmen, small greengrocers, deliveries for suppliers."
"It is for vehicles such as these that we need to add a component as soon as possible to ensure an improvement in the air quality in the towns of Europe."
"This procedure at second reading is a perfect example of Parliament's ability to work quickly and efficiently."
"We received the common position on 2 April and having completed our work on it today - at the end of April - we are now able to come to a decision."
"That shows how quickly and efficiently Parliament can work."
"That is why I do not want to make any grand speeches. I want instead to uphold this tradition and urge quickly and efficiently that we follow this recommendation from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, so that industry can plan with confidence, and so that the air quality in the towns of Europe is improved."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for enabling us to arrive at a result very quickly in this procedure as well."
"I should also like to thank Mr Lange, and I would ask you to understand that, although we are now in a position to take this matter forward to the conciliation procedure, the Commission cannot accept amendments which go beyond the Auto/Oil Programme II. That applies in particular to Amendment No 5 and the other amendments connected with it."
"However, it does not mean that we shall not cooperate with Parliament in a very open and positive way, as we have in the past."
"Although not many people have heard this remark, that does not matter because it is well known that this is how we work."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.00 a.m."
"Votes"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose to our Parliament that we show solidarity with European Parliament staff, who are currently holding a standing general meeting to defend the independence of the European civil service against nationalization and politicization."
"Mr President, lest there be any ambiguity, my group will be voting against all amendments."
"We decided this procedurally."
"We welcomed a common text which, very unfortunately, Mr Nicholson felt unable to sign."
"Our position is to support this text unamended."
"This should not be interpreted to mean that we do not agree with the substance of some of the amendments but we are satisfied that the Good Friday agreement contained strong commitments to decommissioning."
"Therefore, my group will be voting for the compromise text debated yesterday."
"Mr President, I rise on the same issue."
"The question of the decommissioning of weapons in Northern Ireland is a very delicate and deeply sensitive question."
"I want to make it quite clear that the position of the Liberal Group is that we shall vote for the joint resolution and we shall not vote for any amendments."
"I wish to say to Mr Nicholson and to the people he represents that we do so because we believe that the sensitive question of decommissioning is comprehensively addressed within the boundaries of the agreement."
"For that reason we do not wish to pick individual items from the comprehensive text."
"Therefore, we support what is in the agreement but will not be voting for amendments to the joint resolution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot have yet another debate."
"That is for the explanations of vote."
"You are now having a debate which, I confess, puts me in a difficult position."
"Other Members have asked to speak. I cannot let everybody speak, so I will just let two people speak and I will then close this debate."
"Mr President, in relation to the amendments, quite naturally I would support the thrust of the amendments which is the active decommissioning of all weapons held by terrorists on both sides of the divide."
"But I wish to state that it is very unwise to selectively highlight any one issue which is already covered quite comprehensively in the agreement."
"Therefore, we cannot support any individual amendment at this stage."
"In relation to amendments which use the term 'Republic of Ireland' , I would like to recall for colleagues that the official name of my country is Ireland."
"Mr President, I did not table these amendments this morning to create any trouble for this House."
"But I have to say to Mrs Banotti, Mr Cox and Mr Collins that simply giving verbal support to them is not enough."
"I say to this House today that you have a chance to say to all terrorists in Northern Ireland: Decommission your weapons!"
"Vote for my amendment."
"That is why I tabled it."
"Mr President, I hope you will refuse explanations of votes from these people."
"They have done them in advance."
"Mrs Green, you are absolutely right."
"That is what I said, but you can see that Mr Hume now wishes to speak."
"I am in a very difficult position, since this dance has started and I am not being fair in the eyes of the other groups."
"I will let Mr Hume speak. I cannot make distinctions between the political groups."
"Mr President, just to get the facts right."
"Mr Nicholson raised a very serious issue - the decommissioning of arms of violent organizations."
"We all agree with that."
"However, I want to point out that in voting for the agreement and for the joint resolution, this is what the agreement says we are voting for: ' All participants to the agreement accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organizations' ."
"That is what the House is voting for."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, in accordance with the Bureau's instructions, I asked for the floor prior to the vote."
"You should have called me prior to that vote."
"My presence should be noted on this occasion for this vote."
"Mr Falconer, I am very glad you keep reminding us of the Bureau's instructions, in case anyone should have forgotten them!"
"Mr President, given that the implementation of the single currency is nothing but a political fraud, I will not take part in this vote."
"Paragraph 11"
"Mr President, I should like to propose the following oral amendment, namely to replace the final words in the German text, i. e, ""zu vertiefen ' by ""weiterzuführen ' ."
"Paragraph 16"
"Mr President, paragraph 16 is important, but not central to this report."
"In order to achieve as large a majority as possible in this House, I am prepared to delete this paragraph, and I would ask those colleagues who have difficulty with this either to vote against or to abstain"
"Mr von Wogau, since you are the rapporteur and paragraph 16 is your paragraph, you have the right to withdraw it."
"We do not need to vote for you to withdraw it."
"Paragraph 26"
"Mr President, we have accepted other oral amendments and so, with your consent and with the House's consent, but particularly with the rapporteur's agreement, I would like to propose an oral amendment because the amendment is incorrectly formulated in terms of the law."
"It is - I repeat - a small technical amendment that I would like to read, if you agree: ""The European Council is asked to observe its undertakings and to propose a single candidate for the Presidency of the European Central Bank during its forthcoming Summit, on 2 May 1998' ."
"I would like to hear the rapporteur's opinion."
"Mr President, we discussed the amendment in its original form in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and we came to the conclusion that we should not agree to it because it contained two factual inaccuracies and was formulated in such a way that we could not accept it."
"As it now stands, the formulation reflects a very broad extent of opinion in this House."
"I have asked the different groups in the committee."
"They all were of the opinion that what we now have is an expression of the view of the House."
"That is why I would recommend that we agree to Mr Dell'Alba's amendment in its revised form."
"Paragraph 43"
"We had reached agreement in committee as regards the content of the compromise amendment but, because the formulation was not quite right, we came to an agreement on the following; paragraph 12, on which we have already voted, says exactly what has to be expressed here, and that is why, as rapporteur, I would propose that we vote against paragraph 43 and that those who have difficulty with this - and I would urge this strongly - should at least abstain."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, because there were so few of us present earlier for the debate, I would ask the honorable Members to listen carefully to what I have to say now, for it is an important moment. I would like to state my position as rapporteur with regard to the different amendments."
"In fact, the vote we are going to take today brings to an end a process which has been in progress for six years now."
"We are going to vote on four amendments."
"I would like to give an opinion initially on the first three."
"Mr President, I will ask you to allow me to speak later on the last amendment which, paradoxically, is No 1."
"With regard to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4, I would like to say that as rapporteur I am opposed to these amendments."
"I therefore hope that the House does not vote for them, at the possible risk of causing upheaval within my own group, since Amendment No 2 is from my group, tabled by Mrs McNally."
"The reason I am opposed to these amendments is clear. They do not address the fundamentals."
"Yet the British presidency - which has put a great deal of effort into this compromise - the Commission - which can confirm this, if the Commissioner so wishes - and I myself, are all of the opinion that after six years of work it is not possible to reach a better compromise than the one we have at last reached, as regards the issues addressed by these amendments."
"To send us to conciliation for these amendments would really create a major problem of blockage for a directive which urgently needs to be passed now."
"All the players in the energy world are calling for it."
"I am therefore asking you, please, whatever your position on the basic issues, show some political reason and reject these amendments."
"Mr President, just to increase the confusion on the left a little more, Amendments Nos 2 and 4, one from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and one from the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, are identical."
"The Socialists intend to vote for the first one, but against the second one."
"I have a feeling this will lead to considerable confusion amongst the voters if we have a roll-call vote."
"Amendment No 1"
"Mr President, the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy voted for Mr Pompidou's amendment in order to encourage the Commission to clarify its position on the issue, that is, to give Parliament the guarantee that there would very soon be a report from the Commission on the state of application of the directive."
"In this amendment, we anticipated giving the Commission a three year period."
"Earlier, Mr Papoutsis gave an opinion on this amendment saying that the Commission could accept it but that, in reality, the time-scales set by the Commission were even shorter than anticipated in the amendment."
"Consequently, if my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party will allow me, I think we should not try to be more catholic than the Pope and I therefore request that this amendment from the Committee on Energy be rejected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the vote on the Desama report I would like to thank Parliament, and especially your rapporteur, Mr Desama."
"With today's vote a big step has been taken towards the completion of the internal market."
"From a political viewpoint, today is very important because, after six years of negotiations, with the directive on the internal market for natural gas as well as the directive on the internal market for electricity, in less than two years, during this present legislature, we have given a new dimension to the European internal market, a market which represents ECU 250 billion a year or, in a few days, 250 billion euros. It is a market which has important beneficial repercussions for industry, employment, and the citizens of Europe."
"For this reason, I would like once again to thank the European Parliament for its particularly important and especially creative contribution to this great effort."
"Mr President, this vote marks the end of a debate which was under discussion for three legislatures."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Desama, for his extraordinary commitment and for the successes which the Parliament as a whole has achieved."
"Even if not provided for in the Rules of Procedure, Mr Mombaur, it is impossible to ignore such courteous remarks."
"(The President declared the common position approved) Recommendation for second reading (A4-0143/98), on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision concerning a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community (ALTENER II) (C4-0032/98-97/0106(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz)"
"(The President declared the common position approved (as amended) )"
"Mr President, I would like it to be recorded that I am present from now on and I will not take part in the vote."
"Mr De Luca, we have taken note of it."
"Amendment No 29"
"Mr President, even before this vote I indicated my wish to speak for a quite simple reason."
"Clearly, a translation has been made that is liable to be misunderstood in several languages, and this ambiguous translation for Amendment No 29 may also lead to a quite different outcome in the vote."
"We are dealing here with a measure against youth unemployment."
"Many young people are qualified for the wrong occupations, for occupations for which there is no demand."
"That is why we have here the proposal that the Commission should ascertain which occupations really are in demand, with a qualitative analysis of occupational needs."
"This analysis should then be made available to the Member States, and the Member States will decide whether or not they make use of this information and change their training plans."
"In other words, we are dealing with the provision of a service, and Member States will decide on a voluntary basis whether or not to make changes."
"This appears in several translations as a binding proposal, and as a result it may lead to a distortion of the voting outcome."
"I would ask you therefore to allow the voting on Amendment No 29 to be repeated."
"Mr Pirker, we will check the translation from German into the other languages."
"You need not worry. Your amendment has been adopted."
"I did not give you the floor straight away but we try to get the vote moving, since if we did not we would go very slowly, and I cannot slow the pace down by allowing Members to speak all the time."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"This matter is now closed. I cannot of course congratulate the rapporteur!"
"Mr President, I have requested the floor because the President cannot congratulate the rapporteur in this case, so I want to do so on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The Spanish are always courteous, and in the case of Mr Medina Ortega this is Socialist courtesy too, for which I am obliged."
"Mr President, we would avoid problems like that raised by Mr Medina Ortega if the rapporteur would not preside when we are dealing with his report."
"Mrs Thors, as you are aware, this is a common practice, and when reports do not present problems it does not matter in the least."
"Report (A4-0134/98) by Mr Ettl, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and selfemployed persons moving within the European Union (COM(97)0486 - C4-0661/97-97/0265(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I am sorry, but from here I was just not able to see as well as you could that in the case of Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 by the Green Group in the European Parliament there really was a clear majority of votes against."
"To be quite honest, I cannot understand it either, because in Question Time on the issue yesterday the Council and the Commission were in agreement with it."
"It has been confirmed."
"There are already working groups in the ecological area of the textile industry."
"Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, as you are aware Parliament, in its wisdom, has the right to vote for whatever position it thinks it should take, without taking into consideration either the position of the Council, or the position of the Commission, or the positions of many of us."
"That is what always happens. The important thing is what Parliament decides and what it values, and I do not think comments are necessary."
"Parliament has decided."
"It has rejected the two amendments and adopted the rest."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"The Green Group in the European Parliament is in agreement with the Commission and the majority in Parliament that the further development of the market for electronic services - pay-TV, pay-perview, pay-radio, online access to databases - on the one hand, and the current fragmentation of this market by national legislation, make regulation at Community level indispensable."
"The present directive fulfils this purpose insofar as it provides a sufficiently comprehensive and flexible framework at Community level through its combination of definitions of protected services, the application of internal market rules and the exclusion of all unauthorized access technologies."
"We share the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media that the importance of copyright protection against exploiting interests, the guarantee of access to public information independent of market interests and the ability to protect the private domain by means of encryption technologies should receive proper emphasis in this directive as well, in spite of regulations in force elsewhere."
"We also agree with those who reject any restriction of the definitions in Articles 1c and e."
"Resolution on Northern Ireland"
"I allowed you to go over your time because I must say I was feeling a little uneasy as during the morning I gave some of your colleagues the chance to speak."
"I was in a very difficult position then as the House was, quite rightly, demanding that there should be no debate."
"On the other hand, I had already given the floor to one or two people and I was feeling very uneasy in the face of your request."
"So I gave you extra time to recompense you."
"Mr President, I would like to make clear today why I vote against this resolution."
"I hope Mrs Malone can remain in the House to hear why because it might do her a bit of good."
"It was because the Socialist Group were not prepared to include decommissioning."
"Mrs Malone, let me tell you I am not cherrypicking."
"Can I further tell you that this agreement would never have come to place but for the courage and determination of my party leader in all of this."
"Can I say to you and the Socialist Group that I speak in this House for the largest Unionist Group in Northern Ireland."
"If the Socialist Group wish to discount what we feel, wish to discount what we say and wish to discount what we really believe in our inner hearts, then you can do so."
"But you do so at a price and at a very serious price."
"Your comrade, the Secretary-of- State, showed us here yesterday that she could not even be balanced when she came to this House in her contributions."
"Mrs Malone, let me make it clear in this House today, I want all terrorist groups to lay down their arms."
"I want them to give them up."
"I know they will not give them all up but they at least should give an indication of how much they will give up."
"I would like to say, unfortunately, this House sent the wrong message to the Unionist people that I represent in Northern Ireland."
"I will have to take back to my party leader a message that is not a good one."
"Fine words are not enough, we need action; if you want consent, if you want consensus you have got to work for it."
"I did not see any attempt to create consensus in the Socialist Group here in this Chamber."
"I do not have anything against any other group in those negotiations, it was only the Socialist Group."
"I wish to express my full support for the agreement reached by the Irish and British Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland on Good Friday."
"The commitment shown by the two governments and in particular the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the Prime Minister is a reflection of the deep desire of the majority of people on the island of Ireland and Britain for a just and lasting peace for all the people."
"Time does not permit me to go through the list of all the participants to the process."
"However, it would be remiss of me not to recall the tremendous courage and vision of the former Irish Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and Prime Minister John Major."
"The success of the present negotiations can be traced back to the signing of the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 which set the parameters of joint cooperation, mutual respect, equality and reform of inequities that were inherent in the systems."
"The much pilloried Hume-Adams Document was significant in bringing the nationalist parties to the table."
"However, the inclusion of the representatives of loyalist paramilitary groups helps to ensure that all traditions are encompassed."
"The ongoing support, both financial and moral, of the institutions of the European Union has been a vital ingredient of the process."
"Europe never lost faith in the Irish people to reach an accommodation that reflects the differing traditions whilst building on common goals and ideals."
"On 22 May the island of Ireland will vote in dual referenda on the agreement and the proposed changes to the Irish Constitution, British constitutional legislation and the establishment of new North-South Bodies."
"My wish is for a resounding majority support for the agreement: ""opportunity comes to pass but not to pause' ."
"I would like to finish with two quotes, first from Abraham Lincoln: ' with malice towards none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive to finish the work we are in.'"
"Finally the often quoted lines from the poet William Butler Yeats, in the Lake Isle of Innisfree: ' and I shall find some peace there for peace comes dropping slow; dropping from the veil of the morning to where the cricket sings.'"
"I would like to begin my comments by saying that I welcome the Irish Peace agreement reached at the multi-party talks in Belfast on Good Friday last."
"I would like to pay particular tribute to the political parties who had the courage and the conviction to participate in these negotiations and to have ensured that a balanced and equitable agreement was secured."
"This agreement is a balanced and reasonable accommodation which recognizes the different values and cultures on the island of Ireland."
"Opponents of the agreement cannot come up with any progress that is being made to foster peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland."
"This agreement needs to be given an opportunity to succeed and a resounding YES vote on both sides of the Irish border would be a sensible step in the right direction in this regard."
"I welcome the role and support played by the European Union in assisting the process of peace and reconciliation and I hope that this will continue in the near future."
"von Wogau report (A4-0130/98)"
"Mr President, in the vote on the von Wogau report on convergence conditions for the introduction of the single currency, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations wanted to carry out a test in order to clearly demonstrate the wide abyss between the ideas of the European Parliament and the national parliaments with regard to how monetary union should be controlled."
"We tabled two amendments, which repeated word for word the demands of the French National Assembly in its resolution of 22 April last."
"One was a request that the President of the future Central Bank would periodically give an account of the bank's objectives and actions before the appropriate bodies of the National Assembly. The other was the wish that an interparliamentary committee on the euro be created, composed of representatives of both European and national parliaments, which would have responsibility for regularly and publicly hearing from those in charge of the ECB with regard to future monetary policy guidelines."
"The test seems to be completely conclusive."
"The European Parliament has massively rejected these two proposals, and has even adopted a contrary proposal by voting for the following text and I quote: ""Being the EU's only directly elected institution, the European Parliament has a formal role interacting with the European Central Bank' .The European Parliament text continues by defining an extremely lightweight control over the Central Bank, which does not question its sovereignty."
"Those are the words of this House."
"So in this declaration, the possible role of national parliaments is completely eliminated."
"We were well aware, and I want to highlight this most strongly, that if our amendments had been adopted they would not have fundamentally altered the antidemocratic nature of monetary union, but their rejection makes the lesson that much stronger, a lesson which the French National Assembly should remember: the European Parliament will never allow the slightest real power to be given to the national parliaments of the Union, because what it really wants is their complete subordination, along with that of the nations they represent."
"But at the same time, its control will never have the legitimacy of national parliaments, for it is too distanced from the people."
"Thus, European monetary union is constructed in such a way that the most legitimate parliamentary control is also the most impossible."
"We predict a very bad time for democracy if the system is really launched in its current form."
"Mr Berthu, I am not in the habit of making comments, of course, but I must say you have taken a really very prophetic tone."
"Mr President, I have voted against this report because it follows the line of eurofanaticism, a line obsessively aimed at the sole objective of the single currency, without trying to outline a common economic policy at the same time."
"For the future Central Bank, the report also accepts a leading role, a status of inaccessibility, with no kind of democratic control."
"By submitting to all this, the majority is unfortunately reserving a subordinate role for the European Parliament."
"Yesterday marked the beginning of a historic week."
"The many years of work towards economic and monetary union have finally come to fruition, for we have now chosen the first wave of countries who will participate."
"During the past months and years, we have been able to examine the strengths and weaknesses of virtually all areas."
"There is, however, one issue which I would now like to come back to, and which was the subject of much discussion two weeks ago."
"The forthcoming transition to the euro is, in fact, of great concern to the many economic and political players in the African, Caribbean and Pacific regions."
"At the time of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, the issue was discussed at length."
"One of the main concerns is the redistribution of influence in these regions, to the detriment of Europe and to the benefit of a fluctuating dollar."
"They also fear the social, ethnic and political tensions which may result, particularly in central Africa, in the short or long term."
"The introduction of the single currency must not make us forget our overseas economic partners."
"A better integration of Africa and the Caribbean/Pacific regions into the world economy must remain one of our highest priorities."
"Monetary cooperation must be maintained in its present form, and will have the result of truly anchoring the euro."
"This principle, set out in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, does not seem to be questionable."
"Nevertheless, we must remain vigilant, given the legal ambiguities of the Treaties."
"Here too, Parliament has an important political role to play in global stability and the development of third countries."
"I approve of the von Wogau report in all its aspects."
"However, it must not make us forget that the future euro zone can help to strengthen our partners' economies and offer us wider access to the market in general."
"For many people, including ourselves, this report represents the latest political position to be taken by the European Parliament on the basis of the single currency before it is formally adopted."
"Obviously other positions may be adopted later, but nothing will ever be the same as it has been till now."
"This is why we treat this report as being much more important than its contents strictly indicate."
"We still have reservations about 'Euro Now' , especially as regards the fact that the Union has opted to claim that there is nominal convergence between Member States before the event, when we would have preferred to see real convergence coming first."
"It has been said, and is still being said now, that real convergence will follow the event, as if in its wake. Similarly, it has been said and is still being said, that the single currency will be a panacea for the various problems facing the EU, of which the foremost is the problem of unemployment."
"Being realistic, we do not agree."
"It justifies the political criterion for allowing two more countries to join the euro 'vanguard' , which introduces the concept of flexibility as regards the fulfilment of the criteria laid down in a Treaty, which we can only applaud. Furthermore, it affirms the transfer of sovereignty of Member States to the Community sphere, in terms of monetary policy at this stage, which we consider represents a degree of intellectual and political honesty which many people have been unable or unwilling to express for a long time."
"A vote in favour of this report, therefore, would be tantamount to saying that we have always agreed with the road we have been travelling along from the beginning, in terms of adopting the single currency, which is not true. If, on the other hand, we were to vote against this report, we would be casting doubt on the rules of democracy, and failing to recognize the efforts of so many people, particularly the Member States concerned."
"In a word, it would be to refuse to give the benefit of the doubt. We have therefore abstained, without intending at any time in the future to make party political capital out of the difficulties we foresee arising as a result of the euro."
"The subject is of course much more serious than that ..."
"That is why our abstention amounts to an additional vote in itself. Let us hope we are mistaken!"
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Karl von Wogau's report on the introduction of the single currency."
"The report concludes that eleven Member States - Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland - fulfil the requirements for participation in the third stage of EMU, and that these nations should be included from the beginning on 1 January 1999."
"The report by the Commission, ' EURO 1999' , accepts that the eleven Member States mentioned above fulfil the necessary conditions for participation in the third stage of EMU."
"The Danish Social Democrats are of the opinion that these eleven nations may participate in the third stage of EMU and we do not wish to prevent these nations from entering into closer mutual collaboration."
"This stance is consistent with the position of the government."
"We also welcome the following key stances:"
"The need for democratic accountability of the European Central Bank."
"It is important to secure openness in EU institutions.-Lifetime learning based on strengthening the education system is important in countering unemployment.-The report's appeal to the Council to implement the obligations of an active employment policy that were entered into at the extraordinary summit in Luxembourg.The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament do not support sections of the report on the coordination of fiscal systems and rates."
"We emphasize that Denmark's four reservations, including the reservation concerning the third stage of EMU, are not affected."
"EMU is a centralizing, high-risk project which lacks popular backing."
"EMU prioritizes price stability and low inflation."
"The EU is not an optimum currency area, and the economies of the various Member States are much too divergent to introduce a single currency."
"There is a high risk that EMU, with its one-sided emphasis on controlling inflation, will lead to increased unemployment."
"The gaps between growth regions and areas of rural depopulation may widen, resulting in increased regional imbalances."
"EMU will bring about a high degree of centralization and a loss of democracy in economic, monetary and exchange rate policy which, by extension, may come to include fiscal and financial policy as well."
"This also emerges from the report, which speaks of a ""stepped-up coordination of tax systems and rates' ."
"EMU is concerned with economic affairs, but it has considerable significance as a political project geared to greater supranationality and centralization."
