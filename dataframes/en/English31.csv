"Question No 42 by Pernille Frahm (H-0100/02):"
"Subject: Brominated flame retardants"
"In the light of recent research (e.g. at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science) showing that brominated flame retardants used, for example, in TVs and computers, have been found in large quantities in fish and in mother's milk, will the Commission take initiatives seeking the introduction of a total ban on their use?"
"Recent research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science has found the brominated flame retardant penta-bromodiphenyl ether (penta-BDE) in freshwater fish."
"Previous studies have shown that penta-BDE is also found in mothers' breast milk."
"That is the brominated flame retardant that belongs to a group of ten chemicals known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PDBEs."
"Three polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants are available on the market. These are: penta-BDE, octa-BDE and deca-BDE."
"Penta-BDE is used almost exclusively as a flame retardant in polyurethane foams such as those found in vehicle upholstery and household furniture."
"At present there is a Commission proposal to ban the use of penta-BDE as from 1 July 2003."
"A major use of octa-BDE is as a flame retardant in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastics, whereas deca-BDE is the flame retardant of choice in high impact polystyrene."
"These plastics are used to mould, for example, housings for computers and as packaging for electronic appliances."
"Due in part to the presence of brominated flame retardants, including octa-BDE and deca-BDE, in electrical and electronic equipment, the Commission has proposed that Member States set up separate collection schemes and ensure the proper treatment, recovery and disposal of such equipment."
"Furthermore, in a parallel proposal the Commission has called for a ban on the use of polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in electrical and electronic equipment as from 1 January 2008."
"The common position adopted by the Council on 4 December 2001 brought forward this date to 1 January 2007."
"At present, octa-BDE and deca-BDE are undergoing risk assessment within the framework of Council Regulation 793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances."
"Risk reduction measures in addition to those mentioned above may, if necessary, be proposed in the future."
"Mr President, thank you for your answer and for the attention that is being given to this matter."
"However, I can remember a time when no one could discover how to replace asbestos. What in reality got things moving was the desire to ban the material."
"I can now understand people's wanting to make collections."
"That is also all well and good. However, it is of course not only a question of what happens to the material when it is worn out but also of what happens to it while it is in use."
"The problem is that, when in use, it emits materials that are absorbed partly into our blood, partly into our layers of fat and partly into mother's milk."
"Now that there has been an investigation indicating that the quantity of brominated flame retardants in mother's milk is forty times greater than had previously been assumed, we would ask if it might not then have been a good idea to draw up a long-term plan for when these substances might also be banned in their two aforementioned forms, which I shall refrain from trying to pronounce."
"I agree entirely."
"These flame retardants belong to a group of chemicals which we must keep an eye on, but that alone is not sufficient."
"We now have a ban on one of these flame retardants, and the two others have undergone risk assessment."
"In a few weeks or at least in a month or two, we should be able to decide on the next step."
"We have not ruled out introducing further bans, but we want to have an opportunity of assessing what needs to be done on the basis of these risk assessments."
"We do not rule out any measures for actually dealing with these chemicals which, as has been pointed out, accumulate in the environment."
"Furthermore, we must ensure that recycling takes place and that the old materials are collected."
"We must have control of where these substances occur."
"Madam Commissioner, do you know whether any Member States are already giving serious consideration to the possibility of banning these brominated flame retardants at present, or, indeed, have already introduced such a ban?"
"Yes, I am aware that this debate is underway in several of the Member States."
"I know that such a debate is taking place in the country I know best and that this is also the case in other countries."
"This question has been brought up on several occasions and has been discussed in the Environment Council."
"There is a great deal of interest in it."
"I believe that we are all agreed that we need to take action to control the use of these dangerous chemicals and, it is hoped, ensure that we can find safe replacements as quickly as possible."
"The risk assessments and risk evaluations give us that opportunity."
"Question No 43 by Patricia McKenna (H-0101/02):"
"Subject: Ireland's compliance with EU environmental laws"
"During Commissioner Wallström's recent visit to Ireland she stated that she would use the leverage of structural funding to force Ireland to comply with some key directives such as the Nitrates Directive and the Framework Waste Directive."
"Apart from the ongoing legal actions, what does the Commission exactly propose to do to ensure that Ireland complies with EU environmental laws?"
"Is the Commission envisaging toughening the current, protracted complaint-making procedure to penalise Member States who consistently fail to comply with EU law and what would these reforms consist of and when would they be launched?"
"In light of the numerous environmental complaints filed by individuals and organisations in Ireland, the highest rate per capita in the EU, what kind of supplementary resources is the Commission prepared to make available to ensure that these complaints are processed swiftly and effectively?"
"Questions to Commissioner Fischler"
"Linkage between allocation of Community funds and compliance with Community and environmental law is even-handed and applies to all Member States."
"Linkage has already been established between Member State compliance with key aspects of the habitats and nitrates directives, and funding under the Structural Funds Regulation and the Rural Development Regulation."
"As the linkage deadline for structural funds approached at the end of 2000, Ireland dramatically improved its level of compliance with the habitats directive."
"The immediate focus is now on the Nitrates directive."
"Ireland is currently the only Member State with no nitrate-vulnerable zones."
"In its rural development plan, Ireland committed itself to complete designation by the end of 2001."
"As this has not yet happened, the Commission will not approve any modifications proposed by Ireland to its programme under the Rural Development Regulation."
"Recently, Ireland brought forward a routine modification which is now blocked by the Commission's services."
"The amount of discussion on designation in Ireland at present reinforces the importance of this action and I look forward to Ireland completing its designation very soon."
"The framework waste directive is not an issue since Ireland has submitted a complete set of up-to-date waste management plans."
"As regards the toughness of Commission enforcement procedures, steady incremental reforms have already speeded up case handling."
"These reforms involve better internal use of information technology and a quicker dispatch of warning letters to Member States."
"Furthermore, in 2000, the Court of Justice imposed its first financial penalty in a case concerning waste management."
"As regards the allocation of supplementary resources to speed up the handling of Irish cases, my services keep resource needs under constant review."
"However, the honourable Member will be aware that the Commission must operate within overall constraints that are very tight, and that there are many competing demands."
"Commissioner, I received your letter today after your visit to Ireland, but the last point you raised, which your letter failed to address, relates to the lack of resources in the Legal Unit of the Environment Directorate to deal with complaints."
"This is a major problem that has to be addressed, because the rights of EU citizens are being denied where complaints are not being fully examined."
"At the same time environmental damage continues."
"We must address that."
"In relation to waste, the problem with Ireland is that it is failing to comply with the waste directive."
"In today's Irish Times Wicklow County Council admits to the existence of up to 88 illegal dumps, 19 of which have not even been examined yet."
"That council has been suspected of being involved in dumping in some of these illegal sites and the EPA, the body responsible for protecting the environment, has actually granted a waste licence to one of these illegal sites."
"Unfortunately our minister has today ruled out any kind of independent inquiry into this."
"In the light of the failure of the Irish authorities to comply with EU directives, particularly in relation to waste, is there any possibility that the Commission might consider sending in an independent team to investigate the damage that is being done and the irregularities present in relation to waste in this area in particular?"
"I must say, after listening to you, that it is clear that Ireland is where the resources ought to be put to take care of the waste problem."
"I also wish that I could have more staff, to be better able to deal with all the cases, but it is in Ireland where action needs to be taken to comply with the directives, including the waste directives."
"I know from my visit to Ireland what a very important, controversial and difficult issue this is."
"I understand that it is a big challenge to Irish society and its government to handle the waste problem, and I have of course made my understaffing problem known in the Commission's internal discussions on resources."
"Action absolutely has to be taken in Ireland to comply with our directives."
"I hope Commissioner Fischler understands that Members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy fully endorse what the Commissioner has just said about the need for extra resources to ensure that environmental legislation is properly enforced."
"But it is not just Ireland that is causing difficulties."
"In October last year a reasoned opinion against the construction of the Odelouca dam in Portugal was issued and yet I understand that construction on the dam started in January this year."
"What steps has the Commission taken to try to persuade the Portuguese authorities to stop construction of this dam?"
"That is a completely different question and I would like to have the full background so that I am fully updated on all the facts. I would be more than happy to answer to your question, but please give me a chance to look into that particular case and then come back to me so that I can give you an updated reply."
"This is a supplementary point."
"What Mrs McKenna said about Wicklow County Council is absolutely true."
"Revelations followed daily and the local authority had a heated and intense discussion on this question yesterday."
"I have made a complaint to you regarding the illegal waste dumps found in Wicklow."
"However, it is now possible that the local authority itself is implicated."
"This is very serious and yet the Irish Government is not setting up an independent enquiry."
"Is there anything that the Commission can do and will it address my complaint speedily?"
"Yes, we take all complaints seriously and we work on all complaints."
"We have, as you know, a record number of complaints from Ireland in particular."
"We look into those as speedily as possible."
"There is also the possibility for me to raise this issue in my contacts with the Government of Ireland."
"This is what I intend to do. These are concerns that were very clearly expressed by people in Ireland when I was there."
"I will definitely take them to the minister responsible and to the Irish Government."
"As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 44 to 47 and 74 will be answered in writing"
"Question No 48 by Alexandros Alavanos, which has been taken over by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0064/02):"
"Subject: Quota buy-back by tobacco producers"
"The regulation on tobacco, as last amended, makes provision for tobacco producers to buy back quotas allocated to other producers, who are leaving the sector, in order to improve their business and their financial position."
"However, the Commission's recent announcements and decisions concerning the phasing out of aid over three years have effectively scuppered the quota buy-back programme as tobacco producers cannot afford the outlay and additional investment required when they do not know whether tobacco subsidies will be available for the 7-8 years minimum period they need to recoup their costs."
"What guarantees can the Commission provide to induce producers to take part in the quota buy-back programme under Regulation (EC) 1636/98"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the quota buyback programme in the tobacco sector was introduced to make it easier for producers wishing to switch away from tobacco to embark on conversion."
"For specific types of tobacco which face steadily declining markets, the buyback price was increased significantly so that producers have an incentive to cease cultivation."
"With regard to the acquisition of quotas from the buyback programme, however, the other tobacco farmers who wish to purchase the quotas have priority."
"We can only buy back the quotas which are not bought by other tobacco farmers."
"For the coming three years, the Commission has submitted a proposal for a Council regulation which sets the premiums and quotas until 2004."
"Among other things, this proposal provides for a restructuring of the Community Tobacco Fund in order to finance studies in the Member States on the opportunities for conversion of tobacco production to other crops outside the tobacco sector, and on the initial experiences of this conversion."
"In this proposal, the Commission has also announced a further proposal for the first half of 2003, which will be based on the guidelines contained in the Commission communication of 16 May 2001 on the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development."
"To this end, it is essential to ensure that there is precise information available on possible alternatives and the socio-economic impact of phasing out tobacco subsidies. A study is therefore also being undertaken at present to evaluate the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco."
"This study should be ready at the end of this year. It assesses the socio-economic impact of tobacco cultivation in the various production areas."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"I think that the question by my fellow Member, Mr Alavanos, was based on the following argument, which is extremely serious. If you subsidise the takeover of quotas by other producers, obviously the producers who take over this production potential need some time to amortise their investment, about 7 or 8 years."
"If you say that you are going to stop paying them a subsidy within three years, then there is no point in their taking over the quotas."
"And I should also like you to explain the following contradiction."
"You say, Commissioner, that you will carry out a study to see what the possibilities are for other crops."
"Quite right too and we have been supporting that here for some time now; however, you yourself have replied to repeated questions which honourable Members have put to you in the past, saying that this is more or less impossible."
"Have you perhaps any more news on this front?"
"Mr President, that was not really a question, but of course the Commission is well aware of the effects of this quota buyback programme."
"However, I must also point out that this is an entirely voluntary programme; no one is forced to buy quotas."
"For this reason, we also cannot raise any legal expectations should the phasing out of subsidies for tobacco cultivation take place at a later stage."
"However, I would also like to point out that we will have an opportunity later this week to discuss the future of the common organisation of markets in raw tobacco in great detail during Thursday's debate here in the plenary."
"The three-year extension and its implications will be a key issue in the debate."
"Commissioner, what are tobacco producers in Granada going to live on now?"
"What do you think the prospects for employment are for the 2000 or so families who made a living from tobacco?"
"Please be so good as to answer in writing if you are not able to give an answer straightaway."
"Cetarsa has announced that it will be closing its Granada factory and Mr Prodi has, to stir things up, announced that there will be no more aid for tobacco growing."
"I ask you Mr Fischler, as Commissioner for Agriculture, what guarantees can you offer Granada's tobacco growers?"
"Please answer me, but give me an answer that talks about alternative jobs and practicalities and do not try to silence us with rabble-rousing talk, or some nonsense about alternative crops."
"Commissioner, please give us a detailed answer."
"Mr President, Ms Izquierdo Rojo, let me answer with due stringency."
"Firstly: it is quite clear, also from what was agreed at the summit, that the phasing out of tobacco subsidies must be accompanied by an appropriate range of alternatives."
"This means that we can only implement the phasing-out process if we are able to offer genuine alternatives."
"That is my position here."
"We want to use the Community Tobacco Fund in the coming years for precisely this purpose, so that we are able to try out options and genuine alternatives and see what works and what does not."
"Only then will a decision by the Agriculture Council and an opinion by Parliament be necessary, based on a Commission proposal which will draw on the findings of this year's study."
"And only then can this phasing out be implemented in practice."
"This is exactly why we intend to undertake a study, at local level, of the options available in the most-affected regions: in Granada, in Estremadura, in Thrace in Greece, and a number of other regions."
"We will not be fobbed off with far-fetched ideas; we want to investigate the reality."
"I think that this is an entirely fair approach."
"As the author is not present, Question No 49 lapses."
"Question No 50 by Izquierdo Rojo (H-0080/02):"
"Subject: Repercussions of Prime Minister Aznar's disagreements with Morocco"
"Will farmers have to bear the consequences of the disagreements which have arisen between Prime Minister Aznar and the Kingdom of Morocco?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, without going into the issues raised by the honourable lady, I would like to point out on behalf of the Commission that matters concerning the bilateral relations between Morocco and an EU Member State have no bearing on the European Union's comprehensive strategy on the Mediterranean countries."
"These relations are governed by the Barcelona Process."
"In line with the principles which were endorsed by all the EU Member States and our Mediterranean partners in Barcelona in 1995, trade in agricultural products will be progressively liberalised by all parties."
"Against this background, the Community then concluded an Association Agreement with Morocco in 1996 which provides for reciprocal concessions on agricultural products."
"The Commission and Morocco recently initiated formal negotiations in order to rework these concessions with a view to deepening the liberalisation process."
"Commissioner, your reply has been quite inadequate and confused, because we know from the press that on 15 March negotiations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco on the agriculture chapter will be starting in Rabat."
"As I am sure you know, Commissioner, Mr Aznar is the President-in-Office of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union."
"I am therefore speaking purely in terms of the EU."
"I would like you, Commissioner, to tell me what basic premises you will be working on in these negotiations and whether you think a climate of good relations with Morocco would have been desirable instead of Mr Aznar's scandalous failure."
"I am not speaking in the context of Spain but of the European Union, since the negotiations that will be opening on 15 March have nothing to do with Spain and are completely European, just as this House and my question are also entirely European."
"And yet the replies you give to the Members of this House are quite unsatisfactory, as if you have no respect for democratic representation."
"This is disgraceful!"
"I would ask speakers to put questions and to state their opinions but not to put words into the mouths of others because this is not what we are here for and nor do I think that this is the spirit in which we should be working."
"Mr President, Ms Izquierdo Rojo, let me make it clear: I began by pointing out that a distinction must be made between Spain's bilateral relations with Morocco and the European Union's relations with Morocco."
"In my reply, I also mentioned the very negotiations you refer to, which were held on 15 March."
"The only detail I omitted was the date when they took place."
"However, I really must remind you that the procedure for liberalising trade in agricultural products with Morocco was established as early as 1995."
"The purpose of the current negotiations is merely to decide on the next step in this liberalisation process."
"It must be clear that liberalisation must be a two-way street."
"It is not merely a matter of agreeing on the concessions we should make to the Kingdom of Morocco; the question is also which concessions the Kingdom of Morocco will make to us in the trade in agricultural products."
"For example, if you look at recent trends in the trade in agricultural products, you will see that interestingly enough, Morocco's imports such as grain from the USA have increased very substantially."
"With regard to the trend in imports from the European Union, the opposite is true."
"This is not a one-way street, it is a two-way street."
"Of course, we must also be prepared to make further concessions."
"Our approach to the negotiations is very constructive."
"After all, the talks have only just begun and still have a long way to go."
"They are scheduled to close at the end of this year, so there is still enough time to make progress."
"Question No 51 by Esko Olavi Seppänen (H-0083/02):"
"Subject: Breaking up of fishing vessels"
"In connection with the consideration of the 2002 budget, an appropriation was approved for the breaking up of Member States' fishing vessels as compensation for the failure to renew the fishing agreement with Morocco."
"On what basis is the Commission granting these appropriations?"
"Can they be obtained not only for breaking up fishing vessels but also for selling them, e.g. to Moroccans, and can subsidies also be paid in respect of the breaking up of vessels built elsewhere with EU aid?"
"Mr President, Mr Seppänen, ladies and gentlemen, on 17 December last year, the Council adopted the Commission proposal to allocate appropriate financial aid to fishermen and vessel owners who had operated under the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco, in order to enable them to undertake conversion of vessels and activities."
"A total of EUR 197 million will be allocated to the programme: EUR 170 million in this year's budget and EUR 27 million in next year's budget."
"The funds are to be used as follows: The share of aid to be allocated to the scrapping or permanent conversion of vessels to activities other than fishing must represent at least 40% of the global amount."
"A maximum of 28% of the total amount can be used for the permanent transfer of vessels to a third country with or without the creation of a joint enterprise, or for the modernisation of vessels."
"At least 32% of the total amount of aid must be allocated to social measures such as retraining for fishermen who have lost their jobs or part-financing of early retirement schemes."
"Thus the permanent transfer of vessels to Morocco through sale or creation of a joint enterprise in Morocco is also eligible for funding."
"However, the premium for the creation of a joint enterprise amounts to just 80% of the scrapping premium, and the premium for export of a vessel amounts to just 50% of the scrapping premium."
"Furthermore, vessel owners who purchased their ship with Community aid and who now wish to export it or transfer it to a joint enterprise with a Community subsidy must repay a proportion of the subsidy received for the original purchase."
"The amount to be repaid depends on the age of the vessel."
"In the case of a five-year-old ship, for example, half the subsidy must be repaid."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply, which was quite thorough with regard to the use of this aid."
"I would still like to home in on one matter with a question that was contained in the original question. Were these ships, which are now being scrapped or sold to Moroccan buyers with EU aid, possibly financed out of other EU funds at the stage when they were purchased."
"In other words, I wish to draw attention with my question to how short or long-term EU fishing policy is."
"Mr President, the situation is really quite clear: This is a specific programme which was adopted in order to address the particular problem arising from the non-renewal of the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco."
"Within this specific programme, the conditions which I have outlined apply."
"Outside the framework of this programme, there are only the Structural Funds for the fisheries industry, which govern all scrapping measures and where the same conditions apply universally."
"The additional funds and improved conditions for the scrapping or sale of vessels only apply in this individual case."
"As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 52 and 53 will be taken together."
"Question No 52 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0086/02):"
"Subject: EU export subsidies for agricultural produce"
"The EU spends nearly EUR five billion each year on subsidies of exports of its own agricultural produce."
"These subsidies seriously damage the prospects of other countries, particularly developing ones, of maintaining a viable position on the market in agricultural produce."
"The Court of Auditors has also highlighted the fact that the expenditure is not checked in a satisfactory manner."
"The EU's subsidies have come in for strong criticism in the WTO and part of the conclusions of the WTO meeting in Qatar was an objective to review subsidies."
"What plans does the EU have for scaling down or phasing out these subsidies in the years to come?"
"Question No 53 by Paulo Casaca (H-0142/02):"
"Subject: Phasing-out of export subsidies"
"The Commission undertook in Doha to launch negotiations for the 'reduction of all forms of export subsidies, ""with a view to phasing out""'."
"This agreement, like any of the others and as is usual with such texts, is conditional on the final outcome of the talks."
"This bold undertaking by the Commission is also justified internally, given the considerable inefficiencies and abuses which this system has given rise to, not to mention its dubious impact on fulfilment of the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty, especially regarding action to ensure a fair income for farmers."
"Can the Commission explain, in terms of timetables and procedures, how it intends to act on this objective, on the basis of full compliance with Article 33, paragraph 1(b) of the Treaty?"
"Mr President, I would indeed prefer to answer these two questions together, as their content is the same."
"In the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the WTO members pledged to engage in comprehensive negotiations aimed at reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies, although the text ultimately adopted in Doha left the final outcome of the negotiations open."
"The negotiations will cover all forms of export subsidies, not only our export refunds."
"For example, they will also focus on a regime for export credits, the export subsidy element of various food programmes, and trade-distorting practices by state-owned trading companies."
"It would be unacceptable to demand a further reduction of subsidies from the European Union alone."
"We have already made this very clear in the proposal we put forward as part of the Article 20 negotiations."
"Furthermore, the European Union has already reduced its export refunds by 50%."
"In 1993, export refunds still totalled EUR 10 billion, whereas they currently amount to less than EUR 5 billion."
"The Commission is also endeavouring to shape its export policies in such a way as to avoid negative impacts on developing countries' production when granting refunds."
"As far as the common agricultural policy permits, the process of reducing subsidies will continue, with due account being taken of the interests of our own producers and trading companies in this context."
"In response to the criticism voiced by the Court of Auditors regarding the use of export refunds, the Commission has devised an action plan which will be implemented during the first half of this year and which will introduce substantial changes to the current system."
"As the WTO negotiating round which has now been agreed is scheduled to end in 2004, it would be premature at this stage to determine the European Union's positions in detail or, indeed, predict the outcomes of the negotiations."
"Our final positions must be established against the background of the overall negotiations."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for that exhaustive answer."
"I think that the European Union is in a unique position when it comes to export subsidies."
"The EU is in a class of its own as the biggest subsidising power on a global basis."
"My question concerns what the plans look like for the years ahead."
"Are there any plans for the next two, three or four years to further reduce the EUR 5 billion granted as export subsidies in the past year?"
"Mr President, we are indeed the largest market, and we are by far the largest importers of products from the developing countries."
"In my view, we should also remind ourselves sometimes that the European Union alone imports more agricultural products from the developing countries than the USA, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia put together."
"We therefore have every reason to hold our heads high when dealing with the other developed states."
"Furthermore, as you are aware, we have agreed on an open-door policy for products from the poorest countries of the world."
"With regard to exports, a key factor in this context is that we can only reduce export refunds in sectors where appropriate reforms of the common agricultural policy are taking place."
"If you look at the structure of export refunds, you will see that we spend by far the most substantial proportion of funds on exports of milk products, sugar and sugar products."
"Why?"
"Because the gap with the world market price is still very high in these sectors, and this price can only be reached by carrying out reforms in these two sectors."
"On the other hand, in the last two years, we have more or less phased out export subsidies on grain, and massively reduced them on beef."
"Given the pace of the common agricultural policy reforms, further reductions in export refunds can therefore also be anticipated."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank Commissioner Fischler for the explanations he has given us, which have been extremely useful."
"But I must confess, Commissioner, that I am somewhat disappointed at the lack of force in what you had to say about this commitment to phase out subsidies for farm exports, which is absolutely essential."
"According to the press, since last December this type of compensation has risen very substantially in the meat sector."
"I must also point out that in 2001 this reduction was closely connected to the rise in the value of the dollar and not to any reform of agricultural policy; and I must also say that there have been substantial increases in the amounts of subsidies for all products not included in Annex I. This is a situation that concerns me and I should like to ask Commissioner Fischler if he thinks it realistic that these reforms of the CAP that he has been talking about will be carried out in good enough time to be able to gradually eliminate these export subsidies?"
"Mr President, Mr Casaca, stringency is one thing, but coherence is another."
"Let us take the milk production sector as an example, as I have already mentioned."
"Under our current organisation of the market, we have a commitment to guarantee a specific price for skimmed milk powder and butter."
"As long as this commitment is in place, we can only export butter and skimmed milk powder with appropriate subsidies."
"As you probably know, there is currently no political majority in the European Union in favour of reforming the existing organisation of the milk market."
"It is therefore a little over-simplistic merely to point out to the Commission that reforms are required."
"That is something which should be drawn to the attention, first and foremost, of the Member States."
"With regard to sugar, the situation is as follows: We have pledged, also to this House, that we will undertake a study of competition in the sugar industry this year and that depending on the findings, the Commission will then exercise the option included in the extension of the common organisation of the market in sugar: we can utilise the review clause which it contains and then make further proposals in line with this clause."
"The reform process, too, is set to continue."
"As you know, the next step is the mid-term review in June this year, but in some sectors, further measures are already planned, for example in the olive sector, the fruit and vegetable sector, and in many others too."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischler, for your dedication to Question Time this afternoon."
"As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos. 54 to 92 will be answered in writing"
"The next item is the report (A5-0063/2002) by Mrs Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the biodiversity action plans in the areas of conservation of natural resources, agriculture, fisheries, and development and economic cooperation [COM(2001) 162 - C5-0467/2001 - 2001/2189(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present to you the report on biodiversity."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Members here today and those who worked with me with a view to drafting and presenting this resolution to you today."
"I would also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Development and Cooperation who supported all the drafts that your rapporteur presented on the protection of biodiversity."
"Lastly, I would also like to thank the NGOs who really made an enormous effort for this report."
"We know that they are excellent observers who have a perfect understanding of the status of biodiversity throughout the world."
"Mr President, the situation is not rosy and I would like to answer a question that, strictly speaking, has not been raised but which is often implicit in some Members' comments."
"What is the real use of biodiversity, or, in more straightforward terms, why protect nature when there are so many other issues of concern?"
"I would like to remind you that biodiversity plays a part in our own survival and that although nature does not need man to survive, we, as human beings, need nature in order to live."
"Our responsibility as elected representatives is to preserve a rich biodiversity."
"This rich biodiversity holds the assets for the development of future generations."
"Each living species that disappears from the face of the planet is an irreversible and irretrievable loss, and if we allow biodiversity to be destroyed, we are slowly but surely destroying ourselves."
"We can see this destruction taking place every day."
"Is the Brazilian Congress not due to issue an opinion in the near future on a project that authorises the use of 50% of the Amazon rain forest, which we know represents a huge genetic pool?"
"It is not out of disinterest that man destroys or threatens biodiversity - very much the opposite in fact."
"It is out of genuine interest."
"It is because huge financial interests are at stake, involving the precious wood as well as trafficking in endangered species, the intensive farming of land, the overexploitation of fish stocks or even the pillaging of the age-old practices of indigenous peoples."
"In order to put a stop to this massacre, the Convention on Biological Diversity was signed at the Earth Summit in Rio."
"Ten years down the line, it is still the poor relative - the Convention's signatory States have not kept their commitments and so far no country has biodiversity in its list of priorities for September's summit in Johannesburg."
"In just a few days' time, the Conference in The Hague will be held, which will bring together those party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the European Parliament, by means of our resolution, must shoulder its responsibilities and send out a strong and clear message."
"We call upon the Union to place the issue of biodiversity on the Johannesburg agenda and upon the Commission to present an action plan at this meeting, as it is doing for the European Union."
"We must reiterate the fundamental role of biodiversity as the cornerstone of sustainable development and the importance of the full application of the Convention and its provisions."
"We also call on the Union to put in place an ambitious policy to preserve its own biodiversity."
"The action plans presented by the Commission in the areas of natural resources, agriculture, development and fisheries, which are the subject of this report, may, of course, be seen as a first step along this road, but they are not enough."
"We need additional action plans, particularly for forestry and for transport, as all these Community policies had or still have a negative impact on biodiversity."
"And although the Commission claims its ambition is to reverse the current trend, it is fully aware of the challenge that it faces."
"The report states - and I quote - that 'during recent decades, the reduction and loss of biodiversity in Europe and worldwide has accelerated dramatically and existing measures have proved to be insufficient to reverse present trends?."
"I would add to this the new threats posed by the introduction of certain GMOs and even the conflicts related to the ownership of living things, which give an indication of future ambitions."
"To reverse this destructive tendency is a bold challenge, admittedly, but it is one we are prepared to face."
"The European Union has still to equip itself with the political and financial means to hope to achieve this objective."
"We already have the birds and habitats directives, which enable us to preserve a part of our biodiversity."
"We demand that they be applied throughout the European Union, including in the candidate countries and in the outermost regions and particularly in areas such as the coral reef."
"We must find ways of preserving these areas."
"The second way of making headway in implementing a sustainable ecological development plan, as formally acknowledged at the Gothenburg Summit, is to equip ourselves with effective means of measuring how far the environment is taken into account in the Union's policies."
"The Barcelona Spring European Council is due to adopt six environmental indicators."
"This is not enough."
"No mention is made of biodiversity."
"We also call on the Commission to present a specific indicator for biodiversity by 2003."
"If we want to make progress in the area of biodiversity, we know that we must begin immediately and continue every day to integrate this problem in the policies of the Union, starting with the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, the policy on transport and the Cotonou development agreements."
"Although there is consensus between the various groups within Parliament on the ways of protecting biodiversity, several Members hold conflicting views on the impact of GMOs on biodiversity."
"Nonetheless, as rapporteur, I hope that the references to the environmental liability of GMOs for polluting the countryside are retained."
"To sum up, allow me, Mr President, to presume that no one would even think of planning to destroy a cathedral, for example, or a listed monument to build a motorway."
"We must have the same approach towards preserving our natural heritage and biological diversity."
"As you will have realised, the large screens are not working properly; however, the screens serving the President's bench are working."
"- (ES) Mr President, farming is an economic activity that depends on biological processes and which accounts for the use of much of the Community's natural resources."
"For this reason, it must play a double-edged and central role in the conservation of biodiversity: first, by consolidating farming practices that are compatible with the environment and, secondly, by ensuring the survival of viable farms and systems of production throughout the territory of the European Union."
"Both the relentless intensification of farming and the fact that farmers are leaving the industry, with the consequent decline of rural areas, are having a devastating effect on biodiversity."
"A Community strategy for biodiversity must guarantee a method of farming that is more sustainable, in the broadest sense of the word, and which, in addition to the biological aspects, incorporates economic and social requirements and, ultimately, the survival of the rural world."
"Furthermore, maintaining this sustainable form of farming is a prerequisite for the European agricultural model, which is based on the protection of multifunctionality in agriculture, as the Council and the European Parliament have reiterated in numerous resolutions."
"The CAP is a useful instrument for biodiversity, as are the resolutions of the Earth Summit adopted at the Helsinki and Gothenburg Councils."
"On this basis it would be a mistake to confine the protection of biodiversity within the narrow limits of the CAP's second pillar and, more specifically, within agri-environmental programmes - designed to encourage the extensification of organic farming, the preservation of native species, the protection of natural habitats, etc. for two reasons: firstly, because the second pillar of the CAP accounts for only 10% of the agricultural budget and, secondly, because although agri-environmental programmes encompass 20% of the EU's farmland, they have been implemented very unevenly and these days they are restricted almost entirely to the least productive areas of five Member States."
"This state of affairs is aggravated by the fact that there has been insufficient insistence upon environmental protection requirements in respect of market aid, and this has generally resulted in the setting of excessively low standards."
"Therefore, we should extend eco-conditionality and encourage more active use of the agricultural market policy mechanisms designed to protect the environment and biodiversity."
"We must support these requirements in our legislation on food quality, plant-health products, seeds and genetic resources."
"It is crucial that we strengthen the financial element of the CAP's second pillar as well as making a distinction between its measures for socio-rural development and its agri-environmental measures."
"We are facing a major challenge, which is to consolidate Community agricultural policies and to draw them together so that they work in parallel to preserve biodiversity."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to say that I am not speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, where I was shadow rapporteur."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for her clarity of vision."
"She spoke about Brazil, but I should like to start close to home in discussing biodiversity."
"At present in the fishing industry we are depleting glass eel stocks from our coastlines, with the result that the eel itself hardly occurs in its natural habitat."
"This seems to me to be an issue for the Commission and our Environmental Commissioner to look into further and to draft a policy accordingly."
"The Fishery Committee's second point of concern pertains to the development of genetic engineering in fish farming."
"Canada and the United States currently have a system which they can set in motion as soon as they receive the green light."
"It seems important to me for the Commission to verify to what extent we can stop this development in Europe, or at least are able to hold a reasonable political debate on the subject before we resort to such technology in fish farming."
"The third point concerns aquaculture and the implications on the maritime environment."
"We need more research on that score too, particularly to find more closed systems."
"The fourth point to which the Fisheries Committee would like to draw your attention is the implications of the dissonance which sometimes exists between bird and fish stocks."
"Particularly with regard to cormorants, there are serious problems in Europe."
"Fifthly, the Fisheries Committee wants research to be carried out into the connection between climate change and fish stocks."
"What is the connection?"
"Insufficient research has been carried out in that area and we will very much welcome the Commission's action plans particularly on that score."
"The sixth point concerns policy we are currently adopting to close areas in order to protect certain fish species."
"It is unclear whether this has truly positive effects on fish stocks or not."
"More research by the Commission in the framework of biodiversity would be appreciated in that area too."
"Allow me to conclude by at least inviting the Environment Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, to come and exchange ideas with the Fisheries Committee on these specific points, so as to ascertain to what extent she can make a contribution to the Green Paper on fishery, also in terms of biodiversity."
"We would welcome such an initiative from the Commissioner with open arms."
"of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. (DA) Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Isler Béguin, on her brilliant report."
"My only objection is that, because most of the world's biological diversity exists in tropical areas in the developing countries, I should like to have seen the development aspect given a rather more prominent place in the report."
"Paragraph 49 calls for EU support for measures aimed at encouraging indigenous peoples to manage and preserve biodiversity."
"I have tabled an amendment adjusting the wording to the effect that the EU should support the role which, in virtue of its traditional knowledge, the original population plays in preserving and managing biodiversity."
"That applies especially to protected areas in which it is important for the indigenous peoples to participate in management so that forced relocations and inadequate access to resources are prevented."
"I have tabled an amendment with a view to having this aspect included in the report."
"In a number of developing countries, there is a clear need to be able to derive economic benefits from the sustainable use of wild resources, if people are to have an incentive to preserve stocks."
"In southern Africa, elephant populations have become so large that they destroy biodiversity and, given the economic situation of the countries concerned, it is completely unreasonable that the latter should not be able to obtain an income from their elephants."
"Biodiversity is now being lost at an unprecedented rate but, for all that, nothing has really happened since Rio."
"Biodiversity has become a concept that has been put on the back burner, and it is now our task to try to keep it on the agenda."
"In order to tackle the issue of conservation, it is necessary to protect the whole ecosystem."
"The Community's cooperation programmes have proved to be sustainable alternatives to a protectionist approach, and I am able fully to support this way of thinking."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, species extinction and the loss of biodiversity in Europe and worldwide are proceeding at an ever-increasing pace."
"Despite all the measures we have taken so far, we have quite simply failed to curb this trend."
"Following the adoption by the Council of the Community strategy on biodiversity in June 1998, it is gratifying that the communication proposes biodiversity action plans in four areas - conservation of natural resources, fisheries, economic cooperation, and development - and this is of course very welcome in principle."
"The Commission's proposals on agriculture are to be welcomed as well."
"I am therefore rather disappointed that the otherwise excellent report by the rapporteur takes such a negative view of agriculture - at least, that is how we see it - and fails to make any mention of agriculture's contribution to protecting biodiversity."
"My group will vote for this report, but we will vote against it on a number of individual points."
"You see, I come from a country which would have no future without its farmers."
"Austria is primarily an Alpine country, and without our Alpine farmers - whose working practices date back a hundred or even two hundred years - there would be a great deal wrong with our country."
"We are well aware that agriculture - especially non-intensive agriculture - also maintains specific eco-systems."
"Some habitats, such as those which exist in the mosaic of planted fields and boundaries defined by hedgerows and ditches, are quite simply vital to protect specific flora and fauna and ensure that they can nest and find sources of food."
"I do not want to recite a list of the different types of bird affected or tell you which species have survived as a result of agriculture, and I certainly have no intention of telling you all about plant and insect species."
"Nonetheless, I think it is important to mention that non-intensive agriculture - let me emphasise this quite specifically - non-intensive and family-based agriculture has made a very substantial contribution to the conservation of wild and, indeed, domesticated flora and fauna."
"I believe that if we fail to recognise the contribution made by farmers today, we are doing a disservice to our natural environment and our eco-systems."
"We will vote for this report, but in the areas where we think it does not do justice to our farmers, we will vote against it."
"Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Mrs Isler Béguin on her report which I think is excellent and constructive."
"The protection of biodiversity deserves top priority."
"When species become extinct, they are gone for ever, and this is why now is the time for action."
"Action plans cannot be non-committal."
"They can only be successful if they take account of the socio-economic circumstances of the people in that area."
"They must set priorities."
"We must tackle hot spots worldwide; areas that are particularly rich in species deserve special protection."
"Action plans must be clear and, above all, concrete."
"Public support is important, and nobody gets excited about an abstract idea such as biodiversity."
"It is about the conservation of the natural resources, valuable landscapes and endangered species."
"We must be well-informed, independent monitoring must be put in place, and we must draw up annual balance sheets of the quality of the natural environment."
"This motivates and inspires."
"The European Union itself should be a little more consistent."
"The bird directive and the habitat directive epitomise biodiversity protection."
"These must be implemented effectively, however difficult that may be at times."
"The end result must always be at the forefront of our minds."
"However, these pearls of nature preservation are in sharp contrast with other policy."
"I mean in the first place agriculture, but also fisheries."
"Large-scale agriculture and the conservation of biodiversity are a difficult match."
"The common agricultural policy must for that reason alone undergo far-reaching changes."
"Subsidies purely based on production are asking for trouble."
"The fishery implications for biodiversity are less visible."
"Seabed disturbance in many coastal waters and deeper waters threatens biodiversity."
"This should be met with a forceful response."
"Biodiversity must form a guideline in regional planning."
"Member States should draft action plans for that purpose."
"I ask the Commission to select and support a flagship project annually, preferably in one of the candidate countries."
"These projects must set an example to other nature reserves."
"The Polish primeval forest could be a good flagship project."
"I should once again like to thank Mrs Isler Béguin for her sound report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I, for my part, would also like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and the Commission for preparing this matter for debate."
"The proposals have an aim worthy of support: environmental diversity is something that is important to all of us."
"I would, however, like to raise two matters in this parliamentary report."
"Firstly, in item eight the matter of forests is raised, mentioning the desire to see a bureaucratic, centralised monitoring system for the EU based on certification for forests and all living organisms in them."
"The use of forests in the Member States would be controlled by the EU by means of action plans."
"At this point we must remember that forestry matters in the EU are covered by the principle of subsidiarity and there is no cause to extend Brussels' control in these matters unless there are special reasons for doing so."
"Furthermore, all those engaged in forestry matters agree that certification should work on a voluntary basis, and on no account should it be managed by the EU."
"Secondly, in item 44 it is proposed that all support payments for agricultural production should be replaced with environment-based aid."
"We have to remember, however, the situation regarding world trade which we have today."
"If production aid were not paid there would no longer be any agriculture on the present scale in the EU in the future."
"How would things stand regarding biodiversity then?"
"In certain regions of the EU, production aid is, relatively speaking, even more important than in central Europe."
"For example, in my country the major problems are not really connected with the state of the environment or biodiversity, but the fact that production must in general be supported, production costs being as high as they are."
"For farmers it is a waste of time to talk about additional environmental action, as all production in our country is in practice organic."
"I propose that point 44 should be deleted from the text. The same goes for the last part of item 42, where agri-environmental action would be solely geared towards protecting endangered species."
"No self-respecting EU institution should record something like this in the resolutions."
"Mr President, we agree with Mrs Béguin's report because it is underpinned by a particular situation: neither the Convention on Biological Diversity, signed in 1992, nor the various international conventions incorporated into Community law, specifically the birds and habitats directives, have managed to put a brake on the destruction of biodiversity."
"Furthermore, it clearly shows that thousands of species that have not even been identified will disappear."
"In fact, 11 000 species of fauna and flora are in danger of extinction."
"I believe that is sufficient for us to adopt the appropriate measures."
"The rapporteur welcomes the plans that are proposed but points out that there are plans that have still not been carried out such as, for example, those concerning forests."
"She also speaks clearly about the need to incorporate environmental policy into our other policies, whether they concern agriculture, fisheries or anything else."
"As I have very little time, Mr President, I shall just give one example, because examples are the best way of explaining what needs to be done: the use of EAGGF Funds in the destruction of the last remaining laurel forest on the island of Gran Canaria."
"I spent last weekend on the island of Gran Canaria with a group of volunteers who protested to the European Commission - I refer you to the question I asked at the time - that in the lime-tree forest of Moya, the only laurel forest remaining on the island, now that all the water that used to come down during droughts has been enclosed in pipes, all the forest's trees are drying up."
"This is being done with EAGGF Funds."
"We must acknowledge all the valuable work done by volunteers, because they give their spare time, unpaid and unrewarded, to fight to preserve this natural resource."
"The volunteers are grateful for the answer that Mrs Wallström gave them, because it proved her excellent knowledge of the area - which must be looked after, because it is likely to become part of the Nature 2000 network - and because she asked the Spanish Government to assume responsibility for looking after this area."
"Mrs Wallström, your speech gave hope to the volunteers."
"This is a clear example of why European Funds should not be used for projects that damage the environment."
"Mr President, I join with other speakers in complimenting the rapporteur and welcoming his report."
"The extent to which biodiversity impacts on the lives of all citizens and the quality or otherwise of their lives makes this debate extremely important."
"Those of us entrusted with the task of ensuring a future for our past must now act with decisiveness."
"We must do so, however, in an enlightened and informed way and be prepared to avail ourselves of modern research and technology in achieving this objective."
"Controversial areas such as biotechnology must, in my view, be part of this equation."
"The role of farmers as guarantors of sustainable and quality food supply must be brought more into focus, because we ignore at our peril the fact that agriculture is a commercial activity."
"The unique role of farmers as environmental managers must also be fully recognised, appreciated and rewarded."
"In this regard, I ask the House to take serious note of the fact that the profession of farming is in decline."
"Farmers are getting older and young people are reluctant to take up farming as a career."
"From a biodiversity viewpoint, the role of farmers and the preservation of family-based farm units are important."
"They represent an important part of the rural infrastructure."
"Biodiversity and sustainable development will not happen if they are planned out of the equation."
"In short, and in conclusion, we must adopt a practical approach which safeguards biodiversity, while, at the same time, acknowledging the professional and commercial role of farmers."
"Mr President, as the Natura 2000 network is being established almost everywhere in Europe, against the advice of the rural community and with disastrous consequences for man, I regret that the report on biodiversity has been hastily debated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"This is, however, an important subject, affecting areas that the Union is considering, such as the protection of natural resources and the relaunch of the development policy, as well as the new objectives for agriculture and fisheries, for example."
"Drawing up national strategies or action plans on biodiversity could only be contemplated if they were drafted after a broad consensus had been reached, respecting regional socio-economic interests."
"As for enlargement and the rapporteur's proposal to select a flagship project on the protection of biodiversity, we must not forget that the candidate countries want to join the Union in order to make up for their economic and social shortfalls as quickly as possible and to modernise their infrastructures."
"Biodiversity is not their main concern."
"I regret the fact that the four amendments that I tabled in committee were all rejected, even the amendment in which I called for a CAP that respects the environment as well as those working in the rural community."
"Several points in this report give me cause for concern and, in particular, the desire to introduce certification for the timber sector and for animal species seems unrealistic in my view, given the considerable diversity in forests and living species."
"What added value does this kind of certification provide?"
"What has happened to the desire to increase the financial resources granted to Natura 2000 and to other measures on biodiversity?"
"Why continue along a path that is, increasingly, called into question by the people, landowners, farmers and users?"
"Who will pay for the introduction of a strict protection system beyond the zones specified in the birds and habitat directives?"
"Are we moving towards a situation where the entire territory will be divided into zones?"
"What are we aiming to achieve with this maximum protection approach towards biodiversity?"
"When reading this report, I wonder whether, in the rapporteur's mind, man is still included in this biodiversity."
"In our view, there is no doubt that he is."
"You are right, Mrs Isler Béguin, the alarm bells raised from all quarters in response to the decline of biodiversity are justified."
"Yes, there are plant species that are disappearing, animal species that are at risk and, even within the species and breeds which are not threatened by extinction, the reduction in numbers, the consanguinity and the uncontrolled spread of GMOs are giving rise to genetic decline, which is a threat to the environment."
"But I wonder whether forcing through regulations without properly consulting the local actors, with the declared objective of transforming sizeable areas where people live and work into sanctuaries - people who have helped considerably to shape current ecosystems - as well as introducing incoherent procedures for implementing Natura 2000 in a number of countries - is the right way to protect biodiversity?"
"Is there not a danger that this will have quite the opposite effect and, instead of achieving the desired goal, will provoke an exodus from farming, which will harm biodiversity?"
"Therefore, we will support the rapporteur's reaffirmation of the 'polluter pays' principle, her prudent approach to GMOs, and her appeal to subsidiarity, but we will not support her call to tighten the Commission's proposals on agriculture, which would result in the CAP being completely taken apart as of 2003."
"We will not preserve biodiversity without the help of the farmers."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express an opinion on the action plan as it relates to the preservation of biodiversity in the context of economic cooperation and as it relates to development cooperation."
"We have already heard this evening that the greatest degree of biodiversity is to be found in the tropical regions of the developing countries."
"These parts of the world have a wide range of crop plants, livestock, wild animals, etc. Moreover - and this is equally important in our eyes - huge numbers of the local, the indigenous, populations are dependent on the existence of this biodiversity."
"If the breadth of biodiversity is now reduced, if there are major erosions of the natural world, this will create a knock-on effect which will plunge the people of these tropical regions into poverty."
"We also know that, unless action is taken to combat poverty, it becomes very difficult to raise and foster awareness of the need for biodiversity and sustainability."
"This is why it is important that this action plan seeks to integrate the principle of preserving biodiversity into the development-cooperation programmes of the European Union."
"This means supporting the sustainable use of natural resources, particularly forests, as well as more frequent recourse to environmental-impact assessments of planned development projects."
"May I also express the support of my group for all those amendments which emphasise the fundamental role of indigenous populations and their social, economic and cultural rights?"
"Now that we are talking about biodiversity and, of course, sustainability too, I should not wish to miss this opportunity to say that we must also put our own house in order if we want to possess credibility in the eyes of the international community."
"When I recall the discussions on the resolution concerning the Barcelona Summit, a resolution which referred quite clearly to specific projects in Europe that contravene the principle of biodiversity and fail to protect rare flora and fauna, I am persuaded that it is not enough for us here in Europe merely to keep tabling splendid resolutions designed to protect mountain gorillas in African forests but that we also need to engage wholeheartedly in the implementation of projects and of our own European programmes, such as Natura 2000."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Isler Béguin, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Development and Cooperation for their work on drafting the report and this resolution."
"Biodiversity is a central issue in terms of sustainable development and the integration of environmental considerations into other policy areas."
"It is important in its own right but also forms the basis for activities based on natural resources such as agriculture and the fishing industry."
"Biodiversity is also important environmental capital which local societies in many countries depend on for their livelihood."
"At the same time, it is disappearing faster than ever before in human history."
"I have sad news tonight."
"We have now lost the first species on our list of protected species."
"The Pyrenean mountain goat has vanished for ever."
"We are thus unable even to completely protect the species we have placed on our lists of species we have promised to protect."
"Both the EU's strategy for sustainable development and the seventh Environment Action Programme state that one of their central goals is that of halting the decline in biodiversity by 2010."
"If we are to be able to achieve this goal, it is very important that the action plans for biodiversity which we are discussing today are really implemented."
"Safeguarding biodiversity depends on the birds directive and the habitats directive being implemented in full."
"However, this is not enough."
"If we really want to stop this loss of biodiversity, we have to look at the entire territory of the EU and not just the protected areas."
"It is necessary to integrate the question of biodiversity with the policy on the development and use of the mainland and the sea."
"The biodiversity action plans are not just ambitious but also realistic."
"They mean a great step forwards in terms of integrating biodiversity into agriculture, fisheries and development cooperation policy, as well as into our own environmental policy."
"The action plan for the conservation of natural resources clearly shows our firm intention to fully implement the birds directive and the habitats directive and to support the work on Natura 2000."
"This also states how we intend to use general environmental controls such as environmental impact assessment, environmental labelling, environmental audits and other financial controls to promote the safeguarding of biodiversity throughout the EU."
"The action plan relating to agriculture states priorities for achieving mutual benefits from agricultural activity and biodiversity."
"The most important instruments cover everything from rural development measures to various environmental initiatives in the common organisations of the market for beef, milk and cereals, etc."
"The action plan covers all of our countryside, including the Natura 2000 areas."
"The action plan for fisheries addresses threats from both traditional fisheries and aquaculture, and it complies entirely with the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy."
"The majority, and the most serious, of the threats to global biodiversity are in the developing countries."
"The battle for biodiversity therefore has a great deal to do with our strategy for eradicating poverty."
"We have a responsibility for helping developing countries so that the natural resources which are crucial to their well-being can be protected."
"The action plan for economic cooperation and development provides the tools for this."
"These plans for biodiversity are not static instruments but instead will be developed primarily through the use of various indicators."
"This has been pointed out during the debate and is naturally also something which the Commission supports and which we have begun working with. These plans will primarily contribute to the discussion of the reform of the common fisheries policy, common agriculture policy and the regulations on the Structural Funds."
"I hope that these reforms will have the scope and provide the controls that are required if we are to completely meet the goals of the biodiversity action plans."
"Only then will we be able to achieve the overall goal, namely that of halting the decline of biodiversity by 2010."
"I would like to thank all my fellow MEPs for your valuable contribution to the debate."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0044/2002), by Mrs Emilia Franziska Müller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements [12394/2/2001 - C5-0640/2001 - 2000/0080(COD)]."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I wanted to announce, before Mrs Emilia Franziska Müller gets started, that the fact that the screen showing the list of names of the speakers has gone wrong may perhaps explain why people might not come to the debate."
"Also, we are only getting the German interpretation in our offices."
"This is a great help to me because I am doing a course at the Goethe Institute, but other people may find it a little difficult."
"There you are, Mrs Jackson, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good!"
"I announced this problem just now and the technicians are trying to resolve it."
"I hope that they manage to sort it out as soon as possible."
"However, you are extremely optimistic when you say that the only reason there are so few Members in the Chamber is because we have got a few technical display problems."
"If only that were so!"
". (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, about 20% of all Europeans regularly supplement their daily diets."
"In 1999, European consumers spent EUR 1 615 million on vitamins and minerals alone."
"Demand is rising constantly, because people's living and eating habits have changed radically."
"Vitamins and minerals are involved in numerous biochemical processes in the human organism."
"It is crucial to people's health and to their physical and mental capacity that they optimise their intake of these substances."
"I believe that the opportunity to enrich our daily food intake with additional vitamins and minerals is very valuable."
"When we speak here today of food supplements, we primarily mean vitamins and minerals that are marketed in the form of tablets, capsules and powders."
"The directive on food supplements is designed to harmonise the laws of the Member States."
"This will give manufacturers easier access to all markets, subjecting their production and marketing practices to a uniform set of conditions."
"The directive unequivocally assigns food supplements to the domain of foodstuffs."
"Food supplements are not medicinal products, nor can they serve as substitutes for medicinal products."
"Through their categorisation as foodstuffs, food supplements are subjected to all the provisions that apply to foodstuffs in the European Union, including the provisions of quality, hygiene and safety legislation."
"The consumer must be able to rely on the complete safety of all foodstuffs, particularly of substances such as vitamins and minerals, where stability levels sometimes differ between products."
"The new directive targets two specific areas: consumer safety and the completion of the single market in food supplements."
"The Council of Ministers has adopted Parliament's key demands from the first reading."
"Parliament welcomes the fact that the Council took account of our position regarding the need to include more substances in the directive."
"The substances in question are already on the market but have not yet been evaluated by the competent scientific committee."
"These are to be included in the annex to the directive."
"In the common position, a period of 18 months has been set for the preparation and submission of a dossier."
"The Committee on the Environment has extended this 18-month period to 36 months in order to give small and medium-sized businesses in particular sufficient time to compile the relevant data on their products."
"The House now has two further amendments on the table - one for 24 and one for 30 months."
"I would personally argue for 30 months, because I believe that two and a half years should be enough time to prove the safety of a product that has been sold to consumers for years."
"I attach great importance to the principle that substances should be scientifically tested before they become the object of Community legislation."
"As far as doses, and hence optimum consumer care, are concerned, Parliament welcomes the system of maximum safe doses combined with the reference quantities per head of population."
"In other words, manufacturers' dosage instructions must not be based on the limits of human tolerance."
"On the other hand, they need not be bound by the recommended daily allowances, which are normally set at very low levels."
"On this particular point, the directive manages to take account of both the wishes of consumers and the need to protect them."
"The common position has come up with a compromise here that I entirely support."
"For this reason we reject Amendment No 6 to Article 5 of the directive."
"With regard to product labelling, the directive provides for clear dosage recommendations."
"The substance of Amendment No 8 on greater transparency is already clearly covered by Articles 38 and 42 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of 28 February 2002 establishing the European Food Safety Authority."
"For this reason the PPE-DE Group also rejects this amendment outright."
"For all the reasons I have outlined, I can have no truck whatsoever with the proposal to reject the common position that is made in Amendment No 7."
"Finally, a few words on the campaign which all Members of Parliament have been forced to endure in the last few weeks and months; this is a campaign through which a single producer and dealer of vitamin products has been pursuing interests of a purely economic nature."
"The company behind this campaign is engaging in image-making at the expense of the sick."
"It is breeding anxiety among consumers and exploiting their distress for its own ends."
"I sympathise with all those people who have been taken in by the scaremongering and utterly specious arguments that have emanated from the company concerned."
"It is clearly not the case that we seek to prohibit vitamin therapies by means of this directive on food supplements or that we are trying to curtail access to natural treatment methods."
"What the directive does prohibit, and rightly so, is any attempt to mislead consumers by making exaggerated claims about the curative or preventive powers of vitamins and minerals."
"This directive gives consumers in Europe the support of a legal framework that attaches great value to product safety and responsible labelling without restricting the range of products on shop and supermarket shelves."
"In short, it is a legal regime that combines free circulation of goods with a high level of protection."
"After talks with many organisations - industrial associations as well as consumer associations - I am more convinced than ever that this directive points in the right direction."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, allow me to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Müller, not only on her sound report but also on the tenacity she has displayed."
"The issue we are debating today has caused a huge stir."
"As we know, there are different traditions, as well as do's and do not's in Europe."
"Like the United States, Great Britain and the Netherlands have, in fact, very flexible legislation whereby, once registered, all vitamins and minerals can be freely bought, sold and used."
"However, there are also products, certain vitamins and minerals, that are not without risk."
"In Germany, another Member State, rules are very strict."
"Food supplements are only available on prescription and at the chemist."
"This is sufficient reason, also as far as the European citizens are concerned, to start to harmonise the internal market."
"This harmonisation should be subject to two criteria: firstly, the indication of a recommended daily intake as a guideline to the consumer and secondly, the establishment of a definitive list of permitted products."
"Products not yet on the European list will be permitted if their file has been submitted to the independent scientific committee for testing."
"Honest European businesses are satisfied with this directive, unlike cowboys such as one Mathias Rath, who, just across the German border in the Netherlands, runs a very lucrative business using his own products."
"Adoption of this European legislation will ensure that his trade, which is primarily aimed at Germany, will fizzle out because consumers will be able to buy safe vitamins and minerals at the chemist or the supermarket anywhere in Europe."
"I am also inundated with an incredible number of e-mails, thousands of e-mails and letters."
"Rath drove the anxious citizen to action with false arguments, no less."
"Let me be quite clear: nothing is being taken away from the consumer."
"There is a 30-month period during which businesses can prove that their products are indeed safe, and I will continue to monitor the scientific committee with regard to registration. I am pleased that Europe is calling an end to a practice which is only aimed at excessive profiteering on the backs of many people who are seriously ill."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to congratulate Mrs Müller on her consistent, expert and tenacious approach."
"Her work currently has great significance."
"The food supplements market is growing fast."
"Food supplements can make a positive contribution to health."
"Anyone who can afford it is keen to buy good health."
"However, it is obvious that quality is not always guaranteed."
"We must therefore separate the chaff from the wheat."
"The consumer is entitled to a safe product and sound information."
"In the field of food supplements, large industrial interests are at stake."
"We have already gathered this from the thousands of e-mails, four books, video cassettes and postcards in support of the cause of the producers."
"In the magazine 'The Rapporteur', the vitamin lobby campaign was described as counter-productive."
"If only!"
"Unfortunately, a number of fellow MEPs, mainly from the liberal and green groups, have fallen for this lobby."
"I recently received 35 letters from anxious consumers."
"I did not receive them directly but via the industry, which immediately makes one wonder."
"The letters were written by people who said that they benefited from taking multi-vitamin tablets and that they had heard that the European Parliament would ban them henceforth."
"A clear example of misinformation."
"Multi-vitamin tablets can still be taken."
"Only when they contain substances or compounds which do not feature on the extensive list must the manufacturer prove that they are safe."
"Is that too much to ask?"
"Anyone who claims that hardly any damage has occurred involving food supplements to date is probably right."
"However, their use has so far been restricted."
"Only latterly has the market grown and do high-dose tablets appear in the shops."
"Safety must be the main concern."
"Producers have 18 months in which to demonstrate that their products are safe."
"This appears to me to be sufficient time, but I have no problem with extending this period to 24 months."
"The directive is of huge importance, and it is futile to regulate safety for each Member State individually."
"We do not do this for food either."
"With regard to food supplements, there is currently no internal market, but many different, national rules."
"We must set up this internal market for food supplements."
"In my personal opinion, the internal market is a great good, provided, however, that it prescribes common standards at a high level, which is where this directive comes in."
"The Commission has laid down a solid foundation for the establishment of maximum safety levels for vitamins and minerals, and that also forms the basis for consumer confidence."
"I would urge you to vote for this directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the consumption of vitamins and other food supplements by our society is a genuine trend rather than a fashion."
"The market that this generates is huge. The considerable lobbying that has been carried out on this issue is proof of this, if it were needed."
"Let us turn directly to the main question which is niggling a number of my fellow Members who oppose this directive and that is should we legislate?"
"I have no hesitation in saying 'no' and I have at least three reasons for this."
"First of all, the proposal for a directive provides a specific response to a reality, namely the lack of an internal market, which has damaging repercussions both for the economic actors in this sector and for consumers."
"By way of example, it is currently virtually impossible for a vitamin manufacturer based in the UK to export and place his products on the market in Belgium or in France, for instance."
"Secondly, it is useful, even so, to recall the two major battles waged at first reading regarding the inclusion of substances with psychological effects - fibres and plant extracts, in particular - and the essential labelling standards to enable consumers to make an informed choice."
"Parliament made its view heard."
"I would add, and this is my third point, that no high-quality food supplement, regardless of its ingredients, will be banned under this directive."
"I stress the point that we must stop brandishing the prospect of bans and of a Europe that castrates."
"Manufacturers will have three and a half years, depending on our vote, to submit their dossier and prove that their products which are not currently listed in the Annex are safe, and if a ban has to be imposed eventually, it would therefore be placed on doubtful substances."
"Anyhow this is the least of our problems, as far as I am concerned."
"Since I am speaking of the purely health-related aspect of this matter, I would also like us to stop saying that vitamin abuse poses no danger."
"This is wrong, simply wrong!"
"We must say that excessive consumption of all fat-soluble vitamins such as A, K, E and D are problematic, and, to give another example, excess vitamin A has known harmful teratogenic effects and can result in foetus malformation."
"We can allow political opposition to this directive therefore, but in no case can we allow scientific falsehoods to go unchallenged."
"To sum up, and for all the aforementioned reasons, we are dealing with flexible and balanced legislation which takes into account the interests of consumers, manufacturers and distributors and which lays a basis for the harmonisation that is necessary in this sector."
"The majority of my colleagues in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will vote in favour of this very good report by Mrs Müller and I too would like to congratulate her."
"I believe this directive is an unacceptable assault on the right of citizens to choose how they look after their health and well-being."
"Huge numbers of EU citizens choose to take supplements to reduce the possibility of their falling ill and needing to seek medical advice to obtain prescribed drugs."
"People should have the right to opt for a healthy approach, rather than waiting for disease to set in and then having to resort to pharmaceutical drugs, many of which have dangerous side effects."
"I am not surprised that the pharmaceutical industry is supporting this directive, since it plays right into their hands and means more business for them."
"Products which have been widely and safely used for many years in several EU Member States are being restricted without any health and safety justifications."
"I believe this is lawnmower harmonisation at its best, where everything is chopped down to the lowest common denominator."
"Consumers should be free to choose their own level of potency and nutrients, provided that they are safe and appropriately labelled."
"Availability of supplements should not be restricted for any reason other than safety."
"This proposal is profoundly flawed, in that it is based on the old-fashioned research which relies on RDAs of vitamins and minerals."
"For the past fifty years, RDAs have formed the basis of conventional nutritional wisdom."
"However, according to many reports which I have read on this issue, RDAs are set far too low and should be revised upwards."
"Instead, legislators should rely on the upper safe limits, which are a much better device."
"For example, the RDA for vitamin B6 is just 2 mg while the upper safe limit is 200 mg. Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 demonstrated that taking supplements containing 100 IU of vitamin E for at least two years reduced the risk of heart disease in both men and women by approximately 40%."
"Despite this, the RDA for Vitamin E remains a measly 10 IU."
"I believe that countries with a restrictive policy should relax it, but not on the condition that we tighten our system and restrict the access of our consumers in our countries to vitamin and food supplements."
"Mr President, two different types of argument have been put forward for this directive."
"The first concerns public health, the second harmonisation of the internal market."
"I consider that the public health arguments are weak."
"There is no major public health problem from people overdosing on vitamins and minerals."
"Nor will the risk of overdose disappear with this directive."
"If we really want to make a vigorous contribution to public health, we should possibly address the subjects of alcohol, tobacco or something else rather than the area covered by this directive."
"The fact is too that the EU is not allowed to introduce harmonisation on public health issues."
"This is clearly stated by the Treaties."
"There is also a risk that consumers who use certain dosages of particular preparations will find this more difficult once this directive has entered into force."
"The real motivation behind the directive is harmonisation, in other words the opportunity to be free to sell everywhere."
"This is not a strong argument in my opinion."
"In my view, sometimes other considerations must be more important than a free market."
"I consider that, in areas such as this, different EU countries should be allowed to have different rules - more liberal or more restrictive - depending on the wishes of the voters."
"I consider that supranational rules should only be used to combat real supranational common problems."
"This is not the case here."
"We have witnessed a furious and quite unpleasant lobbying campaign."
"Its methods and its content have been counter-productive."
"Several of the arguments put forward against the proposal have been exaggerated and sometimes also incorrect."
"Parts of this proposal are positive, such as the requirement for declarations of contents."
"On the whole, there are, however, no strong arguments for implementing the far-reaching harmonisation proposed."
"There is also a risk that the system which has been drawn up will benefit major industrial interests at the expense of small enterprises."
"The directive which is before us today has two principal key objectives: first, to harmonise national legal provisions on food supplements so as to reduce and eliminate considerable problems facing the free movement of food supplements; second, to establish an appropriate level of consumer protection in the use of food supplements in the European Union Member States."
"To achieve these two objectives, it is necessary, as the rapporteur has said, to appropriately define what food supplements are; it is necessary to put in place a scientific assessment of all the ingredients and their minimum and maximum doses; it is necessary also to outline the key criteria for requirements with regard to consumer protection; and of course, the quality of standards has to be looked into as well."
"The protection of the European Union's 370 million consumers is of paramount importance."
"Under the Amsterdam Treaty, Parliament has the power of codecision with the Council in the area of consumer protection and public health matters."
"I have always supported the need for improved labelling provisions so as to ensure that the consumer information is transparent and effective."
"The fact of matter is this: we live in an internal market where there is free movement of goods, services, persons and capital."
"We need to guarantee the safety of our food chain from farm to table."
"It is important that we have the framework proposal to put in place uniform systems for the full certification of food supplements."
"If there is any possible likelihood of endangering public health by means of the implementation of any particular proposal, one must always veer on the side of caution, and I compliment the rapporteur on her report."
"Mr President, there are no known cases of serious, harmful effects that have been caused by consuming vitamins and minerals that fall within the present directive."
"In contrast, we all know that in the European Union, half a million people die prematurely from the effects of smoking every year."
"It is therefore astonishing that minerals and vitamins will soon be subject to stricter legislation than tobacco."
"In the report, producers of food supplements are being met halfway by extending the period of approval from one and a half years to three years."
"This does not solve anything for the, mostly small, companies, since the required tests are too costly."
"This will lead to a ban on food supplements which have been sold legally in certain Member States without any problems for many years."
"Since permitted quantities in tablets have in many cases been reduced, this will mainly have the effect that consumers will end up buying larger quantities of tablets in order to consume the same levels."
"However, I have more fundamental objections."
"Since different regions of the European Union have different eating habits and eating cultures, the need for food supplements varies greatly."
"I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to draw up European legislation in this area to suit these different cultures."
"At first reading, the PPE-DE Group called for a referral back of Mrs Müller's report because it contravenes the Treaty."
"This was met with little support at the time."
"Meanwhile, it is my understanding that the support for rejecting this legislation has grown considerably."
"I therefore hope that there will be a sufficient number of Members who have the courage to reject the Council's common position."
"Many consumers share this hope."
"Given the numerous reactions, this is a considerable problem for many consumers."
"I should like to hand you the many thousands of signatures that have been collected for this purpose."
"Mr President, this is a bad directive."
"I do not say that on the basis of any emotion or the fact that Doctor Rath has lobbied me."
"Oddly enough I have not received many e-mails, so my machine has not been stuffed full of e-mails from Doctor Rath or anybody else."
"I do not know why that is, but I am very quick with the delete button."
"I do believe this is a very bad directive, not in its intention but in its method."
"It is designed, as everybody has said, to bring about a common market in food supplements."
"It may well bring that about, but in doing so the risk is - and there is a risk - that some products currently on the market in some countries will cease to be available."
"I, like many British MEPs, have received many letters from people in the region that I represent."
"These are not circular letters that they have just signed, they are letters that they have written themselves."
"The people who write them fear that they will no longer be able to buy over 300 food supplements that their good health depends on."
"We do not need to go into why this fear has arisen and who stirred it up, if anybody has stirred it up."
"The fact of the matter is that the Commission has created a situation, by bringing forward the directive in this form, that has given people reason to voice and to have such fears."
"I have no quarrel with the German Members or with the rapporteur. She has done a valiant job."
"They are standing up for the system they have in place."
"They believe our - British, in this instance - more liberal system may allow unsafe products onto the market."
"We contend that consumers should be able to exercise as wide a choice as possible and that there is no evidence that products on our market are unsafe."
"Where is the evidence that they are unsafe?"
"Why should we have to prove that they are safe when people buy them every day and believe that their health depends on them?"
"I say to Commissioner Byrne: be careful."
"This directive tries to reconcile very different national approaches to allowing these products onto the markets and it fails in that attempt at reconciliation."
"Small businesses have been allowed too little time to submit the required safety dossier on their products."
"We may put that right tomorrow, but why, Commissioner Byrne, is it that there is no cost impact assessment on small businesses in this directive?"
"When it came forward two years ago there was no cost impact assessment attached."
"Just as important, we need to have the whole process of reviewing what there is on the market much more out in the open."
"It should not be done by secret committees."
"MEPs on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy will insist that we are much better informed on this, so that we can keep track of what is happening on behalf of our anxious constituents."
"We hope that we will be able to block any heavy-handed attempt to deprive people of the products they know and continue to need."
"Mr President, I must confess to being quite astonished!"
"We are speaking about products that are on the market today and are asking why we need to provide evidence of their safety!"
"I can tell you why: because it has to be done for every last bit of artificial colouring that goes into your Uncle Joe's Mintballs and for every preservative that is added to jam, and because we have always resolutely proclaimed in this forum that consumer safety is important."
"For this reason a product cannot be deemed marketable unless it can be proved safe and harmless."
"This is surely easy to demonstrate for any product that has already been on the market for some time."
"Moreover, I must also express my astonishment at the references to divergent systems."
"I do not know what you are talking about."
"I understood neither Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's reference to these divergences nor Mrs Jackson's."
"In Germany you can go into any drugstore at all, into any supermarket, and you will be perfectly free to buy vitamins, calcium or whatever you want in various different dosages."
"I have nothing against that."
"Nor do I object to these products remaining freely obtainable."
"I do wish, however, to see the introduction of a maximum dose - yes, a maximum dose is something I do want to see."
"People like myself, for example, who have the misfortune to suffer from kidney stones, must not take too much Vitamin C, because it crystallises."
"People like me must also be careful with calcium, and we have to know these things."
"This is why labelling is needed; this is why safety is paramount."
"Anyone who stands up today like Patricia McKenna and says that the adoption of this directive would force products off the market is misleading people."
"I take no pleasure in saying this, Patricia, because our opinions often concur."
"It is not true that a single safe product will disappear from today's market."
"All manufacturers must be able to demonstrate the safety of their products."
"Every single manufacturer must be able to do that."
"For each and every product we buy - for all our cosmetics, our pharmaceutical products, our artificial sweeteners - we expect proof of safety."
"And are we now saying that we do not expect the same for food supplements?"
"Surely food manufacturers will then come along to us and say, 'Why must we prove that our muesli bars are safe?'"
"And they would be right to do so."
"They would then be exempted in future too."
"At that point they could start making their products with genetically modified organisms and whatever else."
"Why should anyone then have to demonstrate the safety of any product?"
"Goodness knows that I have been involved for long enough in matters of consumer protection in this House."
"I believe my reputation goes before me in that respect."
"I tell all the people who call me that none of the products they can now buy will be taken off the market."
"I shall ensure that they are informed in future about any product they buy and whether it is safe."
"It makes no difference to me whether the evidence has to be produced within 24 or 30 months, but the evidence must be produced."
"I congratulate Mrs Müller on her excellent report, which will have my unreserved support tomorrow."
"Mr Blokland, I had a quick look at the list you gave me and I thought it best to pass it on to the Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, who can give you a response."
"You will, of course, receive another response regarding the outcome of the document you entrusted to me as well."
"Mr President, last year in Britain alone, 5 000 people died from overdosing on alcohol."
"They drank themselves to death in one session."
"Yet I do not see a directive before us to require alcohol to be submitted to all sorts of safety tests, or for bottles of Guinness or Strasbourg wine to carry the strongest possible health warnings."
"So why on earth are the manufacturers of food supplements being told that they must jump through a series of expensive hoops, which may be so costly as to drive some of them out of business, in order to keep their products on the market?"
"My colleague, Frederick Ries, says that not all vitamins are safe, but of course you can kill yourself on anything if you eat enough of it."
"You can stuff yourself with baked beans until you die, but unlike alcohol or most pharmaceutical products, vitamin and food supplements do not have a track record of killing people."
"On the contrary, I, like Mr Blokland, have a stack of letters which testify that many do a great deal of good."
"This directive, therefore, is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut!"
"Better labelling would have been sufficient to provide such protection as is needed, but perhaps that would not have been enough to satisfy the big drug companies, which are seeking to control a lucrative market."
"I remember the Commissioner telling us not long ago that under his regime we would have less interference of the kind which angers many European citizens for no good reason."
"However, when it comes to Brussels proving that it wants to treat people like an interfering nanny, this directive really does take the biscuit."
"I will begin by distancing myself from the very aggressive campaign which we Members and, especially, the rapporteur Mrs Müller have faced while debating this issue."
"Naturally, everyone has the democratic right to argue for what they believe in and to attempt to influence decision-makers and decisions but, in this case, matters have gone beyond the limits of what is acceptable."
"I am one of those who would like to reject the common position."
"This is not because I always have to be against regulation or harmonisation in the area of public health but because, in this particular case, I consider that it is neither desirable nor necessary to harmonise national legislation."
"Just as Mr Blokland said, different countries have very different traditions and, as far as I know, no one has ever died from taking vitamins and minerals."
"The problem with the directive is partly Article 5, which concerns establishing the maximum daily intake."
"The European Parliament will have no insight whatsoever into, or influence upon, how this is determined. What, however, is most likely is that it will be done using the committee procedure."
"Another problem is the appendix which states which vitamins and minerals are to be permitted as food supplements."
"The opportunity of small companies and manufacturers to make their influence felt in the market worries me considerably in that respect."
"Many companies and products will disappear and, most importantly of all, consumer choice will thus be limited."
"We are currently exposed to stress and to a number of environmental poisons and chemicals, which means that a varied and healthy diet is not always sufficient to ensure that we keep healthy and well."
"We need vitamin and mineral supplements, sometimes in high doses, to be able to balance the functions of the body."
"Good knowledge of nutrition, Mr President, could also prevent illness in all contexts."
"We should encourage people to take care of themselves and take responsibility for their own health."
"This directive sends out the wrong signals."
"Mr President, obtaining food supplements as health products from the Internet is not encouraged by this report."
"I well understand the life stories of the individuals who are concerned by this directive, but my own experiences tell me something different."
"In my opinion, substances that are used to treat and alleviate the symptoms of serious illnesses, of illnesses that may not yet be curable at the present time, should be covered by legislation on medicinal products and have nothing to do with the consumption of foodstuffs."
"In other words, products with pharmaceutical ingredients which are advertised as possessing medicinal powers must be subject to licensing as medicinal products."
"The aim of the directive is to harmonise maximum permissible quantities of active ingredients throughout the 15 Member States and to improve national conditions on the basis of criteria relating to the harmlessness of products to human health as a preventive measure of consumer protection."
"The national food and pharmaceuticals industries are vying for an extremely lucrative market in foodstuffs enriched with active ingredients."
"A new type of food product is being advertised here, and the advertisements often focus on additional health- and performance-enhancing qualities, sometimes proven but often imputed, of these products."
"I believe that it is important and that it befits our responsibility to ensure that the line between medicinal and food products does not become blurred or negotiable."
"In this expanding market, the pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs industries will move heaven and earth to enrich food products with additives which are not naturally found in those products."
"The report is based on transparency, disclosure and safety for consumers."
"For this reason I support it."
"The directive will never absolve patients and consumers, however, from the imperative obligation to read the small print: 'If in doubt, please consult your doctor or pharmacist'."
"This is why scientists and researchers have a legal entitlement to improve this common position."
"Mr President, circulating the streets of Strasbourg this morning was a mobile advertising hoarding asking this Parliament how it could ignore the wishes of 450 million voters."
"The obvious answer is 'very easily': it has been doing it for years."
"And if this Parliament accepts the common position on this directive it will prove my point."
"It is a totally unnecessary intrusion into the freedoms of millions of people."
"Never have I received so many communications from ordinary people asking me to reject it. The Commission is entirely wrong to assert that lobby groups are scaremongering."
"As far as I can see the pressure is coming from ordinary people who are very worried by this proposal."
"It is those ordinary people whose interests are under threat."
"Accordingly I will be voting for the UEN Amendment No 7, calling for the rejection of the common position."
"I urge every Member of this House to do likewise."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Emilia Müller, and Mr Corbey and Mrs Roth-Behrendt too, for the courage they have displayed, despite the immense, absurd amount of pressure to which they have been constantly subjected by people with no scientific knowledge and no integrity."
"I would like to inform Commissioner Byrne that, in order to speed up the adoption of this directive, I have withdrawn an excellent amendment which sought to ensure the safety of consumers, particularly, in that it specified that all food supplements should be prepared according to good manufacturing practice."
"This amendment was intended to ensure that food supplements are prepared in such a way as to guarantee not just the highest quality of ingredients but also their innocuousness when taken repeatedly over long periods of time."
"I therefore call upon Commissioner Byrne to deliver a formal undertaking to the effect that the provisions of the regulations to be drawn up stipulating that food supplements must meet high quality and safety standards in order to prevent small artisans - or health quacks, even - from marketing low quality, potentially dangerous products, will be made clearer and more explicit."
"In view of Parliament's clear, great responsibility in matters of the citizens' health, we must be highly focused in our work in order to ensure that all the individual Member States of the European Union are provided with rules making high standards of quality and safety a priority."
"One last plea to Commissioner Byrne: in calling for this new documentation we should request that it be differentiated according to the composition of certain products, for this would reduce the expenditure for small and medium-sized businesses considerably."
"Mr President, it is not every day we have to congratulate a rapporteur for sheer civil courage in standing up to one of the most unscrupulous lobbies of our time."
"I do not believe that I have seen anything like it before."
"Like most of us, she has been accused of being a stooge of the pharmaceutical industry, of being ignorant and insensitive."
"We should say to those who made these accusations that we cannot be bought in this House and that we cannot be bullied either."
"We owe our constituents our judgement, and mine is that for all its flaws and deficiencies, the directive is one that should be commended, with amendments, to those many people who are frightened and nervous, who depend on these food supplements to preserve their health, and some of whom even believe it is a matter of life or death."
"They fear this directive because they have been told that these products will be banned, that testing will be prohibitive, and that what remains will be swallowed up in a restrictive and prescriptive regime."
"We owe it to them to make certain that is not the case, and shallow populist rhetoric is not the way to do it."
"We need to make certain that small producers can come forward and be reassured that it will not be a costly and prohibitive process."
"Time after time, we see that this is ignored in directives."
"It has been ignored in the PPP directive."
"The people who have the greatest need of our protection now are the small producers and we should help them."
"They should be able to register their product for simple and cost-effective evaluation."
"It should be a positive list which is rapidly expanded, with maximum dosages linked to real needs and not to outmoded daily allowances."
"People such as Mr Davies have said: 'well, we have not done this for alcohol'."
"My God, we have tried!"
"We know what lobby it is that stops us doing this on alcohol, which stops us having the labelling that is necessary."
"Two wrongs do not make a right."
"We have to look at this directive in terms of the way in which it will be interpreted."
"The more people make claims about their health, the more we see that this needs a safety evaluation."
"You cannot have the one without the other."
"If you make the claims, you must expect to see them tested, but they should be tested fairly, simply and in a cost-effective way to leave a regime of light-touch and user-friendly practices."
"That is what my country has had and I believe we can keep it."
"It is also possible to fit that in to the framework of this directive."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, I believe that this directive represents a terrible infringement of our right to these products."
"Commissioner Byrne, your proposal, if implemented, could remove hundreds of vitamin and mineral supplements from our shelves, in the UK and Ireland in particular."
"These products are safe and have been accessible to consumers for years."
"But instead of going for a scientific safety assessment, the directive is based on an outmoded Recommended Daily Allowance dating back to the Second World War."
"This directive will force consumers to purchase these products on the Internet, where there are no controls."
"Is this what you really want?"
"Consumers will not forgo these products."
"I believe that this directive is an own goal."
"The European Commission has stated that its goal is the extension of the internal market."
"However, many Member States have put national interests first and lobbied to keep their markets closed."
"This is because the liberal regime in Ireland, the UK and the Netherlands is not acceptable to other Member States such as Germany and France."
"This means that products that are safe and widely available will be withdrawn from the market."
"The only criterion for taking products off the market should be one of safety."
"As I said, this is an own goal and we will end up importing products from the US via the Internet."
"Is this really what you want?"
"Mr President, the EU's internal market is a fundamental pillar of European cooperation."
"It has given Europe free trade, competitiveness and welfare."
"There is however no need, in terms of the market, for uniform rules on the sale of vitamins and minerals."
"Member States have different traditions in this area."
"In Sweden, as in the UK and Ireland, individuals can buy many preparations with strengths up to the maximum recommended daily intake over the counter."
"This tradition must be respected and take precedence over the requirement for uniform rules."
"What is really behind the proposal to regulate the sale of vitamin and mineral supplements at EU level?"
"Opponents shift the blame onto the pharmaceutical industry on the grounds that it wants to sell more tablets."
"Those in favour of the regulation also point the finger at the pharmaceutical industry, but in this case as being opposed to the proposal because it wants to see even higher volumes of sales."
"I personally believe both sides are wrong."
"I have not encountered any lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry on this issue."
"The main driving force behind the eagerness for regulation is instead an overprotective mentality among EU civil servants and politicians."
"Naturally, it is inappropriate to overdose on vitamins and minerals, but there is a huge margin between overdose and harmful levels."
"With the help of information on the bottles, most people are able to manage their daily vitamin intake themselves."
"We should trust individuals to do so."
"I myself am a dialysis doctor and have seen many cases of poisoning."
"I have seen two young women poisoned by nutmeg and an older man suffering from severe nicotine poisoning, but I have never met anyone with vitamin or mineral poisoning."
"Kidney stone patients have to be very careful about taking much more than just vitamin C and calcium."
"It is Mrs Roth-Behrendt's doctor whose job it is to tell her what she should be careful of. Doctors have more important things to do than prescribe vitamins and minerals in higher doses than those accepted as food supplements."
"Mr President, today, we are debating the vitamin directive at second reading."
"I must say that I am pro-European and in favour of harmonisation, but not in this manner."
"I am pleased that the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are willing to grant producers of vitamin tables 36 months instead of 18 months in order to prove that their products are safe."
"While this is not a problem for large pharmaceutical producers, it does cause problems for small businesses, especially financially."
"In principle, it is wrong that they should have to prove that their products are safe while these may have been on the Dutch, British and Irish markets for dozens of years."
"I am in favour of proving the safety of new vitamin tablets, but not of the old tablets."
"The Commission, the majority of the Council and Mrs Roth-Behrendt are saying, in fact, that all the old tablets are unsafe."
"This is why I shall be voting for rejection of the common position."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for 60 years we have had two traditions in Europe and had no significant health problems."
"As long as we have acceptance of the upper safe limit, consumer choice should prevail."
"Millions of people in Europe have bought vitamins and minerals of their choice."
"Not only have they had no problems, but their health and well-being have benefited."
"Now we are faced not with a health measure but with a single-market measure which threatens to omit 300 items on this list from the 'positive' list of items available."
"These 300 items are currently legally and safely on sale in the shops of my country and yours, Commissioner."
"They are not oddball items - they are things based on boron, calcium, copper, iron, manganese, potassium, selenium, zinc and so on."
"If these items fail in 18 short months to get the scientific committee's approval or to get their dossier in, then they will come off the market."
"That is not a problem for large manufacturers, but it is a very serious problem for the small ones."
"The cost and time to them may be prohibitive, and if items go off the market, then it is the consumer who will suffer."
"If they do go off the market they may, as we have heard, go abroad, go offshore or appear on the Internet, at some risk to the consumer."
"What we need, Commissioner, is a simplified procedure for the items that have been omitted so that they can come onto the list quickly, and for that we need the 36-month timescale."
"However, may I say also that Emilia Müller has suffered one of the worst assaults by people outside this Parliament that any Member has had to put up with."
"It is one thing to be e-mailed; it is one thing to be lobbied; it is one thing to be mass-lobbied; but to endure threats of violence, bullying and harassment as she and her family have is something which this Parliament will not accept."
"I say that to whoever is doing it outside: lay off, because we will not allow our fellow Member to suffer in that way."
"She has more integrity in her little finger than those people have in the whole of their bodies and I demand, Mr President, that you suggest to the President of this Parliament that this matter be referred to the Legal Affairs Committee, with a view to seeing how a Member of Parliament under that sort of assault can be protected and allowed to do her job properly as a Member of this Parliament, as a rapporteur and as someone for whom we have great affection and respect."
"I too fully condemn this sort of behaviour and I will certainly inform the President."
"I do not know whether the President will decide to refer the case to the Committee on Legal Affairs but, in any case, I agree that something has to be done."
"There is a great difference between all the pressure and lobbies and being subjected to threats and abuse."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Emilia Müller, who has attended to her task in difficult circumstances."
"Many of us have been pestered and obstructed to an unreasonable degree by those who have masqueraded as philanthropists and defenders of the sick."
"I have had thousands of messages a day sent to my own private e-mail address, sometimes as many as 8 000 unnecessary messages in one day."
"It is not really any longer a matter of public opinion when one and the same person sends 900 messages on the same day."
"That is simply criminal harassment."
"I can just imagine what it has been like for Mrs Müller!"
"Parliament should explore, not just in this case but especially in preparation for any future situation, practices of national parliaments that would guarantee Members' inviolability, safety and right to work in peace."
"All this harassment, with people being urged to express their opinions, has been absolutely pointless."
"It has seemed to be more of an unscrupulous marketing campaign on the part of a private business, which did not even intend to influence the work of Parliament."
"Presumably the party that got the campaign off the ground also knew that alternative treatments and vitamin cures and treatments are not banned or prevented in the EU."
"A simple thought has many times crossed my mind: the means is the message."
"If the means to lobby us has been so unscrupulous, it is hard to be convinced of the sincerity of the issue that lies behind it."
"The two main purposes of the directive are, on the one hand, the approximation of national laws so that a single market for food supplements can be created, and, on the other, to establish an appropriate level of consumer protection in all Member States."
"For that reason, with this directive there should be an appropriate definition of food supplements, a scientific assessment of all ingredients should be carried out, requirements relating to consumer information and labelling should be specified, quality standards should be developed, and an adequate monitoring system should be guaranteed."
"All this should be totally acceptable to the honest players and even directly to their advantage."
"Whilst the directive will help guarantee access to the markets for all manufacturers, Parliament has been especially keen to take account of the problems of small manufacturers."
"For that reason, Parliament wishes to extend, by way of its own compromise proposal, the eighteen-month deadline proposed in the Council's common position to 30 months."
"If these conditions are met I see no reason to reject the common position."
"Mr President, what has happened to Mrs Müller should actually have repercussions."
"The word 'duress' occurs to me, as a lawyer."
"I am full of admiration for her, and I shall most certainly be supporting the common position."
"I also feel, however, that this position touches the limits of moral acceptability."
"You see, I come from a country where vitamins are still available in pharmacies only."
"When anyone goes into a chemist's shop and buys vitamins, the chemist will say, 'Don't take too much, and please read the enclosed instruction leaflet'. It will cause great confusion in my country if that all changes."
"It will create the impression that vitamin supplements are really quite harmless after all."
"This is not the case. Vitamins have side-effects."
"The impact, of course, is not immediate."
"It is like when you drink too much."
"Not until you come staggering out of the pub do you begin to feel the effects on your health. It may have tasted good, but it will catch up with you at some point."
"We are far more aware than we were ten years ago that vitamins do indeed have adverse effects."
"I really do find it irresponsible to set them loose on consumers in this way."
"To tell you the truth, Mrs McKenna, I am deeply disappointed."
"I thought you would be encouraging us to eat oranges, lemons, bananas, curly kale and other health foods."
"No, you are recommending artificial substances to us, substances that are simply mass-produced by an industry where many people earn great fortunes."
"I fail to understand your thinking."
"Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at the outset at the progress that has been made on this proposal for a directive on food supplements."
"First of all, the objective of this legislation - and I must emphasise this - is not to ban food supplements."
"It has to do with maximum safety levels."
"I regret very much that I have to disagree with my friend Mr Bowis, for whose opinions I have the utmost respect, when he says that the position at the moment is that there are upper safe limits."
"That really is not the position."
"This will be the position after this legislation comes into place."
"That is the purpose of the exercise."
"This exercise will be based on scientific evidence and scientific evaluation."
"It also dismays me to some extent to hear people in this House - also for whom I have enormous respect - express the view that this legislation is motivated by, of all things, lobbying of the pharmaceutical industry."
"That is a slander."
"It is absolutely wrong."
"It is unfair to say that I or the people who work for me would be motivated by such things."
"But sometimes people who make these allegations are the ones who are inordinately concerned about the role of industry."
"But what about the role of industry that profits from this piece of legislation not going through?"
"What about that?"
"Have they questioned themselves to determine whether they have been subjected to such a degree of lobbying from that industry that they have themselves been duped by that industry and tried to tar the Commission and those who advocate the passing of this legislation with a brush in a way that I find quite reprehensible?"
"The subject is not an easy one."
"We currently have very different attitudes, rules and practices among Member States."
"These impede the free circulation of food supplements within the European Union, and can deprive consumers from access to a wide range of these products."
"So the case for harmonisation is obvious and is strong."
"I believe that the vast majority of stakeholders share that view."
"You will not, therefore, be surprised that I cannot support the views of those who propose, with Amendment No 7, to reject the common position."
"A substantial number of Members of Parliament and of the Commission have been subjected to an orchestrated and misleading campaign against the adoption of this directive."
"This campaign has only been waged by those who do not share the general European interest."
"I should also emphasise to Mr Blokland and others who make reference to being lobbied by consumers who have written letters, that may be the case."
"I suspect they may very well be people who have been seriously misled by those who profit by this legislation not going through the system."
"The consumer organisations who are there to look after the best interests of consumers have not been misled."
"They are in favour of this legislation."
"BEUC has come out and said that it supports this legislation."
"This is a strong endorsement, in my view, rather than anecdotal accounts of individual consumers who, in my opinion, have probably been misled by the statements made by many which are simply untrue."
"They have misrepresented the aims of the directive, used misleading arguments and misinformed consumers."
"This was made clear during the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Mrs Müller has done an excellent job as rapporteur."
"Her contribution to the advancement of the draft directive has been invaluable."
"I sincerely congratulate her and thank her."
"I would also like to acknowledge the responsible and very constructive role of Mrs Corbey, as shadow rapporteur."
"The common position provides a very good framework for the regulation of food supplements in the European Union."
"It is designed to ensure that a very wide range of such products is available to consumers."
"The underlying criterion for a single market in food supplements is safety: adequate and appropriate labelling designed to inform consumers."
"Of course, these products must be used in the context of a diversified diet and in line with manufacturers' instructions."
"The deadline for preparing dossiers for the evaluation of substances that are already on the market is an important issue."
"I have listened carefully to the concerns expressed, concerning small and medium enterprises, that a period of 18 months for the preparation of evaluation dossiers may be too short."
"If that were to be the only amendment to the common position, I would be prepared to consider an extension of the period mentioned."
"I can, therefore, accept any one of Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 or 5 that relate to this point, provided that this would contribute to the adoption of the common position without further changes."
"I have also taken careful note of the interventions with regard to good manufacturing practice for food supplements, which is the subject of Amendment No 2."
"I would like to reiterate what I said at first reading."
"The adoption of principles of good manufacturing practice by legally binding measures for specific categories of products is not appropriate in the case of foodstuffs."
"This already exists in relation to foodstuffs in many pieces of horizontal legislation."
"I am happy to take comfort from Mr Nisticò's contribution on the basis that he is certainly one of the MEPs I know here who is a scientist himself."
"He supports this legislation."
"He has asked me to take careful note of the risks to ensure the elimination of low-quality products when this framework legislation goes through the system."
"I am happy to say that will be taken into account."
"The vast majority of these principles are covered by horizontal legislation, particularly in the directives on hygiene and control."
"These will apply also to the manufacture of food supplements."
"In the draft directive, we are referring specifically to the issue of purity criteria for the vitamins and minerals to be used."
"We have improved the relevant provisions following your amendment at first reading."
"We also foresee adopting specific technical rules with regard to the margins of tolerance for the amounts of vitamins and minerals declared to be present in food supplements."
"We believe that these rules are important for ensuring the quality of these products."
"I am firmly of the view that this array of horizontal and specific rules fully covers all concerns expressed that these products should be manufactured to high-quality standards."
"I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 2 to adopt provisions on GMPs for food supplements."
"However, I reiterate that I will give priority to adopting the technical rules on margins of tolerance mentioned in Article 9(1)."
"Amendment No 6 refers to the criteria that will be used for setting the maximum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements."
"This point was the most difficult one to reconcile in the Council."
"The text of Article 5 is now carefully balanced."
"It is my belief that any disruption would jeopardise the whole proposal."
"Finally, Amendment No 8 proposes an addition to the text that concerns principles for the functioning of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and of the Scientific Panels of the European Food Safety Authority."
"I believe that these issues are adequately covered in the recently adopted general food law."
"They should not, therefore, be repeated in this specific directive."
"For this reason I cannot accept Amendment No 8."
"But I repeat and emphasise that the role of the European Food Safety Authority in this area will be of paramount importance and that this work will be done by independent scientists."
"The evaluation of that work by the Board of the European Food Safety Authority will be done in a fully transparent way - indeed, in public."
"In conclusion, the Commission considers that the common position as such is satisfactory on all substantial points."
"The Commission would be ready to accept a technical modification of the common position to extend the period mentioned in Article 4.6.b. as in one of the amendments - Amendment No 1, 3, 4 or 5 - if that would help the adoption of the directive at second reading."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 6 and 8 and certainly does not support Amendment No 7, that calls for the rejection of the common position."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for excellent teamwork for the almost a year and a half during which I have been dealing with these two reports."
"It has gone incredibly well."
"In the common position, the Council and the Commission have accepted the majority of the just under a hundred amendments we submitted on the first reading."
"I am very pleased to see that the Council and the Commission are now in agreement with the European Parliament on the fundamental principles."
"The first and most important principle is that only by-products from animals approved for human consumption may be used in feed, cosmetics and medicinal products."
"I say this with a slight reference to the preceding debate."
"We will thus obtain a ban on intra-species recycling, that is, animal cannibalism."
"The new regulation will in fact be sufficiently flexible to be adapted to technological developments and new scientific findings."
"The common position has in fact been welcomed by the industry concerned in Europe."
"Please consider that the final vote tomorrow puts 200 000 jobs across Europe at risk."
"Do not forget that this industry is not located in densely populated areas. Instead, we are looking at companies in rural areas."
"Every day that passes without clear ground rules, more and more small and medium-sized companies are in danger of being forced to shut down."
"To be blunt, I could say that Europe's producers, and consumers too, are standing and stamping their feet while we here, at the very last stages, are engaging in trivial disputes."
"Let me first talk about Amendment No 25, which is a compromise."
"As is always the case with compromises, this means that no one has got exactly what they want."
"We have all had to give in quite a bit, and I am a little uncertain as to what the end result of this compromise will be."
"However, the amendment does give the Member States which currently permit the use of catering waste under extremely carefully controlled conditions a transitional period of four years."
"Towards the end of the debate on the matter, a number of details concerning sludge and waste water came up."
"Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 14 should in fact be set aside in favour of Amendment No 21, which is intended to promote the safe handling of these materials so as to avoid serious environmental consequences."
"This is therefore a practical way of dealing with this issue."
"I myself would really like to see Amendments Nos 3 and 5 put into effect."
"Unfortunately, this is more or less impossible for technical reasons."
"These amendments concern the marking of category 1 material."
"The already adopted Regulation on TSEs contains clear requirements that direct risk material be marked."
"Amendment No 5 is about the marking of category 2 material."
"I think this would be desirable, but that the amendment should be rejected because it would have unreasonable consequences."
"If the amendment were to be adopted, all fertiliser - natural fertiliser - within the EU would have to be marked, and this would affect approximately 1 200 000 000 tonnes a year."
"This means that we would be able to choose whether the fields were to be blue, green or purple each spring, and it would all look a bit peculiar."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 16 must in actual fact be adopted."
"Otherwise, the report's main principle that only raw materials which have been approved for human consumption may be used in animal feed would be undermined."
"The amendments do not in fact involve any changes to the requirements which currently apply to sampling and/or post ante mortem inspections of slaughtered animals."
"It is only the final assessment based on existing rules which is affected by this regulation."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 8 concern the handling of catering waste."
"In this case, I recommend voting in favour of Amendments Nos 22 and 23 whereby catering waste generated from means of transport operating internationally should, with all its risks, be treated in accordance with the most stringent requirements of the regulation, in category 1."
"On the other hand, catering waste in category 3 should be handled under existing structures and systems for collection, transport and disposal in line with the EU's waste directive."
"The common position contains a somewhat strange proposal regarding endangered species of necrophagous birds, namely lammergeiers in Spain."
"Amendment No 24 states that it is permitted to use category 1 material to feed this specific small group of birds."
"I have checked this very carefully."
"These birds have to have this special food."
"It sounds a little odd, but sometimes nature is, by nature, odd."
"Amendment No 12 on the permanent marking of imported pet food is particularly controversial for the United States."
"Regarding dyeing the raw materials which are to be included under categories 1 and 2, it is laid down that products in categories 1 and 2 are to be marked once they have turned into fat and processed proteins."
"Such processed material must then be permanently marked when it comes to imported pet feed, as exactly the same requirements must be set for imported products as for our own products."
"Amendment 15 concerns the separation of facilities."
"Right from the start, the European Parliament demanded completely separate sites."
"I can accept separate buildings if they really are separate - and not just separate parts of one building under the same roof."
"There are also a number of amendments which were rejected by the committee and which, for various reasons, should be rejected once more."
"We are concerned here with deleting references to biogas and composting."
"This regulation does not regulate biogas plants and composting systems."
"On the contrary, Article 6.2 says that national legislation in this area should apply until new EU environmental legislation is passed."
"The only point of the reference in Article 1.2 is to give the Commission legal justification for requesting scientific statements on biogas and composting."
"If we delete household waste, that is, from private kitchens, from the definition of catering waste, we are doing ourselves a disservice."
"We know that catering waste is a very serious channel of infection for both swine fever and foot and mouth disease."
"I personally think it is quite difficult to ban household waste being used as feed."
"It has been a tradition in our European culture for thousands of years but we are now living in a new world and in another time, in which food, feed and ingredients are moved from place to place in a completely different way from 50 years ago, for example, when feed and food circulated in relatively small and recognisable cycles."
"Once more I would like to thank my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council for excellent teamwork over the past year and a half."
"Mr President, could I first of all thank Mrs Paulsen for the constructive way in which she has conducted the dialogue between the groups to come up with some compromise amendments?"
"I am pleased that my group has been able to sign all the compromise amendments, with the exception of Compromise Amendment No 25."
"We very much support the ban on the use of catering waste in animal feed, not least because the likely cause of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom was the use of pigswill as feed."
"I am also pleased to see that catering waste from abroad, such as may come from aeroplanes landing in our country, has been upgraded to category 1."
"However, two problems emerge from this situation."
"The first is the use of used cooking oil in the United Kingdom as animal feed."
"Unfortunately, we will not be able to hide this oil behind the piles of fridges currently found in my own country and I am afraid that much of this oil will find its way into the drains of the country, causing environmental damage and also, I suggest, public health problems as it congeals and solidifies in the sewers of our major cities."
"We also have a problem in Germany, where there are centralised plants for treating catering waste, unlike the on-farm situation in the UK, which was not very satisfactory."
"Many of these installations are brand new and run according to the highest standards with typical German efficiency."
"We should recognise the situation in Germany and Austria and allow an extension on the use of some of these brand new plants."
"That is why I am pleased to support Amendment No 10, which was proposed in committee by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and calls for the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal by June 2002 requiring Member States to supply proof that these plants can operate safely."
"Compromise Amendment No 25 contradicts this because it calls for a four-year extension on the use of these plants."
"If, as I have been advised, the authors of the original amendment were to propose an oral amendment stating that this new legislative proposal could come forward in four years' time, then this would avoid such a contradiction."
"That would be a good way forward and my group would be prepared to support such a move."
"On the issue of sludge, could I ask the Commissioner to clarify the situation?"
"We have many slaughterhouses and meat processing plants that discharge effluent into domestic sewage systems in our major towns."
"Although this process involves some initial filtration, there is no way that one could describe this discharge as sterile: it contains pathogens of all sorts."
"Determining that the sludge from the sewage treatment plants in these large cities had to be incinerated under this directive would place unacceptable costs on slaughterhouses."
"The European Union has already been responsible for the closure of many slaughterhouses and, in fact, in many cases, there would be no space for separate sewage treatment facilities."
"Therefore, could I ask the Commissioner to make it quite clear on the record that the primary filtration products of these plants would be covered, but that the sludge from sewage treatment would not have to be incinerated and could be spread on the land as before?"
"Mr President, it is indeed a remarkable situation in which we find ourselves today."
"We are speaking about a second reading, which the rapporteur has prepared brilliantly, and I admire the way in which Mrs Paulsen has tried to navigate a course between Scylla and Charybdis, Scylla being the thirteen Member States that have accepted the common position, and Charybdis being the two that have not, namely Austria and Germany."
"Austria and Germany did not approve the common position for clear reasons."
"Austria has been undertaking schemes involving the composting of biomass and the use of biogases for energy production, schemes which would no longer be possible under the common position. Germany would be prevented from sterilising and reusing catering waste."
"When I listen to this debate today, and when I look back on the past few days, it surprises me that the United Kingdom, France and other countries accepted the common position."
"I have just heard Mr Goodwill saying that he and his group did not sign Compromise Amendment No 25, which I signed along with all the other compromise amendments."
"I signed them because they are compromises."
"The ideal world is different."
"I have a different conception of the ideal solution too."
"But among the sources of the compromise amendment are not only Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's Amendments Nos 10 and 1 but also Mr Whitehead's amendment, which provided for a four-year transitional period."
"Mr Goodwill referred to fears in his country that foot and mouth disease had been caused by the use of pigswill as feed."
"To my knowledge, this has not been proved."
"Swine fever, yes, but as a cause of foot and mouth disease it is new to me."
"I had certainly heard this being mooted in the past, but that is only one aspect of the issue."
"Another point - and this is part of the compromise, Mr Goodwill - is that if I go back to my own Member State and say that there is a disposal problem with reheated cooking oil, they will tell me in Germany that this poses a dioxin problem which they refuse to contemplate."
"We must be very careful."
"This is a very fine line we are treading today, and we must avoid the mistakes of the past, when cost issues and disposal problems were often invoked to the detriment of animal health, and hence of human health too."
"If I say today that I can support our proposed compromise on catering waste, I must explain part of the background against which I make that statement."
"Nobody has been able to tell me what happens with catering waste in the other Member States."
"In Germany, there are modern high-performance facilities which undertake state-of-the-art sterilisation of catering waste then recycle it into animal feed."
"That is a fact."
"In other Member States no one can tell me what happens to it."
"Some say it is burned."
"Nobody really knows."
"No one knows the standards, and in private conversation any Member will admit that some of it ends up in landfill sites."
"That is precisely what we do not want."
"I should like to have a clear set of rules."
"In five years' time, if we have legislation banning the recycling of catering waste for any purpose other than the production of biodiesel, so be it; that is what we shall do."
"But it must then apply to all Member States."
"At the moment, Germany, Austria and other countries are being penalised for their high standards."
"If I appeal tomorrow for us to support all the compromise amendments, I shall be doing so because they are compromises."
"I must then ask you to be fair and support the compromises too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the matter under discussion is very intricate and complex, and is one that will have a very far-reaching effect on the food industry."
"For that reason, I wish to thank the rapporteur: we are grateful to you for your excellent work."
"I would, however, like to draw attention to one point, and that is Amendment No 15."
"There are Member States where processing is on a very small scale."
"The requirement, therefore, that different categories of activity should have a separate building is unreasonable as far as these countries are concerned."
"For example, in my own country we have two plants, both of which already have clearly separate and properly supervised production lines."
"If we were to find ourselves in a situation where we had to construct separate buildings for one more separate production line that would be unreasonable considering the small volumes being processed."
"In my opinion the issues mentioned previously in the Council's formulation have been taken proper account of, and I would hope the Council's and the Commission's position will enter into force with regard to this matter."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, for the excellent work she has done to get this regulation on health rules concerning animal by-products through."
"I also know that Mr Staes is pleased with the cooperation and the way in which we have been able to reach compromises as well as with Mrs Paulsen's work with the shadow rapporteur."
"Thank you for that."
"This is a very technical and complicated matter which can be difficult to get to grips with."
"At the same time, it goes without saying of course that we must guarantee safe food for the citizens of the EU and, that being the case, we must do so throughout the entire chain."
"Therefore, how we treat animals and what we feed them on is naturally important."
"I am very pleased about the principles which the European Parliament and the Council have agreed on, in other words that only by-products from animals approved for human consumption may be used as animal feed."
"The most important thing is possibly also the ban on re-use within the same species, that is, the fact that we are rejecting cannibalism."
"I understand the Council's position in seeking to prohibit catering waste in animal feed."
"It is difficult to guarantee safe and risk-free handling of catering waste."
"How can we know what mixed household waste actually consists of?"
"Now we have tabled a compromise amendment, Amendment 22, where exceptions are made for catering waste in category 3, and we submit Amendment 25 in which some Member States are permitted to feed catering waste for a transitional period of a maximum of four years."
"I am not entirely happy about this amendment but I am still willing to accept it so that we can get the report through."
"At the moment, there is a kind of moratorium on the use of meat and bone meal in animal feed."
"This means that the Council could at any time decide to permit the use of meat and bone meal once more."
"The Verts/ALE Group has therefore submitted Amendment No 20."
"I ask my colleagues to vote in favour of it as it does provide a kind of assurance that the Council must bring the issue up again before any decisions in that direction can be made."
"Mr President, at first sight, this report on health requirements for animal by-products appears to be very technical."
"It forces us to face a genuine problem for society and to take into account two realities that are not easy to reconcile."
"Firstly, the legitimate concern of consumers with regard to the BSE epidemic and the terrifying human form of BSE, namely Kreutzfeld-Jacob's disease. And secondly, the necessary concern for farmers and all employees of the meat industry, whose work is being jeopardised by the frightening - and mounting - burden of restrictions that are being heaped upon them in the name of the precautionary principle."
"Despite the fact that, several years ago, the fifth quarter or meat by-products were re-processed and sold, which met slaughterhouses' overheads."
"We now send these by-products - and quite rightly, I am sure - to be destroyed at great expense."
"As a result, meat is constantly becoming more expensive for consumers whilst farmers are no longer paid a fair price for their animals."
"The common position, on which we are due to vote, is creating a number of technical bottlenecks, since it is based on an extreme concept of the precautionary principle."
"For example, is it a good idea to ban spreading sludge, manure and stercoral matter from slaughterhouses on land and to send 20 million tonnes of this waste to incineration, when we do not yet know how to process the two million tonnes of animal feed that we have?"
"Is it a good idea to involve several thousand local and regional slaughterhouses in building hundreds of sewage treatment plants and incinerators when BSE detection tests are making swift progress?"
"We will therefore reserve judgment, Mr President, on this extremely pernickety and excessively cautious text which will place such harsh restrictions on slaughterhouses, that many will be at risk of closing down, with all the consequences that these closures will have on the transportation of animals and the spread of epidemics."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by expressing my sincere thanks to all the honourable Members whose hard work and constructive attitudes have brought us to this point."
"It is unquestionable that the prevention of epizootic diseases which lead to food crises is of great importance, not only to the future of European farming but also to the entire population of Europe."
"The crucial task now is to find a suitable means of meeting the needs of a multifunctional agricultural system as well as those of consumers."
"In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, I therefore call for the preservation of the tried and tested national systems for the disposal and recycling of organic waste."
"The collection and use of biogenetic waste for the purposes of composting or for use in a biogas plant are highly commendable from an environmental point of view and must therefore remain possible in future."
"In Austria in particular we have found these processes extremely useful."
"I should also like to address the extremely controversial issue of recycled catering waste."
"The Austrian example shows that application of the highest possible standards of hygiene, coupled with official monitoring, banishes any concerns regarding a possible risk of epizootic disease."
"This has been confirmed once again in the recent past."
"I would therefore regard a general ban on the use of pigswill for animal feed as an unduly draconian measure."
"In addition, we must not forget the investments that have been made in the municipal collection of organic waste and in the officially licensed decoction facilities, investments made in the belief that the future lies in an exemplary system of environmental protection."
"In recent years, 250 new decoction facilities have been built in Austria."
"I shall therefore lend my support to all compromise amendments that guarantee the continued existence of proven monitored systems for the recycling of organic waste."
"I consider it very important that we formulate our decisions on this sensitive subject in such a way that the general public can follow our reasoning."
"The public would certainly not want to see the prohibition of an exemplary practice."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Paulsen very warmly on her diligence and skill in bringing through another complex piece of food safety legislation."
"She always manages to steer between national positions and never loses sight of that corpus of food safety legislation which we are slowly bringing together."
"I would like to look at the very wide definition of catering waste in the annexes and in Amendments 22 to 25."
"I will leave aside the feeding of carrion birds because I wish to look at a different form of carrion, that is the catering waste represented both by the recycled swill in some countries and by recycled cooking oils in others, including my own."
"Catering swill arouses deep misgivings in my country because of the role it played in the recent foot and mouth epidemic."
"Cooking oil is seen to be a problem after the dioxin scandals of recent years."
"The rapporteur has brought the two together in a complex series of amendments culminating in No 25, which I will support."
"I acknowledge her efforts."
"The UK's problem, as Mr Goodwill has mentioned, is that we need to have an effective and rewarded system of collecting used catering oils for fuel - not feed - reuse."
"That will take time."
"If no other outlet is provided, users will dump it in drains and ponds. They will become sumps of noxious material."
"One constituent demonstrated to me in the most vivid terms what exactly those consequences will be."
"Therefore, Commissioner, we really would like a statement of intent on whether the four-year transition period is achievable."
"I hope it is; otherwise, good intentions will founder here for sure and the old saying that the best can be the enemy of the good will be vindicated."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking my esteemed colleague, Mrs Paulsen, for all the sound and skilful work she has done on this report."
"I support most of the content of the report and am pleased that the Commission is prepared to propose transitional arrangements for the cleansing of waste water."
"I think, however, that we are going too far in a number of areas."
"During the last part-session, we debated Mr Olsson's report on the extent to which the existing BSE decisions had been implemented in the Member States."
"That was depressing, and there was not much to rejoice about."
"There are too many countries which cut corners, and that creates too many holes in the system for BSE to be combated effectively."
"Something needs to be done about this. We owe it to ourselves and, especially, to those countries which comply with the decisions."
"I am unable to support the proposed amendments to the regulations governing post-mortem inspection of blood, for which I do not believe there is any scientific justification."
"Nor have I been given any estimates of its economic significance for the Member States and the regions, and I fear it would involve major costs for smaller enterprises and, in particular, for slaughterhouses operating on a very small scale."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome the Commission's initiative to introduce uniform European rules on the use of animal by-products."
"Optimum control and traceability of animal by-products are vital prerequisites of greater consumer safety."
"In particular, I support the amendment which was adopted in committee on the use of kitchen waste for animal feed."
"The feeding of untreated kitchen and restaurant waste has often been regarded in the past as a possible source of swine fever and foot and mouth disease."
"For this reason it is especially important that all such untreated catering waste which is transported into our countries should be eliminated."
"It undoubtedly makes sense to process catering waste in accordance with strict regulations, so that the entire operation can be supervised down to the smallest detail."
"Our declared aim in all of this must be maximum safety for consumers."
"Strict processing regulations, by which I specifically mean rules governing sterilisation and the destruction of potential pathogens, and firm European regulations on traceability and control are indispensable and reduce the risk of the spread of epizootic diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever."
"Consistent checks by producers, but also by farmers, must supplement the system."
"The vital thing is that farmers and consumers must be able to rely on the safety of feed products."
"This requires a system for the conditional authorisation of catering waste for use as animal feed, a system that can be closely monitored."
"This is why I firmly support the amendment tabled by the Environment Committee."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I join my fellow Members in congratulating Mrs Paulsen for the work she has done as well as her collaboration."
"The aim of this report, as previous speakers have said, is to draw up sanitary rules with a view to improving food safety."
"One of the fundamental aspects of this proposal is to ban re-use within the food chain of certain animal products, namely animal carcasses and downgraded animal by-products."
"However, the draft text submitted to Parliament at second reading - and I am referring to Article 4 here - indicates that all matter of animal origin collected during processing waste water in slaughterhouses and other premises must be classified as category 1, and this wording and change in the text gives us cause for concern."
"A provision of this kind would cause huge problems in terms of storage, collection and disposal, since the sludge from processing waste water during slaughter would no longer be able to be spread on land, but would have to be incinerated, which would add to the millions of tonnes of animal feed that we have to dispose of."
"The costs incurred by these new restrictions would force many slaughterhouses and cutting rooms throughout the European Union to close down their business that has become increasingly difficult in the wake of the various crises that we have experienced."
"I can only reaffirm that, at local level, the professional workers, employees, citizens and local authorities, if they failed to grasp the scientific justification of this text, would find it hard to understand that, after all their efforts (sanitary measures, tests, slaughtering herds), the European Union is asking them to make a further effort which goes beyond the financial limits that they are able to cope with."
"I therefore believe that it is essential that we provide clarification on this matter and that this specific treatment only applies to equipment with specific risks, thus ensuring increased food safety and feasibility for our industries and tradesmen."
"We must also step up our research programmes so that we have the most effective techniques possible for the processing of animals that are slaughtered and intended for human consumption and also pursue our other food safety policies to improve traceability, monitoring of imports from third countries and safe livestock feeding, as our priority must be to tackle the root of these problems."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, there is a popular saying that politics is a dirty business."
"Does it become even dirtier when politicians have to deal with such unsavoury matters as pigswill and abattoir waste?"
"Would it not perhaps be more consistent if we did not deal with these matters at all but simply proclaimed an outright ban?"
"If we commit ourselves to the search for sensible solutions, does this necessarily make us somehow corrupt or venal?"
"All sorts of inferences like these have been doing the rounds lately."
"I do not believe they have any substance."
"The European Parliament has shown courage."
"I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Paulsen for her systematic work on this issue and for her close cooperation with our committee."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have had the task of representing the interests of the farming community."
"I believe we have successfully integrated their concerns into this common position."
"May I also thank you, Commissioner Byrne, for our long conversations and debates."
"They were no bad thing."
"They were fruitful and, besides, they were quite enjoyable too."
"Here we are looking specifically at high-quality protein which is to be fed to non-vegetarian animals."
"We do not intend to make vegetarians of them, any more than we can induce carrion-eating birds to stop eating carrion."
"It would be the death of them."
"Similarly, when it comes to human foodstuffs, we want a system that will recycle all the high-quality nutrients."
"We cannot adopt a set of rules at the expense of the hungry people in the world, whereby anything that is no longer good enough for us is simply destroyed or abandoned."
"We are not legislating on catering waste here; it is merely a matter of the Commission presenting its own legislative proposal, to which we accord the same systematic and meticulous treatment that we gave to meat and bone meal."
"I do not understand the position of some people who are saying that meat and bone meal can be fed but catering waste cannot."
"Then there are others, of course, who are saying that catering waste can be fed but not meat and bone meal."
"So both positions exist."
"That is why I tabled my proposal."
"Your compromise proposal, Mrs Paulsen, is fine."
"Tomorrow I shall move an oral amendment in which I shall alter the time scale in my amendments, which are similar in substance to the compromise; this alteration relates to the time before the entry into force of the proposed regulation."
"I believe the alteration will make the amendments compatible, and we can then adopt them as they stand."
"We shall then have a sound solution."
"Thereafter, Mr Byrne, I hope that, on your initiative, we shall soon have the new version back here on the table."
"Then we shall engage in some more of the good old cut and thrust, and we shall revel in it."
"Politics is not a dirty business; it is actually a most enjoyable occupation!"
"Mr President, the recommendations under discussion today put forward by my colleague, Mrs Paulsen, are a continuation of the important work she has been so very commendably involved in as Parliament's rapporteur regarding updating the legislation on food safety."
"We have been able to respond to food crises in the current parliamentary term in a way that has been both consistent and wide-ranging."
"Our common goal is to restore complete consumer confidence and levels of safety."
"I would like to say that I agree with the view expressed just now by Mr Pesälä regarding Amendment No 15."
"The traditional, common sense way in which catering waste is used for feeding has for the present unfortunately proved problematic as a result of inadequacies in the processing of feed."
"Serious animal diseases have thus been able to spread."
"For that reason Parliament now requires the Commission to promptly submit a legislative proposal banning the use of catering waste of animal origin as feed and obliging Member States to provide proof of its safe disposal."
"As an exception, the production of feed from catering waste could be permitted if it has been properly sterilised in an officially authorised plant."
"Parliament can also feel pleased with how the codecision procedure works and the cooperation established with the Council in the area of food safety."
"That is why it is unfortunate that the most prominent element in publicising the work to improve food safety, the establishment of a new Food Safety Authority, has proved such a difficult task in the Council and that the agency is commencing its work in a temporary location."
"This is also likely to hamper the recruitment of qualified staff for the agency."
"In this respect the Council should be capable of making the right decisions swiftly and showing consumers that the long-term work done to guarantee the supply of safe food is more important that seeking to obtain short-term benefits for individual countries in the Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we discuss this report dealing with animal by-products that are not intended for human consumption, we must not speak exclusively of waste products."
"The basis for a very specific distinction is provided by the submission from the Commission, which divides the materials into three categories."
"They must be separately registered, stored, treated and marketed, and evidence of each operation must be recorded."
"The items that must be destroyed and removed from the food chain are quite clearly defined, as are the conditions for their removal and destruction."
"We are all agreed that contaminated and inferior material has no place in the food chain."
"On the other hand, we can treat and then re-use important nutrient carriers that were properly prepared for their original use."
"Strict rules govern the procedure for such recycling."
"Here we have the example of pigswill."
"To allow the use of pigswill, the Committee on the Environment adopted Amendment No 10 on the recycling of catering waste."
"There is pressure to adopt this particular amendment within a short time frame."
"The directive on swine fever enters into force on 1 November and imposes a blanket ban on the feeding of catering waste."
"And this is why I ask you, Commissioner, whether Compromise Amendment 25 that has been set before us lifts this ban."
"A legal loophole must not be created here, because the existing processing facilities produce hygienic feed which contributes neither to the spread of classical swine fever nor to that of foot and mouth disease."
"I believe Amendment No 10 was good, which is why the committee adopted it."
"It is for this reason that I asked my absolutely clear and unequivocal question about the new compromise amendment on the table."
"We should take particular care to ensure that we make clear and unambiguous statements and that we leave no scope for confusing double standards and overlaps between different regulations."
"This sort of thing affects small and medium-sized abattoirs."
"For that reason, we must support Amendment No 2 to Article 4."
"May I reiterate my sincere thanks to Mrs Paulsen for this report?"
"It is a matter of the safety of our food chain, which is, after all, very closely connected with the health of consumers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, feeding catering waste to livestock instead of indulging in waste tourism - that is my political demand."
"When shall we create an authoritative and objective system of public information in the EU?"
"In Germany, catering waste is fed to fattening pigs under the strictest of rules."
"Confidence in the processing facilities is high."
"My country is the most populous in the EU; about a quarter of the entire population of the Union lives in Germany, and there is a correspondingly high output of catering waste."
"There is no evidence of any epizootic disease having occurred in our country through the feeding of treated catering waste to livestock."
"What are we actually doing to ourselves with this planned ban?"
"In my view, we have started to place pigs before people as far as food intake is concerned."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has already raised this point, and I too find it monstrous to do this in a world where people are starving every day, where slum children have to rummage about in rubbish heaps for food scraps."
"What life of luxury is Europe trying to lead?"
"This, you may well say, is an emotional argument, but it is extremely important to me, Commissioner, that we restore some rationality to our examination of the feeding of catering waste."
"It must surely be possible for us, through our own efforts and with the aid of the media, to present these issues in a rather more objective manner."
"The treatment of catering waste must, of course, comply with appropriately high sterilisation standards."
"That is the only way to guarantee the destruction of foot and mouth and swine-fever pathogens."
"Plants supervised by the public authorities are surely the best safeguard."
"Along with the numerous previous contributors to this debate, may I say thank you very much to Mrs Paulsen for the work she has done, but I also hope that we can reach a practicable solution and that we can send out long-term signals from which the feed industry, waste processors and farmers can take their lead."
"Mr President, this proposal is the second major component in our defence barriers against BSE."
"The other is, of course, the regulation on TSEs."
"It is a hugely important proposal, key to the safe processing of the millions of tonnes of animal by-products produced in the Union each year."
"The continued absence of a sound, comprehensive and regulatory framework to deal with these by-products is quite dangerous."
"First of all, I would like to single out for particular appreciation your rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, for her enormous efforts and tireless work over these months in pursuing a rapid agreement with the Commission and the Council towards early implementation of the proposed regulation."
"A great many of the key provisions of the regulation under discussion result from her personal commitment and determination."
"I am greatly encouraged that all three institutions are in general agreement on three key principles: the requirement that only animal by-products derived from animals fit for human consumption should be used in feed, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products; the prohibition of intra-species recycling; and the need to tighten certain provisions in order to improve the control and traceability of animal by-products."
"However, I regret that, despite the very good progress made on the proposal, the question of how to deal with catering waste remains a main obstacle to final agreement."
"The feeding of catering waste carries a major threat of transmission of serious animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever."
"For example, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK last year, which caused such enormous losses to both the farming and non-farming community, is reliably known to have originated from swill feeding."
"I might also add that the outbreak of classical swine fever in the Netherlands in 1997 was also caused by the feeding of pigswill in neighbouring Germany."
"Nobody would wish this to occur again."
"Given the huge damage which has arisen from recent outbreaks of these diseases, the insistence of Member States on very high levels of protection is understandable and shared by the Commission."
"I am fully aware of your concerns that a total ban may not be appropriate, especially in Member States with strict controls."
"However, I am equally aware that the Member States are not prepared to take any risk arising from the authorisation of swill feeding."
"They have already decided on a ban in the swine fever directive, despite several opportunities to reconsider the need for a ban."
"There are no indications of a reversal of this position."
"Parliament must also accept that there are contradictions in any proposal to retain swill feeding."
"For example, Parliament is demanding the full traceability of ingredients in animal feedingstuffs and a ban on what might be described as cannibalism."
"How can this be consistent with a derogation allowing the use of waste collected from restaurants and hospital kitchens to feed pigs and poultry?"
"Similarly, how can Parliament ask to exclude catering waste from the strict control rules of the regulation, fearing that these rules would compromise the practice of composting, and at the same time demand that the Commission propose a new regulation on the safe disposal of catering waste?"
"The Commission, having heard the insistence of 13 Member States on the necessity for a ban, and in the interests of consistency, remains opposed to any relaxation of an outright ban in this regulation."
"We must therefore reject Amendments Nos 1, 10 and 25."
"We are also opposed to these amendments on institutional grounds, as the insistence on a deadline and on the content of future proposals undermines the Commission's right of initiative."
"Furthermore, the disposal and recycling of catering waste is and will be governed by existing and future environmental legislation on biodegradable waste."
"Finally, the Commission has already officially declared that it is ready to propose transitional measures, to be adopted by comitology whenever this is justified and appropriate, in order to allow the affected industries time to adapt to the new requirements introduced by this regulation."
"I would also refer you to Article 32, which might give further assistance in this area."
"Turning to the details, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 and 5 on the requirement of the marking of unprocessed category 1 and 2 material."
"Acceptance would require the marking of cadavers, including pet animals, and 1.2 billion tonnes of manure."
"I leave to your imagination the potential for the Eurosceptic press to exploit this requirement in order to undermine our credibility."
"We also cannot accept Amendment No 9, as detailed and sufficient requirements regarding accompanying documents and record-keeping are established in the annex to the regulation and may be supplemented if need be by comitology."
"We can, however, accept Amendments Nos 22 and 23 on catering waste making reference to environmental legislation, as they would ensure that the goals of the regulation are achieved without undermining separate collection schemes."
"Therefore, Amendments Nos 17 and 19 are unnecessary and cannot be supported by us."
"Amendments Nos 22 and 23 also clarify that the highest risk catering waste from international means of transport should remain subject to the control rules of Article 7."
"Therefore, they are preferable to Amendments Nos 7 and 8."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 18, aimed at excluding household kitchen waste from the definition of catering waste, as this is would be inconsistent with the existing EU legislation on classical swine fever."
"Turning to another important issue - sludge from slaughterhouses - we cannot support the first part of Amendment No 2, as it virtually destroys the effect of Article 4 by removing from the scope of the article material from waste-water systems from all slaughterhouses and other premises from which specified risk material is removed."
"It should be noted that the TSE Regulation does not establish any rules in this area."
"But as an aside, and in answer to Mr Goodwill, I should point out that I have written to Dr. Jackson on this particular subject."
"I have sent a copy of the letter to a number of Members and I will ensure that a copy is sent to you."
"It explains the position with regard to sludge and gives the kind of reassurance you sought earlier in your presentation."
"We could accept in broad terms the second part of Amendment No 2, which seeks to clarify that animal material collected when treating waste water is a category 1 material only if contains BSE specified risk material."
"However, Amendment No 21, which has the same objective but is clearer, is acceptable."
"Amendment No 4 cannot be accepted as, when combined with Amendment No 2 or with Amendment No 21, it would be superfluous and confusing."
"We cannot support Amendment No 14, which would provide a 3-year transitional period without conditions to apply during this period."
"I repeat that the Commission has already officially declared that it is ready to propose transitional measures to be adopted by comitology whenever this is justified and appropriate."
"We can support Amendment No 24 aiming to extend the derogation on the feeding of certain animals with category 1 material to endangered and protected species of, for example, vultures."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 11, as it would extend that derogation to any endangered or protected species."
"We can support Amendment No 20 requiring Member States to submit a report on the implementation of the Regulation, except for the reference to the lifting of the ban on meat- and bonemeal. This is already comprehensively covered by the TSE Regulation."
"Similarly, we can support the principle of Amendment No 13, which has the same objective as the first part of Amendment No 20, subject to editorial change."
"Finally, we can accept Amendments Nos 6, 12, 15 and 16 to various articles and annexes, as they are in line with the basic objectives of the Regulation."
"I wish also to note that Parliament has not made any further amendments to the second proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 90/425/EEC and 92/118/EEC as regards health requirements for animal by-products."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0459/2001) by Mrs Sornosa Martínez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the implementation of Directive 91/271/EEC on urban waste-water treatment [2000/2318(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the real reason it has been possible to draw up the European Parliament's own-initiative report on the implementation of the directive on urban waste-water treatment is that we in the Committee on the Environment concerned ourselves with this directive and followed its development very closely."
"With this report we have shown that there are serious shortcomings in the implementation of this directive, despite the fact that it has been in force for a long time - it is more than ten years old - and that, furthermore, it is extremely important for all European legislation on water."
"We know that many Member States have failed to comply with this directive."
"In 1998 there were many agglomerations of more than 150 000 inhabitants that had still not resolved the issue of waste-water treatment."
"Many Member States had still not submitted information on the condition of sensitive areas."
"Currently, many other cities of more than 15 000 inhabitants are still not treating this waste water in this way."
"We know that throughout this time the approach of the Member States has been so carefree, having implemented neither this nor other directives on the issue of water, that I believe Member States have been censured on more than 42 occasions for failing to comply with 17 directives in the field of waste water."
"Member States have been censured because they have not provided the information that the Commission asked them for and because, of course, they have not complied with this legislation when they should have, and they failed to comply in full in 1993, 1998 and even in 2000."
"But, Commissioner, the Commission also considered that their behaviour towards the European Parliament was unsatisfactory, since the information we were provided with was insufficient and, in some cases, wrong."
"I should like to say that, initially, this report had an annex, which, following two debates in committee, we were forced to remove, because the data that the Commission had supplied us with was wrong."
"In our view, the Commission has shown neither the necessary strength nor will in this case to demand that the Member States provide data and demand that they comply with this directive."
"I wish to say, Commissioner, that when we in the Committee on the Environment requested that this own-initiative report be drawn up, what we really wanted was for you to consider us as your ally, in order to strengthen the binding nature of this directive and to enable the Commission to force the Member States to comply more energetically with the directive."
"In this report we ask you to admonish the Member States, to initiate proceedings against those that have not complied and to continue using all legal means within your power, all in order to ensure that this legislation is complied with."
"We also asked you, of course, to continue keeping the European Parliament informed, requesting information from the Member States and holding seminars."
"Lastly, we ask you to adopt all necessary measures to ensure that, with the proper will to create such legislation, and the willingness to provide as much information as possible, compliance with this legislation can be enforced."
"Commissioner, there is currently a serious discrepancy between the enormous quantity of legislation we have approved and which we are continuing to approve but with which, nevertheless, the Member States are still failing to comply, which is why we have before us two own-initiative reports - on nitrates and habitats - by the European Parliament."
"These have shown us that the Member States are also failing to comply with other environmental directives."
"It is my view that, as European citizens, it is our right to have the Treaties protect the environment."
"In the European Union we already have certain principles (such as the precautionary principle and the principle of prevention)."
"We also have objectives, such as the strategy for sustainable development."
"We have tools, such as the Sixth Framework Programme and legislation."
"The European Union is even considered to be the world leader in protecting the environment."
"But, Commissioner, if all of this is really nothing but words, nothing but reports, if the Commission does not demand that the Member States comply with this legislation in its entirety, it will be quite useless."
"You can count on us to be your allies in ensuring that this legislation is complied with, because otherwise, we will lose credibility and I believe that we are here precisely to support the Commission and to prevent ourselves losing this credibility."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 1991 directive on urban waste water is intended to guarantee the construction and maintenance of sewage-treatment works in all large towns and municipalities of the European Union."
"Since these measures involve considerable financial expenditure, very liberal implementation deadlines were set."
"As my honourable colleague Mrs Sornosa Martínez has said, we must conclude today that not all Member States have made use of the time at their disposal; on the contrary, they have engaged in delaying tactics and - regrettably, in view of their failure to submit reports, we must also say quite bluntly - in obfuscation."
"The Belgian metropolis of Brussels, which is so keen to call itself the capital of Europe, sets an appalling example in this respect."
"The fine report compiled by Mrs Sornosa Martínez mercilessly exposes the inadequacies."
"Most Member States have not even fulfilled their reporting obligations for the first date in 1998, let alone for the second date in 2000."
"That is bad enough."
"What is far worse, however, is that the Member States' waters continue to be polluted by untreated municipal sewage."
"We are addressing many demands to the Commission today."
"It cannot act, however, as long as it does not have the power to do so."
"I believe that the large number of default actions and legal proceedings instituted before the European Court of Justice proves that the Commission is doing its duty."
"It is unquestionably the Member States that are in the dock."
"As Members of Parliament, we too should take action in our own countries."
"The call for wider direct powers of on-the-spot scrutiny for the Commission in the Member States, enabling it to intervene in the same way that it can already intervene in the realm of agriculture, is vehemently rejected by most of the Member States."
"Be that as it may, if we identify such gross violations by national governments of their obligations to implement European legislation, we must also find out why this is happening."
"I should like to mention at least three reasons."
"The first is the high cost, to which the European Parliament has drawn attention time and again since the directive was first debated."
"It is estimated that an eleven-figure sum in euros is needed for investments alone in the 15 Member States."
"Current estimates also put the cost of implementing this one directive in the applicant countries at about EUR 30 billion."
"The second reason is that many directives require the Member States to submit reports, which considerably increases their administrative workload."
"I urge the Commission to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether this task cannot be simplified, perhaps by means of standardised returns."
"Some initial moves have already been made in this direction, of course, within this very domain of activity in connection with the various directives for the protection of water resources."
"The third reason is that those Member States which have transposed the directive have gone about the designation of sensitive areas in very different ways."
"Should the Commission not spell out the precise criteria for the designation of sensitive areas?"
"That might perhaps make the directive easier to implement as well as having the desirable side-effect of enhanced comparability."
"I should be grateful if the Commissioner could respond to these points too."
"Mr President, very briefly, this is a very sorry story."
"It has been a bad story for some time and it is particularly embarrassing if you are Belgian, of course, or indeed anybody visiting Brussels, because the city of Brussels is one of the cities which has been in breach of this directive for the longest period."
"My questions to the Commissioner, which she might like to consider answering either now or later at some time, are, first: does she not agree that the situation in this directive proves the need for a much more thorough impact assessment to accompany legislation such as this?"
"I recall that when the urban waste water directive went through, the impact assessment was very feeble and never really gave any figures as to the likely costs."
"I am told that in the United Kingdom between 1989 and 2005, GBP 26 billion will be spent on upgrading the water system to deal with this directive."
"That figure was not known at the time when the directive was brought through - not in my country and not in any country; so the question is: can we obtain better, more effective impact assessments?"
"Not just cost-impact assessments in terms of a global figure, but impact assessments as to the disadvantage of doing nothing set against the advantage of doing something."
"Secondly, I wonder whether I might ask the Commissioner to be very bold, because this really does come down to the question of Mrs Wallström's debates with the Council of Ministers."
"One of our problems is not only that the Commission does not produce impact assessments, but that the Member States are not honest about their capacity to put in place what they sign up to."
"What we really need is a system whereby each Member State is asked at a Council meeting whether or not it can comply with the legislation that its ministers are about to sign up to."
"A very good place to start would be the new directive on packaging waste."
"I am sure that every Member State wants to send its minister to Brussels to agree to environmental directives; that is just our problem."
"They agree to far too much; they do far too little; and this waste water directive illustrates the problem."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Sornoza on doing this report so well."
"We had many problems getting the information out of the Commission, for the simple reason that the Commission did not have the information because the Member States had failed to furnish it."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank the European Parliament, and rapporteur Mrs Sornosa Martínez in particular, for the work which she and Parliament have put into this resolution."
"Water is one of the areas which I prioritise in my capacity as Commissioner for the Environment, and I am especially interested in this question."
"Treated waste water is one of the most important tools for protecting our water and human health."
"I have examined the information on the Member States' implementation of the directive and share very many of the opinions put forward by Parliament in its resolution."
"Water quality has improved in larger rivers and many lakes but, nevertheless, the majority of Member States have either not done enough or they have acted too late."
"They have also been late in submitting information on the implementation of the directive, which has slowed down the Commission's assessment work."
"At the Commission, we have used a number of controls to ensure that the directive is implemented."
"These include traditional controls - including legal measures, which can now also include the imposition of fines - and financial support within the framework of the EU's funds."
"We are currently taking proceedings against seven of the 15 Member States, and further proceedings will be brought."
"The new controls are focused on raising the level of public awareness and on exchanging skills and information."
"A year ago, we ran a name, fame and shame seminar."
"I have also ordered wide-ranging reports on the implementation of the directive."
"This exceeds what the Commission is legally obliged to do."
"We think that the reports should be written in a way that is easy to understand and that they should be accessible to the public."
"The Commission has already responded to most of the demands in the resolution."
"This is the case regarding legal measures to ensure that the directive is implemented, the publication of information on implementation of the directive by the Member States, including details of court cases, the condition that the requirements in the directive must be met if financial aid is to be received, the development of a comprehensive monitoring and assessment system linked to the Geographical Information System and, last but not least, cooperation with, and support for, the candidate countries."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Statement by the President"
"Before turning to the topic of this morning's debate I should like to make a brief statement in the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council on the grave developments in the Middle East over the past several days."
"We have been watching with growing disbelief the violence and reciprocal atrocities that have plumbed new depths of horror in recent days."
"Military operations have now reached levels unknown in two decades."
"The region, and especially Israel and the Palestinian Territories, seem to be edging frighteningly and inexorably towards an all-out conflagration."
"We have a responsibility in our Parliament in this unfolding tragedy to do anything that we can to prevent the holy places being transformed into killing fields."
"We must actively support the unanimous call yesterday evening by the United Nations Security Council for an immediate ceasefire."
"The EU's High Representative knows that our Parliament stands squarely behind him in his efforts in favour of peace and for a ceasefire."
"Equally, I would like to take this opportunity this morning to place on the public record our Parliament's deep debt to the personal courage and unshakeable commitment of the European Union envoy, Mr Moratinos."
"He may not thank me for saying this, but I had the opportunity to speak to him at length yesterday about his diplomatic efforts on our behalf to keep channels of communication open with all sides."
"He is, for Europe, one of our unsung heroes."
"I want to pledge to this House to take any action on behalf of Parliament which has a chance of promoting peace and of trying to draw this region back from the edge."
"I have taken steps to invite Mr Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat to seek to break that infernal cycle of violence by inviting them to come to address this House."
"I hope they will be in a position to take up this offer."
"We would welcome them as champions of peace through the hardest of times."
"I, in cooperation with Mr Solana and the good offices of the Spanish Presidency, remain open to the suggestion to travel to Ramallah with the Knesset speaker, Avraham Burg and to meet there with Abu Ala in the Palestinian Legislative Council should circumstances permit."
"Because the risk is looming of an all-out conflagration we have to do whatever we can."
"In the name of this Parliament, for humanity's sake, the essential appeal I want to make this morning is: please stop the violence, start the dialogue and give peace a chance."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on having made this statement, which is proof that you are fulfilling your duty."
"My group invited two high-profile speakers, one Palestinian and one Israeli, to address us here last night and they described life in reoccupied Ramallah."
"They told us how the camps were being bombed and also described the horrors of the attacks in Jerusalem."
"They told us how the city of Ramallah was plunged into darkness and bombed at the very moment when President Arafat was receiving Mr Moratinos, and how bombs fell just a few metres from where they were meeting."
"I think that you were right just now to recall our decision to invite President Arafat and Mr Peres."
"I believe that you are right to remind us of this and to extend the invitation."
"We also decided to send a high-level delegation to the area; this was Parliament's wish."
"I suggest that we act on this decision and that this delegation be a high-level one, comprising, for example, the presidents of our groups or even Parliament's President."
"I would also like to express our support for the resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council. The latter represents a turning point in history because, for the first time, explicit reference is made to the need to recognise a Palestinian state, as advocated by the European Union."
"I believe it should be emphasised that the UN, the European Union, the United Sates and Russia need to work together if we are to find a light to guide us out of the darkness of the current conflict in the Middle East."
"This message should go out loud and clear, Mr President of the Council, particularly because it is important for the Council of Ministers to present a united front on this matter, and support the work of our representative in the Middle East. Parliament made its views clear through the resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority in the February plenary."
"I believe it is now time for the Council to act likewise and agree on a common approach it could wholeheartedly support. It might then be possible to move forward and break the present infernal cycle of violence."
"All that remains for me to say, Mr President, is that the initiatives you proposed and which were also part of our resolution, do reflect our common desire."
"Mr President, our group, too, thanks you for your statement, and we are right alongside you as regards a peace settlement, or the attempt at one, in the Middle East."
"This debate is not about the Middle East, as we want to discuss enlargement, but it is our profound conviction that we will be successful in the fight against terrorism only if we, that is the United States of America and the European Union, support the peace process between Israel and Palestine with equal determination and in the same way, something on which there could be stronger signals from the West, to which we belong."
"I am much obliged to you for your initiative."
"Mr President, I should simply like to thank you for your words and say that, if ever a delegation did go to Ramallah and Jerusalem, I hope that it would be able to meet not only representatives of the institutions but also some representatives of civil society in Palestine and Israel, because I believe that peace will only be restored in the Middle East if civil society is mobilised."
"Mr President, I should like, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to thank you for your support and for what you have said today."
"We are in a dreadful situation in which people are being killed every day in these areas: children, young people, the elderly, the innocent."
"Moreover, we must do everything to support you and, as a Parliament, call upon the other parties to do something."
"I think, however, that it is important that, as elected representatives of the people, we take this task upon ourselves and, at this time, express sympathy, as well as the horror and fear that we feel."
"I thank colleagues for the endorsement of that statement and of the possible initiatives that we might take."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on enlargement and we are very pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Piqué i Camps is here today to lead this debate."
"Mr President, before turning to enlargement, which is the topic of today's debate, I should like, if I may, to say a few words on the situation in the Middle East."
"Firstly, I wish to endorse the statement you just made. It is entirely appropriate and has my full support."
"We have long been involved in intense political and diplomatic activity aimed at finding a solution to the current situation in the Middle East and to the violence spiralling out of control in the region."
"A peace process is therefore the only option, and that process must involve the peaceful coexistence of two states in the region. On the one hand, there is the State of Israel, with internationally recognised borders and the right to feel secure, and on the other a Palestinian State that needs to be viable in every sense, especially as regards its political, economic, social and territorial dimensions."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to express my support for the United Nations Security Council resolution, as is right and proper. On behalf of the European Council I would like to add our voice to those calling for an immediate ceasefire."
"A number of initiatives and ideas have been put forward. I should like to endorse the initiative launched by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia."
"I believe it represents a good basis for further progress. It would be helpful if it received the support of the Arab League at its summit in Beirut at the end of this month."
"It is essential to get the peace process back on track. I should emphasise once again how important it is for the international community to work together to that end, as stated in that Security Council resolution and by a number of speakers in the House today."
"The European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations must work together. In addition, the whole Arab world as represented by the Arab League, and certain states in particular, must also be involved in this concerted approach."
"It should then at last be possible to convince both sides of the need to put an end to this fruitless cycle of actions and reactions. We are all aware of what the outcome has to be, and this makes the suffering and deaths even more senseless, if that were possible."
"I therefore believe we must persevere with this approach. I am very grateful for what you have said and for the support of the House."
"We shall persevere along these lines. We are working on a declaration for the European Council to be held in Barcelona the day after tomorrow."
"The declaration is being drafted in the clearest, most categorical and specific form possible. I trust that this declaration will be endorsed by other international players present and also that it will be a step towards attaining that longed-for peace which often still seems to be light years away."
"Mr President, I should now like to move on to the subject of this first speech, namely the enlargement of the European Union."
"It is abundantly clear that the impending enlargement represents one of the greatest strategic challenges the European Union has faced since its creation."
"As you are aware, it is one of the key priorities for the Spanish Presidency."
"The overriding political importance of this venture was made quite clear at Nice, when a road map setting out our objectives for the half year was devised."
"It was stated that negotiations with all those countries sufficiently prepared should be completed by the end of 2002. The next step was taken at Laeken, when the terms of this final stage of negotiations were confirmed."
"It was also stated that if the present rate of progress was maintained, up to 10 countries could be ready. In addition, specific terms were laid down for the conduct of negotiations."
"These terms must and will be adhered to, to ensure a successful outcome. On the one hand, there must be compliance with the acquis, and on the other, with the Berlin financial framework."
"It involves bringing into the Union countries that were military dictatorships with planned economies barely fifteen years ago. I am referring to the countries of Eastern Europe, most of which belonged to a military alliance opposed to the North Atlantic Alliance."
"I would remind you again that I am only casting my mind back fifteen years at most."
"As a result of the fundamental changes that happened so quickly, this enlargement has taken on its own specific characteristics. It differs significantly from previous enlargements, and therefore has its own particular nature."
"In line with the programme, my country's main aim whilst it holds the Presidency-in-Office of the Council in the coming six months is to achieve common positions on the chapters which have fallen to us by virtue of the timetable. It will be for our Presidency to close these outstanding chapters."
"I am referring to the budgetary and financial aspects of the common agricultural policy, and regional policy, notably the Structural and Cohesion Funds, in addition to financial and budgetary provisions. Finally, there is the chapter on institutions."
"They represent approximately 80% of the Community budget. This in itself is an indication of the size of the challenge we have before us."
"No effort will be spared in the pursuit of our aim. One reason is that we are aware that any delay could jeopardise the entire venture."
"The debate on these chapters was opened with the Commission's presentation on a communication concerning the financial framework for enlargement. I imagine that further details will follow."
"They have been debated seriously and in depth. The Commission has now undertaken to present draft common positions during March if possible, or failing that, in early April, depending on the outcome of the discussions."
"I have to say that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is favourably inclined towards these documents. We believe that they provide a fair and sound basis for negotiations."
"Their content is reasonable, balanced, and in line with the acquis and the Berlin financial ceilings, as agreed at the Laeken Council."
"We are now at a critical juncture. Consequently, we shall try to ensure that the possible attempts to reform common policies do not interfere or overlap with the enlargement negotiations, because if they do, enlargement will inevitably be delayed."
"The Presidency is fully committed to discharging this responsibility successfully. Nonetheless, as I mentioned earlier, we are aware that these are the most complex and sensitive chapters of the negotiations."
"We do not envisage opposition to reforming the main policies on expenditure. Rather, it is a case of stressing the importance of keeping to the agreed timetable, and therefore following a different course from that set for the enlargement negotiations."
"In discharging its responsibility, the Presidency knows it can count on the good will of the Member States. They are all aware of the significance of the task in hand."
"The Commission has presented the horizontal documents on regional policy, agriculture and the financial framework for enlargement. It has also canvassed the opinions of the Member States."
"As I mentioned earlier, the next stage will come within a few days when the Commission presents to the Council draft common positions acceptable to the Member States and negotiable with the candidate countries. I have to say that the Commission is doing an excellent job."
"The Commissioner responsible deserves particular recognition. He is present here today and I should like to take this opportunity to thank him for all he has done."
"The Presidency also hopes it can rely on support from the candidate countries. They are making a great effort to adopt the acquis and implement it effectively, but they will also be called upon to make an effort to be realistic at the negotiating table."
"A preliminary debate has already taken place in the Council in its various configurations: the General Affairs Council, the Agriculture Council and Ecofin, for instance."
"Nonetheless, I am convinced that in the course of these discussions we shall arrive at consistent positions we all agree on. They should also be acceptable to the candidate countries because, ultimately, we need to come up with a solution amounting to a fair compromise between a whole range of demands."
"Secondly, compliance with the rationale underpinning the negotiations, namely the transposition and effective implementation of the entire acquis. This applies to everyone, and there is no scope for differentiated systems."
"Furthermore, as I mentioned previously, it is essential to comply with the budgetary ceilings set in Berlin."
"Lastly, it is important to take on board the reasonable expectations of the candidate countries and respond positively."
"I am confident we will all work together to reach such agreement, overcoming the difficulties we are currently experiencing as a result of the sensitive nature of these chapters in the negotiations."
"We intend to adopt common positions on these chapters with financial implications and try to provisionally close the chapters that could not be closed earlier because of the specific difficulties involved. In addition, we propose to set in train a range of measures designed to facilitate the process."
"Firstly, the committee charged with drafting the Act of Accession and related instruments will begin work."
"The committee is to start operations at once, cooperating closely with the candidate countries."
"Furthermore, during these six months, the Commission will submit the action plan on compliance with the third criterion for enlargement. This is the so-called Madrid criterion regarding effective implementation of the acquis by each of the candidate countries, a crucially important issue at this stage in the negotiations."
"During our Presidency we also aim to open all outstanding chapters with Bulgaria and if possible, with Romania too."
"Obviously this will only happen if the Commission and the two countries concerned supply the Council with the necessary information and comply with other requirements."
"Bulgaria and Romania have certainly made a great effort to move forward. This was recognised at Laeken, and I am pleased to be able to commend them for it in the House as well."
"It is important to continue sending out positive signals to these two countries regarding our commitment to their participation in the enlargement process. Hopefully this will come about very soon."
"I should like to deal with Cyprus separately."
"Reunification is not a precondition for accession, though clearly a solution to the current situation would make things very much easier."
"Throughout its Presidency, Spain will fully support the United Nations' efforts to resolve the situation. It is to be hoped that the prospect of enlargement will be an incentive to put an end to the division of the island."
"Lastly, further to the Laeken conclusions, the Spanish Presidency will press ahead with the pre-accession strategy for Turkey. The aim is to move to a new stage in Turkey's preparation for approximation to the acquis, taking into account the extent to which the country has complied with the Copenhagen political criteria, and with a view to setting new objectives in the accession process."
"We have many important commitments and tasks to deal with during these six months in order to maintain the momentum of the negotiating process."
"The ultimate aim is to ensure that we are in a position to conclude negotiations with those candidate countries that are genuinely ready by the Copenhagen European Council at the end of the year."
"We are convinced of the importance of bringing the enlargement process to a successful conclusion."
"It is morally necessary for Madrid, Barcelona, Berlin or Rome to be deemed as European as Prague, Budapest or Ljubljana. Furthermore, non-enlargement would have very serious implications both for the present Member States of the Union and for those prevented from joining it."
"As Spain's Foreign Minister, I am delighted to inform you that eurobarometer's readings put my country at the top of the list of countries whose citizens are most in favour of enlargement. The Government of Spain is certainly fully behind the people on this."
"The political situation in Member States where elections are due to take place shortly must not be allowed to affect the enlargement process. The latter must not be affected either by the tragic events of 11 September."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish, on behalf of the Commission, to thank firstly you, Mr President, most warmly for your statement on the situation in the Middle East and to make it clear that the Commission endorses the whole of what you have said."
"I believe that the present time requires us to demonstrate that all the political institutions of the European Union share common ground and a determination that the violence in the Middle East should come to an end and that common sense must be given a chance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me now turn to the subject of our debate."
"In terms of enlargement, 2002 will indeed be a most decisive year."
"The European Councils in Gothenburg and Laeken, and Parliament's decisions on the subject, have given rise to such political momentum and created such a level of response that this process can now be delayed no longer."
"Any delaying tactic would now have unmanageable and perilous consequences and could lead to the political and economic stability now achieved across the whole region between the Baltic and the Black Sea being jeopardised."
"It is still, then, our objective to welcome all those candidate countries that are sufficiently prepared as new members before the 2004 European elections, and prospects for this are good."
"Negotiations are progressing according to plan, and we are adhering fully to the timetable."
"The Spanish Presidency's excellent cooperation gives me confidence that, under it, negotiations will be successfully completed on all the chapters - with the exception of the financial package and the 'institutions' chapter - with the ten countries that, at Laeken, were named as potential candidates for membership in 2004."
"As envisaged in the road map, the Commission will, in the coming weeks, be submitting drafts of the common positions on the chapters on agriculture, regional policy, budgets and institutions."
"Apart from that, we intend this year to open all the outstanding negotiating chapters with Bulgaria and Romania and to present a more developed and enhanced strategy to prepare these countries for accession."
"I would now like to deal with a number of political issues which have, in recent weeks, and to some extent in recent days, shown themselves to be potentially problematic or possible obstacles."
"I will start by referring to the discussions on the Bene? Decrees."
"It is the Commission's view that this is not just a legal problem, but primarily a political and moral issue, a solution to which has for some years been sought by the Commission and by many others in many, many confidential discussions."
"The Commission takes the view that those Bene? Decrees that refer to the expropriation of property conflict both with present-day Czech and European legislation, and are therefore obsolete and of no further effect."
"It should therefore be our common endeavour to get back to objective reality on this issue and not have the process of enlargement laden down with issues that belong to the past."
"An understanding has to be reached which will allow all the parties concerned to maintain stable and lasting relations with each other in a spirit of good neighbourliness and to shape Europe's future together."
"The question that is significant in terms of coexistence within the European Union is whether Czech legal practice on the reconveyance of property results in discriminatory effects."
"I have noted with satisfaction that the Czech government, for its part, is examining this question, and I also welcome Parliament's request for an independent opinion on the matter."
"The Commission, too, is at present re-examining all the legal aspects of this issue."
"I am already able, though, to tell you today that the Czech government has declared to the Commission its readiness to act and ask the Czech legislature to change the legal position if it should transpire that present legal practice cannot be reconciled with European law."
"Another issue to which we have had to give closer attention this year has been that of the future of the Kaliningrad region."
"On completion of Poland and Lithuania's accession processes, Kaliningrad will become a Russian enclave within the European Union."
"The Russian government has raised a range of issues on the problems of access, cross-border travel and energy supply."
"It is my belief that we have to consider these topics in the overall context of the development of the Baltic region as a whole."
"Substantially more than just agreement on a transit order is at stake, and a great deal more than a solution to the question of visas."
"As regards transit arrangements and the visa issue, we are seeking an arrangement within the framework of the existing Schengen acquis."
"The Commission has already, over the past year, set out its thinking on the issues to be dealt with and emphasised its willingness to enter into dialogue."
"Such discussions need now to be continued in a purposeful way within the framework of the existing EU/Russian bodies."
"I would, though, like to make it clear that separate negotiations with Russia on the Kaliningrad issue cannot be carried on within the framework of the enlargement process."
"We are unable to engage in negotiations on the rights of third parties and, above all, cannot come to any agreements to their detriment."
"The decisive question will be how the Kaliningrad region can successfully be included in the dynamic of the Baltic region's development."
"The real problem will be the growing socio-economic gulf between Poland and Lithuania on the one hand and the Kaliningrad region on the other, which will ensue if a way cannot be found to make possible Kaliningrad's involvement in the region's increasing economic dynamism."
"We must reduce this gap if the spurt of growth that will result from enlargement is not to give rise to social and political tensions in this part of the Baltic region, for the real danger is of the development gap leading to potentially explosive social and political tensions."
"Let me add to what has been said on the subject of Cyprus."
"Last week, I had the opportunity to hold a series of political discussions in Cyprus, notably with the leaders of the two communities, Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash."
"I came home from Cyprus thoroughly encouraged, with the impression that both leaders of the negotiating teams in the ongoing face-to-face discussions on a possible resolution of the Cyprus question are striving in earnest and with determination and commitment towards a lasting political solution."
"No breakthrough has as yet been achieved, and there are as yet no definite agreements, but I could see that convergence has been achieved to an extent that would have been considered impossible even only a short time ago."
"So I want again to encourage both sides to pursue these discussions in a constructive fashion and make use of this window of opportunity to come to a sustainable and durable peace settlement in good time for the accession negotiations to be completed."
"I derive particular satisfaction from the fact that both Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash assured me that it is still their objective to reach political agreement by June of this year."
"The Commission remains in close contact with the United Nations in order to ensure that any political solution is compatible with the provisions of European law in force."
"It is from our point of view crucial that Cyprus, being subject to international law, should be able to act at an international level, speaking with one voice in the institutions of the European Union and should be able to implement and enforce within its own territory the international undertakings that it enters into."
"On 30 January, the Commission presented its proposals for a common financial framework for enlargement, our objective being to guarantee the coherence of the negotiations on agricultural policy, structural policy, and on the budget chapter."
"Over and above that, we want enlargement to come about under conditions acceptable to all sides."
"There must not be second-class membership, nor will there be."
"Enlargement must, though, be on a sound financial footing and also manageable in the long term."
"In preparing the common negotiating position in the coming weeks, the Commission will be guided by the following principles: Firstly, that the ground rules have been clear ever since the 1999 Berlin decision on Agenda 2000."
"The Berlin global upper limits will not be exceeded even if we now accept up to ten new Member States, whereas the decisions taken in Berlin assumed six."
"Secondly, the new Member States are, in principle, to participate in all common policy areas, in certain cases only after agreed transitional periods, although it should be noted that such transitional periods may be requested both by the candidate countries and also, in individual cases, by us."
"Thirdly, the new Member States are not to be financially worse off after joining than they were before it."
"It goes without saying that we cannot tolerate a situation in which those who will be our poorest members will, in the early years of their membership, be paying for their richer counterparts."
"It is, then, absolutely unacceptable that the new members should be in a net position from the very start."
"Fourthly, our proposals are not under any circumstances to prejudice the form that Community policies may take in the future."
"That also applies to agricultural policy."
"The Commission's proposals do not, therefore, in any way prejudge the next financial perspective for the post-2006 period."
"You will be aware that our package is, above all, one of structural aid, as it is in this area that there is the greatest need."
"Perhaps I should just quote some figures."
"Of the overall package alone, 76% is allocated to structural and cohesion measures and to measures in the rural development area."
"Of the financial package as a whole, 76% will take the form of direct investments in the development of these countries."
"It is only in the cohesion fund, but not in the structural fund, that we are proposing to increase resources, thus putting the emphasis on projects in the areas of the environment and transport infrastructure, where the need is greatest and in respect of which the candidate countries have, in the course of negotiations, entered into commitments which we must help them to meet."
"The Commission considers it particularly necessary to emphasise the development of rural areas in order to actively promote structural measures in rural areas and make use of the opportunity for restructuring."
"It is true that, in Berlin, no exact calculations were made as regards direct income aid for farmers in the period up to 2006, but I must point out that the Commission remarked at three points in the memoranda that accompanied Agenda 2000 that the acquis is a unity, that there cannot, in the long term, be two agricultural policy systems alongside each other and that direct aid forms part of the acquis."
"We must, then deal with this issue at the negotiating table."
"After accession, the new Member States will pay full contributions to the budget, whilst some of the structural and agricultural policy measures will become effective in budget terms only after a certain time delay."
"As in previous enlargement rounds, the Commission will therefore provide for the facilitation in principle of lump-sum compensation in the budget."
"Practical details of this can, of course, be decided only at the very end of the negotiations."
"From the Commission's point of view, the package now on the table is balanced both in terms of policy and content."
"The plan is still in place."
"Negotiations are progressing at a brisk pace."
"The next stage is clearly mapped out."
"Up until the European Council in Seville, the task in hand will be to work out a common EU negotiating position on agricultural policy, structural policy, on the budget chapter and on the institutional chapter, and the course taken so far by discussions in the Council leaves me confident that that will also be achieved."
"In addition, the Commission will be presenting a report to the European Council in Seville on the realisation of the action plans to build up administrative capacity in the candidate countries."
"At the end of October this year, the European Council, under the Danish Presidency, will consider the progress reports for 2002 and the Commission's actual recommendations, which will relate to the question of with which candidate countries negotiations may be formally concluded at the European Council in Copenhagen at the end of this year."
"This can, at the same time, introduce the concluding phase of negotiations."
"Continued close cooperation and Parliament's political support will be indispensable to reach a satisfactory conclusion."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group, that of the European People's Party/European Democrats, supports the general directions taken both by the President-in-Office of the Council and by Commissioner Verheugen."
"In saying, at the end of his speech, that Parliament's support is indispensable, the Commissioner was expressing a truth."
"We, too, hope that the whole process in which we find ourselves will lead to an outcome that will enable the Council, the Commission, and Parliament to declare themselves satisfied with it and to adopt what the negotiations have produced."
"Like Commissioner Verheugen, the President-in-Office of the Council again put the emphasis on timing."
"It was indeed our Group that proposed that the negotiations should be conducted in such a way that the first countries to join the EU should be able to take part in the 2004 European elections."
"This makes it necessary that we should complete negotiations by the end of this year and by the beginning of 2003 at the latest."
"I hope that this will be possible under the Danish Presidency, for the completion of the negotiations would complete the cycle that began when the Copenhagen criteria were laid down ten years ago."
"It is also beautifully symbolic in a particular way that the Presidency at this important stage is held by Spain, a country of the South, thus focusing attention on the significance of the centre of Europe and expressing our common political intention that EU enlargement - which of course involves Cyprus and Malta, but mainly the central European states - should not be about the interests of a few Member States of the European Union, but about our common interest, that of all the Member States of the European Union."
"There is of course still much work to be done, as we all know."
"We should not now give any country a guarantee and tell them that they are in whatever happens; rather, every country must make the effort so that we can achieve satisfactory outcomes at the end of the day."
"We know that many chapters still have to be negotiated on."
"Whilst hoping for results on them, we also say - and, whilst not being an expert on agriculture myself, I do say this for my own part also - that our farmers have, in the European Union, Agenda 2000 to protect their legitimate expectations, and we see the mid-term review, to be presented by Commissioner Fischler, not as being about various things that actually have nothing to do with enlargement, but we want to safeguard our farmers' confidence as well."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, Kaliningrad has been mentioned, and, Mr Verheugen, I emphatically support what you said."
"I recently spoke with the Mayor of Pillau, which is in the Western part of the Kaliningrad region, where there is very great interest in the possibility of direct contact with the Commission in Brussels and a concern that not everything should be done via Moscow, which is a long way away."
"Perhaps, in our discussions with Russia, we might also ensure that there are immediate and direct links between Kaliningrad, formerly Königsberg, and the European Union and its Member States."
"I also wish to mention the Ukraine, the western part of which, as we know, was formerly eastern Poland."
"However much we, naturally, have to guarantee border security - and we must make every effort to ensure that the Mafia, drug trafficking and serious crime cannot get into the European Union across Poland's eastern border - we should, at the same time, be flexible in order that the people there who have ties across the border, who live in Western Ukraine and are of Polish origin, may also have flexible solutions in their dealings with Poland, so that no new Iron Curtain may descend there to separate people from each other."
"I believe that this will be of immense significance as regards our relations with the Ukraine."
"I believe that we - Council, Commission and Parliament - have a common task, in that we need to work much harder at persuading people, not only in the candidate countries but also in the European Union, that the membership of the central European countries and also Malta and Cyprus is a massive opportunity for the European Union - and particularly for the countries of central Europe - to establish stability on our continent."
"It is, though, also an economic opportunity, as trade between the European Union and the central European states has in the meantime almost equalled in scale our trade with the United States of America."
"This unleashes a dynamic that is to the benefit of all of us."
"If, when considering enlargement, we cast our eyes eastwards in particular, it is very important that we, especially in days like these - so we thank you again, Mr President, for your initiative on the Middle East - also look southwards, to the Mediterranean region."
"Eastward enlargement enjoys equal priority with our relations with the Mediterranean countries and with the Arab and Islamic world."
"If, as a European Union, we act with determination, courage and an eye to the future, then, I believe, we will also be able to accomplish a great work for peace and contribute to stability in our environment, both to the East and South of the European Union."
"I believe this to be the common task of the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"If we, together, bring that to pass, you, in the Commission and in the Council, will of course have our unqualified support."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen was entirely right to say that we are in the final phase of an irreversible process."
"Enlargement can be delayed no longer, and to seek to delay it is to contemplate making a grave error and taking an unhistorical step."
"Nobody in this House, I believe, wants to hold enlargement up."
"In this irreversible process, though, demands are made of both sides."
"We have discussed the candidates, and the tasks that the candidate countries must carry out."
"Many true things have been said about this, but we must take a critical look at ourselves and ask ourselves where we stand in this final phase."
"Even on the eve of its enlargement, does not the European Union itself still show deficits, and are there not tasks that it has not completed?"
"On that point, I want to address two aspects of the debate over the past eighteen months, and a period of time that lies ahead of us."
"Following Nice, we were told by everyone in the then Presidency of the Council and by the Commission, that Nice made the EU capable of enlargement; indeed, there were even Members of this House who said so equally emphatically."
"In Parliament, the overwhelming majority of Members took the view that this was not the case."
"Parliament took the initiative in introducing what was then termed the post-Nice process, which has, thank God, culminated in the convocation of a Convention, which is henceforth charged with eliminating the deficits, particularly of an institutional nature, that we still have as enlargement progresses."
"Nice saw the adoption of an agreement that did not go far enough, especially in the areas simplifying decision-making mechanisms, reform of the Council, and reform of the Commission's structures and democratisation."
"Much more is it the case that what was adopted at Nice was a mechanism for reaching majority decisions, one that complicated matters more than it simplified them."
"If we proceed with enlargement on the basis of such structures, it will be incapable of being delayed - on which point, Mr Verheugen, you are right - and will, furthermore, be necessary and historically right."
"It would, though, lead to a dangerous paralysis in the European Union and, furthermore, such a paralysis that there would an even greater threat of people turning away from the European Union."
"There is therefore a link between the Convention's task and enlargement."
"It is the Convention, in fact, that must make the European Union capable of enlargement."
"You referred to the need for Parliament to give its support in this."
"Parliament is indeed an important partner, and that in two respects."
"We are an important partner because we, in this House, will see to it that the democratic reforms needed at the heart of the European Union are actually carried out before the new Member States join, in other words before the European elections."
"We will equally see to it that we will, being part of the budgetary authority, join in dealing with the financial requirements, and do so to a creditable extent."
"As Commissioner Verheugen rightly said, the upper limits are clear, but there continue to be within them serious problems in need of a solution."
"These problems are, incidentally, not only of the sort that arise from enlargement and the financial arrangements associated with it; they result also from the decisions by which, within the framework of the foreign and security policy, additional financial functions are transferred to the European Union, functions that must also be funded from the Budget and will result in staff being redeployed."
"This means that Parliament, over the next two years, has to make it abundantly clear that we are the Council's and the Commission's partner in enlargement policy."
"Being a partner, we give support, but we will also critically monitor what the Commission and the Council will do about democracy, reform and the funding of the enlargement process."
"Mr President, the Commissioner has very helpfully outlined the major challenges that enlargement will bring - challenges such as the problems of Kaliningrad, of the Bene? Decrees, of Cyprus; and he has talked a lot about the cost of enlargement."
"I am, however, very pleased that the President-in-Office drew attention to the cost of non-enlargement, which is by far the greater."
"It may well be true, as the President-in-Office said, that for us these countries will have waited a ""mere"" 15 years to join the Union."
"To them, however, those 15 years will seem more than half as long again as the decade that Spain waited to come into our Union."
"I believe it is incumbent upon us to do all we can to speed up the process of enlargement."
"The first step in that process is in the hands of the Presidency this week as the Council meets in Barcelona."
"President, you have emphasised that we have a responsibility for reuniting our divided continent."
"We must welcome those who wish to join us as soon as they are ready."
"But it is not primarily a budgetary question: there are tremendous economic benefits to be gained, and that is where Barcelona comes in; for we need to have the courage to undertake ourselves the difficult economic reforms which we rightly expect of the applicant states."
"This means, in Barcelona, agreeing important economic reforms, finding the way towards reform of the common agricultural policy, and moving towards reforms of our institutions."
"The Heads of State and Government must not fudge the opportunity of real economic reform in Barcelona."
"We must open up the markets for gas and electricity, both wholesale and domestic, by 2005 at the latest."
"We must recommit ourselves to the package of legislative measures in the financial services action plan, unblocking discussions in the Council."
"We must also see progress on public procurement and a European patent."
"If we are to fulfil our objective of staying within the financial perspectives, enlargement must also mean reform of the common agricultural policy."
"The over-production and waste which characterise the CAP and the worrying consequences for public health of intensive farming methods must be dealt with as we move towards a modern rural development policy, breaking the link with production and creating an environmentally sustainable policy providing aid to our farmers."
"The prospect of enlargement also requires us to make a success of the Convention."
"Our institutions and our decision-making procedures are like a Trabant, when what we need is a Mercedes."
"We need to design a constitutional settlement for the Union of the 21st century which goes beyond Nice, which is based on common rights and values, which addresses the legitimate concerns of our citizens, combining accountability, democracy and efficiency."
"Here, above all, what is called for is a responsible approach from our Member States."
"It is not helpful for financial discipline if the Italian Finance Minister questions the finances of enlargement."
"It is damaging, when a Community of 25 or 27 will need a strong Executive in the Commission, if the Head of Government of one of our large Member States accuses the Commission of a bias against his country, of wanting to smash the culture of one of his industrial producers, and of singling out his country."
"If we are to insist on a responsible approach from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, then we need a more responsible approach ourselves."
"I hope that as we move towards the Danish Presidency later this year and the historic decisions on enlargement, we will see a responsible, united and purposeful Western Europe welcoming these new democracies into the democratic fold."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I must say that I can see an astonishing transformation."
"Whereas we have, over and over again, invented new and grand names for the enlargement of the European Union -'Europe's achievement of the century' and 'peace project for the continent' spring to mind - recent weeks have seen the addition of a new name for it: the 'enlargement savings bank'."
"This 'achievement of the century' is saving the fifteen EU finance ministers a cool EUR 18 billion over against the financial decisions reached in Berlin!"
"This is not to say that the financial decisions reached in Berlin were set rather too high through being wrongly estimated."
"On the contrary, criticisms were voiced at the time that it would probably not be enough for enlargement."
"It was said, though, out of fear of the net contributors, that we still had the reserves, and that we could call on them if it came to that."
"The opposite, though, is the case; the Commission has for weeks been repeating the slogan that enlargement must not cost anything."
"This strikes me as playing at a topsy-turvy world, as a peace project costs a fair bit."
"There cannot be a two-class Europe, as that would produce social tensions, migration and under-development."
"We Greens therefore call for the financial forecasts to be re-examined."
"It is not true that rural areas and the Structural Fund are getting more."
"It is precisely at these points that conspicuous cuts are being made over against what was estimated in Berlin."
"It would, basically, be necessary to use for enlargement the EUR 15 billion that are to be given straight back to the finance ministers of the fifteen EU States in 2002 and 2003."
"I also believe that transitional periods are possible until 2007 at the latest."
"The attempt to delay phasing-in even further, until 2007, is a pusillanimous proposal and evidence of the Commission's incapacity, as it would mean that the agricultural policy would not be reformed, and that they want to adjourn the mid-term review that makes the European Union do its homework."
"We are not going along with that."
"We need an agricultural policy under which aid is linked in with ecological and social criteria and projects are funded only if they are compatible with the reform."
"The candidate countries, though, must participate in this reform on an equal footing."
"The Commission continues to reject one important proposal by Parliament, namely that the agricultural reform should be introduced now in the candidate countries in order to strengthen rural areas, and that this should be done with the citizens who live there."
"The Commission, I believe, must stop acting in a feeble manner, and must have the courage to reform, and the courage to tell us that enlargement will cost money if it is to be a success."
"Mr President, as a Dane, I naturally hope that this can be done so that the Copenhagen criteria come full circle and we can append the final signatures in Copenhagen by the autumn."
"As a democrat and internationalist, I rather doubt, however, whether we shall make as much progress as that."
"I think there are still many obstacles. Some of these have been mentioned, but I think there are others that are also worth mentioning."
"We heard about developments from the fall of the Berlin Wall until the present time."
"Eastern and Southern European countries, emerging from planned economies and militarisation, were mentioned."
"All right, but what is to become of these countries if there are no planned economies or militarisation."
"The other day, we had a debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy about transatlantic links, and all the participants thought that European countries should prepare to get the defence budgets up to between 3 and 5% of GDP, simply in order to comply with general expectations of the EU's military capacity."
"What does that mean for the candidate countries and their economies?"
"I fear that, when it dawns upon them what conditions we are offering them, the people of Eastern and Central Europe will vote 'no' in the final referendums, and that would in my view be a catastrophe."
"I am dissatisfied, then, with the economic package prepared in connection with enlargement."
"I am dissatisfied with the statement that it must not cost anything."
"I am dissatisfied with the fact that the candidate countries must go through a transitional phase of ten years before they feel they are participating fully in the economic area, when it is also ourselves who are laying down transitional conditions and not allowing the principle of freedom of movement for the labour force to apply to the candidate countries on the same footing as it applies to other countries."
"When considerations of this kind become apparent to those people who, in due course, must vote on whether or not the candidate countries are to become members of the EU, then I fear we shall have problems."
"I would therefore call for an extra effort to be made in the last phase to alter all this about its not having to cost anything."
"I agree completely with Mrs Schroedter from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance when she said that we are probably talking about the biggest peace project of our lifetime."
"Must it really rest upon its not having to cost anything?"
"Are those of us in this cooperative venture really so small-minded that we believe that the greatest peace project of our lifetime must not cost anything?"
"I should very much like to be involved in campaigning for the rich Member States to be required to pay for the project, and that also applies to my own country."
"Denmark must naturally be willing to pay."
"Saying that it must not cost anything is tantamount to not wishing wholeheartedly to get this mammoth project under way."
"Mr President, the EU Convention comes at a very important moment in the life of the European Union."
"The Laeken Declaration made clear both the extent of the achievements of the European Union over the past 45 years and the scale of the challenges which it now faces."
"The debate we are holding here today relates to the enlargement of the European Union."
"The enthusiasm and determination of the candidate countries seeking to join the EU provide the clearest proof that the European Union is an enormous success story."
"I very much welcome the participation of representatives from the parliaments of the applicant countries in the Convention and look forward to the fresh insight they will bring to its workings."
"Institutional reform goes hand-in-hand with the enlargement of the European Union."
"The regulations and directives enacted through the three decision-making procedures in Europe must be streamlined and simplified."
"The Göteborg European Council decided that those applicant countries which are ready to join the European Union may complete accession negotiations by the end of this year."
"The goal of admitting new members into the European Union by 2004 is still a very ambitious one, but it is not a pipe dream."
"The enlargement of the Union is the number one policy priority of all key European Union legislators."
"Our resolve and courage at these enlargement negotiations must match those which the candidate countries themselves are showing in enacting wide-ranging new laws as they prepare to join the European Union as full members."
"The Spanish Presidency is now dealing with the most difficult enlargement negotiations, notably agriculture, the structural funds and budgetary matters."
"I am confident that both sides can reach agreement on these chapters of the talks and reach a conclusion that is - and must be - fair and balanced."
"The applicant countries have made substantial progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria, with regard both to the transposition of legislation and to the implementation of new European regulations and directives covering a wide range of economic and social sectors."
"The significant advances made by the applicant countries in terms of enacting new EU legislation have certainly ensured that the enlargement negotiations can proceed at a stronger pace."
"Undoubtedly, substantial progress has been made in increasing the independence, transparency and efficiency of public administrations in the applicant countries, as well as in improving the operation of their legal systems."
"Efficient public administrations are necessary not only to enact new EU laws completely, but also to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used effectively."
"This year will undoubtedly be a decisive one for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe."
"This institution will work very closely with the Spanish and Danish presidencies of the Union to ensure that enlargement negotiations are a success."
"We will have to show the same determination as in the past in order to find constructive answers. I believe that this House has the goodwill and determination to do just that."
"Mr President, I should like to warn against our treating the new candidate countries as second-class applicants."
"In the Convention, the national parliaments met and appointed their two representatives in the Bureau, without the representatives from the candidate countries being called at all."
"On 25 February, I submitted a proposal to the effect that the candidate countries should themselves be able to elect two representatives to the Bureau."
"The proposal was neither circulated nor debated."
"The Bureau has held its first meetings without the new countries being represented."
"The latter must naturally have completely equal rights and also be entitled to have material interpreted in their own languages."
"This weekend, the prime ministers are meeting in Barcelona."
"The large countries are attacking the equal rights enshrined in the rotating presidencies."
"There is the risk of a situation in which the EU is run on an intergovernmental basis by representatives of large countries who, in that way, act together supranationally in relation to the smaller countries."
"That is how I interpret Mr Solana's discussion paper for the Summit."
"It is a variant which the EU's critics should not be alone in criticising."
"The proposals are also a sign to the candidate countries that they can certainly join us but not on an equal footing."
"The Commission's proposal on agriculture also operates with two classes of Member State."
"It would be cheaper and more sensible to phase out price support in the EU before enlargement and to provide the candidate countries and our own farmers with compensation."
"Signalling different treatment is wrong and deeply damaging."
"It is also the Nice Summit's decision to give the Czech Republic and Hungary two fewer places in the European Parliament than are allocated to EU countries with fewer inhabitants."
"I wish once again to call upon the Commission to publish the so-called screening reports concerning how far the candidate countries have got with introducing our legislation."
"That is information which belongs to the people, both in our own and the candidate countries."
"In this case, it is everyone who is being discriminated against."
"Debates concerning legislation should be fully open, as they are in all the parliaments, and the people of the candidate countries must also be able to monitor the phasing out of their own laws."
"Mr Solana's new discussion paper should have been submitted directly to ourselves, as I requested. Instead, I now hear about it through leaks."
"Let us put an end to this secretiveness and take the Commission to the Court of Justice if it does not hand over the screening reports."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to make reference to the general speech by our group's Chairman and seize on a few, perhaps just small, details."
"Although we have to keep an impartial view of all applicant countries, this must not mean that the various decisions they made prior to accession negotiations or their special circumstances arising from their natural resources or history should be completely ignored."
"I am mainly alluding to the situation regarding Estonia, which is close to Finland."
"It is unreasonable that the Union is demanding that the country's bituminous shale-based production of electric energy, which is unable to compete in a freely competitive market, should swiftly become the object of free competition, while, at the same time, France, and to some extent Germany also, are still, after fifty years, obstructing the liberalisation of their own energy markets."
"Fortunately for it, Estonia is still not even part of the European electrical network."
"The other special feature of Estonia concerns its milk quotas, which the Union wishes to fix at a basic level equal to that of the start of the last decade, when Estonia - rightly or wrongly - decreased its production. Thus, present volumes of production - very important for Estonia's countryside, which is still dependent on agriculture - will not fit within the framework of the quota."
"It is these sorts of decisions that will, however, determine the attitude of the farming population and the people of East Estonia to EU membership in the referendum."
"The question of Kaliningrad always comes up as a key issue in any talk about enlargement, the northern dimension and our relationship with Russia."
"I am a very strong supporter of Russian cooperation, but I am very pleased to hear Commissioner Verheugen remind us that Kaliningrad is a part of Russia, and that there can be no special negotiations on it with regard to enlargement."
"Russia is also mainly responsible for proposals on cooperation and participation in financing."
"Neither is Kaliningrad - and this is something I want to stress - a crucial element in the problems and opportunities of the northern dimension, which lie elsewhere."
"They are in Murmansk, in the St Petersburg region: close to the Finnish border."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, in this debate on enlargement I should like to emphasise an aspect which is not part of the negotiations as such, but which will be very significant for the success of the new accessions."
"I wish to talk about the statements which are made from time to time - and too often for my liking - by the leaders of candidate countries, political declarations which emphasise the bilateral conflicts between neighbouring countries in Central Europe, countries which today aspire to join the European Union."
"For example, I am thinking of a subject which you yourself addressed, Commissioner: the recent virulent comments made by the Hungarian Prime Minister on the Bene Decrees, which were followed by the sharp riposte of the Slovak Prime Minister, his Czech counterpart and the President of the Czech Parliament."
"The result of this controversy was the postponement of the Vi?egrad summit, during which four countries - Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak Republics - had intended to coordinate their positions for the final phase of the negotiations, which would have been extremely useful."
"I am not going to express an opinion here on the Bene? issue itself."
"In any case, you have already done so, Commissioner, and very well too."
"For my part, however, I deeply regret the climate of mutual mistrust of which this controversy is symptomatic."
"Similarly, the persistence of the excessively nationalist leanings of certain leaders and the general public in the candidate countries is something which we can only contemplate with fear."
"Of course we can understand their terrific thirst for freedom and independence after so many years of oppression."
"Having become well acquainted with these countries myself just after the fall of communism and the break-up of the Soviet Union, I think that I am quite well placed to know and understand how the people there are feeling and why they are reacting in this way."
"But, for pity's sake, accession to the European Union does not require them to forget the past, but to be able to transcend it."
"I have often regretted the fact that the accession negotiations are based solely on the Copenhagen criteria, that is, on criteria which are objective, admittedly, but which are essentially materialist."
"Psychological political criteria - states of mind, attitudes, private reservations - which are obviously difficult to measure, hardly play any part at all, as you have often reminded us, Commissioner."
"However - and I say this in a spirit of friendship and out of the high regard that I have for the candidate countries - their accession to the Union, which we are hoping, preparing and waiting for, has to take place in a climate of confidence, with the very strong desire to live together, and not in a climate of distrust and even suspicion."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank the Council and the Commission for their work, and I hope that, despite the political hurdles which will no doubt appear, the negotiations in Copenhagen will nonetheless be successfully concluded."
"We then come, however, to the next phase, namely the people's support of the project by means of referendums and, in that connection, I should like to address one aspect which covers half of the population, namely women."
"There is no doubt - and the Commissioners have also assured us of this - that the Community acquis must be implemented."
"However, there is a difference between theory and practice, and the reality is of course that the situation of women in the candidate countries has not been improved following the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"I must therefore ask whether, in the Commission's and the Council's work, there is anything at all that ensures that there are opportunities for strengthening the position of women in the countries concerned."
"If there is not, we may have a problem with the referendums; we may have a problem with female representation at the elections to Parliament; and we may have a problem with female representation in the public administration."
"I would therefore ask the Commission and the Council to answer the question of whether special initiatives are being taken with regard to women in the countries concerned."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is my personal belief, and one I share with my party and my group, that there can be no going back on enlargement towards the East."
"There is a historical basis for that view, but we should not forget that a commitment on our part is called for too. We have just heard a reference to Kaliningrad."
"At present it is part of Russia, but it was the birthplace of no less a figure than Kant, one of the thinkers who laid the foundations for modern Europe. We should also remember that the Ukraine is as European as Poland."
"There is a region known as Galicia in Spain, but there is another Galicia in Central Europe with Krakow as its capital. That region boasts a long history and is at present partitioned between Poland and the Ukraine."
"It should also be borne in mind that if Turkey joins, Europe will spill over into Asia."
"All the problems and political uncertainties related to this process must be taken into account. We are contemplating a Union with a population of 500 million and 28 Member States at the last count, if the Balkan countries do not join."
"Such a Union will need European institutions that are both more tolerant of diversity and stronger. The issue of the type of constitution we should seek also arises."
"Regarding economic uncertainties, it has been claimed that after 2006 the European budget could be maintained with 1.27% of European GDP."
"That is impossible in my view, if we wish to maintain the Structural Funds and European policies, notably the employment policy."
"We only have to recall the German experience."
"Differences between East and West still exist, despite the tremendous effort made."
"It is also important to respond to concerns regarding the environment, transport, and even the impact on this House."
"It is not clear whether the Treaty of Nice will have been superseded by the time the new Members join, but it provides for 732 Members of the European Parliament."
"What kind of enlargement will it be? Will ten countries be joining or not?"
"I think these questions deserve careful consideration."
"Finally, I believe the issue of eastwards enlargement should lead us to reflect on the kind of Europe we are aiming for."
"A more diverse Europe should in the future be a world power working for peace and solidarity."
"By its very nature, it cannot be a militaristic power like the United States."
"All these thoughts should be aired in the House. We must avoid focusing on minor difficulties arising, because we have many major problems to deal with."
"Mr President, although the EU has already gone through several processes of enlargement in its fifty-year history, there has never been such inequality as in the present round."
"The acceptance of new members is not actually taking place on the consistent basis of equality and solidarity."
"I find the debate on the Czech Republic intolerable."
"Anyone who wants to examine the so-called Bene? decrees and raises issues of property cannot leave out of consideration the character in international law of the two-plus-four process involved in the union of the two German states."
"Anyone who wants Russia on their side, wherever they may be, had better not make any false moves over Kaliningrad."
"As seen from Brussels, the accession process is more than a one-way street; that is something that Mr Schulz addressed."
"Accession is meant to cost as little as possible even though the candidates are bound to the unconditional acceptance of obligations and payments in advance."
"The opening-up of markets is already turning out to mean good business for business groups, banks and insurers."
"Demonstrably better support was given when other countries joined - Spain being one of them."
"The candidates from Central and Eastern Europe have, on average, reached not even half the gross domestic product of the European Union, and the three Baltic States have only managed one-third."
"The level of production in some of these States is lower today than it was in 1990, which indicates that the preparatory payments have not been much use."
"What is required is the reshaping of the structural and cohesion policies to ensure that, in both present and future Member States, the less developed regions in general, and the border regions in particular, will receive appropriate support."
"We therefore need concepts that really will convince citizens of the candidate states that entering the EU is the right step for them to take, and one that will be to their benefit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to bring to your attention a matter which is far from unimportant and is closely connected with the enlargement of the Union. It is the matter of the protection of human health, which has always been a primary objective in all the development policies of the countries of the European Union."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam, in fact, lays down that a high level of health protection is guaranteed in the drawing-up and implementation of all Community policies and activities."
"To this end, we are making every effort to ensure that the citizens' health is protected by means of a common, efficient, high-quality health system, as proposed by the Community Action Plan for Public Health 2001-2006."
"Given that to achieve such objectives we need to develop specific policies aimed at ensuring the ongoing improvement of professionalism and scientific research in the health structures of the European Union Member States, and given that the current status of the health structures - and health policies - in the candidate countries for enlargement is clearly backward compared with the situation in the European Union, I believe we should urgently take steps, by means of studies or simulations within the Member States, to identify the possible consequences of the enlargement of the Union on public health."
"Furthermore, we should verify that the Community acquis on health has been effectively adopted in the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and we must take into consideration control measures to prevent the entry of the candidate countries from leading to a fall in standards of health care in the countries of the Union, in view also of the recognised shortage of medical and nursing staff."
"Mr President, this debate contains one overall message, namely that membership of the European Union constitutes something along the lines of maximum political good fortune for the Member States and for the EU as a whole."
"I wish that assumption were correct, but I am unfortunately convinced that the message of the EU project will reveal itself to be a huge and fearful illusion. Wishful thinking is an obstacle to anything approaching sober realism."
"A number of problems have been mentioned, but these are not the crucial ones."
"There are the politically inflammatory problems with the Bene?"
"Decrees, there is the Cyprus question and there is the economy with the unsolved problems of agriculture and the Structural Funds and so forth. Then there are the set of problems concerning the budget and the fear that the candidate countries will be treated as second class Member States."
"However, the crucial and fundamental problems are not of course of a political and economic nature. The crucial problems arise from the fact that the process in relation to the candidate countries from Eastern Europe entails a huge transformation."
"It is about producing the legal framework for a transformation process of historic dimensions."
"Moreover, these legal problems, which may be difficult enough, of course conceal the democratic problems."
"The basis for the latest Copenhagen criterion is that a public administration should be brought about which effectively and correctly administers, applies and implements Community legislation."
"There is no information in the existing reports concerning this huge problem."
"And even if an effective legal administration, able to implement the transformation, is obtained, it will be democratically compromising, for how are the people to be involved in this process?"
"The moment of truth is approaching."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, your speeches have naturally struck home with me as well, especially the idea that we are now on the road to enlarging European rule of law to include more countries. As a result, European peace can ensue in States that know their responsibilities."
"A 'European-style' peace."
"I also have a great deal of faith in the policy of the Commissioner during the negotiations. I support his underlying principles."
"I also welcome the fact that he keeps the pressure on until the last minute, until October, and that it is not a foregone conclusion that ten countries will be joining."
"Their accession remains conditional."
"I should like to ask a specific question concerning the costs that enlargement entails."
"A few other MEPs have already mentioned this topic, and we have also discussed it with the Commissioner within the framework of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy."
"Regarding the costs of enlargement, I believe the Commissioner completely when he states in this respect that these will, in fact, not exceed our set budget."
"We have cut costs to ensure that enlargement becomes possible within the budget."
"Despite this, we hear all kinds of conflicting stories in the various Member States, depending on whether it is in their interest to turn this into an issue."
"A moment ago, I heard Italy being mentioned. I also have to include my own country, my own government, which states that the additional costs could be enormous."
"The Secretary of State for European Affairs made a cryptic statement that this could well cost the Netherlands anything between 0 to 1 billion."
"This proves that a) he has a conscience and b) he is also a campaign leader."
"Commissioner, I think it would be extremely useful if another authoritative analysis were issued of these calculations which are being drafted in the Member States and which give a completely different picture from that of the Commission."
"Surely this can be done independently, and I also think it is important for our people to be able to distinguish between the truth and accuracy on the one hand and unfounded nightmares on the other."
"Added to this, of course, is the fact that we have created our own problems by not reforming our own agricultural policy in time."
"We have simply not done our homework, but have saddled those other countries with these tasks instead - which they are implementing - and we complain in the meantime."
"Mr President, I have to say that I am also delighted with the statements made by the Commissioner with regard to the Bene? Decrees."
"We are all very busy working on them, and I have also noticed that in the Netherlands, associations, for example, are reporting claims in connection with Poland, among others."
"I would very much appreciate it if the Commission and the Council were to clarify which claims, with a reference to Copenhagen, would be viable and which would not be."
"In my view, clarity in this connection is crucial in order to keep our population in the positive frame of mind with regard to enlargement."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I am very grateful to the two introductory speakers for their references to the great vision and also to the problems that remain to be solved."
"There are still a number of stumbling blocks that we have to remove, and not all the forces in the Member States, or in the candidate countries - to whom reference has already been made - have been very helpful in this."
"The discussion of the Bene? decrees is certainly one of the stumbling blocks."
"Historians certainly judge these decrees in different ways, but I am obliged to the Commissioner for pointing out that the only issue of relevance to accession is that of whether they still to this day have discriminatory effects, that is, whether the legal systems contain provisions that go against the acquis communautaire and are still of relevance to negotiations today."
"Provisions of this nature must be removed along with their effects;"
"I am very glad that this is something on which the Czech and Slovak governments now agree."
"We will not be helped to build a new Europe either by revising the Bene? decrees or by cementing them into the EU's treaties."
"Rather than getting bogged down in nationalistic squabbles, we should not lose sight of the vision of a great Europe."
"The 2004-2005 enlargement round will be the cause of much satisfaction in many of the candidate countries, but there will be disappointment in those that remain outside."
"It is worth considering whether we ought to give these countries not only greater financial help with the implementation of their reforms, but also a realistic - and I emphasise realistic - provisional date for their accession, subject to their making progress in the relevant areas."
"There is great fear, particularly on the part of Romania and Bulgaria, of being put on the shelf."
"Consideration will have to be given at the same time to adding new countries to the list of candidates, and I am at present thinking only of Croatia."
"With Turkey, on the other hand, we have to consider how to grant what it has asked for, describing this as a compensation for its help with the Cyprus issue, help that has, though, not yet made itself clearly visible."
"Here, too, it must be clear that a date for the beginning of negotiations with Turkey cannot be named in isolation from fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria."
"In light of the fact that the borders of a future Europe will become ever more visible, we must also, I believe, even now slowly start thinking about how even closer political and organisational ties can be forged with those states that I believe will remain outside the European Union - Russia, for example, or many of the Mediterranean states."
"For Europe does not consist of the European Union alone; there are other states with which we want to build up new and strong cooperation, with potential for the future, in order to maintain a strong European Union."
"Mr President, when, on 9 November 1989, we stood in front of our television sets and saw people, intoxicated by the spirit of democracy, hurling themselves over the Berlin Wall, we all felt the pulse of history."
"The very same night saw the beginning of the enlargement process, or the reunification of Europe, as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party prefers to call it."
"We now stand on the threshold of creating a unified Europe, an EU for the whole continent."
"It is, of course, nothing less than an historic sensation."
"Now, however, we must move on a stage from merely engaging in rhetoric, whereupon it becomes a question of hard facts: money, agriculture and ancient border conflicts."
"Who said that it would be simple?"
"Who believed that it would not cost anything?"
"Who believed that we should not have to make sacrifices?"
"Certainly, enlargement has a price, but it is worth it."
"Obviously, there are still a lot of problems to be solved, but we must not drown in details."
"2002 is an incredibly important year for enlargement, but it is also a year with elections in six Member States and three candidate countries."
"The European issues will become important, but there is a very great risk of domestic political considerations overshadowing enlargement and the European issues."
"That is why vigorous European leadership and action by the Commission is required to force the pace during these crucial months."
"2002 must not be a lost year."
"Enlargement must not be delayed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen's statements on the Bene? decrees, which I expressly welcome, mark a noteworthy change in the Commission's attitude."
"Many initiatives, Commissioner, saw these issues as bilateral in nature and not to be put in the context of negotiations on European enlargement;"
"I expressly welcome the way you have now abandoned this manifestly untenable position and I praise you for it."
"You obviously did this influenced by the public debate sparked by Mr Zeman, who, this House should note, has presumed to advise the Israelis to do with the Palestinians what the Czechs did with the Hungarians and Sudeten Germans after the last World War - which I consider to be the most monstrous thing he has said."
"Such an attitude of mind has, though, no place in the European Union, and so, Mr Verheugen, I expressly welcome the way you have put discussion of these decrees into the context of the European legal order, recognising the political and moral issues involved, which go against the EU's legal order, and which are indeed obsolete, being incapable of having any future legal effect within the EU, and that what matters now is to make it our concern, in a spirit of good neighbourliness, that they do not constitute obstacles on the road to enlargement."
"Questions therefore arise and demand to be answered."
"If the decrees have indeed lapsed, as the Czech government maintains, why were they not unambiguously annulled?"
"If, though, they have not lapsed, and can still be employed in practice, indications of which are unfortunately numerous, how, then, can they be reconciled with the European legal order?"
"And the pre-eminent fundamental question is that of what line the Czech government takes, not only on excesses but with the expulsion of entire ethnic groups as such, that is, on what we have unfortunately learned to call ethnic cleansing."
"That the Foreign Affairs Committee intends henceforth to set in motion investigations by experts is therefore to be welcomed to an extraordinary degree, as these issues affect not only the EU's conception of itself as a community based on law, but also the foundations on which the EU enterprise rests."
"These issues must be clarified before we can actually complete enlargement successfully."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the European Union is an endeavour - an endeavour for 500 million people on this continent, people in the EU's fifteen Member States, but also in the countries that want to join them in it."
"In contrast to what you have said, Mr Verheugen, it is not an effort that we have to make now and which we can no longer get out of, but an endeavour that we want to engage in because we want to create a future Europe that will be a community of solidarity in that future generations can work in peace with one another and with economic success on sound social foundations and under optimum conditions from the point of view of the environment."
"Such an endeavour must be worth something to us - not only in terms of what we ourselves, or politicians, put into it, not only in terms of drumming up people's support, but also in terms of figures in black and white, by which the project must be backed up; it means that we also, of course, have to give thought to how we can set out, including in financial terms, the individual steps that must be taken. That is not just a fear on the part of the public, but an important issue."
"As a householder myself, I, naturally, pay a great deal of attention to that."
"We have just heard that we will be able to cope with all that within the framework of the Perspective that was adopted in Berlin in 1999."
"All of what the Commission has presented will indeed last us until 2006."
"There are though, a few things in all these columns of figures that we need to discuss."
"Mr Verheugen referred to one of them himself."
"It is expecting too much of the new countries who will be added that they should be net contributors from the very outset."
"You cannot demand that countries whose gross domestic product is certified as being only 50% of that of the existing Member States, that they should start out as net contributors, for the precise reason that payments have to be effected directly, whilst repayments would be made only after a period of time had elapsed."
"In this financial perspective, we have described pre-accession aid packages that, in the first instance at any rate, worked on the assumption that new countries would be added with immediate effect from 2002."
"However, they have not been, but, spread over the years, the EUR 3 billion remain the same."
"If ten countries actually are added in 2004, the EUR 3 billion left over would be for two countries, Bulgaria and Romania."
"We will have to discuss what is actually meant by this and how it has to be implemented."
"Finally, we must think about how things are to go on after 2006, for you cannot simply say that this will be enough until 2006, and that we will just carry on after that date."
"You mentioned that the Structural Fund and the Agricultural Policy are in the ratio of 75:25."
"In our current Budget, the ration is 45:35, in favour, let it be noted, of the Agricultural Policy."
"We cannot make such massive changes to it that it will be as you have just said by that date."
"What this means is that we must discuss in precise terms how we go on from here."
"We will monitor that during the Budget very constructively, but with a highly critical eye."
"Mr President-in-Office, this morning you introduced this topic for us."
"With all respect for you and your office, I have a request to make."
"In the whole of your speech, you did not once mention Parliament as being a fellow-player in connection with these enlargement negotiations."
"We are legislators on the Budget every bit as much as the Council."
"It would be good if the way you conduct business were to take us into account."
"Mr President, we have made a considerable number of requests of the candidate countries - we have set a whole series of criteria - but from time to time it is good to reflect on our duties, and I should like to mention three of these."
"First of all we need to ensure that the public understands what is at stake."
"Here it seems to me that there is a lack of information in our countries."
"Secondly, we need to rethink cohesion policy, taking into account the points mentioned by the Commission in its second report."
"But we should have one priority: to bring the costs of enlargement under control."
"Finally, we need to reflect on the issue of federalism and democracy in an enlarged European Union."
"It is true that this is what the Convention is now doing on a daily basis. Nevertheless, it remains the key problem: we need more democracy in Europe."
"Mr President, I have listened very carefully to what the President-in-Office and the Commission had to say to us."
"I have two questions to ask."
"I still fail to understand what you intend to do about Bulgaria and Romania."
"Perhaps you are taking a step forward, but I fail to understand how and I totally fail to understand what our longer-term objectives are for the rest of the Balkans, where the decisions which we have taken so far are creating a black hole at the heart of Europe."
"My second question, Mr President-in-Office, is this: I am an optimist and I believe that the first accession agreements will soon be signed."
"Have we considered the fact that the candidate countries, which by then will be members, will need to learn to work within the European Parliament and, as in the past, their parliaments will need to send representatives to Parliament in Strasbourg and Brussels until such time as European elections are held?"
"Have we made the necessary financial and technical arrangements?"
"I think we should because this is something which has to be done and it is an extremely positive message which we can send the candidate countries right now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Foreign Affairs Committee has commissioned a legal opinion on the issue of the Bene? Decrees."
"This greatly gladdens my heart."
"I see them as not only a bilateral problem; they continue to be applicable in law, and the question therefore arises of whether they are compatible with Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Previous progress reports have, unfortunately, had not a word to say about this."
"Commissioner Verheugen has given it as his opinion that the Bene? Decrees are not merely a legal problem but a political and moral one."
"The ethnic cleansings and expulsions in the most recent wars in the Balkans have without doubt revealed a European dimension."
"What is at the heart of the Bene?"
"Decrees is no different. The international jurist Felix Ermacora came to the conclusion, in a legal opinion on the Bene?"
"Decrees, as recently as 1992 that they were incompatible with current international law, thus indicating that they cannot be reconciled with EU law either."
"It is with real excitement that I await the outcome of this opinion and the reaction of the Commission and the Council to it."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a process of such historical significance as enlargement can only be approached on the basis of broad consensus."
"I should like to emphasise that it is essential to arrive at financial consensus."
"In recent years, the European Union has operated by means of a multiannual agreement as expressed in the so-called financial perspective. This consensual system has resulted in two key achievements."
"Members must also be aware of the major difficulties anticipated in connection with drawing up a new financial perspective valid until 2013. By that time, the House will have welcomed new honourable Members and the new Member States will be present in the Council."
"The impact of a reformed agricultural policy is one of the variables the new financial consensus will need to take into account. Others will be actual convergence in the areas classed as Objective 1 at the time, and the statistical effect will have an impact on that."
"Then there is the absorption capacity as far as new Member States are concerned. It will even be necessary to come to a new decision on own resources and the maximum ceiling, currently 1.24%."
"It might therefore be wise to delay negotiation of a new financial perspective until it is possible to ensure complete consensus between the parties."
"If the present financial framework can cope with enlargement, it should perhaps be retained until an overall assessment of the new financial situation is available."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt about it, agriculture is at present certainly one of the most difficult chapters to negotiate in the enlargement process."
"I would therefore like to preface my remarks by saying that there may not be, and there will not be, a link between reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and these countries joining, nor a composite measure to that effect, even though there are those who would like to see such things."
"The one must be dealt with separately from the other, although that does not mean that there is not a whole range of requirements and rules to be complied with by both sides."
"First of all, there is the need to guarantee the full transposition of the acquis communautaire, especially with regard to the veterinary and plant-health sectors, quality standards for food safety and adherence to the regulations on the protection of animals."
"There is no dispute that there will, in some sectors, be transitional rules with time limits, but they will be few and far between."
"Furthermore, the Sapard programme, conceived as pre-accession aid, must at last be fully implemented, as what has been done hitherto has been unsatisfactory."
"We also support the Commission proposals for direct payments to the new Member States to start by being made gradually and in a form related to area rather than to production following their accession and for rural development programmes independent of production to be markedly topped up with resources, in order to avoid social dumping, among other things, in countries such as Poland."
"Agriculture and rural development still play a central role in these countries and will continue to do so for a long time to come."
"Not only there, either, might I add!"
"Support, across the whole of the EU, must be given on the basis of multifunctional agriculture in all its many facets, thus further strengthening the second pillar, not only with regard to the WTO negotiations."
"I would like again to make it clear that the idea of solidarity, by which our Community is governed and characterised, must be neither eroded nor done away with."
"This does not mean, though, that the Common Agricultural Policy was not in need of reform, both in our own states and in the candidate countries, whether enlargement took place or not."
"Any of the farmers' representatives who believes that no reform of the CAP is needed is, by his attitude, doing nothing more than accelerating the downfall of rural agriculture, the maintenance of which he constantly and stridently demands."
"Let me turn to the Presidency of the Council and say that it is perhaps dawning on some of us that, in the 1999 negotiations on Agenda 2000, it might sometimes have made more sense to think along slightly less national and rather more European lines."
"Is it not so, Mr President-in-Office, that there can and will be no more inherited farms?"
"As a Parliament, we want Europe to be enlarged and hence reunited, and I am certain that Commissioners Fischler and Verheugen will see to it that this does not fall at the hurdle of the agriculture chapter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, right at the beginning of my contribution to the debate, I would like to remind you that Parliament will not only have to approve the enlargement treaties with each country in turn, but also, in exactly the same way, the relevant transfers of funds in accordance with Article 25 of the interinstitutional agreement, with an absolute majority of members and three-quarters of the votes cast, and so it is a good thing that both the Commission and the Council have involved Parliament in the negotiations from an early stage."
"So what are we doing now?"
"For a start, toiling through the mid-term review, as decided on in Berlin under the German Presidency of the Council."
"Secondly, setting in motion a further development of Community policies for the post-2006 period, ever bearing in mind that eastward enlargement and the world trade round are running in parallel. Let me say loud and clear that over-ambition will endanger the timetable for enlargement."
"I would also like to make it clear that I consider the current Commission proposals, for example in the area of agricultural policy, to represent a responsible approach to budgeting."
"We certainly also have to discuss, in the area of structural policies, how we can develop plans for adapting the Structural Funds."
"I will go on record as agreeing with Mr Walter."
"We will also have to discuss this if we have special provisions for the Cohesion Fund."
"Would these apply up to 2006 or would they be laid down for a further period from 2006 onwards?"
"The devil is trying to hide in the detail here."
"Let us not deceive ourselves; we will also have to ask whether the deficient implementation of pre-accession aid to date is the litmus test for the candidates' ability to transpose regulations and their suitability for accession, or whether we have ourselves complicated matters to such an extent that nobody can cope any more."
"So I hope that the Convention comes up with the conclusive results that we will need on the institutions' capacity for action, and on the concentration of competences. Let me add that I personally have doubts as to whether what we are currently discussing in relation to capacity for action and the rules governing languages will really be the final solution."
"Above all, there is one thing we must pay attention to: We need solutions that are capable of gaining a majority, that will not only be adopted in parliamentary bodies, but will meet with public approval in both the old and the new Member States of the EU."
"With that in mind, let us go to work together!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been said that this is an inevitable, unstoppable process, but it is a process that must be kept under control."
"We must recognise the efforts of these countries but, at the same time, we must also ask ourselves some questions about the more sensitive aspects of this process."
"As has already been said, Bulgaria and Romania are countries that have been left behind and form part of an area - the Balkans - that in itself is a critical area historically, let us remember, an area that sparked off disasters during the last century."
"What do you intend to do, Mr Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to speed up the process of integration and approximation of the Balkans to the Union?"
"The second point I should like to make concerns relations with the Mediterranean countries."
"There is a kind of double vision in this House: on the one hand, two hours ago we all applauded the initiative that our President proposed, seeking to adopt a different, more participatory approach to the Palestine peace process; on the other hand, after Barcelona, our Mediterranean policies are practically dead."
"How can one think of holding an effective dialogue if one is unable to understand that it is also possible to further peace through practical forms of aid?"
"Then there is the matter of public opinion."
"I was pleased to hear that we will be getting a coherent package as regards agricultural policies and Structural Fund policies."
"Public opinion is distrustful of the enlargement process, especially inside the countries of the Union."
"Of course, some people are more sensitive and others less, but all in all there is distrust in all the Member States."
"I believe that, from this perspective, answers need to be forthcoming."
"A final point: languages."
"Here I support everything Mr Böge has just said."
"I believe we must retain the principle of multilingualism."
"With continued enlargement, on the one hand we are taking up an historical challenge that we do not, of course, want to miss, but on the other we must also do what we can so that the identity of our cultures and our peoples is not lost."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my prepared statement by thanking Commissioner Verheugen for discussing the subject of the Bene? Decrees and thereby, as Parliament has already done in many resolutions, clearly pointing out that this issue very definitely possesses a European dimension."
"Commissioner, you were right to observe that problems of a legal, but also political and moral, nature have arisen and are certainly of relevance to the process of integration."
"I will now also expressly welcome and support the encouragement you have given in this House to the Czech Government and the Czech public to do everything possible to put a stop to such discriminatory effects in the legal field as may still result from these Bene? Decrees, and thus remove potential obstacles on the path to enlargement."
"I greatly regret the remarks by some Members to the effect that enlargement is inevitable."
"As if we were now to have to do everything in our power to move this process further forward, because it would otherwise be unstoppable!"
"This process is not only unstoppable, it is also explicitly desirable, and to be desired, moreover, with the utmost ardour!"
"In particular, enlargement incorporating the countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and those to the North, overcomes the historic burdens laid upon us by Yalta, at last overcoming the division of Europe, and benefiting us all, especially countries such as Austria and Germany, who will profit directly from the growing markets at their front door!"
"Mr President, the 45-year history of the European Parliament confirms the Communist Party of Greece's assertion that it was created in order to serve the interests of big business, not of the people, as many would have us believe."
"The workers of the European Union have seen their rights eroded or even abolished, especially over the last ten years."
"This applies to industrial relations, insurance rights, democratic liberties and wages."
"Unemployment, poverty and suppression are spreading."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises in town and country are being wiped out."
"Measures are being taken which bolster the increasingly autocratic powers of major economic interests."
"A Union is being constructed which, instead of opposing the barbarity of the United States, goes along or competes with it on a dangerous and absurd path, which may lead to the destruction of our very planet."
"The people of the candidate countries therefore have nothing positive to expect as regards their vital interests."
"Pre-accession relations have given them a bitter foretaste of what happens when companies are restructured, nationalised industries are snapped up by foreign capital, their important social rights are abolished and support is given to their local exploiters, often the Mafia, who are proving to be privileged partners of the European Union."
"That is why the Communist Party of Greece, in a spirit of solidarity with the people of the candidate countries, urges them to oppose this process."
"As far as Palestine is concerned, I should like to call on the European Union, here and now, to cut all funding to the regime of criminals in power in Israel and any supply lines to that regime, in order to put an end to the crime being perpetrated against the Palestinian people."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the honourable Members who took the floor."
"I listened carefully to what they had to say."
"Unfortunately, time does not allow me to reply to each of them individually, as I would have liked."
"I believe this has been a very useful exchange of views and ideas for all concerned. It demonstrates the cooperation that exists between the various European institutions, notable the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"I would however like to make some observations and I hope they will be relevant."
"As I see it, there is clear and overwhelming support for this great historical enterprise of enlargement."
"We have all but achieved a common front on this issue. In addition, there is universal awareness of the need to abide by the timetable we set ourselves to ensure that many of today's candidate countries can participate in the next elections to the European Parliament in 2004 and be represented in this House."
"The historical dimension of enlargement was mentioned, and rightly so."
"Enlargement is a political venture but also one with a historical dimension. It aims to reunite Europe for good, following the divisions that arose during the cold war and the balance of terror, when Europe was split into rival blocs."
"Nonetheless, it is true that this enlargement will probably not allow us to claim that we are topping off the building of Europe in a geographical sense."
"At present we are all thinking in terms of a maximum of 10 countries, and of concluding negotiations by the end of 2002. I shall come back to the question of the number of countries in a moment."
"We are working hard, but many difficulties and obstacles remain to be overcome."
"Several honourable Members referred earlier to the situation of Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, the Balkans and Ukraine."
"I should like to point out that when strong criticism of the present process of building Europe is voiced, there is a tendency to overlook the fact that the building of Europe and the whole political enterprise of creating the Union are an obvious success story. The Union began with six Member States."
"Nobody wants to be associated with failure or to join a poorly-run club. On the other hand, people generally queue up to join a well-run venture with proven success."
"Take the Balkans as an example."
"I shall refer to both the Eastern and the Western Balkans including Bulgaria and Romania."
"I said earlier, and Commissioner Verheugen endorsed my comments, that it is essential to send out very clear, strong and positive messages to Bulgaria and Romania. The aim is to open all the chapters with these countries in the coming few months, and to speed up negotiations for their future accession as much as possible."
"The European dimension has special significance for these countries, as indeed it did for Spain in the past."
"Where freedom, the consolidation of democracy, social justice, modernisation and economic progress were concerned, Europe always was a lodestar for Spain."
"The same is true for these countries. They have exactly the same right to integrate into the European Union as we had at the time."
"In due course the same will also be true of the Western Balkans."
"What are we offering these countries?"
"We are spreading a prospect out before them and offering them the opportunity of integration."
"We are enabling them to pursue the consolidation of democracy and internal reforms, because there is no feasible alternative to integration into Europe."
"This will be the best way of ensuring that conflicts do not arise. It should prevent a repeat of the war situation these countries experienced in the recent past."
"It is for this reason that the European Union is setting up Association and Stability Agreements with several of these countries within the framework of the Stability Pact."
"The time-scales vary from country to country, but it is our declared aim to ensure that all of them will in due course be in a position to apply for membership of the European Union."
"This therefore is the venture we are currently engaged in. You will appreciate the importance of getting things right at this stage."
"We must be serious, rigorous, disciplined and realistic."
"I listened carefully to the honourable Members who spoke of reconsidering the financial perspective and of how enlargement would not be achieved for free. It certainly will not."
"On the contrary, it will be provided for within the framework of the financial perspective we agreed. That is something quite different."
"Other speakers referred to the need to begin considering the reform of the common policies. They are quite right, of course."
"I would like to make the following quite clear, however. At this juncture, anyone who maintains that the debates on the financial perspective and on the reform of common policies should be interwoven with the accession negotiations has to realise that doing so would make it impossible to keep to the timetable for enlargement."
"Anyone in favour of enlargement and meeting the deadlines set must be aware that either we continue in the present vein or we shall fail."
"I believe there is full agreement between the Council and the Commission."
"I trust the same is true of Parliament."
"A broad consensus of this nature is essential if we are to meet the citizens' expectations."
"I should like to make one last observation which I think is also relevant."
"The European Union has demonstrated a clear political will concerning enlargement."
"That political will does not, however, imply that a political decision has been taken to close negotiations with ten candidates before the end of the year."
"The pace of negotiations must be maintained, and the candidate countries need to demonstrate their administrative and judicial capability. In essence, they must demonstrate their political capability regarding the transposition of the acquis into their legislation."
"Further, they must satisfy us that they are capable of complying with it. Things will go badly both for them and for the present Members if that is not the case."
"I trust that the same kind of clear political will shown by the European Union will also be shown by the candidate countries, and that they will therefore take the action required. Then, when the time is right, it will indeed be possible for us to take the political decision to close negotiations with ten countries in the first instance and with more in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Parliament most warmly for the wide-ranging support it has given the Presidency of the Council and the Commission in the enlargement process, and I consider it highly significant that this common purpose and cooperation are continuing."
"A couple of very short observations: Firstly, it seems to me that I again need to point out very clearly that we may not impose new conditions for enlargement, no matter how desirable it may be to push forward certain reforms within the policies and also within the structure of the European Union."
"Much as I understand the use people make of enlargement as an argument in favour of pressing on with these, I must equally warn against any form of composite measure, as that could be taken in the candidate countries only as a new and additional obstacle and would serve to confirm the candidates' existing suspicion that, whenever they approach the objective, we move it even further away."
"That is not on!"
"Nor do I at all understand what is the problem with the Convention, for example."
"Why is it that the present candidate countries should not, as new members, already play a full part with equal rights?"
"Those who think they would be incapable of doing so are deluding themselves."
"Let me deliver a forceful warning against the conception that we even now have to put our silverware and valuable porcelain in a place of safety, before the grubby kids arrive from the East."
"Anyone who approaches enlargement in this way does not grasp the whole historic dimension of this problem."
"My second observation relates to finances."
"I am quite happy to be admonished by representatives of the budgetary authority, that the Commission should adhere to what the budgetary authority has prescribed."
"If you want us to spend more money, then by all means come to an agreement with the Council that more money should be made available."
"Until that happens, the Council will adhere strictly to the framework that we have received from the Council and from Parliament."
"I can tell you that that is quite sufficient."
"It would be quite absurd to make substantially more money available because of our being at the limit of what we can justify as allowable expenditure in the candidate countries."
"It is quite simply untrue that they are getting a worse deal than the present members."
"Measured by reference to their gross national product, those who will be our new members get substantially more aid from the European Budget than do the present cohesion Member States."
"It is, then, accurate to depict us as applying double standards only in as much as the candidate countries enjoy preferential treatment to some degree."
"They are not, though, neglected in any way."
"In response to Mr Oostlander's last remark, let me say that there are dozens of studies of this sort, some of which also come from the Netherlands, to the effect that the costs of enlargement would in fact be far higher than we have calculated."
"All these studies, including the Dutch ones, have one thing in common; they are based on political assumptions that are not going to become reality."
"They assume results from negotiations that do not exist, nor will they exist in the future."
"If, of course, we were to negotiate a requirement for the whole environmental acquis to be completed in the new Member States by 2005, that would cost EUR 130 billion, and that EUR 130 billion would have to be raised."
"We do not, though, negotiate like that."
"We negotiate in such a way that we remain within the bounds of what is financially possible, and we do not enter into financial commitments for the post-2006 period."
"I surely do not have to explain to Parliament that it is not even possible to negotiate in such a way as to produce financial commitments that Parliament and the budgetary authority have not covered."
"You would never adopt an enlargement treaty of that sort if it involved financial risks."
"Enlargement, though, puts us at no financial risk."
"I have my own hunches as to why, certain discussions have been launched in certain Member States and using certain documents."
"My position as a member of the European Commission does not, unfortunately, permit me to express my thoughts on the subject."
"I might perhaps be permitted to observe that the European Union's budget permits neither tax increases nor indebtedness, so that we really cannot budget more than the Member States make available to us as contributions, and perhaps every Minister of Finance in the European Union ought to be aware that that is the case."
"The discussion on the Bene? Decrees has encouraged me to continue with the Commission's cautious way of dealing with this issue."
"I would ask for all those who wish to participate in this discussion to do so with the utmost sensitivity and care."
"Not all the strident voices of recent times have helped us to get closer to the objective."
"I agree with all those who say that, beyond the subjects of the negotiations themselves, there are issues and problems that should be resolved before we come to any decisions, as we do not want to have to drag burdens from the past behind us on our way into our common European future."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the debate on the statement by the Council and the Commission on Transatlantic relations, including steel import tariffs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank this House for giving me the opportunity to speak, on behalf of the Council, on the current state of transatlantic relations."
"I believe this reveals Parliament's sensitivity with regard to the European Union's foreign policy and, moreover, it is a timely initiative in view of the events of recent months and the forthcoming Summit meeting between the European Union and the United States, the first since 11 September."
"The European Union and the United States are partners with a shared history that cannot be denied."
"I use this term not only to describe the longevity of this relationship but also as a graphic illustration of its importance and unique nature."
"The relationship between the European Union and the United States is based on strong and long-standing ties between our respective peoples and governments, and rests on fundamental values such as the respect for human rights, personal freedom, the rule of law, a democratic form of government and the system of free trade."
"Experience has shown on many occasions that, when the European Union and the United States act together in harmony, we can make a decisive contribution to generating a positive dynamic for world change, fostering the establishment of democratic regimes, seeking greater trade and investment opportunities, reducing poverty in less favoured societies, or overseeing environmental protection on a global scale."
"Going beyond our political and economic ties, the events of 11 September are a constant reminder of the value that both Europeans and Americans attach to the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for people's rights that shape our relations."
"By way of an introduction, I should like to remind you of the terms in which the Spanish Presidency expressed its priorities for its current six-month term with regard to transatlantic relations - and I shall quote directly here: '11 September has strengthened even further, if that is possible, the indissoluble nature of Europe's intended integration with the transatlantic relationship."
"Now is the time to remind the younger generations of Europeans that this prosperous and peaceful Europe that we know exists partly because of the generosity and solidarity of many Americans when, not so long ago, Europe was no more than a battlefield and, after that, a continent in ruins."
"Now it is our turn to show such solidarity."
"During its Presidency of the Union, Spain will push this vigorously'."
"Less than twenty-four hours after the odious attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September, the European Union expressed its total solidarity with the United States Government and the American people."
"On 20 September, the European Union and the United States committed themselves to work together within a broad coalition to combat the scourge of terrorism."
"We thus made a joint commitment to lead a hitherto unheard of cooperative effort on a global scale, aimed at eliminating the terrorist threat and its leaders, networks and organisations."
"This determination reflects the strength of our transatlantic relationship, our shared values and our determination to stand shoulder to shoulder against the challenges posed by fanaticism and intolerance."
"Together with the United States, we are committed to the security and well-being of our citizens, and we shall spare no effort to protect our societies from the terrorist threat."
"We shall keep a special watch to ensure that the freedom of the individual and the rule of law are always scrupulously upheld."
"The Presidency accords the highest priority to furthering this cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism, particularly with a view to European Union-United States Ministerial meeting that will take place in Madrid on 10 April and the EU-US Summit to be held in Washington on 2 May."
"We can be proud of the efforts that we and our American counterparts have made in this regard over the last few months, but satisfaction with what has been achieved must not distract us from the long road that still lies ahead."
"Since the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs which met in Santiago de Compostela on 14 February, there has been a consensus for the Presidency to ask the Council for a negotiation mandate to conclude an extradition agreement and a mutual legal assistance agreement on criminal matters, based on Articles 24 and 38 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The Presidency wants to present the Council with a draft mandate so that it can announce its decision on 25 April."
"We are aware that this mandate must be clear and flexible and must represent added value compared with the current situation, and it must of course comply with the limits laid down by the constitutions of the Member States and the procedural guarantees inherent in European values."
"International affairs are another fundamental element in the exchange of information and points of view that form part of transatlantic dialogue."
"This dialogue on CFSP matters seeks greater coordination of our positions on matters of great importance - including security and defence policy - and viable solutions to international conflicts."
"For example, amongst other issues, we have been and still are analysing the conflicts in Afghanistan and the Middle East every day, at various levels."
"Over the last fifty years, the European Union and the United States have helped create and develop the rules and institutions responsible for promoting peace and prosperity within many different international forums, including the United Nations, NATO, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation."
"For two generations the Europe-America link has ensured peace in our continent, and now, when Europe is closer than ever to achieving its dream of reunification, we bear the responsibility of maintaining and expanding our understanding with the United States, renewing our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder against the demands and challenges of the present day."
"Mr President, the European Union and the United States also share one of the most complex, rich and varied economic and trading relationships in the world."
"Trade between us is worth almost EUR 1 200 million every day, representing roughly 37% of world trade in commodities and 45% of trade in services."
"Direct investment by the European Union in the United States stands at approximately EUR 675 000 million."
"Three million jobs there depend directly on this investment, and one out of every twelve American workers is paid by a European company."
"I must emphatically point out that the vast majority of these trade and investment links are carried out openly and without any obstacles, and when this does not happen we prefer consultation and dialogue as the most suitable means of resolving our differences, in a constant and sometimes far from simple effort to find practical, swift and balanced solutions."
"The decision adopted at the WTO meeting of Ministers, held in Doha last November, to initiate negotiations for a new multilateral trade round is a clear example of the beneficial effects of European-American cooperation, which can overcome our divergent aims and interests for the sake of a greater common goal."
"At the same time, however, we must not be surprised if the complexity of our economic and trade relations causes disagreements and disputes, which, despite their relatively minor impact when compared with the total volume of trade, can sometimes take on considerable importance."
"Such disputes at times play a leading role and strongly influence the debates led by leading politicians and also the media."
"In contrast, few people remember our ability to reach compromises and solutions to past controversies."
"The banana conflict is one example I can mention, which remained with us for a long time until it was finally resolved quite recently."
"One of our objectives, therefore, is to provide a new, positive focus that can enhance and develop bilateral trade."
"This positive side of things is all too often overshadowed by the prominence accorded to disputes."
"The Presidency underlines the need to use the as yet untapped potential of commercial relations to transcend any process of crisis and confrontation and transform it into a process of cooperation."
"I am convinced that, in this way, we shall be able to address other ongoing disputes, such as those of the Foreign Sales Corporations or genetically modified organisms, or the more recent dispute on the trade in steel."
"On this point, I must specifically mention the appearance of this new disagreement with the United States, as a consequence of the decision announced on 5 March to impose safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products."
"The imposition of tariffs of up to 30%, depending on the case, reflects a worrying trend in the United States towards unilateral protectionist options that ruin the efforts that the European Union and other producing countries made in Paris under the auspices of the OECD."
"It is a very unfortunate precedent at these times, which are so important for the fate of the new multilateral trade round."
"All the Member States and the Council support the measures adopted by the Commission, and in particular the policy being implemented by Commissioner Lamy."
"I assure you that the Presidency takes this matter very seriously and, with regard to future developments, it will remain in close contact with the Commission and the Member States, determined to adopt appropriate measures whenever necessary to safeguard the interests of the Union."
"Mr President, it is understandable that Europeans and Americans sometimes have different views on major international issues, but that must not hold back our commitment to try to act together, and I shall give you an example that I think demonstrates this clearly: the Monterrey Conference."
"We managed to reach a consensus between the European Union and the United States, which all countries worldwide have also agreed to."
"I believe this is a good precedent and an incentive in the run-up to Johannesburg."
"This is not the case in the environmental field, however, where the European Union has just taken an important step forwards in ratifying the Kyoto Protocol at the last Council meeting of Ministers for the Environment only a few days ago, whereas the United States, with the adoption of the recent programme announced by President Bush, seems to be moving further away from this goal."
"Even in this case, however, when our positions seem so far apart, the Presidency believes in building bridges and, in the next few weeks, we shall be holding a high-level meeting within the working party set up at the Gothenburg transatlantic summit."
"Mr President, I will finish here."
"The opportunities that each of us has to influence the others' actions positively and for the benefit of all are by no means negligible, and the European Union, which is ever more European and ever more united, must fully accept its responsibility as the friend and ally of the United States."
"The Presidency will therefore do its utmost to ensure that our relations with the United States are fully developed and, together with the Member States and the Commission, it will spare no effort to make the summit planned for 2 May in Washington satisfy both sides' expectations."
"In this context, the contributions to be made today in this sitting of the European Parliament will be of fundamental importance, and I thank you for them in advance."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their comments this morning."
"I believe that we have reached one of those critical stages in the development of the transatlantic relationship in its global context."
"Firstly, looking at the overall relationship, it is quite clear - as our two speakers have said - that since 11 September 2001 we have seen a significant change in the way in which the Americans view their place in the world."
"We see an America under attack - one which we recognised on 12 September in this House, but which perhaps we now fail to recognise six months on."
"Secondly, we are in danger of seeing an unravelling of the security side of our relationship, where a political consensus underlying NATO cannot now be taken for granted for out-of-area responsibilities."
"We see the military gap widening and perhaps difficulties also in expanding NATO operations."
"Thirdly, the strong impetus that came with the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda now appears to be under threat because of a lack of political vision and, perhaps, frustration at the lack of results among many of the parties involved in the dialogues."
"On the specific case of steel, I can only welcome the comments made by the Commissioner in deploring the US decision."
"The Commission should take action to seek compensation, and look for legal means of taking retaliatory action."
"I would also add that it would be very unhelpful, as Mr Aldonas at the Department of Commerce in the United States has suggested, for the US to link this steel dispute to the wider issue of problems in the global economy."
"That surely is not the way to go."
"Fourthly, I come to what we might be able to do in the present context."
"It is indeed tempting to think of taking retaliatory action through tariffs."
"However, as The Times stated on 7 March, in Bush's folly, tariff walls would amount to an own goal."
"It would simply be a futile effort by the Americans to preserve unviable jobs in steel."
"Surely, therefore, we should be looking for a broader transatlantic partnership in which to define Europe's role and America's role and build on our common interests together."
"As regards NATO, that means ensuring that we can move NATO on to more global responsibilities."
"Furthermore, your meeting on 2 May at the EU/US Summit to update the New Transatlantic Agenda to meet new challenges must ensure that the political communities are properly involved."
"In conclusion, it is up to you to provide leadership."
"We must be tough and take the necessary action to protect our interests in this steel dispute, but also think of the broader context and form a vision of how the transatlantic partnership should look in the 21st century."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the framework for our transatlantic relations, I believe we have to start with the current framework, which is the Madrid Declaration of December 1995, issued under the Spanish Presidency."
"I do not recall that the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned this declaration, which defines our framework; I do not know whether that is because a Socialist government adopted it, but in any case, as it was the Presidency of the Union, I recommend that he should take it into account this May, and Mr Elles will not deny this since we worked together at the time for the Spanish Government to push this very important declaration through the Council."
"I really must say to the President-in-Office of the Council that I believe this declaration should be brought up to date, for various reasons."
"First, because of the situation since 11 September: we have not merely shown our solidarity with the United States, but we have also adopted measures."
"In this fight, however, as in all others - I must be frank about this - we are allies, but we have to work together on an equal footing, and our American allies - as some ministers in the Union have said - must understand that we are equals and subservience has no place here, which means that we must not systematically bow to unilateral decisions."
"This applies to many things."
"We have to act jointly in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the Balkans; it is to be hoped that the United States will reconsider their position on Kyoto and especially with regard to certain worrying announcements by the Bush Administration."
"With regard to the specific question of the steel issue, which the Commissioner, Mr Lamy, has developed further, we believe that we must adopt a firm stance and we also support taking reprisal measures."
"We do not understand why, for example, the United States trade representative, Mr Zoellick, is today developing the worldwide international conspiracy theory to say that the United States is being attacked through steel imports."
"The history of the European Union began with the Coal and Steel Community, which was a restructuring process."
"I understand that Mr Bush wants to win elections, but what the Americans have to do is restructure their steel industry, which will demand sacrifice, and we should not have to pay for the restructuring of American industry."
"We have to make this quite plain and, in addition, there are proposals such as applying a 2% surcharge so as to be able to restructure the industry."
"What does not make sense is that we should have to pay this, when in this Parliament we systematically have to deal with the banana war, hormones and GMOs, and we always have to check the list to see what reprisal measures we can take within the bounds of our own countries."
"Our American friends and allies have to understand that we cannot go on working like this, and we therefore call on the Commission to take the strongest line possible to make them see reason."
"Mr President, the announcement last week was bad enough."
"The comments from some US officials, including Mr Aldonas, that somehow protectionism is warranted to correct wider macroeconomic factors is potentially even worse."
"It displays a dangerous and economically illiterate philosophy that needs to be strongly rebuffed."
"The question is: how do we rebuff it?"
"Firstly, we need to ensure that we consolidate our friendships with those allies with whom we wish to act together against American unilateralism."
"And if there is one tactical concern my group has about brandishing safeguard measures against those steel exports that might be diverted from the US to Europe, it is that it might actually alienate countries such as Russia, India and Brazil, with whom we have to act together in the WTO and the OECD to take on this American move."
"Therefore, we would ask the Commission and, of course, the Council, as a matter of urgency to try and negotiate bilateral voluntary export restraint agreements with these countries, so as to avoid the diversion from steel going to America to Europe happening in the first place."
"The obvious danger if we do not achieve this is that we end up having spats with precisely the people we should be teaming up with against this American behaviour."
"The second point is this: let us not be squeamish; this decision was taken for domestic political reasons."
"It will only be reversed or limited if domestic political pressures dictate that should be the case."
"In order to do that, we need to brandish big sticks which are felt on the domestic US political scene."
"And conveniently enough, if inelegantly, we do have such a big stick, in the form of the measures we can take within the context of the foreign sales cooperation dispute."
"Of course, we do not wish to mix these things formally; but let us not be naive."
"The FSC dispute provides us with the best means by which to inflict the domestic pressure which is absolutely necessary in order to get some change in the American attitude and to reassert the international rule of law, rather than the rule of the law of George Bush's economic jungle."
"Mr President, needless to say, the fact that we are debating transatlantic relations today has everything to do with 11 September."
"But let there be no mistake: 11 September has accelerated a process that was started long before, namely the forging of a new alliance between the EU and the United States."
"Many structural causes play a role in this: the EU's stronger, enhanced role as an economic superpower, the end of the Cold War and, related to this, a shift in the role for the United States in Europe."
"The EU is no longer America's kid brother who is proud to walk in its shadow. But neither has the EU become, I hope, the adolescent who wishes to follow in the footsteps of its great example."
"The EU must carve its own role in a self-assured manner. The EU must not shy away from conflict, and should not be frightened to show that it disagrees with the United States if that is the case."
"Above all, the EU should not try to emulate the United States. Allow me to illustrate this with two examples."
"The first is the sharp increase in defence budgets by an amount which far outstrips the budgets of France and Great Britain put together."
"Does this mean that the European Union should increase its defence budgets accordingly?"
"Not in my view, because it is completely futile to try to bridge the difference in the belief that we will be a more credible partner if we do."
"It is up to the European Union to consider a credible mix of military means, but, above all, to consider matters which the European Union is good at: conflict prevention, crisis management and nation building."
"May I venture to quote American President Roosevelt who said: 'Let us speak softly, let them carry a big stick?"
"But the bearing of arms is also subject to restrictions, and these restrictions are exceeded in the US plans, which have now been leaked, concerning the use of nuclear weapons."
"It is unacceptable for the United States not to cut back the role of nuclear weapons, which is what we want, but instead they cast them in a new role in a new strategy, lower the threshold for their use and allow the line between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons to become blurred."
"This is a development against which the European Union should not be afraid to protest."
"The blurring of the line between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons is a dangerous development, and we all know that the threat of nuclear weapons would only hamper the search for solutions in Iraq or Iran, for example."
"It makes no sense whatsoever to use this threat, and we must not be frightened to say so."
"What is more, the French and British governments should be urged to clarify once and for all their stance on nuclear weapons."
"As far as my group is concerned, the answer is quite simple: nuclear weapons have no role to play in future European security policy."
"I should like to quote the Middle East as a final example."
"Needless to say, it is preferable to keep a diplomatic offensive together with the Americans. We should do this, but we should not wait for the United States."
"The European Union can play its own role not only diplomatically, but mainly economically."
"This will give us a unique opportunity to step up the pressure on both sides, and we are also committed to ensuring that our own human rights policy remains credible."
"Mr President, the European Union is an economic superpower which is trying to carve a role for itself in the world."
"We will succeed in this if we speak with one voice, if we do not shy away from open criticism of other superpowers and, above all, if we do not try to emulate the United States."
"The European Union is not a military superpower which can impose its wishes all over the world all by itself, and neither should we want this."
"Neither is the EU a naïve Maecenas, who pays up once the United States has done the dirty work."
"The United States should obviously be able to keep the peace in its own backyard, also militarily."
"Apart from this, we should mainly focus on what we are good at: to talk and talk again, to strike compromises and to pay up eventually."
"The EU needs the United States if things get out of hand, but the United States needs the EU to ensure that things do not get too out of hand."
"Mr President, I agree with much of the President-in-Office's statement, in particular about the need for a strategically positive relationship with the USA."
"However, I am also particularly grateful to Mr Lagendijk for identifying the key events so clearly."
"I do not think that it makes any sense to dub the problems in current relations with the USA as 'cowardice in the face of amity'."
"I believe that it is urgently necessary, indeed I would even say that it is of the utmost urgency, to discuss transatlantic relations in a very open way."
"And that is the point, Mr President-in-Office, where there is a difference that has not been mentioned and that you did not touch upon."
"It seems that at present we do not have the courage to admit to ourselves that the role of the European Union in international relations is undoubtedly at risk because of this."
"We do not have the courage to admit that there are differences between us and the USA."
"We do not have the courage to admit that you can hardly say there is a common foreign and security policy at present."
"There are also significant developments beyond steel which will have serious consequences."
"I am certainly pleased that the business community in Europe has at least aired its differences of opinion and not just expressed unreserved support."
"There is the issue of withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and the issue of unilateral declarations involving clear legal violations."
"The problem in such cases is that those who have their headphones on hear, whilst those who stand around chatting do not get the message at all."
"So the United States has made a unilateral decision concerning the non-proliferation treaty."
"They are blocking controls on biological weapons."
"The United States is dismantling the control organisation for the chemical weapons treaty."
"There has been an announcement about withdrawal from the space weapons treaty."
"There have been violations of international humanitarian law, the withdrawal from Kyoto, and the non-ratification of the international protocol on the International Criminal Court."
"I do not want to say that this all adds up to a negative picture, but it is nevertheless clear that there are very big differences between the US and Europe here, and I can only agreed with what Mr Lagendijk has said about nuclear weapons."
"I am certain that that the plans of the US and probably Russia as well contain even more macabre scenarios, but the point of their becoming public knowledge is evidently to humiliate Russia, which has recently been so zealous in its support for the USA."
"I wish to call on the European Union to counter this trend towards genuine multilateralism and the strengthening of the UN, and it should take advantage of its position as a civilian power, a power that practises preventive conflict resolution, and it should actually develop a common foreign policy."
"The most important condition for this is that, regardless of everything we have in common, we should ensure that these differences are not allowed to be hidden in a kind of European policy blind spot."
"Today marks a critical time in the transatlantic relations which, six months after the direct terrorist attacks on the US, are straining under intense pressure."
"This is mainly caused by the further development of the international anti-terrorist coalition."
"As with the Islamic terrorist network of Al Qaida, President Bush is issuing serious military warnings to potential terrorist States."
"For support of this bold approach, the American Head of State is making an urgent appeal to all coalition members."
"It is precisely this appeal which is stirring up very mixed emotions in European quarters."
"The standard European reproach of American unilateralism, which dates back to before 11 September, is once again being uttered."
"However, this familiar European reproach addressed to Washington is rooted in a fundamental weakness on our side."
"Indeed, recent analyses have clearly shown that the military and technological chasm between the transatlantic allies is widening at an alarming pace."
"The European NATO Member States carry increasingly less military weight."
"There is no doubt that this imbalance within NATO promotes American unilateralism in the area of security."
"The scenes of battle in Afghanistan bear witness to this."
"Mr President, for Europe to be a force to be reckoned with on the international scene, without jeopardising its own security, it needs to make a credible defence contribution to NATO and to outline a coherent, viable Euro-Atlantic security concept as a matter of urgency, on pain of being ostracised internationally and of being isolated."
"However, with regard to the steel conflict that has broken out between the US and the EU, there is no reasonable excuse for this example of uninhibited American protectionism and unilateralism in terms of trade."
"Passing on the weakness of its own steel industry to that of other countries by levying a 30% import tariff for three years only steps up the tension in transatlantic relations."
"In addition, this one-sided American government measure jeopardises the new trade round within the WTO."
"Above all, the intervention has an adverse effect on the American economy: the protection of 9 000 jobs in the American steel industry translates into a possible loss of no fewer than 75 000 jobs in other economic sectors due to higher steel prices."
"Where do we go from here?"
"A trade war between the US and the EU would undoubtedly come at the worst conceivable time politically speaking."
"Attempts to settle the dispute within WTO are therefore much to be preferred, for example, through a serious European contribution towards relaxing and reinforcing transatlantic relations."
"The debate is adjourned."
"It will resume at 3 p.m. with a statement by Commissioner Solbes."
"Mr President, on a point of order, you may be aware that Parliament's entire e-mail system has practically crashed."
"This is a direct result of the unforgivable spamming of our system by a certain Dr Rath of Germany, who appears to have considerable interests in the matter of vitamin therapy on which we are voting this morning."
"Several times in this House I have protested about this totally unacceptable invasion of our system, which has no place here and is causing serious problems for Members."
"I would like to reassure Members that we are doing our very best to take action in this regard."
"I would also repeat that all Members are entitled to request a filter for their system if they are being annoyed by these e-mails, which will then be removed."
"However, the ubiquitous Dr Rath - wherever he is, and I suspect he is in this House - has carefully changed the message regularly as it comes through, making it very difficult for our services to block these e-mails."
"We would have blocked them if we could have done so."
"However, each individual Member can request a filter on his or her machine to prevent these completely counter-productive e-mails from coming in."
"Mr President, I should like to make a correction to what Mrs Banotti has just said because we will be dealing with spamming and unsolicited commercial e-mails at a later plenary."
"What we are being targeted with is not spam."
"Spam is untargeted. We are quite clearly being targeted in this particular case."
"With relation to this whole spamming issue, everybody in Parliament is extremely frustrated with the campaign that is taking place."
"But I have spoken with organisations in the UK and Ireland this morning who are clearly as frustrated as we are."
"I may be paranoid, but I wonder whether industry is behind this attempt to get a reaction from Members of Parliament."
"Clearly, though, the organisations I am working with have tried desperately hard to stop this campaign of spamming our e-mail systems."
"We will leave it in the hands of the Quaestors to see what further action should be taken."
"Mr President, the Commission's position on these amendments is as follows. The Commission can accept all the compromise amendments to the common position put forward during the second reading, namely Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3."
"On the other hand, the Commission cannot accept the other amendments that diverge from the common position, which was largely supported."
"It is my pleasure to inform the House that there is a delegation from the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry of the Canadian Senate in the Official Visitors' Gallery."
"They are led by Senator Leonard Gustaffson."
"They have been having agricultural discussions in Brussels and in Strasbourg."
"We welcome them here."
"We value our very close links with our Canadian partners."
"We now continue with the vote."
"Report (A5-0046/2002) by Cecilia Malmström, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the European Commission's legislative and work programme (amendment of Rule 57 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure) (2001/2110(REG))"
"Before the vote:"
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now agreed to six amendments to the Rules of Procedure by the necessary majority; we now have to vote on a proposal for a decision, the first paragraph of which states that these amendments to the Rules of Procedure are to be adopted."
"This amounts to a kind of final vote, which as I see it is unnecessary in accordance with Rule 180(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I would accordingly ask you to refrain from voting on paragraph 1."
"This will also enable us to avoid another problem: paragraph 1 would require 314 votes for it to be adopted, whereas paragraph 2 would only need a simple majority."
"Mr Corbett, I understand you know something about the Rules."
"Mr President, I think Mr Wuermeling is correct."
"The custom and practice is that we do vote on the draft decision but I agree with both Mr Wuermeling and Mr Corbett that they have a point."
"I would ask the Rules Committee itself to examine this matter."
"Just one correction - because this is now a draft decision it does not require a qualified majority."
"It is now a simple majority we are going to vote with."
"I refer to the vote on the amendment by Mr Elles."
"It was not carried because it needed a qualified majority."
"Mr President, as far as this report is concerned, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 22."
"We feel that these amendments actually improve the quality and clarity of the text."
"We can accept in part Amendments Nos 4, 15, 16 and 19 and we reject Amendments Nos 3, 5, 13 and 21 as well as 23 and 25."
"Mr President, this is a procedural motion."
"Yesterday, when we debated this issue, I asked the President whether we might hold the debate in another way and perhaps obtain a more lively debate by my talking for four minutes and subsequently rounding off the debate with a further minute of my speaking time."
"The President was very obliging and said that we were perfectly entitled to do that, and the whole matter passed off splendidly."
"My question to you, Mr President, is as to whether you will instruct the Sittings Directorate that this is in actual fact a procedure that can be used here in Parliament and that it is supported by the College of Presidents with a view to bringing about a more lively debate."
"When I asked the Sittings Directorate whether this could be done, they in fact said that the debate could not be conducted in this way."
"I would therefore ask you to instruct the Sittings Directorate that this is a method of proceeding that we use here in Parliament."
"It gives rise to livelier debates, and there is nothing in the Rules of Procedure to prevent this approach from being used."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order as the chairman of the committee which is bringing this report to Parliament, and particularly on behalf of the rapporteur."
"Members of this Parliament will be aware of the very high degree of public interest in this issue and of the lobbying to which we have all been subjected."
"I am not against that lobbying - a lively parliament should welcome lobbying from all sides."
"But the situation regarding this particular directive is unusual and serious."
"Firstly, the rapporteur, Mrs Müller, who has done her job very gallantly, has been subjected to unacceptable harassment and threats."
"Lies have been disseminated as to her motivation."
"Secondly, the people in question, led by Dr Rath from Germany, have practised deception on Parliament."
"They gained entry as a news team to the committee meeting when her report was adopted, and used the material to make a video that caricatures the views of the Committee on the Environment and its rapporteur."
"Mr President, I ask you to consider what can be done about this."
"I would like to ask the Presidency to find a means of dealing with such excessive, fraudulent and oppressive approaches."
"(Loud applause)"
"It is true that in this instance they have done more harm than good, as Mrs McKenna has said; and it has to be said that there is a perfectly good case against this directive; but we need to put in place a procedure, as a parliament, to guard ourselves in the future."
"In some national parliaments in this instance the person concerned would certainly be called before the parliament, reprimanded and asked to apologise, and we might consider putting that in place."
"(Applause)"
"But given the fact that there are now electronic means to overwhelm us with lobbying, we need to do something."
"I ask the President of Parliament to consider this very urgently."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Amendments Nos 1 and 10, which were adopted by a majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, relate to a ban on the use of catering waste for feeding and to its disposal and use."
"The rapporteur has now tabled Amendment No 25, which is a compromise amendment."
"However, with one exception, these amendments are mutually compatible."
"The problem is that they refer to different dates."
"The amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy refer to 30 June 2002."
"Mrs Paulsen's Amendment No 25 says ""before the entry into force of this regulation"", and that is what we are voting on now."
"I would like to table an oral amendment to the effect that in the two amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy the date should be changed to ""before the entry into force of this regulation""."
"Yesterday, the Commission said that it would not take on board either Amendments Nos 1 and 10 or Amendment No 25."
"So there will be a clash between us anyway, and that is why it is important for us to vote on all three amendments in this way."
"However, even if this oral amendment is defeated by the required majority - and I am saying this now so that I do not have to speak again later on - we can still vote on these amendments, because this date does not tie the Commission's hands."
"It has the right of initiative and can decide anyway."
"It is simply a recommendation, and if that does not go through, then I am in favour of us still adopting all three amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it rather complicates matters that these amendments, Amendments Nos 1 and 10, on the one hand, and Amendment No 25, on the other, are more or less identical."
"The oral amendment to Amendments Nos 1 and 10 is not an editorial change. Instead, it would disturb principles fundamental to the whole report and make it incredibly difficult to achieve a conciliation."
"I cannot approve this oral amendment."
"I would ask my fellow MEPs to vote in favour of Amendment No 25, which would open up possibilities for solving both Germany and Great Britain's special problems with household waste and second-hand household oil."
"In other words, I do not approve the oral amendment."
"You know the Rules."
"If there are 12 Members standing their places against an oral amendment then it cannot be put."
"That is the case."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Report (A5-0077/2002) by Claude Turmes and Bernhard Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directives 96/92/EC and 98/30/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and natural gas (COM(2001) 125 - C5-0184/2001 - 2001/0077(COD))"
"Before the vote on Amendment No. 72:"
"Mr President, we have just voted against Amendment 71."
"If one looks at the text of Amendment 72, it tries to introduce a sentence relating it to Article 17, paragraph 2(a)."
"As this Article has gone now, I propose that we attach this Article 72 to Article 16, paragraph 2."
"Mr President, I would like to put forward an oral amendment to rectify an unfortunate typing error made initially."
"This will insert the word ""not"", so that the last phrase reads as follows: ""independent from other activities not relating to the transmission system""."
"I am sure the rapporteur understands this, but I do apologise to the House for the original typing error."
"Mr President, we have of course made some decisions about the electricity part that mean we now have to be careful not to contradict the gas part too much."
"That is why I would like to speak at three different stages: first now about the block vote, then later on about Amendment No 162 and then once again on amendments Nos 149 and 184."
"These are not comments on the substance, but rather comments about the adjustments."
"I would like at this point to comment on the first block: we have just rejected the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party's Amendment No 173 in a roll-call vote."
"The problem that we have here is that in committee we did not make a decision on this subject as regards electricity, but we did in the case of gas."
"The Liberal Group has now tried, in parallel, to do the same thing for electricity as we have already done for gas."
"We rejected that."
"However, we now have Amendment No 147, which belongs to this block, and which covers exactly the same substantive point that we rejected in the case of electricity."
"We are bringing forward something for gas that we do not want to bring forward in the case of electricity - the progress of market opening, as proposed by the committee."
"However, we still want to defer the opening of the gas market somewhat as compared with electricity."
"We are now creating an inconsistency around precisely this point."
"That means that by analogy we should be opposing Amendment No 147, but I simply do not know how we do that procedurally speaking, because in the voting list that is included in the block."
"That is why you, Mr President, have to decide now whether we should take Amendment No 147 out and vote on it separately; in that case, by analogy with the vote just taken, it would also have to be rejected."
"I hope that was confusing enough for you!"
"Mr President, this a bit simpler than just now."
"It is just about correcting something."
"The intention of Amendment No 162, a joint PSE and PPE-DE amendment, is to bring what we agreed for electricity in line with what we are now agreeing on for gas."
"It is word for word what we agreed earlier on for electricity."
"But because of the way the voting list works, that means that we first have to vote against the committee's amendment and then vote for Amendment No 162."
"However, a mistake has crept in along the way."
"This is exactly what we agreed for electricity on Article 8(5)."
"Amendment No 162 now also reads ""Article 8(5)""."
"However, for gas it is not Article 8(5) but Article 7a(1), and so of course that needs to be inserted there from the Minutes; this is just a technical adjustment."
"Mr President, this is about another adjustment, but this is rather more complicated than the one we had just now."
"You do not really need to listen at all, just do as I suggest, that will make things perfectly simple!"
"(Laughter)"
"But enough joking."
"We have just voted on the relevant part in relation to electricity."
"This is found in the committee's amendment."
"The amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party attempts to remove the discrepancies between Article 14, which relates to the gas sector, and Article 22. I must say that this is certainly necessary if we are to be rigorous here."
"However, if we now only voted on the PPE-DE's amendment, the key point concerning the electricity sector would be lost."
"Conversely, if we were to vote as shown here in the voting list, according to which if Amendment No 149 is accepted Amendment No 184 becomes redundant, then we would once again have the problem of a lack of consistency with the other article."
"That is the reason for the following proposal, and I have agreed this with the mover, who can confirm this. We should first of all vote on Amendment No 149 from the committee, and the PPE-DE Group will then withdraw its amendment except for the part that eliminates this inconsistency."
"This would then be added to Amendment No 149."
"We would then have eliminated the inconsistency between electricity and gas and the internal inconsistency in the case of gas."
"(Applause)"
"Just to confuse my colleagues, it is not exactly correct, because if we vote for the EPP Group's amendment, then we will have a different wording on Article 22 which is the Article on the electricity and gas regulator."
"I will leave it to the wisdom of the Assembly, but personally, I will vote against this in order to be consistent with Article 22."
"If we do not solve it today, we will solve it at second reading."
"Mr President, two minor drafting errors have crept in here."
"The first error is in Amendment No 48."
"It should say ""the competent authorities"", in the plural; there was not any disagreement between the Council and Parliament about this, it was just an error in the wording of the amendment."
"Similarly, we made a small error in Amendment No 52, in which two words have been omitted from the written version."
"However, in the case of Amendment No 52 in particular, this goes a long way towards meeting the wishes of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I would therefore ask you to approve the two oral amendments and to vote accordingly."
"Mr President, there is a problem in the Dutch version, and I understand that this also occurs in various other language versions."
"It concerns the word 'identity', which is wrong, and should be 'identification'."
"We do not want religious or political symbols to appear in passports and on identity cards."
"That is the issue."
"Mr President, we should like to table a compromise amendment."
"We want to know whether the GUE/NGL Group would accept the addition of the words 'including those inspired by fundamentalism? at the end of their Amendment No 29, so that the amendment would read thus: 'Urges the Commission and Council, when applying penalties based on the human rights clauses in association and other agreements, to take account of violations of women's rights, including those inspired by fundamentalism.?"
"This is a compromise amendment that would remain as an addition."
"Furthermore, Mr President, may I say that, if linguistic issues arise, I should like the Spanish version to be taken as authentic."
"Mr President, since work is running late, I shall forgo all the oral explanations of vote I was going to deliver today."
"That is very kind of you."
"You have been listening to your mother again."
"Mr President, the Council common position on the liberalisation of postal services guarantees that there will be a controlled opening of the market in these services in Europe."
"We need to adhere to the planned target dates and weight limits, as they will make it possible to liberalise the postal sector, with all the advantages to be gained from fair competition, in a gradual and organised way."
"As always, if areas of public services are to be liberalised, the opening process needs to be carefully controlled and implemented with regard to security of supply and social issues."
"The compromise worked out in committee concerning the production of regular reports on the application of the directive as a source of information for future development is therefore to be welcomed."
"Nevertheless, the economic, social and territorial consequences of the liberalisation process need to be taken into account when making policy."
"It is, however, questionable whether it really is right for the directive to make recommendations to the competent social partners, as has been suggested, for example, in one amendment."
"Mr President, my colleagues and I think that of all the sectors forced to endure the agonies of liberalisation, the postal sector is both the most important and the most ill-treated."
"First the Commission and then the Council of Ministers showed that they are either unaware of or systematically underestimate the fact that alongside and in addition to the service which they provide to the public, the postal services play a significant social role in all of the Member States and in all of the regions of the Union."
"On the pretext of liberalising the service, we are depriving the public - and first and foremost its most disadvantaged members - of social support which is nevertheless essential."
"Parliament had, moreover, rejected the initial proposals put to it."
"Those which have been put to the vote today contain improvements, but they do not remove the threat to society; quite the opposite, it is becoming increasingly clear that no provision has been made for funding the universal service or for compensating for the inequalities caused by nature."
"To make matters worse, the massive job losses which will be the direct result of the measures being recommended will compound the violence which is already doing serious damage to European society."
"Under these circumstances my colleagues and I supported all of the constructive amendments, wherever they came from, and will remain more vigilant than ever."
"- (FR) The history of European directives on opening the market in postal services to competition is a good illustration of the Commission's methods: from force to stealth, it makes skilful use of the weapons bestowed on it by the Treaty, in particular the monopoly on the right of initiative, to impose its theories and gradually see off its opponents, including in this case the European Parliament, which here had tended to advocate moderation."
"It is all the more regrettable, as is so often the case, that the Commission's position is, in essence, perfectly unilateral and open to dispute."
"It has not furnished the proof that opening up postal distribution to full competition would be profitable overall in a country like France."
"And yet this is the objective towards which it is leading us de facto."
"And by what right?"
"Just as it would appear justifiable that the Commission should wish to concern itself with cross-border mail distribution, so it seems to us that internal distribution should be the responsibility of each State."
"Such distinctions do not exist, however, in the eyes of the Commission."
"Commissioner Bolkestein has just explained to this House that we need to ""move forward towards the completion of the internal market for postal services""."
"Does not this internal market exist today?"
"Is it not possible to send a letter from France to Denmark or the United Kingdom easily and inexpensively?"
"All of this is laughable."
"The internal market already exists and Commissioner Bolkestein is only betraying the fact that, for the Commission, the real objective is quite different: it is unification, of which we have no need whatsoever."
"This issue raises another general question: the interface between the Commission's competence in matters of competition (where it now enjoys inordinate powers) and the Member States' competence to organise national public services."
"We think that, where there is any uncertainty, it is the State that should have the last word, provided of course that it has the clear support of the public."
"We must not allow the Commission to develop and impose a megalomaniac vision of its competences in the field of competition."
"That is why the Convention which is going to meet to discuss the future of Europe should add this important issue to its agenda."
"We voted in favour of the GUE's amendment because it rejects the whole of the Council's common position on opening the market in postal services to competition."
"We did not do this solely to show our disapproval of the attitude shown by the Council in refusing to take into account the European Parliament's flimsy amendments."
"Even if it had been amended or toned down as proposed by Parliament, the scheme would have been unacceptable."
"We reject the text as a whole because we are completely opposed to any privatisation of postal services and to any notion of these services being for profit."
"In rejecting the Council's text, we reject the overall policy pursued by national governments and the European institutions, a policy to demolish public services, a retrograde policy, harmful both to users of the postal service and to workers in this sector."
"We refused to take part in the vote on the amendments because neither the text on the table nor the initiative as a whole are capable of being amended or improved."
"It is clear that the progress that has been made these last few years on defining and guaranteeing a universal service in the postal sector, as in other areas, such as energy, constitutes a significant advance which we found it very hard to conceive of or even hope for at the beginning of the nineties."
"I would therefore pass a favourable judgment on this progress: we now have not inconsiderable guarantees on the accessibility and quality of the universal service, in terms of a minimum set of products being supplied as part of the universal service and in terms of the universal service being adaptable to new technology."
"Nevertheless, there remain some doubts, questions and concerns about striking the right balance between the public service and the market, about maintaining the postal network in our towns and villages and about the tariffs applied."
"That is why I signed the amendments seeking to have the Commission submit regular reports to the European Parliament on the development of the internal market."
"That is also why I signed the amendment with the Greens setting the weight limit, as at first reading, at 150 grams (with pricing conditions)."
"I regret the fact that this amendment, which 'guaranteed the guarantees' given by others, was rejected."
"We will now need to be extra vigilant when the texts are implemented."
"First and foremost, I should like to thank both the rapporteur in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Markus Ferber, and all of the Members of that committee for their proposal."
"The compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, is unsatisfactory, indeed even unacceptable."
"This amendment is unsatisfactory because it calls for a unilateral evaluation, which would be made by the Commission alone, and not, as I would have wished, a more controversial one carried out by all of the stakeholders."
"It is unacceptable because it rejects Parliament's initial proposal to limit the next stage of liberalisation to 150g and four times the basic tariff, and yet does not give any guarantee that a high level of social cohesion will be maintained."
"It is also unacceptable because this amendment refuses to tackle the problem of the conditions under which access will be available to the networks of the new operators."
"Finally, it is unacceptable because this amendment refuses to raise the issue of how the universal service will be funded; in fact if there is a legitimate request it is surely that of funding: we actually have a right to know how the universal service will be funded, which is to say how the universal service will be able to be guaranteed as such."
"Nevertheless, I will vote in favour of the common position for lack of anything better, because if we were to try to amend the text again we would run the risk of seeing the common position fail; we would therefore be running the risk of not having any directive on postal services and consequently of this sector being fully liberalised within two years."
"It was therefore more out of a concern to play safe than a real enthusiasm for the text - which in my opinion is far too cynically liberal - that I voted in favour of the common position."
"On 14 December 2000, when we voted at first reading, we were among a handful of Members who rejected the 'gradual and controlled liberalisation of the postal market'."
"We had tried to convince those who, although they supported the public service, explained to us that the essentials had been safeguarded."
"This was without reckoning with the Commission and the governments' firm desire to liberalise and then to privatise all of our public services."
"There is no acceptable compromise on either the timetable or the scope of the liberalisation."
"That is why we voted to reject the common position and we will continue to defend the postal service as a public service."
"This is the only position which guarantees continued high quality for users and free access for everyone, in particular for those living in rural and working-class areas."
"It is the only position which safeguards jobs: by adopting this directive alone, Members are opening the way for 450 000 jobs to be cut in this sector in Europe, including 50 000 in France."
"It is now time to mobilise the public, workers and their organisations against the liberal dogma of treating our needs and fundamental rights as commodities and to impose a public postal service which is coordinated at European level and placed in the hands of the people."
"The compromise which emerged at the Council meeting of 15 October last on opening up the Member States' postal services to competition, which was supported amongst others by the socialist government of France, seems to us to be built on a series of ambiguities which may hide considerable dangers."
"France's unique position and the precautionary principle - to safeguard the equality of our fellow citizens - are the reasons why I did not support this shaky compromise, which is tantamount to handing a blank cheque to the Commission to complete the demolition of the French postal service by around 2006."
"The economy should not be the only guiding force behind European policy."
"France has chosen to have a quality postal service, which extends across its territory and is accessible to everyone for a standard price."
"This is our vision of a public service."
"It is our wish to safeguard our system, whatever the cost."
"I should like it to be minuted that since all public services fall within the competence of each Member State, each of them will remain free to determine the final shape of their postal service."
". (NL) Public utilities, such as postal services, public transport, the supply of energy and drinking water, have, for more than a century, been government monopolies for very good reasons."
"These are vital utilities, and competition would interfere with their being continuously available to all at an affordable price."
"One would expect that advocates of political and economic unification would strive towards the integration of public postal companies of all the Member States and towards single European stamps."
"Instead, the co-existence of different postal companies in the neo-liberal phase is being used to allow these companies to compete with each other and, in addition, to open the door to American or Australian companies, or to new companies which offer poorer services at lower prices under poorer working conditions."
"Twenty years from now, after take-overs and bankruptcies, there will be three global concerns in charge, and mandatory protection of staff, the environment and consumers will prove impossible."
"At first reading, the majority of the EP rejected a further weight decrease of postage under 150 grams for distribution in a competitive market, as well as more far-reaching forms of liberalisation in due course."
"At the risk of the European Commission applying other rules which offer yet less protection to a universal provision of services, after years of protest, the social democrats are now finally resigned to these unsatisfactory plans."
"In my opinion, this resignation is unnecessary and harmful, and I will vote for rejection."
"At first sight the Malmström report on the presentation of the Commission's work programme to the European Parliament offers a pleasing aspect: it actually manages - without saying it in so many words - to erode the college's monopoly on the right of initiative and expose its unilateral and anti-democratic nature to the broad light of day."
"On the other hand, however, it omits the essential point: nothing is said about the Council's right to approve this same work programme."
"The Malmström report shows firstly that, as the European Parliament becomes more powerful, the Commission's monopoly on the right of initiative weighs increasingly heavy on it."
"It therefore seeks to impose its own priorities."
"This desire had, moreover, caused some tension last December when the Commission presented its programme for 2002."
"Today, the agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament, which has just been adopted, sets out a timetable for the year n-1 for us to work together to draft the work programme for the year n. This is a good initiative."
"But it raises a further question: where is the equivalent timetable for a dialogue with the Council?"
"Such a timetable would be even more justified, and for three reasons: 1) the Council is the European institution with the deepest democratic roots because it is based on national parliaments; 2) theoretically, unlike the European Parliament, it already has real power to push forward and guide the work of the Commission, pursuant to Article 4 of the TEU; 3) finally, the Council has an overview of the work which needs to be done at European level across the three pillars of the Treaty, including the initiatives taken by Member States in the intergovernmental pillar."
"In the absence of clarification on this point, the Malmström report appears more than anything to be a man?uvre by the two old connivers, the Commission and the European Parliament, to throw out the primordial rights of the Council."
"Mr President, I apologise for taking up your time."
"You are aware, as I am, of a campaign waged by the Daily Record newspaper in Scotland, in the course of which some extremely unfair things were said about our colleague Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, whose valuable report we adopted today - things which I deplore."
"It is the case, however, that this valuable report, which protects working people against noise in the workplace could have had unintended side effects on the music industry."
"I am very glad that Amendments Nos 23 and 25 were corrected, thereby saving the world of pipe bands amongst others."
"I think I am the only piper in this House, so I am particularly pleased about that!"
"But I do want to say to Mrs Thorning-Schmidt that her Scottish colleagues regret the way she was unfairly pilloried in our press."
"We look forward to hearing the pipes at the next Burns' Supper."
"(EL) The initiatives to introduce Community legislation on minimum health and safety standards for risks to which workers are exposed from noise are a step in the right direction given the truly abysmal situation in certain Member States such as Greece, where even the most rudimentary safety mechanisms have still not been introduced."
"Having said which, we need:"
"low limit values before action is taken (83 db);"
"responsibility for action to lie with the employer, not the workers, which is why ear protectors should not be taken into account;"
"a reference period of one working day, not one week, to avoid extending the exposure of workers to noise and the damage caused by it."
"These positions are contained in the relevant amendments tabled by the European Parliament, which is why I supported them, but are not included in the Council's common position."
"Finally, we need control mechanisms to ensure that these measures are put into practice."
". It has always been the position of my group to work towards a safer working environment for all workers and in the past we have been very supportive of realistic initiatives that achieve this end."
"We, in common with many other members had many concerns with the contents of this report, in particular the wide ranging requirements on the employer and the dubious emission levels."
"For these reasons we were unable to support many of the amendments put forward and indeed we were disappointed that many amendments were given the support."
"In particular, we were very happy that the amendment to exclude the music industry was adopted."
"This is most welcome as I and many Members had the impression that this was not the appropriate place to deal with a very specialised sector of industry."
"We must also welcome the willingness of the Council to take on board many of the amendments proposed by Parliament in its first reading and we hope that the goodwill shown by the Parliament will be reciprocated in the future."
"On a personal level, I did not participate in the vote as I had such grave reservations with regard to the content of the report and many of the amendments and as a former musician I did not think it was right for me to vote."
"In general our group is pleased with the outcome and hope that this new realism will continue in this."
". I wholeheartedly support this report by my Socialist colleague to tighten the Council's common position on exposing workers to noise."
"No workers should be exposed to such high levels of noise that they are unable to have a conversation: you only get one pair of ears and to protect them is vital."
"Moreover, it is better that measures to combat noise pollution and harm are preventative rather than curative and that the onus is placed on collective rather than individual responsibility in this domain."
"So that this directive is as effective as possible, we should work with existing tools and avoid duplication."
"Therefore, the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work should be used to its maximum capacity."
"This will facilitate and promote the exchange of best practice in terms of acceptable noise levels."
"Moreover, it is logical that this directive must be far-reaching to include those employers and employees who are self-employed, since these make up a significant share of today's workforce."
"Mr President, I voted for the Müller report, and I say so with great conviction."
"I support Mrs Müller's cause and hope that the appeals made to the House by Mrs Jackson, as well as her statements, and also the assurances given by Mrs Banotti, the Quaestor, about settling the matter of this unacceptable and unbelievable interference - not only for the sake of our parliamentary work but also, I believe, for democracy as a whole, for the development of parliamentary debate - will achieve their aim as soon as possible, so that interference of this kind - which even included death threats - cannot happen again, in other words so that those responsible can be suitably reported and such things can never be repeated."
"I am confident that Mrs Banotti will handle this."
"Mr President, I regret the vote that took place today."
"It is a major blow to the public's right to choose alternative forms of medicine, the right to try and avoid relying on pharmaceutical industries and their products."
"Last night Commissioner Byrne rejected the idea that the pharmaceutical industry had anything to do with this, but I wonder why they are so interested in getting this through if that is not the case?"
"He clearly tried to give the impression that those opposing this were just spokespeople for the industries that produce food supplements."
"That is not the case."
"We are clearly in favour of people's right to choose."
"That right has been taken away from them today."
"Some Members of this House took a ridiculous approach in saying I should be recommending that people eat more oranges and vegetables."
"Take the example of pregnant women."
"They would have to eat a lot of broccoli to get the amount of folic acid they actually need, so such an argument is ridiculous."
"What has happened here today has played right into the hands of the pharmaceutical industry, which will now have more customers because more people are going to fall ill."
"It is also an assault on individual Member States' policies."
"If the Member States do not have a lenient policy in their countries they should change it and not force the rest of us to drag our standards down to theirs."
"Mr President, I supported the amendments to the Müller report, though every fibre of my being wanted to deliver a body blow to Dr Rath - spelled r-a-t? - and his minions, who have placed this Parliament under siege not just for the past few months, but for a year."
"I would also join with Ms McKenna in saying that vitamins - which I personally, as a nurse, do not regard as a food supplement - are on free sale in our country and that I have never yet heard of anybody overdosing on vitamin C or any other vitamin."
"For that reason - regretfully, because I would have done anything to defeat Dr Rath's purpose - I voted for the amendments which, unfortunately, were not passed."
"I agree with Ms McKenna that so far the free sale of these products - which, I repeat, I do not regard as food supplements - has not caused any problem, and I see no reason to interfere with that sale."
"Mr President, may I just say that the whole discussion on this directive shows that there is an urgent need to make laws and rules clearer."
"There is a huge misunderstanding about how this is to be interpreted, when Article 4 makes reference to annexes and other things."
"I urge us all to support better regulation."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has decided against the right of European citizens to be able unrestrictedly to enjoy natural medicines, which are completely free from side effects."
"People have tried to make us Members of Parliament forget a simple truth, which is that nobody in human memory has ever died from taking vitamins, whereas the same can certainly not be said of the products of the multinational drug companies' sophisticated laboratories, as shown by the Lipobay case."
"There are tens of thousands of cancer patients who are treating themselves effectively with vitamin therapy associated with natural substances such as the amino-acids lysine and proline."
"In upholding the demands of a powerful lobby of the multinational drug companies, this directive therefore goes against a substantive right and the widespread interest of European consumers."
"It is not for nothing that a board member of the second largest multinational drug company, Mr Bolkestein, sits in the European Commission."
"Nobody mentions that he is certainly not unfamiliar with this directive, which, in one fell swoop, kills off the healthy small and medium-sized dietary supplement enterprises and the freedom of four hundred million Europeans to choose their treatment."
"Many people in Europe take vitamins and mineral supplements."
"It is therefore appropriate, as part of European consumer policy, to avoid any abuse of these substances and to ensure that the products offered to consumers are of high quality."
"This recommendation meets these aspirations, in particular by proposing an adequate European legal framework which does not hinder the free movement of these products, while guaranteeing increased health protection for the consumer and accurate and appropriate information on the products available."
"One of the factors which is crucial to the safety of these products is the maximum quantity of minerals which they contain."
"That is why setting maximum limits for the quantities of vitamins and minerals authorised in food supplements is important for ensuring that they are taken in moderation."
"This is because scientific opinions show that absorbing excessive quantities of certain vitamins and minerals may have undesirable or harmful effects."
"In addition, the list of these substances should not be set in stone because other products with nutritional or physiological effects could be incorporated into the provisions."
"On the basis of the experience it gains in this field, I should like the Commission to present to the European Parliament and the Council additional proposals, accompanied by appropriate legal measures, on other nutriments and substances which can have comparable effects to food supplements."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Müller's report and I should like to highlight the quality of the work done by our rapporteur."
"I am delighted that this House is finally speaking out on such an important issue."
"Today it is a question of ensuring that the products concerned do not present a health risk by guaranteeing that the labels provide European consumers with clear, accurate and appropriate information about the products."
"It is desirable to set a minimum level of vitamins and minerals which these products have to contain so as to guarantee that the food supplements contain them in sufficient quantity to justify the stated objective of the product."
"Once we have agreed the principles in accordance with which the maximum and minimum quantities are to be set, the adoption of specific limits for each nutrient, on the basis of the opinion issued by the Scientific Committee for Food, is a purely technical matter."
"Let us not forget that absorbing excessive quantities of some vitamins and minerals can have undesirable or harmful effects."
"That is why it is necessary to guarantee the safety of these products, amongst other things by having labels with precise instructions on the use of the product and in particular the quantity that may be consumed."
"The European public will thus be able to have peace of mind when choosing vitamins and mineral supplements from the huge range of products currently available on the market, without having to worry constantly about damaging their health."
". (NL) Last year, all EP Members were inundated with e-mails on food supplements and vitamin preparations."
"Both a scientific theory and an economic interest underlie these."
"The theory of Linus Pauling, who became renowned for his protest against nuclear arms, is interesting."
"However, the economic interest of Mathias Rath, who dispatches products from the Netherlands to customers in Germany, where his products are banned, cannot justify an adaptation of the law."
"These food supplements should be subject to the same rules as other contentious products which are consumed by the public in the expectation that these will benefit their health."
"Government intervention is only justified to protect people from harm."
"On-going debates, lack of scientific certainty and permanent differences of opinion on the effectiveness of substances cannot be resolved by legislation which from the outset lumps together anything which deviates from established medical science under the umbrella of fraudulent practices."
"I note that many people use these products and that they consider any ban imposed by a bureaucratic government to be unnecessary and patronising."
"Under these circumstances, the EU should confine itself to controlling harmful substances."
"Since it would be preferable if the EU were to redirect any other measures to the national legislator, who can react more effectively and more quickly to changes in public opinion, I vote for rejection."
"I have voted against the report."
"In my view, there is no legal basis insofar as the EU is not entitled to legislate within the area of public health."
"It is national legislation that should deal with issues of food supplements, not the European Union."
"Nor has the EU taken any initiatives to regulate legislation within areas in which very serious abuse takes place, for example those of alcohol and drugs."
"The fact that an attempt is now being made to do so within the field of health foods - something that would have consequences for people's self-medication by means of vitamin supplements - raises a number of fundamental issues."
"In whose interests is this to be done?"
"Why should it be done specifically within this area?"
"How would it affect the individual citizen?"
"Which manufacturers would suffer, and which benefit?"
"These questions demand answers, and no satisfactory answers have been given."
"Mr President, I would like to state that I voted for the Paulsen report and above all for Amendment No 10."
"I basically believe that we need to pay close attention to hygiene regulations and enforce them very strictly, and that standards need to be raised accordingly."
"Nevertheless it does not make sense for us to destroy reusable waste - and that is what catering waste is - and by destroying it to create further costs for the public, when we could in fact make use of it in a sensible way."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament has agreed with this approach, even if it has been by a narrow margin."
"I hope that as things proceed we will also get the necessary agreement of the Commission that reusable waste should not be indiscriminately destroyed, which also involves extra costs, but that it should be possible to use it and recycle it."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to table an oral amendment and to explain what is behind it."
"Unfortunately, it did not scrape past the required 314-vote mark."
"That is a pity as far as the amendment is concerned, but it does not alter the fact that in compromise Amendment No 25 Parliament has called on the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal."
"That means that the codecision procedure will be invoked and that we can deal with this by means of a regulation of our own."
"I wish to call on those Member States that have not so far called for a ban to make sure that these substances, which are dangerous if they are not properly treated, are properly disposed of."
"I expect that during the transitional period until a regulation governing all this is submitted, the Commission will use its control functions to make sure that we do not have a repeat of the disasters that we have already experienced - foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever - which can be caused by untreated catering waste."
"I have always attached great importance to health and consumer protection."
"I should like to make two essential remarks on the points which I advocated in the parliamentary committee."
"The European Union's decisions must be consistent."
"In the interests of efficiency, it is therefore appropriate not to have a proliferation of regulations on the same subjects."
"In laying down provisions for the prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 already subjects animal by-products from slaughterhouses handling ruminants and cutting plants handling meat from ruminants to rigorous and controlled health rules."
"Consequently, to ensure consistency and the correct application of the rules, there is no reason to include these facilities in the scope of a second regulation with the same objectives."
"The European Union's decisions must also be possible to implement."
"In fact we already know that, because of treatment and disposal capacity (incineration or landfill), measures which have to be implemented at too short notice cannot be applied at Community level if they cover effluent - whether category 1 or category 2 - from wastewater treatment plants at slaughterhouses, which are often shared facilities."
"These shortcomings mainly came to light when the ban on animal meal in animal feed was imposed, forcing the Member States to store large quantities of animal meal while waiting for it to be incinerated."
"Adding several million tonnes of products to be disposed of or treated before processing would impose further constraints on storage because it is not possible to treat or incinerate them as required."
"And we know that storage can involve health and environmental risks."
"It is therefore necessary to put in place an adequate timetable allowing this to be managed at Community level in a way which is well thought-out, safe and respectful of the environment."
". I would like to commend the rapporteur Ms Paulsen for her work on this important report."
"The BSE crisis of recent years must never again threaten European consumers, farmers and the beef industry."
"I believe that great credit is due to the Commission for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each and every one of the issues surrounding the original crisis."
"The Commission and the Member States have taken the necessary steps, with the full co-operation of the farming community and the beef industry, to guarantee safe farming and food production practices and a safe product for the European consumer as well as for our vital export markets."
"Many actions and measures taken have brought with them great sacrifice and we must remain conscious of that."
"This particular proposal aims to establish a single legal framework to clarify conditions for treating animal by-products."
"Most importantly, the only by-products which should end up in animal feed, and consequently the food chain, are those by-products which would be fit for direct human consumption."
"In other words, if you can't put a spoon of the stuff in your cup of cocoa at night then you shouldn't be feeding it to the pigs either."
"As a Member of Parliament representing a largely rural constituency, and coming from Ireland, the Member State most heavily dependent on agriculture, I fully endorse the stringent thrust of this proposal."
"I strongly believe that there must be a complete ban on the feeding of swill to pigs."
"We have seen the damage that can be wreaked from a more lax approach."
"I am also convinced of the need to ban recovered vegetable oils from all feed uses."
"There is great merit in the rapporteur's suggestion that household catering waste be exempt from the provisions of these regulations with regard to transport, identification etc and that they be covered by national rules and the Framework Directive on Waste."
"As regards the issue of waste water from slaughter houses, I believe that this must be reviewed as it covers a huge quantity of material for disposal."
"Defining 'sludge? in the Annex might help clarify the situation."
"In conclusion, I would like to assure the Commissioner that he has the full support of Parliament in this important area of food safety."
"In this regard I would urge him to exert some pressure on the Council to come to a final decision as to the location of the all-important Food Safety Authority."
"Protection of European consumers, and of the integrity of the food chain, remain at the heart of the concerns of Members of this House."
"In establishing the single market, which is its stated aim, the report on cross-border exchanges in electricity seeks, first and foremost, to open the market in electricity to competition and de facto, even if it does not admit it openly, to privatisation."
"This means awarding the prize of supplying electricity to more than 300 million Europeans to large private groups."
"Not content with this, but perfectly consistent with this approach, the rapporteur recommends passing on the costs of opening up the national networks to the private sector to consumers throughout the European Union."
"We are resolutely opposed to privatisation of the generation and supply of electricity, as we are to the privatisation of all public services, which the Member States and the European institutions are so keen to achieve, because this policy can only be to the detriment of the interests of both the workers in the sectors concerned and the vast majority of consumers."
"We condemn this policy of demolishing public services, whose sole aim is to satisfy capitalists' appetite for profit, whether it is acknowledged as such, as in the Mombaur report, or whether it is veiled - ineffectually - by environmentalist considerations, as in the Turmes-Rapkay report."
"We therefore voted against these two reports."
"Energy is not a marketable commodity like any other!"
"How many times have I already said and repeated that?"
"Account must be taken of the need to guarantee security of supply and the volume of investment this entails."
"The provision of essential public services and its impact in terms of regional planning must also be taken into account."
"In spite of all this, following the request made by the European Council at its Lisbon Summit for rapid progress towards the completion of the single market in gas and electricity, the Commission has presented a communication, a draft regulation and a draft directive designed to speed up the liberalisation of the gas and electricity market with a view to the establishment of an entirely open market in 2005."
"At the Stockholm Summit, the Member States approved this acceleration, with the exception of France, which is strongly opposed to the adoption of that date."
"The Commission wishes to speed up the opening of the electricity market so as to give non-residential customers a free choice of supplier by 1 January 2003 and to extend the same opportunity to all electricity consumers not later than the beginning of January 2005."
"In the case of gas, free choice of supplier is to be available to non-residential customers by 1 January 2004 and to all consumers by the start of January 2005."
"This is utterly irresponsible and unacceptable."
"It is the distortion of an ultra-liberal Europe that I am resisting."
"Given the balance of power in the European Parliament and in Europe, it will be an arduous struggle."
"To this end, I have signed a compromise amendment to Article 19, tabled by Mr Herzog and Mr Savary, which alters the deadlines and conditions for open competition and insists on scope for cross-subsidisation to guarantee equality of charges for residential clients."
"This is why I voted against the report in the final vote."
"France should uphold this position at the Barcelona Council."
"I would first like to state that there was not a majority in the committee in favour of the part of the report on a Directive concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity, the part for which Mr Turmes was responsible."
"If there had been just a Turmes report instead of the Rapkay-Turmes report we now have before us, it would not have seen the light of day in plenary."
"We are of course in agreement with the three major objectives of the process of liberalising the electricity and gas industry, and our message to the Barcelona Summit about this was clear and undisputed."
"It is as follows:"
"1) we want to ensure that consumers are free to choose their suppliers;"
"2) we want to guarantee that all suppliers have fair and transparent access to all networks;"
"3) we want to see a binding system in all Member States in order to underpin the objective described in point 2."
"However, Mr Turmes felt that in his part of the report, which covered the electricity industry, he should set out his entire ideology and the Greens' wish list in this area, which have nothing to do with the actual subject matter."
"His report therefore misses the point."
"Like my colleagues, I voted against these parts of the resolution."
"Because we are now involved in the codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council, Mr Turmes has, with his Red-Green wish list, not done a great service to the subject at hand here, by which I mean a reasonable and balanced liberalisation of the EU electricity market."
"(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (NL) The promotion of international trade in gas and electricity leads to more problems in the field of the environment, consumer protection and price stability."
"This is a comment in connection with the Mombaur report."
"As transpired yesterday - much to the chagrin of the spokesperson of the PPE-DE Group - the rapporteurs Turmes and Rapkay have made proposals to moderate the effects of the Mombaur report."
"Their intention is noble, but difficult to implement, because it aims to combine two incompatible objectives."
"They accept more emphasis on market forces, which centre on growth and profits, while trying to protect the environment and consumers."
"I welcome their attempt to give customers a percentage breakdown in their bills and in information leaflets explaining the origin of electricity and the effects on the production of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, and to apply this to imported energy."
"I also support financial measures to promote investments in total energy and windmills."
"I am less keen on the importance being accorded to attempts also to liberalise biogas and to ensure that environmental obligations do not restrict competition between companies, although this may be a concession to the majority in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Although I reject the circumstances under which this proposal has been made, unlike my group, I gladly support it in the absence of anything better."
"."
"I welcome the move to shake up Europe's energy markets: this will make markets more open and accessible to all."
"If the final directive contains many of the useful amendments proposed by the Industry Committee, European energy consumers will operate in a considerably more favourable climate than they do at present."
"Bills will contain more basic information and consumers will be better informed of exactly what they are paying for."
"Even more significant for European consumers will be the proposed non-discriminatory access to networks for different competitors."
"Basic economics tells us that more competition for networks should result in an eventual decrease in prices: good news for some consumers who, in the present system, end up paying over the odds."
"This is equally goods news for small energy companies who are sometimes deterred from further expansion owing to high market entry costs."
"Gas and electricity are basic necessities, not luxury goods, and this directive will be a triumph for most European consumers and some producers of energy."
". (NL) In the past, electricity was generated and distributed on a small-scale, and organised for each municipality or province under the remit of the administration elected for that region."
"Now, we are on our way to the generation and distribution by international concerns on which democracy has no effect whatsoever."
"The drawbacks have meanwhile become glaringly obvious in America, especially in the power cuts in California and in the bankruptcy case of Enron."
"But in Europe too, the adverse effects are already being felt."
"The Dutch energy companies, until recently in the hands of municipalities and provinces, have made considerable investments in the environmentally-friendly generation of electricity."
"This clean production is now being considered too expensive, and dirty electricity is being imported via the cross-border connection network, which originates from pit coal, brown coal and nuclear energy."
"This connection network was installed some time ago to allow Member States to help each other in the event of disaster and in cases of peaks in the use of electricity, but its capacity is now being used completely for the purpose of international trade."
"This is why I disagree with the purport of the Mombaur report on cross-border electricity trade, even if through the proposals by Turmes and Rapkay more attention is paid to keeping track of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste, to promoting windmills and total energy, and to consumer protection."
"These objectives will ultimately not be compatible, which is why I am voting against the proposal."
". (NL) Airports are built in densely populated regions and attract extra economic growth, as a result of which an increasing number of people end up living in their vicinity."
"Consequently, aircraft noise has become a plague to an increasing proportion of the population."
"The more a region is forced to rely on air traffic for its transport needs, the greater the burden becomes in terms of damage to health."
"The only ways to combat this nuisance are to restrict air traffic to long-distance flights, to create greater distances between airports and residential areas, to accord lower priority to economic growth or world trade and to ban noisy aircraft."
"Clearly, America and the Third World have different views on noise pollution."
"The Third World is too poor to consider matters of this kind, and in affluent America, company profits are more important than any other considerations."
"Anyone truly wishing to restrict noise pollution in Europe should not be content with the agreement that was recently concluded on a global scale within the ICAO, but should set higher standards themselves, if necessary."
"The proposal to withdraw the aforementioned Hushkits Regulation from 1 April onwards mainly aims to avoid a trade war with America."
"I share the view of the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Blokland, that this proposal does not go far enough and that it continues to permit exceptions for too long a term. I will be voting against the proposal."
". I fully support this report on the Commission communication, which aims to improve information exchange between the EU and its citizens."
"Anti-EU campaigns in countries such as Ireland have clearly demonstrated the need for a positive communication strategy."
"Moreover, the practical policy prescriptions outlined in this report show that the EU is serious about becoming closer to European citizens and countering the common perception that it is run by an elite bureaucracy."
"Focusing on issues which affect people's daily lives, such as food safety, the euro and justice and home affairs, will ensure that citizens fully engage in the debate about Europe."
"Moreover, the focus on decentralisation in this communication exchange is pertinent: regions vary dramatically across the EU and local authorities are attuned to regional needs and issues of local importance."
"They are clearly the best placed to disseminate information about the EU."
"Similarly, it is vital that regional TV should be involved."
"Finally, the call for more Internet use in the information campaign will ensure that this campaign is not only cost-effective but environmentally sound, too."
"Since the European Parliament is the European institution closest to European citizens, it would make sense for it to become the institution around which this information campaign revolves."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to inform you as to why we have voted against the report."
"First of all, because of the poor quality of the report."
"It is a very confused report and it is very difficult to make sense of it."
"A second reason is that religion, fundamentalism and the violation of human rights are lumped together, which is unacceptable to us."
"A third reason is that the European Union is given a number of inappropriate assignments, including the setting up of a free university for women. In fact, we do not want a separate university for women; we want co-educational universities."
"These are the reasons why we have voted against the report."
"Mr President, I voted against the report before us because it does not live up to the expectations created by the title."
"The main focus is on religious fundamentalism, with other forms of fundamentalism only being given a brief mention."
"Even if religious fundamentalism is the most significant form and stands out from other forms, it is nevertheless essential to recognise all forms of fundamentalism if a meaningful debate is to take place."
"The threats posed by fundamentalism are growing in a way that the events of 11 September suggest involve an enormous contempt for humanity."
"However, to do justice to the situation we cannot limit ourselves to religious aspects alone."
"Just as people obsessed with a fundamental order are to be found in all walks of life, this way of thinking is also prevalent throughout society."
"The logical consequence of recognising this can therefore only be that we should examine this whole area and not concentrate on just one form of this phenomenon, even if it is the form with the most adherents."
"Mr President, during the vote one of my Dutch colleagues remarked that part of the report did not make sense in Dutch."
"I had difficulty in finding any of it that made sense in English!"
"This report has taken political correctness to a whole new level."
"It is counter-productive to approach such an important issue as religious fundamentalism with a tirade of political fundamentalism of the kind that this report is largely made up of."
"I am particularly critical of paragraph 29, even as amended, which considers the separation of church and state to be the most acceptable form of government."
"I do not have to remind you, Mr President, that in my country, if not in yours, the head of state is also the head of the established church."
"That is a system that works very well indeed."
"I hope Parliament is not calling on the Queen to abdicate, so that maybe we can elect President Kinnock in her place!"
"The Izquierdo Rojo report on women and fundamentalism, which has just been adopted by a slim majority in spite of our having voted against it, is a prime example of a good initial idea that has been completely perverted in the course of the discussion process."
"It was originally a matter of reaffirming our desire to ensure that women's rights are rigorously respected throughout the territory of all the Member States at a time when huge influxes of unassimilated immigrants are prone to import practices that are degrading to women or are tantamount to cruel torture, such as female circumcision."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament ultimately shied away from naming the plague that besets us, namely floods of unassimilated immigrants, often from countries with an Islamic culture."
"Faced with this predicament, Parliament has taken refuge in sanitised statements or, even worse, has issued sweeping condemnations which seem to apply to all Europeans without distinction and which imbue everyone with an unwarranted sense of guilt."
"The same is true of the concept of fundamentalism itself."
"Under that heading, the report blithely lumps together the rigorous practice of Christianity, a religion that places the individual at the heart of society, and the rigorous practice of another religion, Islam, which subordinates the individual to the community."
"But these are not the same phenomenon at all."
"To crown it all, the European Parliament recommends that the forthcoming directives on the right of asylum, based on the Treaty of Amsterdam, provide for reception of women from all parts of the world who suffer from 'fundamentalist persecution'."
"Had it been consistent, the report would have called at the same time for the abolition of the budgetary stability and growth pact!"
"The report has the merit of condemning one of the most odious aspects of the oppression of women in the world by taking a stance against the integration of church and state and the regimes that practise it."
"We voted in favour of the condemnatory paragraphs and of the measures to assist women who are forced to flee from countries where women are the victims of systematic barbarism."
"On the report as a whole, however, we abstained."
"Although the report rightly condemns Islamic fundamentalism, it is considerably more discreet about the other forms of fundamentalism, notably the role of Catholicism, of which women are victims both outside and inside the European Union, in countries such as Ireland and Portugal or in some of the German Länder."
"Prohibiting women from voluntarily terminating their pregnancy, in other words denying them the right to use their bodies as they please, is one example of a sexist and oppressive attitude towards women."
"And the good resolutions adopted by the European Union against misogynous practices and the excesses of Islamic regimes would be more credible if the Union first put its own house in order by prohibiting discriminatory practices against women in its own Member States."
"The European institutions have taken it upon themselves, with the complicity of the European governments, to impose such a retrograde step as nightshift work for women."
"Why do they refuse to impose throughout Europe the fundamental right of women to self-determination, including the right of voluntary termination?"
"I must warmly congratulate Mrs Izquierdo Rojo on her excellent own-initiative report, compiled as a result of the hearing on women and fundamentalism held on 23 January 2001."
"Everyone agrees that fundamentalism can appear in many guises."
"It can be religious, political or ideological."
"We do not stress often enough that women are the chief victims of fundamentalism and that this state of affairs frequently arouses utter indifference."
"While the European Union has to condemn this phenomenon in third countries, it must not presume to lecture the rest of the world, because it is confronted with fundamentalism within its own territory."
"This is confirmed by the massive floods of e-mails that have inundated Members of the European Parliament and in which we are being urged to reject this report on the grounds that it is 'a threat to the dignity of women and to the right to life of every human being until his or her natural death'."
"On the contrary, I support the demand contained in this report for promotion of equal rights for women, particularly the right of women to exercise control over their own bodies and to decide when they wish to start a family, to determine their own lifestyle and the nature of their personal relationships."
"It appears equally imperative that the Member States should adopt legislation outlawing any practices that endanger the health or the physical and mental integrity of women, such as female circumcision."
"Who could fail to recall the human misery into which the Taliban plunged the eleven million women of Afghanistan in 1996?"
"Imprisoned behind their chadors, deprived of education and care, subjected to public floggings, they endured an existence beyond the bounds of human dignity in order to survive."
"It is our duty to exert pressure on the new government in order to ensure that the political wind of change sweeping through Afghanistan is translated into a genuine improvement in the position of women."
"The struggle for the recognition of women's rights should be an integral part of the foreign policy of the European Union."
"I am thinking here of the way in which we implement the MEDA programme and the Lomé Convention."
"The human rights clause is too often allowed to remain a dead letter for fear that its implementation would jeopardise the success of particular economic or trade agreements."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo has given us many avenues to explore in the fight against fundamentalism."
"The main line of approach I wish to highlight is that of the secular state, in other words the clear separation of religion and public affairs."
"This is a fundamental principle."
"In addition, the modernisation of political life must mean granting women their rightful place in the machinery of public administration."
"Nothing can justify the violation of an individual's fundamental rights and freedoms and which issue from that individual's inalienable dignity."
"I am therefore against fundamentalism as the expression of a way of thinking that denies a person - man or woman - their freedom and the right to choose their own destiny, and It is my view that the European Union must, with every means at its disposal, uphold and promote respect for human rights wherever they are violated."
"I cannot, however, accept the implicit censure of religious values and actual religion that the Izquierdo report makes, under cover of its censure of fundamentalism - and not only in relation to Christianity."
"It is one thing to freely espouse religious principles that accord with respect for human rights; it is quite another to impose rules of behaviour that entail the negation of individual dignity and the infringement of such rights."
"It is one thing to support the separation of Church and State, a position I fully share because it is the basis of the democratic system, but quite another to deny the Church and religious communities their right to freedom of expression in the name of secularity - in other words their right to interpret, according to their way of thinking, the facts of public and political life that govern citizens' lives."
"By adopting this report today, the European Parliament has done the cause of the freedoms we wish to promote no favours, because behind the censure of fundamentalism there is in fact a new form of fundamentalism that they are trying to impose on us: secular fundamentalism, which is just as deserving of censure as any other, in that they all deny the freedom of the individual to choose his or her own model in life."
"This is the reason why I voted against the report."
". I abstained on the amendments and voted against the final report because I am deeply concerned about the lack of balance within this report."
"Implicit in this report are western cultural values which make a presumption against the rights of women in Islam."
"I would question the wisdom of this parliament in producing this report and in doing so pass judgement on other cultures and their values."
"I believe this report was based on an external view and with very narrow and limited experience of Islamic lifestyle."
"I am deeply committed to equal opportunities for women everywhere, however, I believe it is crucial that women in different parts of the world can establish their own concept of freedom which takes into account the variety of different cultures and values they hold."
"The Members from the National Front will vote against Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's report."
"There are undoubtedly good elements, such as the principle that fundamentalism must not be fought with other types of fundamentalism of an opposite kind (recital M)."
"But the report also contains bad things and some very bad things."
"First of all, it is astonishing to note that this report, which was originally devoted to Islam and women, has now been renamed."
"The reason for this was undoubtedly to avoid shocking anyone and to comply with the sacrosanct dictates of political correctness."
"Moreover, to create a stronger sense of guilt among us, recital A recalls that 'the concept of fundamentalism originated in the 1920s in the USA, where it primarily referred to Christianity'."
"The eleven million Afghan women who were banned from all public places, deprived of education, barred from professional activity, deprived of care and exposed to beatings and floggings in the years when the fundamentalist Taliban ruled their country have a different story to tell about the origins of fundamentalism."
"In this report, the European Parliament presumes to lecture us on moral theology."
"On what authority?"
"With what qualifications?"
"How can it put religion and fundamentalism, the exercise of spiritual and temporal power, on the same footing?"
"The report systematically equates religion with fundamentalism in utter disregard of reality."
"The report, in fact, is a hotchpotch of hackneyed ideas, all of which have the same purpose, namely the inversion of decent values and the promotion of decadence."
"What can I say, for example, about paragraph 33, which calls on the heads of Christian churches to legitimise lesbianism?"
"This report is also yet another stepping stone in the pro-immigration policy pursued by Brussels."
"In fact, by some sleight of hand, paragraphs 18, 19, 21 and 24 use the fight against fundamentalism as a pretext to demand greater flexibility for governments to grant asylum to women from countries where fundamentalism is rife as well as using the framework of a preventive policy to secure the rapid social integration of the immigrants, refugees and minorities who are resident in the territory of the European Union."
"For these reasons, and many others besides, we must reject this report and resist any attempts by Parliament to replace it, under cover of the struggle against religious fundamentalism, with another report, which may be even more arbitrary than this one and which is the fruit of the fickle convictions and hostility to the natural order that characterise the present majority of this House."
"- (DE) It is vital for us to deal with this topic thoroughly, because many women suffer from fundamentalist discrimination."
"However, the report before us does not do justice to these problems and creates the impression that fundamentalism is the hallmark only of certain religions."
"The political, social and ideological fundamentalism directed at women with such devastating consequences for their quality of life has been ignored."
"Narrowing the scope of the report in this way is contrary to the Christian ethical order of values."
"This one-sidedly anti-religious approach means that an opportunity to deal appropriately with this important subject, ""Women and fundamentalism"", has been missed."
"The report is unbalanced, contradictory and undifferentiated, and accordingly totally undermines the battle against discrimination against women."
"Freedom of religion and protection against discrimination are key aspects of fundamental rights that cannot be played off against each other, and that is why I voted against this report."
"When the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities was given permission to draw up an own-initiative report on women and fundamentalism, we had reason to hope that this report would serve not only to reiterate our condemnation of the fact that millions of women in the world are deprived of elementary human and civil rights, which we know only too well."
"We also nurtured the hope that this report might provide a valuable contribution that would push things in the right direction wherever a push was needed."
"Regrettably, our rapporteur and those who followed her lead have squandered a great opportunity; this is illustrated, incidentally, by the fact that the report was adopted by only 15 votes to 7 in the Committee on Women's Rights, while the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was adopted by 18 votes with 11 abstentions."
"The two women rapporteurs are members of the Socialist Group in this Parliament."
"The uncooperative approach of the rapporteur for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, and indeed her obstinate determination not to listen to reason and to throw everything into the one pot, if I may say so, means that I cannot vote in favour of this report; for one thing, it indiscriminately accuses all religions for practising a pernicious form of fundamentalism, and another, more important reason is that it seeks to manipulate this resolution to define details of the asylum and immigration policies of the European Union."
"This is unacceptable and I am afraid that, through her obstinacy and the tone of her report, the rapporteur has done a great disservice to the women who are victims of fundamentalism and, hence, to this House too."
". (NL) All people are equal, but there are always people who have an interest in denying this."
"This leads to slavery, racism, colonial wars, child labour, subsistence wages for workers, underpayment for raw materials and the withholding of equal rights for women."
"In order to maintain their position, some privileged parties draw on quotes from the Bible or the Koran which are supposed to justify their misconduct."
"Only in the past few centuries have women in different European countries acquired the same rights as men, such as the right to vote, the right to work, rights to equal remuneration, access to managerial roles, the right to dissolve a failed marriage and equal rights of inheritance."
"There is still a rearguard of men who are opposed to this."
"New to us is the increase - through immigration - of the number of men originating from cultures who oppose gender equality."
"Some of them keep their daughters at home, marry them off and penalise them for looking for contact with boys independently."
"I fully endorse the proposal by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities not to use family law from the countries of origin as a basis, not to support the States that discriminate against women and also to bring women who are persecuted on grounds of gender under the asylum law."
"The report on 'women and fundamentalism' addresses many important issues."
"It is indisputably the case that women in large parts of the world are at present denied their rights and suffer oppression in the name of what we call religious, political or ideological fundamentalism."
"As Christian Democrats, we vigorously condemn these human rights infringements and condemn the treatment to which women have been, and are, exposed in, for example, Afghanistan under the Taliban regime."
"However, the report contains such basic shortcomings that we cannot, in the end, support it."
"For example, there is no definition of what is meant by fundamentalism."
"Even though it can more or less be inferred that what we are talking about here are violent and repressive regimes or forms of, in particular, religious belief, the report does not successfully distinguish between what, in that case, is to be viewed as fundamentalism and what are to be regarded as ordinary religion and religious institutions."
"On a number of occasions, the report states that religion is something private and that religious institutions should not interfere in 'the public and political life of the state'."
"We believe in a vigorous civil society, of which the churches too should be a part, and do not wish to remove any right to participate in ongoing public debate."
"I abstained on this report."
"I believe that it is important to guarantee women's rights."
"Fundamentalism exists in all areas of society and not only in Islam, an idea constantly repeated in the report."
"The report is one-sided and condemns only a few states that do not recognise women's rights."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.58 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on Transatlantic relations including steel import tariffs."
"Almost six months to the day after the events of 11 September, one can only be extremely surprised that, in the progress report on transatlantic relations which has been drawn up by the Presidency of the European Union, such a relatively small part has been devoted to the lessons to be drawn from those events."
"One might have thought that the tragedy of 11 September would prompt the countries of Europe to engage in some soul-searching on the reasons why the international Islamic terrorist network chose Europe as a location for the bases from which they struck at the United States."
"So what particular facilities do our countries offer, and how can these be rooted out?"
"What consequences should be drawn from the exploitation of asylum procedures by terrorist networks, etc.?"
"Our police forces have certainly worked hard in close cooperation with the U.S. authorities."
"Their enquiries have revealed the extent to which terrorists have set up bases in our countries."
"When it comes to analysing the significance of 11 September, on the other hand, a considerable gulf is developing between the two sides of the Atlantic, with one side regarding it as an isolated operation and the other as a manifestation of the new global terrorist scene, dominated by hyperterrorism."
"The communication from the Council indicates this."
"The effective measures to deal with the nature and scale of the common threat is not its main concern and a very minimalist response seems to be envisaged."
"There is only a vague mandate to draw up, sometime or other, an agreement on mutual judicial assistance."
"This, Mr President, is a strange and dangerous divergence which may well seriously encumber transatlantic relations and our own security."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is extremely disappointing that when we talk about the transatlantic relations between the European Union and the United States, we should also have to mention a steel war."
"This is extremely disappointing because we assumed that President Bush would be one of the main champions of the market economy, and not that he would belong with the campaigners for protectionist measures."
"It would, of course, be understandable if he were to take such measures for electoral reasons, but based on his undertaking to act in favour of free trade, this is, naturally, an incomprehensible attitude which we must unreservedly condemn."
"It is all the more disappointing since we have just started the fourth ministerial meeting in the framework of the Doha world trade talks, now being overshadowed by a measure of that kind."
"And that is not the last we have heard of it, for if I understand it correctly, the United States wants to adopt the same line for agricultural products too."
"Mr President, this is completely the wrong route to take."
"In the case of steel alone, I should like to point out that my country, the Netherlands, has made considerable efforts, together with your country, to restructure the steel industry."
"This has, both directly and indirectly, led to thousands of job losses in both our countries."
"This means, therefore, that we would have to pay the price for the lack of restructuring in the United States."
"In my opinion, the European Union has tabled sound proposals to consider whether a kind of fund could be set up to help restructure the steel industry in the United States."
"These proposals have, of course, been dismissed, which means, therefore, that we cannot make any more headway, and that the high costs of steel in America - certainly not simply due to the expensive dollar, but also, of course, due to the social security schemes and pensions in the steel industry - have, in fact, been passed on to us."
"In my view, Barcelona should be used to launch a diplomatic offensive, alongside the normal measures which you, Commissioner Lamy, have to take, obviously, by threatening the United States with countermeasures."
"However, what matters is that we should also use Barcelona to launch a diplomatic offensive in order to make it clear to the United States that protectionist measures of this kind only lead to major disruption in free trade and with it, to a huge upset in the creation of jobs."
"It is exactly the opposite signal from the one we need: we all want to create more jobs globally."
"Yet, what is happening now is the reverse."
"I would therefore call on the Commission and the Council - and I am pleased that the Council is here today - at least to ensure that initiatives are taken in Barcelona."
"The transatlantic relations between Europe and the US are once again under intense pressure."
"Europe and the United States are adopting increasingly threatening language with each other on a variety of topics."
"Only last week, President Bush unleashed a fresh trade war by restricting steel imports by means of import tariffs."
"The European Union was right to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation about these Draconian measures."
"Although our trade disputes with the US only concern one to two per cent of our trade and investment flows, they can cause a great deal of damage to our mutual relations."
"Trade disputes are always catching the headlines and undermine the political relationship, which is already very fragile at this time."
"Each new trade dispute is one too many."
"Consequently, more efforts must be made to nip potential conflicts in the bud as a matter of urgency."
"Transatlantic relations desperately need new positive impulses in the interest of us all."
"Mr President, the Greens have spent more than a decade endeavouring to expose the myths at the heart of the free-trade theory."
"Now we know for sure, as we have always suspected, that the rhetoric of the US and its major corporations was a sham."
"Far from being at the centre of a development agenda to help poorer nations out of poverty, the US tariff barriers reveal how that country uses trade rules to gain access to other people's markets, while protecting its own industrial interests at home."
"The US view is clearly that free trade is a one-way street for a superpower: good for US exporters, but not so good for US domestic industry."
"Contrast that with the unequivocal lectures given by the US to developing countries at the WTO meeting in Doha, to the effect that, by liberalising their markets, they will automatically reap the benefits of globalisation."
"Poverty eradication and sustainable development are somehow automatically meant to follow, yet poorer countries have known for a long time that this is often far from the case."
"Perhaps the one good thing that could come out of President Bush's unilateral introduction of tariffs on steel imports would be a much-needed serious debate about the flaws and weaknesses inherent in the free-trade model, because there is growing opposition to the global inequality inherent in its diktat that every country must put international competitiveness above all other domestic concerns."
"The reaction against this ranges from Indian farmers calling for an increase in tariffs to protect themselves from cheap food imports, through to steel workers, including fully restructured UK steel workers, who find that they will now still be unable to compete with Romanian steel exports."
"However, there are some retaliatory actions that the EU should consider, which will send the right signal to the US."
"I would like the Council and Commission's views on them."
"For example, since the US has refused to implement the Kyoto Protocol because of the perceived impact this would have on US business, the EU should levy an energy tax on all US-manufactured goods."
"Or we might consider the issue of a complete ban on all imports of US-produced GM foods, since US pressure exerted under free-trade rules has prevented EU ministers from reflecting popular opinion by banning such foods from markets here."
"The time is long overdue for the EU to call Mr Bush's bluff."
"Mr President, it is perfectly understandable that we should wish to examine the state of transatlantic relations in the light of the current situation."
"Let us begin with the decision to tax steel imports at rates of up to 30% and to impose quotas."
"As the main exporter to the United States, the Union is the primary target of these measures."
"And yet European steel imports have fallen by 33% since 1998, and so they are not the cause of the problems in the U.S. steel industry."
"Coming on top of the differences over hormone-treated beef and GMOs, these measures are likely to have serious economic and social repercussions for the European steel industry."
"The Commission would therefore be well advised to bring a complaint before the WTO, as Mr Lamy announced, as well as to apply retaliatory measures without delay against US exports."
"What is more, this latest decision by the Bush Administration testifies to a strengthened desire on the part of the US Government to adopt a unilateral approach in numerous domains: on the commercial and economic as well as the cultural and military fronts, and this last front is the focus of deep concern."
"The New York Times has just published a report indicating the existence of a secret Pentagon plan targeting Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria and North Korea and even Russia and China."
"The plan apparently envisages the possibility of using nuclear arms for offensive purposes, for example in the framework of an Arab-Israeli conflict."
"To quote John Isaac, a leading figure in the voluntary sector in the United States, Doctor Strangelove is alive and well and working in the Pentagon."
"This lurch by the American superpower, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, towards a permanent war footing poses an intolerable threat to the entire planet."
"The United States is redefining its role in the world around one single obsession, namely its own security."
"But in this world, right cannot be exclusively and invariably on the side of the Americans."
"It was impossible not to be concerned at the words of John Bolton, Under Secretary at the Department of State, who fired this broadside during the Conference on Disarmament, and I quote: 'Our policy is, quite simply, pro-American' and 'The United States ? will meet this threat with every method at our disposal'."
"This policy, which entails a 15% increase in the military budget, equivalent in monetary terms to the entire state development aid provided by all OECD member countries, along with the planned anti-missile defence system, is liable to provoke a new arms race."
"The fight against terrorism, on the other hand, involves identifying its roots and seeking real solutions."
"And again, the United States is obstructing progress towards a fairer world by refusing to ratify several international conventions, such as those on the rights of the child, disarmament, biological weapons, the International Criminal Court, climate change, the Kyoto process and a host of others, not to mention the failure of the United States to adopt a sufficiently impartial position on the Middle East conflict."
"We can no longer be silent on the death penalty, a crime perpetrated by the state, where it is administered by a superpower that seeks to impose its order and its values on the world."
"We want nothing to do with that particular value."
"Numerous people, including US citizens, reject that vision of the world and aspire to globalisation based on solidarity."
"This was one of the messages that emerged from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. Europe must take heed of the ardent hopes of those who are exhorting us to play our part in the pursuit of that goal."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, transatlantic trade relations have often come under strain."
"We have been able to resolve many trade conflicts in a professional way that satisfied both sides, but only because we have accepted binding rules for free and fair world trade within the framework of the WTO, and also because the WTO is the only international organisation that has a dispute resolution system that also provides for sanctions."
"However, with the punitive tariffs the United States is now imposing on steel imports, they are abandoning the common ground that we have so far occupied under the WTO."
"It is extremely hard for us Europeans to understand these measures, as they primarily hit our steel products."
"Almost half of Europe's steel exports to the USA are affected by these punitive tariffs."
"What is more, we Europeans can expect to suffer twice over from the American measures, because of diverted trade flows."
"That is something we are not prepared to accept."
"We will not support the Americans' game of playing off their workers' interests against those of our own workers."
"Over the past few years, the European steel industry has had great success in carrying out restructuring, but this has involved enormous job losses, making this a very painful process."
"It must be clear for the United States that it is not in their interest to undermine confidence in the WTO's system of multilateral rules and its impartial conflict resolution system at the beginning of the Doha Round."
"In the case of bilateral contacts with the USA, the European Union needs to firmly demonstrate to our American partner that this serious and unwarranted interference in free world trade will not be simply accepted, and that we will make use of the mechanisms currently at our disposal."
"Why is the Commission not considering using the mechanisms available to it in accordance with the decision of the WTO panel on US export promotion and taking countermeasures?"
"I believe it is now necessary for us to make that clear to the Unites States."
"Mr President, behaviour which is apparently irrational usually has an explanation."
"President Bush's decision to impose steel tariffs is irrational."
"The tariffs are a flagrant breach of world trade rules."
"There has been no sudden calamitous increase in imports."
"US steel has been uncompetitive and in deep trouble over a long period; it has not become so suddenly."
"Tariffs will not solve the US steel problem, but they will badly harm America's allies."
"They will destroy American jobs in other sectors and they will damage world trade relations."
"Knowing all this, why would President Bush take this irrational decision?"
"We know why."
"He wants to buy votes in steel-producing areas come November and is so desperate to do so that he will gladly sacrifice his international credibility - and we in the EU and others elsewhere in the world are meant to pay the price!"
"Talk about collateral damage!"
"Of course, this cannot be tolerated."
"We do not subsidise steel, we do not dump steel."
"We went through terrible times to make our steel competitive."
"Our market is open."
"There is no possible justification for this deliberate attack on the livelihood of European steel workers."
"Remember, this is the President who thinks he can provide world leadership."
"Global leader in military power he may be, but he is a global dunce in citizenship and respect for others."
"Commission: take him on."
"You have all of us behind you and you have the tools to ensure that you can act both legally and effectively."
"Go for it!"
"Mr President, I am dismayed at the United States' belligerency towards the free market in steel, particularly since free trade has been the hallmark of the USA since the 18th century."
"I am appalled at the concomitant weakening of the all-important transatlantic alliance that this creates: an alliance that is the world's greatest force for peace today and one that gives unrivalled opportunities for prosperity to the world's 1 billion poorest people."
"But since the European Union and the USA share essential values, I cannot believe that the US seriously intends to follow this destructive course of action."
"I therefore see this as a purely political manoeuvre - President Bush placating domestic and special-interest lobbies."
"We must be tough and then we will succeed."
"The cause is good."
"The arguments are correct."
"I firmly support the Commission and the Council of Ministers and I believe that with EU backing and pressure, the World Trade Organization will act correctly and throw out the US position, and that President Bush will welcome this."
"Mr President, the events of 11 September ought to have strengthened transatlantic relations by virtue of the emotions they unleashed and the solidarity displayed."
"On the contrary, it appears today that relations have been weakened."
"The North Atlantic Alliance, which took the decision to invoke Article 5 of its charter for the first time, is in crisis because the Americans did not see the need to enlist the aid of its organisational structure in the war in Afghanistan."
"NATO is mulling over this manifestation of unilateralism, and no one within the organisation wishes to see it as proof of the Americans' indifference towards their European allies."
"I too support this view and share the ensuing frustration, but I do not subscribe to the overall conclusions drawn from it."
"I have always been a proponent of the idea that the prevention and management of crises by the international community should be regionalised."
"Our experience at the start of the Balkan crisis showed us that sending in troops from all corners of the earth, from Vancouver to Vladivostok and from Moscow to Buenos Aires, for all its huge symbolic value, was not an efficient way to proceed."
"Effective intervention in the maintenance and restoration of peace in specific parts of the world depends on familiarity with the culture and history of the country in crisis."
"This is what prompted the international community to support the establishment of a pan-African peacekeeping force, for example."
"It is also what prompted the Americans to base their operations in Kabul directly on the provision of support to the Afghan forces who were opposed to the barbaric dictatorship of the Taliban."
"As I said in Brussels in 1993, the primary mission of NATO is to intervene in European territory and on the fringes of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, in order to guarantee and develop peace and stability throughout these areas."
"Within the Alliance, I believe it is legitimate that the Americans, who are aware of our prosperity, require us to assume an increasing share of the burden of maintaining a European defence system that has hitherto fallen almost entirely on them."
"I believe that Europe must prepare itself to take over a leadership role which the Americans are willing to transfer to us gradually."
"To this end, the governments of the Union must possess the necessary will and must provide the necessary resources."
"Do you believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that Europe is finally ready to assume this role?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up on what was said this morning."
"I believe that transatlantic relations are regularly subjected to crucial tests."
"What we are experiencing now is nothing new; it is not a new conflict."
"Steel is an old chestnut."
"As many Members have already indicated, we need to proceed with sufficient toughness."
"But we should also be guided by reason, wisdom and far-sightedness."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has pointed out that our relations are historical ones and that we have many values in common, but that we need to shift from a crisis situation to a process of dialogue."
"I would certainly support him in that."
"However, this also means that the Council needs to consider new initiatives."
"It was the Spanish Presidency that established the new transatlantic agenda."
"I believe that the Spanish Presidency should also undertake an analysis and a review and present new proposals at the next summit."
"I would like to ask what work you have done on this so far and what the nature of the Spanish Presidency's proposals will be."
"We need an update, as James Elles said this morning."
"We need an EU strategy that goes beyond what we have at present."
"The Commission proposal is good, but it does not go far enough, and it does not cover all factors."
"In particular, it does not include a sufficiently clear EU strategy."
"Commissioner Lamy said today that he is investigating several areas, including intellectual property and the auditing of accounts."
"In my own report, which I shall be presenting on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy together with James Elles for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall be presenting some proposals on this."
"In particular, you will be interested to see that economic relations are very close and that in many sectors it is already fair to talk about a transatlantic market."
"That does not of course mean that trade conflicts can just be glossed over, quite the opposite."
"A small delegation of us will be in Toledo on Monday, and the topic of relations between the USA and the WTO will be on the agenda."
"I would be grateful if you could briefly say something more about our approach at that meeting."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, can anyone tell me what has been happening in the United States since Mr Bush took up office?"
"With a straight face, he has proclaimed unilateral measures, measures which a) are counter-productive to transatlantic relations, b) do not conform to WTO agreements and c) will lead to a wave of protectionism in the world."
"A 30% import tariff on steel, mainly aimed at the European Union, is a great injustice."
"Has our European steel sector in recent years not been restructured very successfully?"
"We do not have overcapacity now."
"Due to the import restriction in the United States, the price of steel will increase over there, upon which the urgent restructuring of the American steel sector can be funded."
"However, the outcome for Europe is an increase in imports through dumping on our market, which translates into falling steel prices, with all its implications, particularly for employment."
"A company such as Corus in the Netherlands and in England will be hit extremely hard, for this latter scenario will lead to a huge number of job losses."
"I would like to ask the European Union, and especially Commissioner Lamy and the Presidency, what does it intend to do about this?"
"Mr President, I was Minister for Steel in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 1989 and was responsible for an industry which was over-manned, uncompetitive, riddled with old-fashioned practices and heading for disaster."
"When it was privatised, it experienced a traumatic time with the loss of plants and jobs, and morale was at rock bottom."
"However, it had to be endured to secure any future at all."
"We do not want that to happen again because an outside agency such as the United States has seemingly broken WTO rules, especially since the US itself should restructure old plants, rationalise employment and pension practices so that its own industry is improved, but not at the expense of European industry."
"I find it disturbing, to say the least, that Romania is one of the countries exempted by the United States of America."
"Romania is home to Sidex, closely connected to Ispat, the firm controlled by Lakshmi Mittal, which gave Tony Blair and the Labour Party GBP 125 000 for their general election campaign and then lobbied President Bush harder than anyone else to impose 30% tariffs that would protect his United States and Romanian steel interests at a potentially deadly cost to British plants and jobs."
"Just whose side is Tony's crony on?"
"It does not appear to be British and European workers, since Mittal will make an estimated USD 1 billion from this deal."
"That GBP 125 000 gift was a real steal - a cheap and cynical investment that will literally pay dividends."
"Therefore, the Labour Government is not our answer - the Commission is."
"We must support the Commissioner in his determined attempts to protest and, if necessary, retaliate - but carefully."
"We need the OECD talks to continue and to produce success."
"How about some targeted action against products from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia?"
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the transatlantic relationship is very important: it was a priority of the last Spanish Presidency and is again under the current one, and we must therefore do whatever we can to preserve it."
"What is happening is that, like any relationship, there are two sides to it, and we are now seeing that the Bush Administration is strongly tempted to act on its own; that is, to practise the Frank Sinatra doctrine: 'I'll do it my way', both in politics - I only have two minutes and I cannot expand on this - and in trade."
"Trade never used to be an area that tested this relationship: we considered trade disputes to be an exception, while trade benefits were the rule."
"Now, however, they have gone too far, on both steel and another product that is less talked about: clementines."
"The cases are different: clementines affect just one country (the region, by the way, where Commissioner Solbes comes from) and steel affects us all."
"Both cases go against the WTO rules without any justification at all and, what is more, they imply self-punishment by the United States."
"We have to withstand both the indirect damage - I believe traffic diversion measures can be taken - and the direct damage."
"There are several possibilities: one is to take action within the WTO, but that will take time and, in the long run, we shall all be dead; there is also the possibility of laissez-faire, of doing nothing, because the derived industries that import steel inputs will become less competitive and therefore we will be able to take over from them; but what I believe we must to is act immediately."
"The provisional measures that can be adopted are within easy reach, covered by the panel judgment on the Foreign Sales Task Corporation, and therefore we must act immediately."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, in a well-known passage in Julius Caesar there is a sentence that reads: 'The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves that we are underlings.'"
"I think this quotation is particularly appropriate to this moment, because the seriousness of the problem does not lie so much in the protectionist measures that affect the United States as in the reaction that the European Union must have to these aggressive trade moves, relations in which the steel and clementine issues - referred to by my good friend Mr Westendorp - are not just isolated incidents but have their causes and their consequences."
"Mention has been made in this House of the ban on imports of hormone-treated meat; the banana war; the export aid declared illegal by a WTO panel; the discussions that took place when the competition policy and certain mergers were implemented by Commissioner Monti; and the aid for certain American products."
"What worries me most in this love-hate relationship, however, is not so much what has happened but what the future holds, which is that the Republican administration is on the point of succumbing to the temptation of protectionism, as shown right now in two cases: steel, which has been explained enough - and on this I fully endorse what my colleague Mr Atkins has said - and clementines, which have also been mentioned by Mr Westendorp."
"In the latter case, as this House knows, the United States unilaterally closed its borders on 30 November."
"The Spanish government and my Parliamentary Group brought these events to the Commission's attention on 12 December and the Commission then took immediate action."
"Thank you for this promptness."
"In addition, on 14 February the Spanish government requested that, in view of the breakdown of the talks that had been entered into, action should be started within the WTO."
"What I am asking right now is that the same efficacy that people are trying to demonstrate on the matter of steel should also be demonstrated in the case of clementines. This is an even more flagrant case because, while in the first case it is a matter of imposing tariffs, which in my view are abusive and completely illegal, in the second it is about an even more drastic measure: the closing of borders."
"This matter really does need to be taken to the WTO, but they will only reach a solution to this conflict, in the case of clementines, once several harvests have passed, and I therefore call for immediate compensation and reparations."
"What we must do is make the United States sit round a negotiating table and work out a solution to the steel and clementines issues, by setting in motion the forceful measures to which my good friend and compatriot Mr Westendorp has referred."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, in the wake of 11 September the United States seemed to want to engage in a policy of broad partnership on an international scale."
"It paid off its arrears to the UN and held consultations with the Europeans and many others."
"However, since the State of the Union address, a hard unilateralist line has come to the fore."
"This change of course appears to create the risk of serious aberrations, judging by the Pentagon report on the revision of US policy on the use of nuclear weapons, which could include the possibility of a first strike against Russia, China and many other countries."
"This creates a difficult and disturbing atmosphere for transatlantic relations, which is compounded by the recent decisions on steel. At the present time, it is important that Europe should reaffirm its role as a major partner whose friendship and solidarity depend on reciprocity."
"This is essential if we want a balanced relationship between Europe and the United States, but it is even more essential for the stability of the world."
"Europe must emphasise the impossibility of dealing with the instability, the dangers, the imbalance of today's world by merely wielding a big stick; it must emphasise that we also need to gain the upper hand in the struggle for peace, that we need to devote the same energy today to the fight against inequalities in the field of development and to defusing hotbeds of tension like the Middle East as has been applied to the struggle against terrorism."
"As far as steel is concerned, Europe must take a firm line."
"It is right and proper to issue a reminder, as Commissioner Lamy did this morning, of the need to submit to multilateral disciplines."
"It is also crucial that we do not hesitate to ensure that other governments comply with rulings that the WTO makes in favour of Europe."
"It will be obvious that I refer here to the Foreign Sales Corporation."
"And so I should like to ask the Commission if it has the intention of applying the retaliatory trade sanctions that the WTO has authorised us to impose, given the decisions that the United States has just taken on steel imports and the violations of trade agreements that the United States has already committed through its use of export subsidies."
"Relations between the European Union and the United States are inextricably linked."
"We have strong bonds rooted in our respective pasts and we share many common values."
"The strengthening of our long-standing transatlantic relationship is to our mutual benefit."
"However, this has to be a relationship based on equality and mutual respect."
"In America's hour of need, after the 11 September attacks, Europe responded with unstinting support and solidarity, and rightly so."
"Regrettably, though, the same sort of solidarity and cooperation has not been reciprocated in US foreign policy."
"Prior to 11 September, it was absent on the issue of Kyoto."
"It is non-existent with regard to a common approach on the Middle East, which is our most critical contemporary political problem, and on which the US unfortunately adopts a partisan role."
"It was cast aside by the recent decision on the part of the US to impose import tariffs on steel."
"Furthermore, the return to US unilateralism - especially evident in its perceived intention to extend the war on terrorism to Iraq - displays contempt for our role in international affairs."
"It would seem that for the US, the transatlantic relationship is simply one of convenience, to be used when it suits, but ignored when US policy and interests take priority."
"All these experiences, particularly those in recent days, underline how essential it is for the EU to strengthen its foreign policy role, including its defence and military capabilities, so that a proper equilibrium can be established in our transatlantic relationship."
"Mr President, this week in Barcelona the European Council will gather in order to seek to build upon the Lisbon Process."
"At that meeting, we will be pressing for more action to be taken in relation to deregulation, for more liberalisation, ensuring that we learn the lessons of employment flexibility."
"There are those of us who have felt ever since we have arrived in the European Parliament that there is a lot of rhetoric in this place about free trade, but that there is also a great deal of protectionism with Member States here in Europe."
"The entire agenda in Europe of taking forward a uniform competition policy and bearing down on state aid is geared towards ensuring that we have free trade."
"In those circumstances, those of us who count ourselves as the best friends of the United States are hugely disappointed by the action that the US President has taken."
"It is not putting it too strongly to say that, in a sense, we feel betrayed by it."
"I do not link this to our support for the United States following the events of 11 September."
"The events of 11 September were so horrific that they should not be linked with any sort of agreement in any other policy area."
"But for those of us who have been pointing to the United States as an example of a deregulated and liberalised economy, it has been a shattering blow to see the way in which President Bush, faced with the difficulties that his steel industry is encountering, has gone for protectionism."
"What is even worse is to read in the Financial Times today a justification of this action from Robert Zoellick, the US Trade Representative."
"I feel sorry for Mr Zoellick, whom again we would regard as a friend of British Conservatives, because I must say that article destroys any credibility that he had in terms of discussion of trade issues."
"The United States representatives watching this debate need to know that, while we may have heard from the usual suspects in terms of anti-Americanism, those of us who are friends of the United States feel very badly let down indeed."
"Transatlantic relations are now in stormy waters."
"The dingy of the European Union is struggling hard to cope with the waves of American power display."
"The steel crisis is mainly political."
"President Bush is backed internally by his electorate."
"Retribution or a political reaction were not likely from the outside world, which opened up the opportunity to pass on the problem of unemployment to the outside world."
"The European Union dingy is now wearily following a course of legal procedures."
"We must take full advantage of all the options and means available to us within the WTO."
"Our retaliation must be convincing. But even so, it does not give much hope of a positive outcome in the short term."
"Our boat should be big enough to weather the storms. But we also need good helmsmanship."
"A political crisis does require a political answer, and we must deliberate upon this."
"Meanwhile, I should like to urge the Commission, and above all, Commissioner Liikanen, to take political action internally."
"We must build a solid ship."
"We hardly have a steel policy left, let alone a steel strategy."
"We are on an ocean without any rescue boats for the workers."
"If there is anything to learn from the steel crisis, it is that European steel policy should be restored."
"Mr President, we can all stand here today and condemn the actions of the US Government in imposing these unjust, illegal and completely unfair tariffs on steel products imported into the USA."
"We all know that the tariffs have simply been put there for short-term political advantage and we regret it for that alone."
"But we must also stand united behind some clear, firm and serious action."
"We must show we mean business."
"The Commission must now act swiftly within the WTO to overturn these tariffs."
"We must see safeguarding measures brought in to prevent a flood of cheap imports from damaging our own industry."
"Those measures must be implemented in respect of all non-EU sources of steel in the form of quotas based on 1998 import levels if we are to do a proper job in protecting our own industry."
"I do not recommend fighting fire with fire in this circumstance."
"Instead, we must dump a large cold bucket of logic, common sense and international law onto the head of the US Government and bring it to its senses."
"Mr President, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has listened very carefully to all the speeches made during this debate and we have taken very good note of the positions expressed."
"As the Foreign Minister has already stated in his introductory speech as President-in-Office of the Council, our commercial policy is a common one, and the European Commission has full autonomy and authority to make whatever decisions are appropriate."
"Accordingly, I believe the Commission has, on behalf of the European Union, taken a firm stand on the steel problem, a stand that was publicly expressed and unanimously adopted by the Council of Ministers last Monday."
"I therefore believe we must trust the Commission's ability - as I have said - to deal with this matter, protest as appropriate, call for suitable compensation and use retaliatory measures, while fully complying with World Trade Organisation rules."
"The Presidency-in-Office of the Council believes that our most powerful option is to call on the United States to comply with the rules that all the founders of the World Trade Organisation have set for themselves."
"It is therefore very important that the European Union should set the example that we are the first to comply with not only the procedures but also the rules of the World Trade Organisation."
"The clementine issue has also been mentioned - another trade issue with the United States that has yet to be resolved."
"In this respect, the Presidency-in-Office can only say that it is up to the Member State affected - in this case Spain - to submit its claim to the Article 133 Committee and the Commission will act in accordance with what the Committee decides."
"Everything seems to indicate that the measures adopted are disproportionate to the alleged threat from the so-called Mediterranean fly, which has been the argument used by the United States to ban the import of clementines."
"These points will be assessed by the Article 133 Committee, which deals with such matters, and the Commission will be given a mandate to act accordingly."
"With regard to other considerations that have been expressed here on the United States' lamentable tendency to act unilaterally in many areas, not only in these matters of trade policy but also in other matters of general policy, the Presidency can only agree with many of the positions expressed here. I therefore believe that the forthcoming EU-US Summit to be held in Washington on 2 May will be a good opportunity for the Presidency of the Council and the Presidency of the Commission to remind the United States' President that the spirit of the Transatlantic Declaration, which, as has been mentioned, was signed in 1995, binds the parties to maintain a spirit of cooperation, to seek common ground and not to seek ground that separates us and, in the fine tradition of the intense relationship between the United States and Europe, it is in the interests of both parties, the United States and Europe, to seek points of agreement and not of disagreement."
"Positions that separate the United States not only from the European Union but also from the general current of international opinion are, of course, not at all helpful in finding points of agreement."
"I believe this debate has been highly fruitful; we shall incorporate many of the opinions we have heard here into the general corpus on which we shall reflect in order to prepare the forthcoming transatlantic summit, and so I should like to thank you, Mr President, and this Parliament for all the ideas that have been put forward in this debate."
"Mr President, I should first like to point out that the Commission also believes that our relations with the United States are essential, but that must never stop us from firmly carrying out the actions needed to defend the Union's interests."
"Today's debate has drifted towards the existing conflicts between the United States and the European Union, particularly the steel dispute, although other matters have also been mentioned."
"The major problem facing us is what we should do."
"According to some of you, the best formula is to establish a link between the steel dispute and other trading problems with the Union."
"Really, though, as our strong point is upholding multilateralism, it is reasonable that we should attack that contradiction by applying multilateral rules."
"We do not think it is a good solution and it is not the one that best serves the Union's long-term interests."
"Others amongst you have suggested linking this issue to other matters; the Foreign Sales Act has been mentioned, as has the matter of hormones."
"Again we wonder whether seeking a package solution dependent on a political debate is the formula we should be using."
"We believe that the strength of our position with the United States lies in the need to comply with what has been agreed multilaterally."
"This must be the road we take; we therefore consider that the first decision, without any question, is to use all existing procedures within the World Trade Organisation, and by all procedures we mean not only those that will take a long time to implement but also the necessary retaliatory measures, but all this must be done through the World Trade Organisation."
"This may, of course, make it necessary for us to implement specific safeguard clauses which, I may say in advance, we intend will affect developing countries as little as possible, since our opinion on safeguard clauses is not to close off our markets but to maintain our traditional trade relations with our suppliers."
"Clearly, the possibility some of you have suggested of making restrictive voluntary agreements to reduce exports is not compatible with the World Trade Organisation."
"With regard to the clementines case - the President-in-Office of the Council has already referred to this matter - I shall only point out that we are negotiating with the United States in an attempt to find a solution to the problem before the next harvest."
"Clearly, in this case too, just as in the last one, we are prepared to use all the legal resources established in the World Trade Organisation."
"The Commission has been pleased to see the broad consensus among the European institutions regarding the need to make multilateral institutions work and to tackle the challenges of globalisation by seeking the best of solutions with our American counterparts and seeking to ensure that the unilateral option is not the one chosen."
"I endorse Pascal Lamy's comments here this morning that it would be fundamental to seek an agreement, as we have seen here, among all those supporting a new and positive boost to transatlantic relations."
"However, that must not mean failing to tackle existing problems with all the means or all the facts at our disposal."
"As you know, right now we are studying and working on various options, and any new contribution this House might make would be welcome."
"Lastly, I should like to thank you for your unambiguous support for the firm line held by the Commission."
"We hope that the resolution you are to vote on will strengthen the European Union's positions on this fundamental issue for us all."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to apologise for the absence of our committee chairman, Mr Bouwman, who unfortunately is ill this week, so that, as Parliament's rapporteur on this issue it has fallen to me to introduce the question."
"Parliament has long been aware of the problems concerning the legal base for the inclusion of third country nationals on the same footing as European Union citizens under the proposed simplification of modernisation of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71."
"As Members know, this regulation seeks to coordinate social security systems between Member States for people moving and working across borders."
"Some of the reservations I have heard voiced about the extension of this regulation to third country nationals border, at times, on the xenophobic rather than the rational."
"You will be aware that the legal opinion provided by Parliament's Legal Services felt that Articles 42 and 308 of the Amsterdam Treaty, as initially proposed by the Commission, formed the appropriate legal base for this extension as well as for the regulation as a whole."
"The European Parliament agreed, as did the majority of the Member States, and that legal base provided for the equal treatment of third country nationals legally resident in the European Union and for the full involvement of Parliament through the codecision procedure."
"Additionally, this parity of legal base seemed to many of us to provide a strong signal in terms of the recognition of the contribution from third country nationals to the life of the European Union and certainly met the twin aims of simplification of the process and natural justice."
"To me that parity was a clear signal of an inclusive Europe."
"I and many others find ourselves at a loss, on reading the Khalil judgment from the European Court of Justice, to understand why this should materially change the legal base on which Council and Commission are now proposing the extension of the regulation."
"The Khalil case, insofar as legal experts have explained it to me, involves people covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 already, should they be allowed to legally reside in another Member State and thus cross borders."
"They are included under this judgment because they are stateless people with rights to social security equivalent to those of nationals in the state in which they now reside as a result of international historical agreements."
"But no right of free movement is provided for by their inclusion under the regulation."
"The regulation does not grant freedom of movement."
"It maintains certain rights for those who move through coordination of social security systems."
"Council's statement last December and the Commission's new proposal do not explain the change in the legal base."
"They simply state it."
"It is an explanation that Parliament is now seeking."
"What specifically in the Khalil judgment has led Council to its conclusion that Article 63.4 is the correct base, when this was not the majority opinion before?"
"Has the European Court of Human Rights case of Gaygusuz v Austria providing for nationality being no barrier to equal treatment to nationals in relation to social security not led to a conclusion of equal treatment in relation to the regulation and thus the parallel legal base?"
"And why should the European Parliament not be involved in this area which is directly relevant to the lives of so many people?"
"Hence our desire as well also to clarify the situation of workers in accession countries during any transition period when they will not be enjoying freedom of movement."
"Council and Commission will also be aware of this House's concern for the complex situation facing cross-border workers."
"The Belgian Presidency had put forward a number of proposals in this area, yet the agreement reached at present is only minimal, as parameter 8 concerning medical treatment shows."
"So what are the prospects for further improvements for this group of workers?"
"We are also asking the Commission for its perspective on a number of issues where Council seems to be less enthusiastic about the Commission perspective as well."
"We would also ask whether the increasing links between the tax and the social security systems are being addressed by Council and Commission, either within the context of the regulation or elsewhere."
"We are all well aware of the desire of Council and Commission to see increased mobility within the workforce and, as a Member of Parliament's Committee on Petitions, I know as well that a number of those who work in other Member States find their situation made more difficult by the lack of effective information, but also by anomalies within the coordination system."
"Many of us are concerned that Council appears reluctant to make free movement an easy reality."
"We know this is a complex administrative issue, but many of the niceties of exclusion of certain benefits and complex rules simply appear as barriers."
"It appears at times that it is easier to move ball-bearings around the European Union than it is to move people."
"Mr President, on 6 February 2002 the Commission presented to the Council a proposal for a regulation to extend the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to nationals of third countries who, solely as a result of their nationality, are not covered by those provisions."
"The said proposal is based on paragraph 4 of Article 63 of the EC Treaty."
"The Council has agreed on the possibility of using paragraph 4 of Article 63 as a legal basis, as the Commission proposed."
"In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 63, the Council will have to adopt measures which define the conditions under which nationals of third countries, who reside legally in a Member State, may reside in other Member States."
"The Council considers that Article 42 of the EC Treaty, interpreted in the light of the judgements of the Court of Justice - in particular the judgement handed down in the Khalil case C-95/99 - does not seem to offer a sufficient legal basis for this extension."
"In fact, Mr President, it can be deduced from the Khalil judgement that the Court has not criticised the inclusion of stateless persons and refugees in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, based on Article 51 - currently Article 42 - of the EC Treaty, solely insofar as it involves a small category of people, in relation to which the Member States have made international commitments."
"In fact, the Court decided as follows: 'The Council cannot be criticised for having, in the exercise of the powers which have been conferred on it under Article 51 of the EEC Treaty, also included stateless persons and refugees resident on the territory of the Member States in order to take into account the abovementioned international obligations of those States."
"As the Advocate General pointed out in paragraph 59 of his Opinion, 'coordination excluding stateless persons and refugees would have meant that the Member States, in order to ensure compliance with their international obligations, had to establish a second coordination regime designed solely for that very restricted category of persons'."
"Therefore, the Council believes that the applicable procedure for adopting a decision should be the one laid down in the EC Treaty."
"If the legal basis adopted for extending coordination to third-country nationals turns out to be paragraph 4 of Article 63, the Council will have to give its opinion in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 67."
"In relation to border workers, the Council has reached an agreement in principle in the field of sickness and unemployment benefits according to which the situation of former border worker pensioners will have to be studied."
"According to the provisions of the current Regulation, the border worker may receive healthcare in the territory of the competent State, but does not enjoy this right as a pensioner."
"For reasons of continuity, so that treatments already started may continue, the former border worker should be allowed to continue to receive sickness benefits in the territory of the State in which they formerly worked."
"Finally, with regard to the unemployed worker, who during their last job resided in the territory of a Member State other than the competent State, the main objective is to incorporate them as best as possible into the labour markets."
"Furthermore, it will be appropriate to guarantee the social protection of the unemployed while bearing in mind the financial aspects of the issue and guaranteeing effective control."
"As regards the relationship between taxation and social security, this is an issue which essentially falls within the competence of the Member States and not the Union."
"It should be stressed that, in a general sense, the guidelines for employment for 2002 draw attention to the need to adapt the tax and benefit structures in such a way that they do not have a negative effect on participation in active life, particularly in relation to women."
"Nationals of candidate countries who become Community nationals purely as a result of accession will be included, by virtue of that accession, within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71."
"The possible exceptions to this principle, which could take the form, for example, of transitional periods, will be determined within the framework of the accession agreements, which are currently under negotiation."
"Mr President, in response to the doubts raised in the oral question by Mr Bouwman, I would like to stress the following on behalf of the Commission: firstly, in relation to the legal basis, we agree with the view of the President-in-Office of the Council; in our opinion, the appropriate legal basis is paragraph 4 of Article 63 of the EC Treaty."
"There is no need to read out its actual text, since the Presidency has already done so."
"We believe that the Khalil sentence, of October last year, raises the inadequacy of the legal basis of Article 51 (currently 42) and obliges us to reconsider that of the Decision proposed in 1997."
"Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, with the new provisions of Title 4, we believe that the appropriate legal basis is paragraph 4 of Article 63 of that Treaty, while bearing in mind that Article 308 of the Treaty can only be applied if there is no other legal basis."
"You also ask for the Commission's opinion on a series of parameters proposed by the Council, specifically parameters 6, 10 and 11, relating to agreements between countries, unemployment benefits and family benefits."
"With regard to the first point, the Commission believes that parameter 6 is acceptable, since this possibility is laid down in the current Regulation."
"The Commission believes it positive that in the Regulation, unlike the current one, criteria are established to maintain these agreements, especially in cases which are more favourable to the person affected."
"Secondly, with regard to unemployment benefits, the Commission regrets the lack of progress in relation to parameter 10, which does not provide any essential modification of the current provisions, above all because it does not offer any specific solution in the relation to the situation of border workers."
"With regard to family benefits, parameter 11 does not correspond exactly to the Commission's proposal, but, in any event, the Commission considers it positive that that parameter intends to guarantee the beneficiary the maximum amount of benefits."
"This parameter will improve the situation of pensioners and orphans in comparison with the Regulation, since these people will benefit from the same provisions applicable to the same category of family benefits as self-employed and salaried workers."
"The relationship between taxation and social security is another of your questions."
"It is true that Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 refers to the coordination of social security systems in the Member States."
"There are no explicit rules for the coordination of these tax systems and this issue is largely resolved by the bilateral agreements on double taxation which have been reached by almost all the Member States."
"The agreements follow the model of the OECD, which means that, in most cases, the income from salaried work (and also freelance work) is only subject to the taxes of either the country in which the work is carried out or the country of residence."
"Therefore, if they are subject to the taxes of the Member State in which they work, that country has competence both in terms of taxation and in terms of social security."
"The Court of Justice confirmed that, in the absence of harmonisation at Community level, the Member States have the competence to establish the criteria for allocation of fiscal competence in order to eliminate double taxation, but, in doing so, it is logical that they should respect the principles of Community legislation and, amongst others, that of the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of nationality."
"My final comments relate to enlargement."
"Firstly, the negotiations with the candidate countries, as the Presidency has said, on Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, in its part relating to Chapter 2, have provisionally been concluded - or have been concluded - with all the countries apart from Estonia, and this Chapter 2 also includes the coordination of social security systems."
"However, the annexes are still under negotiation."
"It has been entrusted to the administrative Committee for the social security of migrant workers, which will shortly present to the Council's working groups the results of its debates on entries, which the candidate countries have asked to be included in those annexes."
"Finally, Regulation (EEC) No 1481/71 will be applied to nationals of candidate countries as soon as they accede to the European Union, since there is no provision for a transitional period in the field of the coordination of social security systems."
"Mr President, I am both angry and sad. Why?"
"Because I am not getting a straight answer from the Council or the Commission."
"Within this internal market, we are in favour of the free movement of goods, people and services."
"I have included people, for this is particularly a problem in border regions. However, the answers that I am receiving are inadequate."
"If I consider my own region, I notice that the labour market there can no longer function without workers from abroad."
"Needless to say, we must make the conditions attractive for these people to come."
"This means, first of all, that we must ensure that shop-floor workers who work in a Member State pay both taxes and social premiums in the same way."
"I would therefore like to know whether it would not be possible to draft a kind of 1408 that applies to the fiscal status of border workers."
"This is my first question."
"My second question is directed at the Council concerning what is so nicely termed 'Council parameters'."
"Incidentally, I very much regret that the Commissioner is not present, for he is truly competent in this field and knows how long this issue has been outstanding."
"Studying these Council parameters - and, Mr Miguelez, I hold you in very high esteem - I note that what you have written in the Council parameters is diametrically opposed to what has been presented to us in recent jurisdiction by the European Court of Justice."
"And I wonder whether you really believe that you can get this issue, in which Parliament has also been involved since Amsterdam in terms of codecision, approved."
"For the aspects you mention, such as sickness benefit and child benefit, are incompatible with what has been pronounced, and the Commissioner will back this up."
"So, with all due respect to Mrs Lambert, for she made some valid points on third-country problems, among others, which I endorse, a change is needed here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we had two reasons for asking these questions. First, to obtain some clarification, and second to get things moving in this whole field."
"Clarification, because we Members of Parliament soon realised that the contributions made by Commissioner Solbes and the representative of the Council did not make it clear why the legal basis has been changed in Article 63(4)."
"It was simply stated, without any justification being given."
"Since Tampere, we have taken very seriously the Council's announcement that the legal status of third-country nationals, that is to say citizens who live and work in the EU, who are legally resident here and do not come from one of the 15 Member States, should be approximated to that of Member States' nationals."
"Europe's institutions want more clarity and transparency without waiting for the Convention."
"However, these new proposals are creating more confusion than before, because, if we have to deal with two different legal bases, that is certainly very confusing."
"It is also unsatisfactory because it rules out codecision by Parliament."
"What a short-sighted strategy on the part of the Commission!"
"You know that up to now we have always been on your side when it comes to modernisation, to changing and improving things for Europe's employees, Europe's workers."
"I think it would be not only very short-sighted but also a dangerous strategy to exclude Parliament at this stage."
"It is of course possible for the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to apply to opt out under Regulation 1408, and that would really be disastrous, because no one in this House could welcome a further social policy opt-out."
"The result would be a patchwork quilt of a social policy which would certain not confirm and win the trust that employees ought to have in Europe's institutions."
"So we are all delighted that the United Kingdom has stopped opting out of social policy."
"Is this an attempt to reintroduce that?"
"The second reason for our question was of course to get the plans for reform moving."
"I remember that an undertaking to update this directive was given in Edinburgh back in 1992."
"Please note - an update."
"I would like to remind you once again that Regulation 1408 does not involve harmonising social systems, but is about coordinating the framework conditions, as it were, in order to encourage and support our citizens in making use of their scope for mobility in Europe."
"Every couple of weeks there are fresh appeals from the Council and the Commission to young people, to workers, to the public in general, to take advantage of this freedom of movement."
"However, I would like to say here that the framework conditions consist of some very complicated and unwieldy legislation."
"In Germany we would say that is a book with seven seals, a closed book if you like, even for the initiated."
"The 12 parameters that we now have before us do not add up to the qualitative improvement that we actually promised ourselves."
"I naturally agree with the critical comments made by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and also with the criticism that you expressed on behalf of the Commission, Mr Solbes."
"The other point I should have mentioned was the time frame."
"We had expected that the Spanish Presidency would have presented a methodical, reasonable and effective proposal by June."
"Mr President, I agree with the Commission's and the Council's interpretation of the Treaties. Of course Article 63 is to be used as a legal basis for guaranteeing third countries' nationals freedom of movement."
"Moreover, I have also in the past put forward the view that the actual legal basis was not perhaps the most important thing right now, for what is at issue is guaranteeing the rights of these people."
"I think, however, that, in the long term, we must arrive at a situation in which Parliament also obtains direct influence on this area."
"It will require a change to the Treaties, and I am ashamed to say that, during the negotiations in connection with the Nice Treaty, my own country resisted our obtaining influence over these matters because of the Danish reservation."
"Moreover, I quite agree with Mrs Weiler that we must get away from a situation in which some countries are accorded reservations in connection with parts of such a policy."
"We must all pull together."
"Mr President, I can only say that I have taken good note of the observations of the honourable Members in this debate and that, naturally, the Presidency will consider this issue."
"Mr President, I will try to answer some of the questions raised very quickly."
"Firstly, the system of taxation and social security."
"The tax system is the responsibility of the Member States and it is decided in accordance with the place of residence."
"That is how it is and treatment varies depending on the Member State."
"The social security system is regulated at Community level by means of Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 and is defined in accordance with the place of work."
"We do not have fiscal harmonisation and that is the reason why the system I referred to earlier is applied, basically taking the agreements of the OECD into consideration."
"The second point raised relates to what our objective is in relation to social security."
"Our objective is, clearly, to apply the same social security system and the same rights to all citizens of the Union, but also for all legal residents."
"With regard to the problem of the opting out by Ireland and the United Kingdom, as the honourable Member knows, it is true that the intention is to use the new legal basis."
"Ireland has indicated that it is going to participate."
"In the case of the United Kingdom, the issue is still open and it will be until the beginning of May, which is when it intends to adopt its decision."
"Finally, with regard to the nature of the new text, it is intended to be more modern than the previous one, with a simpler and more accessible definition for users of the current legal system."
"The new text is intended to include both the conclusions arising from the judgements of the Court of Justice and the various amendments which have been introduced since 1971."
"It is true that there is a debate on the legal basis, but we believe, of course, that the one used is the correct legal basis in accordance with the current system, and it has clearly never been the Commission's intention to affect Parliament's rights in any way."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A5-0062/2002) by Bruno Trentin, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the state of the European economy - preparatory report with a view to the Commission recommendation on broad economic policy guidelines (2002/2014(INI))."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, a slow recovery in economic growth seems to be taking shape in both the United States and Europe, although the timescale and stability of this recovery are still uncertain."
"Above all, the extent of the recovery already seems to vary greatly across the various sectors involved, and it is intertwined with restructuring and modernisation processes, which may be supported by heavy public investment and unacceptable protectionist measures, as is the case with steel in the United States."
"The problem that the European Union is always faced with is how to prevent such a contradictory and non-uniform move out of recession from coinciding - because of a wait-and-see attitude of European governments and the Union - with a widening, and not a narrowing, of the innovation and competitiveness gap that already penalises Europe in comparison with the United States."
"For this reason, the report I am tabling highlights the urgent need to adopt a proactive policy - at the Barcelona summit, let us hope - which is, above all, in line with the Lisbon objectives, a policy mix that makes the social agenda adopted at Nice an integral part of a coordinated economic and social policy centred on the objective of increasing the active population and achieving full employment."
"This seems even more essential if one bears in mind the need to abide by the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, particularly that of keeping budget deficits down to within 3 per cent of gross domestic product, which only leaves rather modest resources available for a counter-cyclical economic policy in the individual States."
"We therefore stress that it is not a question of concentrating new powers in Brussels but rather of making very selective choices and coordinating state intervention in order to achieve a critical mass, creating positive synergies of public intervention and private investment at a European level."
"It is a matter, then, of choosing."
"In the report we uphold the need to prioritise the revival of a policy of investment instead of an across-the-board reduction in the tax burden, except for further exemption from labour costs."
"In the area of public and private investment, we insist on a resumption of the Lisbon strategy, which today, especially in some countries, is making disturbingly slow progress."
"This means giving high priority to channelling Community resources and national investment into strategic sectors like research and innovation, lifelong learning as an integral and inseparable part of the structural reform of the labour market, and the creation of a European network of infrastructures and services, starting with telecommunications."
"In addition, Community projects need to be better coordinated with governments' economic and social policy guidelines, and not only coordinated better but in good time - by the summer, in this case - so that they can affect the decisions of the national parliaments, which must be informed of the initiatives of the competent European Parliament committees in due time and be involved in them."
"We must not just hope for coordination but promote it too, for instance by proposing - through the Commission - forms of open cooperation between different governments on common projects concerned with research, innovation, lifelong learning and active ageing policies, the latter being a prerequisite for achieving a reform of social security systems that is not disastrous for workers' pension rights."
"Social dialogue must also be involved in this policy mix, based on the need to set out the guidelines and financing methods for the continuing education policy."
"The participation of the social partners in defining a modern welfare state, turning it into a decisive factor in sustainable development leading to full employment, is one of the cornerstones of the European social model."
"At Barcelona we must therefore reject any attempt to weaken collective bargaining and to remove from the Charter of Fundamental Rights a major part of its content."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation."
"But I would also like to say a few additional words about the report."
"In Lisbon, a high-flown declaration was made that we would become the number one in the world."
"It is now evident that things will not happen as quickly as some people had hoped."
"We might now think that target was over-ambitious."
"Perhaps we should be honest and totally forget it."
"A lot of things are now attributed to 11 September and to the economic downturn in the USA."
"It is certain that the tragic events of 11 September had an additional negative impact, but negative economic trends had already set in before then in Europe."
"In particular, from a German point of view we should not lose sight of the fact that Germany is the largest economy in the European Union and that countries that have far closer economic ties with the USA, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have far fewer problems than we do."
"We should move away from that."
"However, I fear that the Barcelona Summit has again proclaimed ambitious targets without us having done our homework first."
"When all is said and done, Europe should not raise expectations that the European Union does not have the power to meet. Instead, the individual Member States should take the announcements they make there seriously when they return home, and should do their homework, for example in the case of flexible working arrangements and corresponding tax reforms."
"I would also warn against repeatedly talking about coordination at European level."
"This kind of coordination could lead to additional illusory powers at European level."
"Ultimately, however, it is hard to move things forward in this area."
"What we need at European level is an offensive on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is SMEs that will create jobs in the future, and we assume that nine out of ten jobs will in future be created in companies with less than a thousand employees."
"It is important here to create framework conditions so that SMEs are not overburdened with bureaucracy and all the requirements that Brussels creates, and that in future the individual Member States should provide appropriate knock-on financing."
"However, at the end of the day it is also important for us to adopt a clear position here."
"This is also evident from the debate about the warning letter."
"I would like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Solbes for having insisted on the 3% being strictly adhered to."
"The discussions that have taken place in recent months about this have not only been damaging to the stability and growth market, but have also adversely affected Europe's reputation, its economy and the euro."
"We should turn our back on this sort of behaviour and have faith in our own economic strength."
"We should not be saying that America needs an economic upturn because it will benefit Europe - we should be able to achieve an upturn by virtue of our own strength and our own convictions."
"Just a few more words by way of conclusion."
"I have just heard someone talking about ""coordinating state intervention""."
"I absolutely must warn against that."
"The best form of social policy is a good economic policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report has, first of all, the extraordinary merit of placing the European Parliament at the centre of the discussion of the broad economic policy guidelines for Europe in the years to come."
"The rapporteur starts from a correct and appropriate premise and gives a rational presentation of the real causes of Europe's current recession and provides a logical suggestion for an appropriate remedy."
"First of all, at political level, accentuating the need for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to play an active and regulatory role in laying down the broad economic policy options."
"Secondly, in terms of public finances, highlighting the need for a stable reference point from which to reaffirm the absolute need to fulfil the final objective of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is to have a budgetary deficit of less than 3%."
"The rapporteur nevertheless acknowledges and recommends an appropriate degree of flexibility, which is necessary if we are to use public policies as instruments of economic recovery, without making the zero deficit in 2004 an obsession that is disproportionate to today's reality."
"Similarly, at structural level, he suggests and endorses the use of instruments to improve the general economic climate, in particular in training, in access to public services, in the creation of a knowledge-based society or in the adaptation of the labour markets. Finally, he takes up the objective of the Lisbon Extraordinary Summit and pursues this objective at the Barcelona Extraordinary Summit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I would firstly like to express our support for Mr Trentin's report."
"It is a very well-produced report which has sought a consensus."
"We have been able to work together and the result will reflect the efforts we have made throughout its drawing up in committee."
"This report could not have come at a more appropriate time: the day after tomorrow the Barcelona European Council will take place and it will deal with issues relating to the assessment to be made and the commitments to be assumed in relation to the Lisbon process, as well as, clearly, a series of issues which the Liberal Group has always insisted on and which the Commissioner is sufficiently aware of and which I am not going to repeat: the need to liberalise the most protected sectors; the opening up of the markets; the emphasis on training and education: the provision of more resources for scientific research and technological development; that is, the fulfilment of the Lisbon objectives."
"We hope that clear progress will be made on this issue at this meeting in Barcelona."
"I would like to point out that the report by Mr Trentin does not exactly establish a social dimension, which is also included in the Lisbon objectives and that, unfortunately, they are not taken into account and, therefore, I believe that the demonstrations which have been organised against the Europe of capital - of this Europe which we are building and which is a reality - lack justification."
"Mr President, may I say that Mr Aznar, the President-in-Office of the Council, very clearly identified the key words of the economic governance of Europe."
"As he indicated, the three wells from which the Union draws its economic policies are liberalisation, privatisation and competition."
"These wells, if I may say so, contain toxic water."
"The dismantling of public services which were operating more or less properly has been the source of all kinds of social havoc and inefficiency: the railways in Britain, the postal and health services in France, electricity supplies in most parts of Catalonia, and so on."
"In Lisbon the Council spoke of making the economy of the Union the most competitive in the world by the year 2010."
"At what price?"
"At the price of all-out, dog-eat-dog warfare."
"We are far from the pursuit of happiness which the most perceptive politicians of the late eighteenth century regarded as an inalienable right of human beings."
"Instead, we have the prospect of permanent stress, widespread insecurity of employment, mass exclusion and perhaps, in due course, the same tragedy that has now engulfed Argentina."
"In Biarritz, Gothenburg, Nice and Laeken, grass-roots society has demonstrated against such aberrations."
"Tomorrow, in my own city of Barcelona, there may well be more demonstrations."
"I believe it is essential to listen to the voice of protest, and I feel that the Trentin report pays it insufficient heed."
"Mr President, may I express my thanks to Bruno Trentin for the quality of his work and for being a good listener."
"In his diagnosis he clearly emphasises that Europe is not cyclically dependent on the United States and that the research and technological-innovation gap between the two sides of the Atlantic is liable to widen, with the Union clearly lagging particularly far behind in terms of public and private investment."
"But how should we respond?"
"Our Committee wished to adhere to the principle of coordinating national policies, which it sees as one of the mandatory precepts of the Stability Pact."
"But who can fail to observe the extremely poor results of this coordination?"
"Who can fail to see that the Pact, while providing Member States with a useful discipline as far as public deficits are concerned, does not begin to define the policies that are required if the development targets set in Lisbon are to be met?"
"As for the intensification of fiscal competition, it compels governments to cut public spending, even on essentials."
"And who can also fail to observe that the Member States will not let the Union acquire budgetary and fiscal instruments that would enable it to support a policy of investment and development?"
"This is why, unlike Mr Radwan and contrary to the letter of the report, I believe we cannot continue to operate within the bounds set by the present treaties."
"It will be necessary to go beyond the coordination stage and try to extend the powers of the Union."
"The broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability Pact must be reviewed if we want to adopt a truly cooperative approach, and we must press for the Union to obtain the budgetary and fiscal instruments without which it cannot pursue real economic policies."
"Accordingly, our Parliament should seize the present opportunity to take a historic initiative by formulating proposals for submission to the Convention on the Future of Europe."
"It would be a cruel disappointment and, I believe, a political error of the first magnitude if the Convention did not try to strengthen the European Union and its powers in the sphere of economic policy at this precise time when some large question marks hang over the development and cohesion of our Community."
"Mr President, Mr Trentin's work deals very clearly with important matters for the future of the Union, and it does so by appropriately combining economic and social approaches, in a context of involvement and participation, in order to maintain a social security framework, and of innovation as well."
"One passage among so many seems significant, however: the one about the need not to wait for the effects of the American recovery."
"Among the various reasons for agreeing with this statement is that we do not believe fully in the soundness of the revival across the Atlantic."
"The reversal of the unemployment trend and an upturn on the Nasdaq contrast, in fact, with the sharp rise in oil prices, perhaps because of the winds of war blowing through the oil-producing countries."
"Each of these aspects taken alone supports the points raised in the report before us, but they also support the need for it to have a wholly European focus, which includes maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact, because another perplexing aspect in the USA is, paradoxically, the increase in floating capital, perhaps as an intentional inflationary nudge to level off the huge public investments that have been made."
"This is an aspect that Europe cannot allow itself, with fifteen economies that are sometimes profoundly different from each other."
"Of course, the expectation is that as soon as possible the Union will achieve effective open coordination - in social as well as economic policy - with joint consideration of fiscal policies, but with the warning that without constant, real grass-roots participation there will be no economic growth that can be enjoyed by the general public."
"The reference to greater participation by local players is explicit, as the second report on cohesion has shown, but from the standpoint of enlargement there is also a clear reference to wider enjoyment, or at least greater access to information regarding Community support, since the fact is that the EAGGF, for instance, has reported significantly low take-up rates in the Member States."
"Similarly, what is needed for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, besides the hoped-for transparency about future action and the procedures for it, is the constructive requirement that the ways in which pre-accession funds are used should be better monitored, bearing in mind that in these countries, still coming to grips with setting up an own resources system, there are generally not enough funds available to support cofinancing."
"It is, in fact, extremely difficult to justify scientifically, as the Union demands, the inclusion of environmental sites on the Natura 2000 list before the Trans-European Networks are built."
"In the latter respect, more and better participation by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in Community plans and programmes would be welcome, as would their greater participation in transport policy, including attention to Community corridors."
"In conclusion, what I am trying to say is that not only are the economic and social plans extremely opportune, but so is the harmonious and integrated way they are implemented, with a vision that goes from the new, near borders?"
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I am sorry, but I have to interrupt you now."
"You have spoken for 22 seconds more than your three minutes."
"Please stick to your speaking time."
"It looks like Europe is not entirely happy with its latest toy, the 'euro'."
"New areas of policy have to suffer interference from European institutions at the risk of being swallowed up by Brussels."
"The issue that springs to mind is that of employment, which is currently in the limelight of the Brussels bureaucracy."
"The report by Mr Trentin particularly mentions national areas of policy, such as education and labour regulations."
"It is a report that pretends to deal with the economic situation, but, in fact, prescribes in a normative manner, that employment must be promoted through education and flexible labour in the Member States."
"We are eloquently informed that the promotion of employment should be regulated from Brussels."
"Education, scientific research and labour policy are mentioned as areas where Europe must play a coordinating role in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon process."
"But how is Europe to do this?"
"And is Europe able to implement policy in those areas?"
"And maybe the most important question: do we really want Europe to have a say in this?"
"Education policy and policy allowing people to take part in the employment process belong with the Member States."
"For it is they who know what type of education and what measures are needed to allow everyone who is eligible to do so to take part in labour and health care."
"Precisely in the Member States, where the government and citizen are closer together, is it possible to let the wishes of those citizens be expressed."
"In my view, these matters do not belong in a report on the situation of the European economy."
"Let it be clear that I fully endorse the objectives of promoting employment, good education and a fair social system."
"However, it is my firm belief that it is not the task of the European Union to contribute actively to policy-making in these areas."
"It would therefore be wise if Parliament were to show restraint in this respect."
"Mr President, six months after the attacks of 11 September, the United States is reverting to growth and job-creation while Europe lags behind, plagued by uncertainty and contradictory signals."
"In this context, the Trentin report, which seeks to assist in preparing the broad economic policy guidelines for 2003, might have been expected to signal very vigorous reforms that could kick-start the European economy."
"This is not the case."
"All we see in it are reform proposals that are already very familiar, such as lifelong learning, support for research, completion of the market in financial services and the opening of the energy and transport markets, measures which will bear little fruit in the immediate future."
"The report also contains the traditional call for close European budgetary coordination, which is said to release what the report calls 'positive synergies', whereas in practice it could well add to the rigidity that already exists."
"For our part, we should like to take this opportunity to call first and foremost for a sharp reduction in taxes and other public charges, because these are the number-one problem in the countries where growth is slow."
"This will inevitably be a major issue in the French election campaign in particular."
"The European Union, of course, has no direct legislative powers in the realm of taxation."
"This makes it all the more regrettable that Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira, in an article that appeared yesterday in a French daily newspaper, spoke out of turn by apparently stating that a candidate's promises to cut taxes were not backed by a corresponding pledge to cut public spending."
"This comment is below the belt, firstly because our candidates' platforms have not yet been finalised and secondly because Commissioner Solbes is not the head of an economic government of Europe, there being no such thing."
"He should leave the French electorate to decide for themselves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my thanks for the positive atmosphere in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because not only this report but also those that follow - especially the legislative reports in the area of financial services - require a high degree of willingness to cooperate and need to be seen in the context of attempts to strengthen economic and monetary union as the motor of the European Union."
"I therefore view the Trentin report in conjunction with the report already adopted on the economic consequences of 11 September."
"We certainly always debated them together in committee."
"I do not need to repeat that."
"I stand by the Lisbon objectives."
"Yes, they are ambitious - but we need ambitious objectives, because if we just tread water and are complacent we will achieve nothing."
"However, we will only achieve these objectives if we do our homework."
"That applies not only to the European Parliament but also to the Council and the governments of the Member States."
"We need to get over this period of weakness, as it says in the report."
"But to get over a period of weakness you have to take measures and not just wait. We have to recognise that we have a great deal to do and cannot just wait for an upturn in America."
"We have to become independent from America's economy."
"For me, that means we need a properly functioning internal market, in other words we must do everything to implement in good time the directives that have already been adopted, to eliminate obstacles to the internal market, and to achieve greater coordination in the internal market despite the variations in competence, in order to remove distortion of competition."
"Our objectives are an action plan for financial services, structural reforms, observance of the Stability Pact and the principles of the social market economy."
"Mr President, I would like to follow on from what Mr Karas has said, and refer to a level competitive playing field."
"Yes, we certainly have an internal market, but we also have 15 sets of national circumstances within this internal market."
"So there is not a level competitive playing field."
"For example, there is not a level playing field between large companies and SMEs, because there are already wide differences in taxation between them, nor is there a level playing field between companies that operate globally and those that operate at regional level."
"There is not a level playing field when you consider the system of taxes and charges in the Member States and how market access is guaranteed."
"When we talk about wanting to become the most dynamic economic region in the world, that means that we have to increase our economic power."
"In a nutshell, that means that we either have to rationalise, which is in the economic interest of individual companies, but not in our macroeconomic interest, as it of course involves job losses, or else we can increase turnover."
"If we want to increase turnover, we need a market - we need customers."
"Customers who must have money."
"That means that we have to increase demand."
"Demand must come from both public and private investment."
"That means that people must obtain sufficient income from paid employment, if they are to be in a position to buy products in the first place."
"It is no good having the very best, most well-designed, most durable and most keenly priced product if there are no customers who can pay for it."
"I therefore simply believe that the contrast that is constantly made between economic policy and social policy is simply wrong."
"Mr Radwan, you said that the best economic policy is simultaneously also the best social policy."
"I would also like to turn that round: a good social policy is also a good economic policy."
"I say that because there is a common denominator here, which is why investments have to be taken into account."
"As I see it, education is not a form of consumption, but an investment in the future, because we have to develop new products."
"To do that, we need a skilled workforce."
"And that has to be built into this whole framework of investment activity."
"Mr President, our old Communist friend Mr Markov has not come up with anything new either!"
"We are talking now about the Trentin report, which we unanimously adopted in committee, and which relates to the broad economic policy guidelines and to a decision-making process which in the first place concerns the Commission."
"Parliament wishes to influence this process of coordination and opinion forming at a relatively early stage, without presenting a wish list the size of a mail-order catalogue."
"However, this is not just a question of keeping ourselves busy: Article 4 of the EC Treaty specifically provides for this common economic policy, this coordinated economic and finance policy."
"And, Mr Markov, that article prescribes the model as follows: ""? in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition""."
"That is our principle, and that is why - not because it is what my group wants, but because it is part of the Commission's programme - the completion of the internal market and the further liberalisation of public-sector services are a priority, as is the fact that we need to equip ourselves for competition at world level, and the fact that we need to dismantle obstacles in the Member States and to tackle the process of reform."
"That brings us to the question that Mr Radwan referred to: where does the Commission's responsibility end and that of the Member States start?"
"Where is subsidiarity appropriate and where do we need to act?"
"The only answer I can give is that whatever the Commission may bring forward and whatever Parliament may agree, in the past it has been more the Council, which is an amalgamation of the 15 governments, that has acted as a brake on this motor of European development, which has now of course become even more necessary than ever with the euro coming into circulation."
"That is why this debate and Parliament's decision only make sense if we specifically call on the Member States to respect their commitments and not to lag behind."
"That means that in the larger Member States, in which there is an especially big backlog of reforms, national reforms will have to be tackled."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Trentin for his interesting report."
"Even though it contains a clear endorsement of the stability policy, the report, as I interpret it, is characterised mainly by attempts to find new avenues, create openings, relax the rules and bring about greater freedom of manoeuvre."
"I also think that the amendments by the social democratic MEPs extend those lines of thought, in other words in the direction of creating a little more scope for expansion and innovation."
"That is positive, for I believe that Europe's economy, which is still characterised by high unemployment, growing social problems and stagnation in important areas such as education and research, requires more expansion, dynamism and innovation."
"Anyone who follows the politico-economic debate in the European Union will see that it is greatly concerned with rules, control, prohibitions, cohesion, coordination, discipline and such like."
"Really, it does not sound at all as if we are discussing a liberal market economy, but a rather bureaucratic and ponderous economy."
"I believe that vigorous efforts ought instead to be made to stimulate the economy and to channel public investment into education and research, something that is really needed if we are to realise the Lisbon objectives."
"Major improvements in the environmental sphere also need to be made and, as Mr Markov pointed out, purchasing power needs to be increased and care taken to create demand so that companies can dare to begin investing again and so that we can invest in quality and in initiatives that help enable us to comply with the ambitious Lisbon objectives."
"That is unfortunately not what I see."
"What I see is something resembling a straightjacket, characterised by stability, rules and discipline."
"That is not enough."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Trentin report surely lays the initial bases for major future decisions on economic policy."
"These bases do, however, need to be more incisive and detailed in the proposals, so that they do not merely stand as statements of principle but can be swiftly put into practice."
"European leaders must apply themselves to rewriting the model for the social and market economy, bringing it up to date and rethinking it with greater emphasis on the social commitment."
"Signing up in general terms to innovation, training and flexibility and then backing out at the decisive moment is becoming not only disrespectful but surely detrimental to the working class as a whole."
"Today, to get out of this rut, class and corporate interests must be opposed insofar as they are not compatible with modern reformism."
"Rather than taking to the streets - or rather getting the workers to take to the streets - the trades unions should be asking themselves how much the workers took home between 1992 and 2000, given the productivity achieved by companies, which was certainly substantial."
"The proposal to turn employment around is based on a new bargaining structure and real pay flexibility."
"The new bargaining framework may be a regional or territorial system, half way between centralisation and company-level bargaining, with the aim of strengthening pay flexibility at company level where productivity is created and the individual contribution is valued."
"A large contribution may be made by company profit-sharing schemes, which allow ordinary shares in the company to be acquired up to a certain percentage of gross profits."
"It has been found that the companies with the highest profits are also those that use profit sharing to ensure that their best staff are paid effectively."
"In the USA, the companies that adopt profit sharing tend to have higher pay and higher returns."
"The pay of those who join profit-sharing companies goes up, while those that leave have to bear a substantial pay cut."
"Mr President, I am going to try to quickly mention most of the issues raised and I would firstly like to thank Mr Trentin for his report."
"It is a good contribution to the broad economic policy guidelines which we are going to discuss and I believe that, in accordance with our fundamental concerns, the report focuses on two objectives: one short-term objective; how to consolidate the emerging recovery and turn it into a lasting growth in Europe; and secondly, how to deal with our problems of growth potential and make progress with the Lisbon objectives, an issue which is particularly attractive at this time, immediately before the Barcelona Summit."
"I agree with the view of some of you that our difficulties did not begin with 11 September."
"We were already in a situation of less economic growth and I also share the view that the impact of the evolution of the American economy has been greater than we initially expected, but I believe we should acknowledge that the Union's action in terms of economic policy during this period has been correct."
"The monetary authorities have taken advantage of the lower risk in the field of price stability in order to cut interest rates, and budgetary policies have supported the activity by means of the functioning of automatic stabilisers and tax reductions which have taken place during this period."
"I do not share the view that we have had a procyclic policy."
"We only have to look at the impact the automatic stabilisers have had in Europe in percentage terms."
"Good handling of macroeconomic policy is allowing us to achieve good results."
"I believe that we can now say that the slow-down reached its worst during the last six months of the year and that the main indicators demonstrate that we are starting a recovery."
"We are currently working on the round of forecasts for 2002 and I can point out that, according to those forecasts, growth has been gaining momentum throughout this year and we believe it will come close to potential growth and may even exceed it by the end of the year."
"However, there are two elements of particular interest to us: firstly, the trend in salaries, which has been extremely helpful during this period - both in terms of stabilising prices and creating employment - and we hope the same trend will continue."
"Secondly, the need to take advantage of recovery for budgetary consolidation."
"We believe that this is a fundamental element."
"The difficulties we have had to face during recent months have basically stemmed from not having achieved a situation of budgetary balance or budgetary surplus during the previous improvement in our economic context."
"And in this respect it should not be inferred from my comments - which some speakers have referred to - that I had any intention whatsoever of entering into an internal political debate, but that I simply wanted to point out something that I have said many times and that is that, in my opinion, any reduction in taxes to confront our budgetary obligations must be based on budgetary surpluses or must be counterbalanced by spending reductions."
"That is all I have said, I have said it many times and I am saying it again, but I do not believe it is the only thing coherent with our budgetary commitments."
"Where must we go in the long term?"
"The answer is unquestionably to increase our growth potential, that is to say, to implement Lisbon."
"And those are the objectives we are also going to find again in the broad economic policy guidelines."
"How can we increase our production potential?"
"In the report which the Commission has sent to Lisbon, we suggest some of the challenges we consider fundamental."
"It is true that Lisbon is a programme for ten years."
"We are currently considering what we must do over the next twelve months and, in this respect, we must define certain priorities which we consider essential to the labour market."
"Mr Trentin has mentioned this issue and in his motion for a resolution he stresses the importance of continuous training, mobility, flexibility and safety, as well as the non-wage costs of the workforce, above all at the lowest end of the scale."
"I completely agree with each of these points."
"However, I would like to add one point."
"I believe we also have to consider that work must be worthwhile; we must have a system which provides incentives for participation in work and, to this end, it is essential to modernise the tax systems and also the social construction systems, as well as the legislation on work protection in order to favour employment."
"I believe that we must avoid unemployment traps which clearly have a negative impact on our situation."
"Safety in employment must be based on training and qualification, and this is a fundamental active element for everybody."
"Safety in work based solely and exclusively on rigid protection legislation may be an advantage in the short term, but there is no doubt whatsoever that it hinders modernisation and greater economic efficiency."
"As the Resolution stresses, employment is not just a problem of wage costs, but it is also a problem of wage structures which are well suited to the productivity differentials in each sector of activity."
"In our report we also refer to goods and services, and your Resolution also stresses the importance of integrated networks of transport and services infrastructures, as well as the need for rigorous competition policy and proposes that consumers be offered the possibility of choosing between different networks of services."
"The Commission absolutely agrees with these contributions and we also point to the need to make progress in investment in priority infrastructure projects, an issue which we consider to be fundamental in order to stimulate our capacity for long-term growth."
"In our recent report on the application of the broad economic policy guidelines for 2001, we point out that in some network industries, the older operators still maintain high market quotas, an indicator that the opening up of the market is still not as desired."
"Therefore, it is essential to make progress in order to have more robust competition which will finally benefit the citizens."
"A final particularly important point has been mentioned by Mr Trentin, and also by some others, and involves the need to pay more attention to the knowledge economy."
"Your Resolution stresses the need to attach more importance to R+D. It is true that R+D is an essential factor for a sustainable increase in productivity and competitiveness, which are essential elements if we want to achieve the Lisbon objective of making our economy the most competitive economy in the world."
"And it is true that progress has been made with R+D, but it is also true that progress in the financial contribution is taking place essentially in the public sector, although the greatest differences in terms of investment in this type of activity arise in the private sector."
"This is undoubtedly a point which warrants attention."
"I hope some conclusion in this respect will emerge from Lisbon and we will have to work to try to improve this situation, just as I believe we should work to make progress with the Community patent, an essential element for technological innovation."
"Mr Trentin has mentioned other elements connected to the participation of national parliaments."
"Nothing would please the Commission more than greater participation by national parliaments in this type of debate and you as a Parliament, and in particular the IMAC, have played an important role in the past in support of certain initiatives of this type, which have undoubtedly been enormously useful."
"I will end by saying that the Commission considers at this time that the broad economic policy guidelines, the basic document on guidelines, must continue to function in accordance with what was agreed in Lisbon, and in this regard it is absolutely essential to accept any contribution that the European Parliament may present in order to improve these guidelines."
"Your contributions, together with the debates which are going to come out of Lisbon, will be fundamental elements for defining our document, which will be presented, as usual, in April, so that it may be debated in the subsequent months."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following three reports:"
"A5-0060/2002 by Mr Lipietz on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the supplementary supervision of credit institution, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and the Council (COM(2001) 213 - C5-0159/2001 - 2001/0095(COD));"
"A5-0069/2002 by Mr Goebbels on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) (COM(2001) 281 - C5-0262/2001 - 2001/0118(COD));"
"A5-0072/2002 by Mr Huhne on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading (COM(2001) 280 - C5-0263/2001 - 2001/0117(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nine months have now elapsed since the proposal for a European Commission directive on this ultra-technical but extremely topical subject was referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Last spring, when the bubble of the e-economy burst, we were reminded that banking is a high-risk business."
"In the autumn, the attacks of 11 September, coupled with the steady increase in industrial accidents and in natural disasters linked to the greenhouse effect, reminded us that insurance is also a high-risk activity."
"The risk will become higher and higher."
"For years, the European Union, like the rest of the world, has been standardising both the prudential rules that are essential to these financial activities and the forms of supervision practised by the banking and insurance authorities."
"We are now called upon to supplement these efforts by regulating those financial conglomerates which contain both banks and insurance companies."
"This is a particularly urgent task here in Europe, the continent that has pioneered insurance banking. It is made all the more urgent by the fact that the development of life assurance and all forms of capitalised pensions savings is compelling our society to run a great risk."
"What would happen if the long-term savings of future pensioners were engulfed in a stock-market crash?"
"This is precisely what the present directive seeks to avoid."
"Its rapid adoption would do no less than make Europe the safest financial area in the world, decisively improving its competitiveness through the geographical factor used by the rating agencies."
"I will not conceal the fact that, at the start of our debates, some of my honourable colleagues were loath to impose new prudential constraints on the financial sector."
"There were discussions, and some questioned whether it was expedient for Europe to set out its own rules before the completion of the Basle negotiations on the same subject in 2004."
"Such misgivings, however, were to be banished by a single event, namely the collapse of the Enron conglomerate in the United States as a result of failure to comply with the prudential rules and breakdowns in the supervisory system."
"If the European Union adopted this directive, Europe would become the 'Enron-proof' continent, so to speak."
"And so the last misgivings have now melted away."
"Yes, the directive is needed urgently."
"No, it must not be watered down, either in its scope or in the rigour and transparency of the prudential rules that the authorities will have to oversee."
"In the course of these nine eventful months, our committee has met with representatives of the banking and insurance professions; where the latter put forward sound arguments reflecting the public interest, the committee has managed to incorporate most of these into its position."
"I refer in particular to two groups of amendments, namely those that relate to the choice of calculation method and those designed to instil a degree of flexibility into capital-adequacy requirements in terms of companies' own funds in the case of groups which are not yet conglomerates."
"Lastly, your rapporteur has benefited, throughout the course of his work, from the cooperation of the Commission and of the Belgian Presidency, and latterly the Spanish Presidency, of the Council."
"My warm thanks are extended to both institutions."
"We have proved on this occasion that the three institutions of the Union are able to take very rapid concerted action when the interests of the public and of the European Union are at stake."
"As I speak to you, at 5.15 p.m., I have just managed to finalise a handful of compromise amendments incorporating the key points from the amendments that were tabled last week. These seem to offer a good basis for a consensus among most of the groups and to anticipate the bulk of the compromises that will have to be made with the Council."
"I therefore believe that the House will be able to adopt an almost unanimous resolution tomorrow and that the amended proposal will be very close to that which the Council will adopt."
"In these circumstances, I believe that one reading, or one reading and a half, if you like, will suffice for us to ratify this directive, and I shall be absolutely delighted at such an outcome."
"We shall avoid any new Enron-type affairs in Europe, and at the same time we shall have legislation with which we can intensify the Basle discussions by offering our new rules as a model for the rest of the world. This would yield immediate dividends by enhancing the global reputation of our financial activities."
"Mr President, it has often been said that the advent of the euro would serve as the catalyst for sweeping reforms in Europe."
"This is especially true with regard to the financial markets, which are still largely fragmented."
"The view of the Commission is that the creation of a vast financial market should reduce the cost of finance for all economic operators."
"Nevertheless, since the financial markets remain vulnerable, there is a need to create, parallel to the establishment of this large market, regulatory authorities vested with wide powers, not to intervene on a routine basis but to take action when the rules of common sense have been breached by players in the field."
"These principles are applied in the draft directive on market abuse."
"Let me make it quite clear that the proposal from the Commission is a sound document."
"It resolutely addresses the key problems."
"Europe is not currently able to penalise insider dealing and market manipulation effectively."
"Such operations have long been considered with a certain degree of forbearance."
"But the fact is that anyone who indulges in insider dealing or market manipulation is guilty of an offence."
"He or she is stealing from the other market operators."
"When insiders make a killing in the space of a few minutes, small shareholders and honest brokers are the ones who bear the brunt."
"The Commission proposal has been a welcome development in the light of the attacks of 11 September."
"Confronted by groups of terrorists who can use the anonymity of stock-exchange transactions to obtain funding for the vilest purposes, Europe is duty-bound to respond on the financial front too."
"Allow me now, Mr President, to comment briefly on the main objectives of this directive."
"Our purpose in clarifying its provisions is to avoid writing a blank cheque for secondary legislation."
"We cannot confine ourselves to vague definitions, particularly as regards the definition of market manipulation."
"For this reason we have developed this and other definitions, although we have left some scope for them to be supplemented in response to imaginative innovations within the markets."
"We believe we have struck a fair balance between precision and flexibility."
"The financial products covered by the directive have been specified in the body of the text, but there is still scope for the inclusion of subsequent financial innovations."
"Market operators have expressed what are ultimately legitimate concerns about the pursuit of acceptable practices in the financial markets."
"In this respect, Parliament puts its trust in what we call the Lamfalussy procedures as a means of obtaining universally acceptable secondary legislation."
"Taking a constructive approach, we wished to go further along the avenues explored by the Commission."
"Preventive measures must be paramount."
"The risk of fraudulent use of confidential information increases if information is not properly disseminated."
"This is why greater transparency is essential."
"In the first place, issuers will have to post on their websites all inside information that they are required to disclose."
"Secondly, persons discharging managerial responsibilities with an issuer of financial instruments must disclose their transactions."
"This disclosure must be made without delay so that the market can digest the relevant information."
"In accordance with this pragmatic approach, we have amended some of the provisions proposed by the Commission."
"For example, the imposition of an obligation on financial intermediaries to reject suspect orders seemed to be rather unrealistic."
"How can an intermediary take such a decision in a matter of seconds when the regulators' enquiries into the activities of suspected offenders may take months?"
"By the same token, the principle of a single authority must not rule out a certain measure of flexibility."
"Similarly, the single authority should be able to delegate some of its powers to other authorities or to stock exchanges. The single authority would, however, retain ultimate responsibility."
"We also turned our attention to the conditions for the implementation of the directive."
"The current procedures are glaringly inefficient."
"Only thirteen criminal penalties were imposed for market manipulation in the 17 countries of the European Economic Area between 1995 and 2000."
"The subsidiarity principle prevents us from harmonising criminal and administrative penalties throughout Europe."
"Our preference is for administrative penalties."
"We are asking for an indicative list of administrative measures and sanctions to be compiled by the Commission."
"I also wished to draw attention to the financial resources to be put at the regulator's disposal."
"In Europe, regulators' budgets are often derisory."
"In the United States, a debate has been taking place in the wake of the Enron affair on the need to increase the resources allocated to the Securities and Exchange Commission."
"But are we aware that the SEC budget is already almost fifty times higher than that of the German regulator?"
"Lastly, I wanted to strengthen cross-border cooperation by providing for an arbitration body."
"Any regulator who has a request for information rejected should be able to ask his or her peers to arbitrate."
"While regulators must be vested with real powers, this does not mean that they should exercise these powers indiscriminately."
"The regulator should benefit from the expertise of market participants; to this end, we propose the creation of a consultative committee within each national regulatory authority."
"In conclusion, may I remind the House that modernising financial markets implies not only greater efficiency but also a more level playing field."
"The financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic undoubtedly suffer from the same ills: constant conflicts of interest, calculation methods that defy scrutiny and weaknesses in the monitoring of off-balance-sheet operations and of derivative transactions."
"The modernisation of financial systems requires the involvement of all players."
"An active Parliament must engage in dialogue with all interested parties and listen to all the lobbies. But the latter do not always seek to serve the general interest."
"I have the feeling, Mr President, that the proposed text serves the general interest, whilst respecting the legitimate interests of the financial world."
"I should like to reply to certain activists by quoting the words of Sir Howard Davies, head of the Financial Services Authority. 'Some well-paid lawyers', he said, 'are talking high-priced, high-octane nonsense'."
"This remark is equally applicable to certain lawyers in the Commission who seek to make themselves indispensable by creating a steady flow of new difficulties."
"Mr President, may I appeal to Commissioner Bolkestein to preserve the fragile political consensus between our institutions in this domain."
"Mr President, this is an important milestone in the creation of the single market."
"Today we will be debating two draft directives, including the prospectus directive, on which I have the honour to be Parliament's rapporteur that incorporate the delegated powers proposed by Baron Lamfalussy's wise men."
"We all very much hope that this new way of dealing with financial regulations will prove to be a step change in creating a single market, the foundations of which have been put in place by the creation of the euro and its successful introduction."
"The prospectus directive is designed to establish the ground rules under which an issuer of shares, bonds or other securities may access investors throughout the 15 Member States."
"At present, a company has to seek 15 regulatory approvals for 15 different sets of disclosure documents."
"This is a nonsense."
"It means separate markets in new issues, higher regulatory costs, higher costs of capital for business and less choice for investors."
"I have no doubt, therefore, that a single regime for prospectuses can create benefits for all, greater choice and higher returns for investors, lower costs of capital and funding opportunities for companies."
"The Single Market is a win-win game, not a zero-sum game."
"In drawing up requirements for an EU prospectus, it is important to strike a balance between the objective of lowering the cost of capital for businesses and that of protecting investors."
"There ought to be enough potential gains to secure both, and that is the balance we have tried to strike on the committee, I am particularly grateful to my colleagues, Mrs Piia-Noora Kauppi and Mr Harald Ettl as the shadow rapporteurs, and to their respective groups, for their help and cooperation."
"We tried to make a break in this proposal with in-depth hearings to understand the issues and I hope that we have a substantial measures of consensus within Parliament on many of the key problems and how to solve them."
"We all agreed we wanted, for example, to exempt the professional market for Eurobonds from the requirement for a prospectus, but of course, to insist on one if the issuer wanted to attract retail investors."
"The broad framework for that is agreed across this House."
"We have one issue to settle: should we have a minimum unit for each exempted Eurobond of EUR 50 000 or of EUR 100 000?"
"I hope you will agree that EUR 50 000 is enough to exclude retail investors, as the larger amount will prove cumbersome even for professional investors who are used to dealing in units of EUR 10 000."
"The second key set of amendments deals with whether companies must annually update their prospectuses or whether, if they do not issue more bonds or shares, they do not have to do so."
"Overall, the committee supported the view taken by the EU's regulators - FESCO and now CESR - and that it makes sense for such annual updating to be optional if the issuer of bonds or shares wants to issue again."
"In addition, this is not a directive concerned with general disclosure requirements by companies trading on the market."
"We shall deal with the consultation in that area in due course."
"I have also been pleased to support an amendment from the Socialist Group to allow smaller companies to update their prospectus, if they so wish, with the filing of their annual report."
"We have also generally sought to have the Commission, advised by the Securities Committee, take account of different securities and issuers including small business."
"Therefore, the disclosure requirements will be tailored to particular circumstances."
"This leads me to a further compromise amendment, which would allow a national authority, if it wanted, to exempt companies with a market capitalisation of less than EUR 350 million from the EU requirement, so long as they are not marketing outside that Member State."
"This seems likes a large amount, but I would merely point out that there are a number of quoted companies currently meeting the small and medium-sized enterprise definition that would actually be covered by this."
"For example, the British Technology Group employs just 182 people and has a turnover of EUR 22 million and a balance sheet of EUR 32 million."
"It is an SME, but has a market capitalisation currently of EUR 1.6 billion."
"Small companies can have vast values, and it only takes one or two Nobel scientists on board to ensure that that happens."
"It seems to me that, as an investor-protection measure, it is better to have these enterprises included within the scope."
"Let me finally explain why I think issuer choice of regulatory authority is important."
"We want regulators to cooperate and they are increasingly doing so."
"We also want to give them an incentive to do so."
"By allowing issuers to choose between their regulatory authorities, largely as they do now, for example, on all securities except equities in a domestic market, we can ensure that that cooperation proceeds and that we gradually put in place the foundation for a single regulatory authority across the Union."
"Mr President, I represent the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as rapporteur for the Directive on market abuse."
"We of course primarily tried during our discussions to make sure that what emerges here goes as far as possible to ensure that the directive is legally correct."
"The main problem we faced was the issue of comitology."
"The original draft directive provided a very general definition of market abuse, beyond which the bulk of the detail, the actual definitions, are relegated to the Annex and made accessible to the comitology process."
"We are convinced that criminal law - and we are talking about criminal law here - can only be adopted by the actual legislature and not through the comitology process."
"That is why in the first place we are very grateful that the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and also that committee as a whole adopted changes in order to move in the direction requested by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"The second legal aspect which is vital here is that although we have some sympathy for the fact that the Commission attempted to adopt a result-oriented rather than a blame-oriented approach, it is a problem for us - and this is a general legal principle - that without blame, without guilt, no penal sanctions can be applied."
"If that approach were to be adopted, it would fly in the face of all the fundamental rights provisions that have become part of the traditional order in our Member States, and it would also be counter to the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in Nice."
"So without any guilt whatsoever it is impossible to apply such sanctions."
"We also considered the degree of guilt."
"It is our opinion that market abuse is an offence very similar to other offences against property, such as fraud."
"However, there is no such thing as negligent fraud or negligent theft."
"Such offences can only be committed intentionally."
"For this reason it was one of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's wishes that intent should also be included as a matter of principle."
"We are very grateful to the rapporteur for his willingness, in a spirit of compromise, to incorporate these points from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market into his draft."
"It now only remains for us to make an appeal to the Council that when it makes its decision it should take account of fundamental rights."
"This appeal is, for very good reasons, particularly directed to the Finance Ministers, who are responsible for this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur and in particular the Commission."
"In the von Wogau report on comitology we also introduced the area of market participants, and I believe that there was very good cooperation in the area in which I was shadow rapporteur for the financial conglomerates, between the Commission, the Council, market participants and Parliament, especially in the preparatory phase."
"This is in fact an appeal to the Commission to carry forward this good cooperation between market participants, Parliament and the Commission, and to eliminate sources of irritation and possible misinterpretations in advance."
"We have succeeded relatively well in doing this, and I think that we can work in this way for the future in accordance with market trends."
"People keep saying that this is a technical report because it is so complicated."
"It certainly does have major implications."
"I will of course comply with the President's wish that I should be very brief, but I would like to touch on one or two points, especially the collapse of Enron, which has been repeatedly mentioned."
"I believe that we need to take Enron's collapse seriously, and we need to think about drawing the necessary conclusions from it."
"One conclusion, for example, could be about how we deal with firms of auditors and consultants in Europe in future."
"Ultimately, however, in this area as well we need to take account of the changing situation - the fact that ever more financial conglomerates are coming into existence which operate internationally, in relation to the joint forum and at the same time Basel II."
"It is our job as the European Parliament to make sure that the public is protected, but also that our companies remain competitive in this global competitive struggle."
"We have to take appropriate corrective measures here."
"I believe that we have considered these measures here in Parliament as part of a calm dialogue, and that we have been able to eliminate many problems, and I believe that could set a good precedent for how we deal with these topics."
"Mr President, I would like to sincerely congratulate the three rapporteurs, and I believe that this cooperation between the Commission and the Council should set the pattern for future discussions."
"I believe it is very important for the Commission and the Council to work towards strengthening the way the European Parliament functions in this area, as provided for in the Lamfalussy report, so that we can also exercise our democratic rights in the monitoring committee while preserving complete neutrality."
"The three directives that we are discussing today and voting on tomorrow aim to overcome the fragmentation of Europe's financial markets, to enhance their attractiveness and competitiveness, and at the same time also to strengthen financial stability and consumer protection."
"The elimination of obstacles to market access and bureaucratic regulations, the removal of antiquated and rigid supervisory structures and their replacement by flexible and market-oriented supervisory rules and instruments are indispensable requirements for the creation of an integrated financial market and for ensuring the competitiveness of Europe's financial service providers."
"However, this should not be allowed to jeopardise financial stability or to lead to a deterioration in consumer rights as regards cross-border transactions."
"We should make total transparency and strict regulatory and supervisory mechanisms, including appropriate sanctions, the hallmark of the quality of Europe's financial markets."
"It is of course also important to regain the confidence of private investors in this sort of saving, not least in the interest of building up fully funded supplementary retirement pensions."
"We do not need statements of good conduct for this, but just clear and binding regulations underpinned by appropriate sanctions."
"The same applies to the Directive on financial conglomerates, which will most certainly take integration an important step further forward."
"If they are to remain competitive in the face of the globalisation and internationalisation of the finance markets, Europe's financial companies need to reposition themselves in the market, and the growing number of takeovers and mergers in this context demonstrates that this process is in full swing."
"This structural shakedown in order to create internationally competitive companies is certainly to be welcomed."
"However, it should not lead to a situation in which financial groups and conglomerates of this kind are increasingly no longer subject to the supervision that up to now has been organised at national level and in most Member States, even at sectoral level."
"Enron has generally highlighted the risks involved in multi-layered and inadequately supervised finance groups."
"The directive before us will create an important harmonised European legal basis for cooperation between supervisory authorities, and it will also prevent multiple gearing of own funds instruments within a group."
"In order to avoid excessive administrative burdens, we believe that we are right in calling for responsibility for the supervision of financial conglomerates and groups to be transferred to a single supervisory authority, which will be established on the basis of legally defined criteria."
"It is also especially important here that we have fortunately managed to reach a compromise with regard to the scope of the directive and also as regards multiple gearing of prudential capital, a compromise that my group also fully supports."
"Mr President, I want primarily to concern myself with the proposal concerning the supplementary supervision of the financial conglomerates with which I had a lot to do in my job as shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"First and foremost, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, for the huge amount of work he has done in connection with Parliament's debate of this proposal for a directive."
"Next, I should like to thank Mr Radwan and Mrs Villiers, with whom I have had very close contact during our work with a view to tomorrow's vote."
"Last but not least, I should also like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his work on bringing about a genuine internal market for financial services."
"With the active participation of the Commission, we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have, where far and away the majority of points are concerned, found common solutions to the problems raised in different quarters."
"The background to the practical proposal is that we wish to secure stable financial markets in Europe."
"We want to avoid scandals along the lines of Enron."
"At the same time, however, there must be no more regulation than is necessary."
"What is most important, therefore, is to secure effective supervision to prevent financial conglomerates from using the same capital to consolidate their positions in several different places."
"I should like to express my support for the oral amendments to be tabled by Mr Radwan to Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48 in connection with tomorrow's vote."
"I appreciate the Commission's also being able to accept the amendments tabled."
"For me, adoption of the proposal tomorrow will be further proof that the European Parliament accepts co-responsibility when necessary."
"I am a great believer in our not dragging matters out if possible solutions emerge."
"We have found those solutions here in Parliament, and so it is merely up to the Council to deliver the rest."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen."
"I regret to inform the Members and Commissioner Bolkestein that this debate is suspended and will resume at 9.00 p.m."
"Mr García-Margallo, you will also have to return after 9.00 p.m."
"I am sorry about this, but we must comply with the agenda."
"Mr President, the situation in Chechnya is still very worrying for the European Union."
"Recent reports by the OSCE Assistance Group in Chechnya, by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and by two NGOs (Memorial and Médecins sans Frontières) demonstrate that the situation in this part of Russia is still dramatic."
"On the basis of this and other reports, the European Union has raised the issue with the Russian authorities in all the political dialogue that has taken place recently and will continue to do so. This is no surprise, since the European Union has repeatedly spoken out clearly against any violation of human rights and on the situation of the refugees and internally displaced people in Chechnya."
"Consequently, the Union has adopted a coherent position in principle which makes it very clear to Russia that, while the upheaval in Chechnya continues, the Union will continue to apply firm pressure for a change to come about, taking every possible opportunity and also turning to the relevant international organisations."
"However, I believe that it would be misleading to say that nothing has happened throughout the whole of last year."
"The question refers to Resolution 1270 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe which says that, while it has been frustratingly slow, some progress has been made thanks to positive changes of attitude now visible within the Russian Federation in relation to dealing with the conflict."
"As an example of this change, we have heard statements from President Putin to the effect that members of the Russian armed forces who do not respect human rights will be tried and punished."
"The Union is pleased with this statement and hopes that the Russian authorities will fulfil their commitment and prevent any further violation of human rights."
"It has always been understood that the fight against terrorism and extremism should take place within the framework of the Rule of Law and with full respect for human rights."
"The indiscriminate use of force will only serve to fan the flames of conflict for many years to come."
"At the same time, it is clearly necessary to maintain stability in the region."
"The Council absolutely agrees that only a political solution can resolve the Chechen conflict."
"It understands that the Russian authorities have tried to reach an agreement with representatives of Maskhadov, but that unfortunately these efforts have not been successful."
"The European Union will not miss any opportunity to insist on a political solution and, for its part, the OSCE is still playing a useful role through the presence of its Assistance Group."
"The security and independence of journalists are issues of great concern to the European Union, which has recently reiterated its views on the situation of the media in Russia."
"The Union has also been very active in terms of achieving the presence of international humanitarian organisations in Chechnya and, by means of ECHO (the European Community Humanitarian Office), it has directly participated in humanitarian aid as one of the principal donors since the start of the Chechen conflict."
"The Union has periodically dealt with the problem of security with the Russian authorities and recently a Commission official travelled to Chechnya to assess the current situation on the ground and the Union's troika is planning another visit to the region on a Head of Mission level."
"Finally, in relation to the prosecution of those people who have violated human rights, the European Union would point out that the Court of Human Rights in the Hague is now involved in several cases."
"The Court will set a date in the coming months to study the admissibility of some of these cases."
"Naturally, the European Union intends to follow these events closely."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the President of the Council for his comprehensive answer, and I am pleased that he himself states that the situation in Chechnya is still tragic."
"I have taken note of the Council's statement that it will continue to discuss the situation in Chechnya during all meetings with Russian authorities."
"I would also expressly like to thank the President of the Council for his condemnation of all human rights violations and for the fact that he calls for change, and continues to do so."
"In addition, I thank the President of the Council for confirming once again that a political solution alone can end the Chechen conflict."
"He also states that the European Union will seize every opportunity to achieve this political solution, and he rightly refers to the contacts between the Russian government and the government of the Chechen President, Mr Maskhadov."
"It is clear that these talks deserve a helping hand, but Mr President of the Council, I am a little disappointed with your very diplomatic use of language."
"It is evident that the contacts with the Russian government will be stepped up in the weeks to come."
"The Russian Prime Minister will be visiting Brussels during the EU Summit at the end of May; I should like to ask you what concrete initiatives you will take in order to translate the fine declaration of intent, which you gave today, into action?"
"This is my specific, supplementary question."
"Thank you for your response."
"Mr President, the Council and the Commission are working actively together in preparation for the summit between the European Union and Russia, which will take place in Moscow on 28 May, and within the framework of this bilateral dialogue we intend to raise all the issues relating to the situation in Chechnya."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is now two years and six months since the second war in Chechnya began."
"Commissioner Poul Nielson has not yet been to Chechnya."
"My question is therefore this: in a matter of this kind - a humanitarian matter, an urgent matter - what time limit does the Council believe should be set for Commissioner Poul Nielsen to visit Chechnya?"
"Should he go there within three years, four years or five years?"
"And now for my second question: President Putin has appointed a negotiator, and President Maskhadov has appointed a negotiator."
"Would the Presidency of the Council be willing to receive the two negotiators, who are recognised by both parties and who are therefore fully legitimate negotiators?"
"Could the Council meet with them?"
"Mr President, I am not in a position to answer this question."
"Mr President, according to reports in the German press, Chechnya's position is becoming more critical."
"Major reports have appeared in our newspapers which indicate that Russian military death squads are operating in Chechnya and that one village turned to the United Nations for help as it had been visited a total of 33 times for ""cleansing operations""."
"I urge you to ensure that an EU delegation should inspect the position in Chechnya on the ground and check what is actually happening there, because journalists can still only visit if accompanied by officers."
"As long as there has been a Council of Europe presence in Chechnya, there has not so far been an EU presence."
"Which is why I am asking if you would consider sending an EU mission to Chechnya."
"Mr President, the possibility of sending a delegation is a matter which would always have to be agreed with Russia, which is a sovereign country."
"The Union has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country such as the Russian Federation."
"If we were to reach an agreement with the Russians on the sending of a delegation, we would be very willing to cooperate there, but for the moment that is exclusively a task for multilateral bodies such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"Mr Dupuis, on a point of order."
"Mr Dupuis, the President-in-Office of the Council has the right to respond to you in that way."
"You are not satisfied with it, but let us not get into a debate. Tell us what your point or order is as quickly as possible."
"I think that Mr De Miguel can say that he is going to refer to the Council on the matter and will give a more detailed answer later, as he is not in a position to do so at present."
"However, I do not think that he is playing by the rules by simply saying that he cannot give an answer."
"I think that he can put the questions that we have asked him to the Presidency and to the Council and say that he is not in a position to answer some of them at present. But I do think that, as a general rule, the Council should answer all questions."
"Yes, Mr President, I can answer."
"I believe that by definition and out of the respect the Council has for the Members of this House, any question asked here, in Parliament and during Question Time, is a question to the Council, and not to the Presidency and that, therefore, the Presidency communicates it to the Council, on principle."
"I have therefore told you that I cannot reply to you because I have not yet consulted the Council, but that consultation of the Council va de soi, and I hope Mr Dupuis understands that phrase in his own language."
"Mr President, the Council would like to draw your attention to the reply to Oral Question No 0967/01, which refers to Article 33 of the European Union Treaty which states: 'This Title (Title VI, Provisions on police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters) shall not affect the exercise of the responsibilities incumbent upon Member States with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security?."
"In relation to data protection, the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data has been ratified by all the Member States of the Union."
"The conclusions adopted by the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States of 13 July 2001, relating to security at European Councils and similar events, indicated the European Union's objective, which was to maintain and develop the Union's status as an area of freedom, security and justice."
"In this field, the citizens must have the right to freely express their opinions and to meet in a peaceful way, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights, and to do so free from any threat to their security, to other citizens or to property."
"The same conclusions stressed the importance of constructive dialogue between organisers of public demonstrations and the authorities of the country in question, as well as the importance of maintaining close international contacts, particularly between police and customs authorities, in order to ensure that legitimate demonstrations are not taken advantage of or abused in order to commit acts of collective or individual violence."
"In relation to Mr Papayannakis, I will say that the preparatory bodies who are examining his question met in January and in February and worked as laid down in the Treaty, that is, respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"It falls within the competence of the Spanish Presidency to offer the reply it considers appropriate."
"Thank you for your reply."
"I should just like to say that Mr Papayannakis is not here because he is attending the conference of Presidents and Vice-Presidents."
"It seems to me that the President-in-Office of the Council endeavoured to give a very general reply with references to a few interesting principles, such as data protection agreements."
"I should like to ask if the Spanish Presidency is making practical arrangements and, rather than following the Berlusconi line, which caused a great many problems and violated the fundamental rights of the citizens of the European Union by refusing to allow peace-loving Greek and other nationals to land in Italy, is making arrangements to follow the Porto Alegre approach in an effort to create a framework within which the protestors can express their views and their claims legally and peacefully."
"It is in this regard that I should like to ask what he has to say about agreements with organisers and so on."
"Mr President, firstly, I reject any comparison by the Member who has just spoken between the government of Mr Berlusconi and the government of Mr Aznar."
"Each government exercises its responsibility according to its competences, and I assure you that the Spanish Government is going to fulfil its responsibilities in the Presidency of the Council of the Union in a way that fully respects the area of security, freedom and justice and the obligations that come with that Presidency."
"In any event, I can guarantee that we have no intention of denying one of the fundamental freedoms laid down in the Treaty (the freedom of movement of citizens), but I must warn you that the Spanish Government is prepared to take all the necessary measures to prevent people who intend to turn peaceful demonstrations into a field of battle, violence, destruction of property and aggression against people and objects, from achieving their aims in Barcelona."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that disruptions at meetings of this kind are above all the result of a failure to educate the public."
"Hence the European Parliament's initiative to endow the WTO with a parliamentary assembly, so that in future discussions can be held with non-governmental organisations and interest groups, thus strengthening communication with the public at parliamentary level."
"I would now like to put this question to you, Mr President-in-Office: what initiatives does the Spanish Presidency intend to take in order to implement this plan as quickly as possible?"
"I would like to say to the honourable Member that the problems raised are not due to a lack of dialogue."
"The Council of the Union has expressed its willingness to hold dialogue on several occasions."
"The Spanish Government is currently holding talks with all the groups that want to peacefully express their ideas in Barcelona and anybody who demonstrates peacefully will have the right to be heard and to demonstrate, since that is an inalienable right of any European citizen."
"But, naturally, I do not think that those people who demonstrate peacefully are the ones who need fora for dialogue, because the fora already exist."
"In any event, the honourable Member's initiative is always good."
"If there were a parliamentary assembly, if a new possibility for dialogue were offered, that may help to create more fora, but I do not think that multiplying fora can resolve the most serious problem of this type of public demonstration being organised and used by violent groups and factions who have no intention of dialogue, since all they want is to take the opportunity to spread confusion and violence."
"Mr President, the Council would like to remind the honourable Member that it is not within its competence to comment on the positions expressed by one of its members."
"Furthermore, it stresses that the issue raised is not within its competence, but that of the Intergovernmental Review Conference, which is currently preparing the Convention created by the Laeken European Council on 14 and 15 December 2001."
"Finally, the Council wishes to refer the honourable Member to the reply it gave to Mrs Rosa Miguélez Ramos during Question Time last February, in plenary session, relating to the representation of the Member States in the Council."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Government of the Spanish State refuses, in a way which is arbitrary and quite contrary to the winds of history, to allow the Union's constituent nationalities and regions to play a role in the Union, not least in the Council of Ministers, and is trying to ignore the practices already in place in Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Austria."
"He is trying to base his approach on an absolutist concept of sovereignty, contrary to that of shared sovereignty which is, in fact, a fundamental principle of the European Union."
"In its folly - as illustrated by the Minister of the Presidency Mr Lucas, a minister who is very close to the President of the Spanish Government - the Spanish Government is both trying to confine the internal constitutional bodies to a consultative role in the politically useless Committee of the Regions, and also, ignoring the reality of the Union, wants to turn this body into senate, even if this means going against proposals such as the one put forward by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, who reserves this role of senate for the Council itself."
"They could not be making a worse decision."
"This is why I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council: why is the Government of the Spanish State insisting on maintaining such an anachronistic concept of sovereignty in the Union?"
"I consider that I have already answered the question, Mr President."
"Secretary of State, you referred to the reply you gave in this House to Mrs Miguélez Ramos and I, who at that time also spoke in relation to this issue, have not received the same reply."
"I would like to ask you firstly whether you can send me a copy of the reply you gave to Mr Miguélez Ramos."
"Secondly, I would like you to tell me whether or not it is true that the Treaty on European Union indicates that Ministers of the regional governments can participate in European Councils of Ministers."
"Mr President, with regard to the reply I gave to Mrs Miguélez Ramos, I would refer the honourable Member to this Parliament's verbatim report, which is public, and therefore I imagine he will have more opportunity to consult it than I."
"With regard to the second question, I can say that the Treaty gives Member States the power to decide who their representatives in the Council are to be."
"That is an internal issue; each country decides what it wants to do and who it wants to send."
"Your are raising points of order."
"I must remind you that we are not going to enter into a dialogue on the basis of the issue and that you must raise a genuine point of order."
"In what order would you like to raise your points of order?"
"I will begin with Mr Ortuondo, on a point of order."
"Mr President, I only wanted to stress that on the occasion to which reference was made in relation to Mrs Ramos, I asked a question and I have not received a reply to that question, and I therefore do not have to consult the verbatim report, because I believe I have the right to receive a reply, since it was I who asked the question."
"Mr President, my question is, can I ask for an answer from the Council, as happened with an earlier question, and can I do so under the same conditions as before and receive a proper answer?"
"As President for the sitting, I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has recalled a reply he gave on a previous occasion, some weeks or maybe a month ago, to the same questions; and the President-in-Office of the Council is the author of his reply, and you can therefore judge it as you see fit."
"Mr President, the honourable Member's question relates to two realities: the Action Plan and the World Fund."
"Firstly, in relation to the Action Plan, the Council would remind the honourable Member that in the Resolution which it adopted on 14 May 2001 on the programme for action and the speeding up of the fight against HIV (AIDS), malaria and tuberculosis in the context of a reduction in poverty (document 8495/01), the Council explained the actions it considers essential in the fight against these three diseases."
"The actions include, firstly, access to pharmaceutical products and, in particular, the flexible application of the ADPIC (Trips) agreement in relation to intellectual property, which allows us to confront public health problems, amongst other things, through the discretionary power to grant obligatory licences in certain exceptional circumstances, including those involving the protection of public health."
"Secondly, it is a question of strengthening and increasing the financial contributions in the field of research and development."
"It is particularly important both to increase the capacity of the developing countries and to offer incentives for the development of specific universal public services, such as new treatments and vaccines."
"Another action is the participation in world associations."
"The objective consists of strengthening the cooperation agreements amongst the Member States with the WHO, the UNO (AIDS), the World Bank and other international actors in both the private and the public sectors, for example, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI)."
"The Council wishes to stress that that Resolution was presented at the 26th Special Sitting of the General Assembly of the United Nations which took place in New York on 25 to 27 June 2001, during which the European Union actively participated in the drawing up of the final declaration."
"Secondly, with regard to the World Fund for Fighting AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Council would remind the honourable Member of the European Parliament and Council Decision adopted on 6 December 2001, on the European Community contribution to the World Fund for Fighting HIV (AIDS), Tuberculosis and Malaria."
"In accordance with that decision, the Commission will contribute EUR 600 million to that world fund for 2001, which will be paid within the framework of a funding agreement to be reached between the Commission and the World Bank."
"That Decision also stipulates that in 2002 the Commission must present the European Parliament and the Council with a first report on the management and working methods of the World Fund."
"With regard to future contributions, the Council is waiting for the Commission to present it with proposals for modifications to the existing Regulations."
"In particular, the Regulation of 24 March 1997 on actions in the field of HIV (AIDS) in the developing countries, which also includes interventions in the field of genetic health, what is know as 'reproductive health', as well as that of 22 July 1997 on aid for demographic policies and programmes in the developing countries."
"With regard to the activities so far carried out by the Fund, the Council wishes to tell the honourable Member that on 29 January 2002 the management board meeting in Geneva approved its first presentation of proposals for funding of associations in countries seriously affected by epidemics."
"The initial series of subsidies, which will be awarded in April, will be the first granted by the Fund."
"The second meeting of the Fund's board must take place in New York at the end of April."
"The Council would urge the honourable Member to approach the Commission directly, since it is represented on the management board of the World Fund, in order to obtain more precise information on the Fund's activities."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the exhaustive information he has provided me with this afternoon."
"In fact, the concern of this Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Development and Cooperation, is - given the current situation in Africa, essentially in its central regions (Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, etc.), in terms of AIDS - how the Council, and of course the Commission, is going to control the fund of EUR 120 million which we approved in this House."
"Since you have told me that EUR 60 million has already been provided and that the first report is going to be carried out now, in April, from then on we will be very attentive to that control."
"Mr President, the Presidency of the Council wishes to remind the honourable Member that, according to the provisions of Article 290 of the EC Treaty, the linguistic system of the Community's institutions will be set by the Council, which will decide unanimously."
"The Council's position on this particular issue is laid down in its Regulation (EC) No 1 of 1958, successively amended for the purposes of the accessions of new Member States, which lays down that there are currently eleven official working languages in the European Union."
"With regard to the presence on the Spanish Presidency's website of the languages declared as official under the Spanish Constitution, this is not an issue which falls to the Council of the Union."
"Mr Secretary of State, I believe that this is an issue of cultural characteristics and open democratic characteristics."
"In Europe, there are more than one hundred peoples and more than one hundred different languages."
"2001 was declared International Year of Languages in the European Union."
"And I say this is an issue of characteristics because, in the Spanish State, we tried to ensure that during 2001 there would be cultural events aimed at protecting and promoting the native languages existing within the Spanish State, which are not limited to Castilian, since there is bable (Asturian), Catalan, Galician, Basque... and many other languages which have a natural right to continue to exist."
"The Government of the Spanish State did not allow any of these languages to be promoted or cared for."
"I would like to ask you what the reason is for this closed and anti-democratic attitude to something which goes hand in hand with the wealth of cultural diversity in both Europe and the Spanish State?"
"I am afraid that the honourable Member has mistaken this forum for another."
"I believe that your parliamentary group would do better to raise this question in the Spanish Parliament."
"I repeat that the Council of the Union is not involved in this issue in any way whatsoever."
"Therefore, since I am appearing here in the European Parliament as a representative of the Council of the Union, and not of the Spanish Government, I cannot answer your question."
"We are going to move on to the next question."
"You are aware that some Members, including the President, would very much like to speak in these debates; but in the case of the President of the sitting, it is impossible, although there has been mention of bable, the Asturian dialect, which is a form of expression in the region I was born."
"Mr President, the European Union has systematically given priority to the issue of human rights and the protection of minorities within its relations with the candidate countries."
"This issue is a key element of the pre-accession strategy for each of these countries, in accordance with the political requirements for accession established by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993."
"In the case of Romania, one of the specific areas included in the pre-accession strategy is childcare."
"In the Commission's periodic report for 2000 on Romania's progress towards accession, the Commission expressed its concern in relation to the adoption legislation and practices in the various countries, which allow different considerations of the greater interest of the child influence decisions on adoption."
"As a result of this, and other expressions of concern, the Romanian Government decided to suspend international adoptions."
"In the revised Association for the accession of Romania, adopted by the Council on 28 January 2002, amongst the intermediate priorities and objectives, it is stipulated that Romania must maintain the moratorium on international adoption until new legislation is adopted which is compatible with interests of the children and with Romania's international obligations, and the necessary administrative capacity to apply the new legislation is guaranteed."
"As well as maintaining the general moratorium, the Romanian Government adopted measures in December 2001 to allow for the completion of adoption procedures in those cases which were already before the courts at the time of the suspension of international adoptions."
"The Presidency of the Council believes that the adoptions of those children whose adoption procedures have already begun in the Member States, with all legal guarantees, should be completed within a reasonable time period."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will closely monitor the situation in Romania in this regard, especially within the bodies created within the framework of European agreement, such as the Association Council and the Association Committee."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, not only for the accuracy of his answer, but also for what he has been doing, both during the Belgian Presidency and during the Spanish Presidency, with a view to resolving 'within a reasonable time period' - to use his own words - these two problems: that of resolving the Romanian adoption system, in order to make it compatible with international agreements and, secondly, that of resolving the problems of those families who, since the procedures were begun under the former Romanian legislation, have seen no progress."
"I am going to ask a supplementary question: is the Council prepared to continue exerting its influence - I do not want to use stronger words - on the Romanian authorities so that they may make progress more quickly than we have seen up until now, despite all the promises in these two fields of applying the new legislation and of resolving these cases?"
"My answer is as follows: yes, the Association Council took place yesterday with Romania and the Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister and the President-in-Office of the Council dealt with this issue directly with the Romanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Geoana, and we received assurances that they would continue to do everything possible to conclude all these adoption procedures which, as you have mentioned, began under former legislation and have become paralysed."
"It is a question of moving forward with what has already been started, of satisfying the expectations created within many families which had already started the process and then, naturally, begin a new system under the new legislation."
"The Romanian delegation was made aware of this yesterday and we received assurances that they would continue in their efforts to satisfy the European Union in this regard."
"I must inform the Members and in particular Mr Ortuondo, who is asking for the floor, that, according to Annex II, 'Conduct of Question Time under Rule 43?, in point 4, which relates to supplementary questions, it is stipulated that 'Each Member may put a supplementary question to any question."
"He may put in all only one supplementary question to the Council and two supplementary questions to the Commission?."
"Since today is Questions to the Council, you have asked all the questions allowed you, Mr Ortuondo."
"Now, if this is a point of order, I have absolutely no intention of preventing you from speaking."
"If it is a point of order, you have the floor, but you cannot ask any more supplementary questions today."
"Alright, then I will do so as a point of order, because, if I have not misunderstood you, you have just said that all Members can ask one supplementary question for each question."
"No."
"You have misunderstood me or I did not express myself well, but I have read you the Rules of Procedure."
"During Questions to the Commission, Members can ask two supplementary questions, in addition to those which correspond to them, and during Questions to the Council they can ask one supplementary question."
"I realise that the Rules of Procedure are not read carefully and that does not shock me; but that is why I am reminding you of them."
"Mr President, with all due respect to Mr Carnero and Mrs Cerdeira, the Council cannot answer their question for two reasons: firstly, because the Council is not in the habit of commenting on articles which have appeared in the press and, secondly, because this issue does not fall within the Council's competence."
"Mr President, can I therefore deduce from Mr de Miguel's answer that the Council considers that to propose any initiative against acts of discrimination suffered by European citizens of both sexes because of their sexual orientation does not fall within its competence, and that therefore, it considers that the provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the Council Decision of 27 November 2000, which establishes a Community action programme to fight against discrimination are also not within its competence?"
"I would remind him that, unfortunately, there are many European citizens of both sexes that call upon this Parliament every day describing the discrimination they have suffered purely because of their sexual orientation and this is something that I, as a Member of this Parliament, am naturally concerned about, and I was under the impression that this did fall within the Council's competence, quite apart from the specific circumstances of the case that has been mentioned here today."
"Thank you, Mrs Cerdeira. What I am trying to tell you is that the specific case you are referring to has a religious dimension, which means that this matter falls within the competence of the Catholic Church and not the Council."
"The individual concerned is not suffering from any kind of discrimination other than the disciplinary procedures that the Catholic Church itself wants to follow with regard to a priest who has declared his sexual orientation."
"Therefore, this is an issue that strictly falls within the competence of the Catholic religion, in which the Council does not wish to intervene."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in a democratic system such as the European Union, no religious or non-religious body is above the standards and fundamental values that guarantee the peaceful coexistence of citizens on a daily basis."
"For this reason, I feel that it is indeed within the Council's competence to inform us of the exact measures it is going to take, and is taking, to prevent the discrimination against hundreds of thousands of European citizens of both sexes who, in carrying out their inalienable right to choose their sexual orientation, are discriminated against or badly treated."
"I think it is indeed within the Council's competence to state, through the appropriate channels, that every institution must abide by the rules that are, as my colleague Mrs Cerdeira has said, laid down in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that has very recently been drawn up and proclaimed by the Council."
"Mr President, all European institutions are naturally obliged to abide by the fundamental principles of respect for the person and to be against discrimination for whatever reason."
"However, I feel that the specific case you have mentioned falls within the competence of the Catholic Church's internal disciplinary procedure, in which, I repeat, the Council does not wish to intervene, as this does not fall within its competence."
"Mr President, first of all, the Council seems to argue that it has no competence in the field of the individual rights."
"Is the Council therefore incompetent?"
"I would like an answer."
"Furthermore, will the Presidency accept that Member States have a duty to condemn such discrimination because they are signatories to the employment framework directive which prohibits discrimination including on the grounds of sexuality and which must be transposed by 2003?"
"Finally, will the Presidency act on a point of principle and condemn such discrimination generally - discrimination which blights the souls of those who practice it as well as those who condone it either by their silence or by their inaction?"
"Mr President, no."
"The Council does not intend to take any action in this regard."
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency is delighted with the positive state of relations between the European Union and Morocco and is determined to develop these on several levels: firstly, with the implementation of the Association Agreement that entered into force on 1 March, which sets the stage for close cooperation in a number of areas; the creation of a free trade area and the establishment of political dialogue, elements which all have a particular importance for the development of global relations with this country."
"Progress has been made in numerous chapters of the Agreement and working groups have been set up in specific sectors."
"The second meeting of the Association Council, taking place today, 13 March 2002, in Rabat, will provide an excellent opportunity to analyse the work being carried out to implement the Agreement and to lay down the foundations for future work."
"At this meeting, the Presidency will also refer to various issues of a political nature, such as the human rights situation in Morocco and the Western Sahara."
"It will also provide the opportunity to analyse the ways and means of strengthening relations between the European Union and Morocco with a view to preparing for the third meeting of the European Union-Morocco Association Council, which, in principle, will take place under the Danish Presidency during the second half of this year, given that the last meeting took place in October 2001."
"On the other hand, the objective of the agricultural negotiations the Commission is holding with Morocco, which started in January, is to widely liberalise agricultural trade between the European Union and Morocco."
"In accordance with the Association Agreement, negotiations will resume in parallel with the Association Committee on 14 March and, in principle, will be concluded by the end of 2002 at the latest."
"The Presidency, for its part, will continue to support Morocco's efforts in regional and subregional cooperation, such as the Arab Maghreb Union and the Agadir Process."
"The latter paves the way for the creation of a free trade area, initially between Morocco, Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia, and, if this proves successful, other countries in the region which have an Association Agreement with the European Union will also have access to this area."
"Finally, the Presidency is pursuing dialogue and cooperation with Morocco on migration policy, including illegal immigration, with the aim, amongst others, of jointly implementing the action plan for Morocco adopted by the Council in October 1999."
"This plan paves the way for socio-economic development, the integration of Moroccan nationals legally residing in Member States, the management of migratory flows and respect for the right of asylum."
"Several projects are being implemented, having regard, for example, to joint development in the socio-economic area, living and working conditions of Moroccan communities in the European Union, the management of border controls and also support for the fight against illegal immigration."
"A meeting of the working group on social affairs and migration was held yesterday in Rabat, and there will be consultations with regard to negotiations for a readmission agreement between the European Union and Morocco during this current six-month period."
"With regard more specifically to fisheries, the Council recognises the ever-important relationship between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco in this area."
"The Presidency will not spare any effort to ensure that this close relationship is maintained within the framework of a mutually beneficial arrangement between both parties."
"Mr President, to tell the truth, this answer simply consists of reading out the agenda of meetings, which I think has no real political value and is very misleading, given that the question that was, in fact, asked, was what exactly will be the contribution of the Spanish Presidency to our relations with Morocco."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office had nothing of substance to say."
"This ready-made mould for meetings could be used for our relations with any other country."
"Mr President-in-Office, please do not answer me with an agenda."
"Tell me the precise objectives and priorities of the Spanish Presidency with regard to Morocco."
"Something that we can understand as being an objective or a priority and not simply a agenda of meetings that, I fear, will be no different from the usual blah-blah we always hear."
"I am sorry the honourable Member can only remember the dates of the meetings and not their content, so I shall repeat this for her benefit."
"Yesterday, 12 March, today 13 and tomorrow 14, there are three meetings scheduled by the Presidency that will deal with the three greatest priorities for Morocco with regard to her relations with the European Union."
"Yesterday, the Committee for Migration met to talk about the most pressing issue, the situation of migration from Morocco to the European Union, the situation of Moroccan immigrants in Europe and aid to Morocco for this very serious emigration problem they are suffering."
"Today, the Association Committee is meeting to deal with all the political issues relating to cooperation with Morocco, not only in the economic but also in the political fields, as well as all the projects existing within the association framework and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which is the fundamental instrument in the relationship between the European Union and Morocco."
"And, tomorrow, the Committee which is looking at all the agricultural exports from Morocco to the European Union will be meeting in Brussels, which is Morocco's top priority: to be able to export its agricultural produce to the European Union."
"If this seems too little for Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, then, Mr President, then there really is nothing more I can say."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to commercial dealings with developing countries, the Council would like to point out that the European Union is the second largest exporter and the main importer of agricultural products in the world and, in particular, that it is more or less the main importer of agricultural products from developing countries."
"The European Union imports more agricultural products from developing countries than the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand put together."
"Between 1997 and 1999, the European Union imported more than EUR 35 000 million worth of agricultural products every year from developing countries, with no import duty in the majority of cases, or at a very low level in exceptional cases."
"In fact, the European Union has a very active policy of supporting these countries, particularly through two main programmes aimed at encouraging exports from developing countries to the European Union."
"One is the Generalised System of Preferences and the other, the well-known EBA (everything but arms) initiative."
"Furthermore, the Council would like to remind you that, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation - comprising 144 member countries, the majority of which are developing countries - an agreement on agriculture was made by virtue of the 1994 Marrakech Agreements with the aim, amongst other things, of reducing the subsidies that cause distortions to competition in world markets."
"Recently, in November 2001, the development cycle initiated by the Doha Declaration set the objective of reducing these trade distortions further, helping, at the same time, developing countries to take fair advantage of world exchanges."
"Within the framework of these new multilateral trade negotiations, the European Union has committed itself to contributing to the conclusion, before 1 January 2005, of a balanced multilateral agreement that will be advantageous to all parties."
"The Community position consists of setting up additional reductions to export subsidies, such as export credits, state trading enterprises or other kinds of export monopolies that use one market to subsidise another; or even specific practices regarding food, whose true objective is to eliminate surpluses and open markets or suppress competition in the markets."
"The Council does not yet have proposals from the Commission, which, as this Parliament is aware, has exclusive control over common commercial policy, but as soon as these proposals are presented to the Council, it will study them within the framework of these guidelines which the Commission, naturally, shares."
"There is no risk therefore of there being any difficulty between the Council and the Commission in terms of achieving the objective of giving more advantages to developing countries so that they can export to Union markets."
"I would thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that detailed answer."
"I believe that these major export subsidies are basically divisive and destroy the agricultural market in large parts of the Third World."
"It will only be possible to achieve a fair trade policy once the subsidies have been abolished."
"I have two follow-up questions."
"The first concerns the extensive fraud involving export subsidies, as pointed out by, for example, the Court of Auditors."
"What measures are being taken to get to grips with this fraud?"
"My second question concerns whether, on the basis of the Presidency's report, I can assume that, once the Commission has presented its proposal, the Spanish Presidency will support substantial reductions in export subsidies."
"With regard to the control of EU expenditure, I believe that the European Union - the Commission, OLAF (the European Anti-Fraud Office) and the European Parliament - have the necessary instruments to control fraud, and I naturally imagine that, in the future, it will be treated with the same degree of severity and rigour as it has in the past."
"With regard to the elimination of export subsidies, I cannot give you an answer on behalf of the Presidency-in-Office, because this will be the response of the Council as a whole."
"I can tell you that Spain is opposed to import subsidies, but the Presidency-in-Office of the Council will, naturally, have to reflect upon the position of the Council as a whole, and I cannot say any more at this time, because we have still received no proposal from the Commission and the Member States have still not given their opinion on this issue."
"Of course efforts are being made to change the system of subsidies paid in the past under the GATT agreements and, if it is changed, it will be at the expense of the agricultural produce and income of the poorer farmers."
"I have to say that, if you bear in mind that 80% of subsidies go to 20% of farms, according to the MacSharry report, the subsidies paid to farmers, especially in the south, should have been increased long ago in order to meet the demands of the European Union for produce in which it is not self-sufficient and of which 70% are imports, such as cotton, tobacco, oil, fruit etc."
"Secondly, this produce is high quality and is good for the consumers of the European Union."
"My question to the Council, given that it has not given a clear answer and, we are told, has not yet formulated a position, is this: will it agree to abolish subsidies in all cases on the basis of the conclusions of the Qatar summit and, if it does, will it take account of the fact that farming will be abandoned in countries such as Greece and other countries in the south and all that that implies, with small and medium-sized farms being wiped out, increased unemployment and the adverse impact on the environment?"
"It is very difficult for the President-in-Office of the Council to provide any further details on the debate that is going to take place on no more and no less than the reform of the common agricultural policy - which is certainly going to be one of the hottest debates in the European Union over the next few months - because at the heart of this reform is the very issue of agricultural subsidies."
"I would ask the honourable Member to be patient and wait until July when the Commission will make its proposal on the medium term revision of the common agricultural policy, in accordance with the financial perspective and what was agreed in Berlin in 2000."
"The Commission will therefore put forward its proposal at this time, the debate will begin in the Council and I do not have the slightest doubt that the European Parliament will very quickly take up all the issues raised and will be closely involved with this great movement for the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"In order to do this, this Presidency or the next one will have many opportunities to give their opinion on these issues."
"I am sorry I cannot go into any further detail at the moment, because there is nothing on the table."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that Question Time is for specific questions and not for debates of a general nature."
"These can be held at other times, in a different manner and with much more time available."
"During Question Time there is just one minute to ask the question and one minute to give the answer."
"I am not referring to any Member in particular, so do not take this personally, this is simply a reminder for you all."
"Mr President, I shall now answer."
"On 12 February 2002, the Ecofin Council studied the updated stability programmes put forward by Germany and Portugal."
"In this regard, the Council also studied, in a similar fashion, the Commission's recommendations aimed at forewarning, using the famous early warning method, these Member States so that they could prevent an excessive public deficit."
"With regard to the concerns expressed in the Commission's recommendations on the worsening of this deficit, both the German and the Portuguese Governments committed themselves to ensuring that the reference value of 3% of GDP for public deficit would not rise again in 2002."
"They also committed themselves to the very strict control of budgetary development in 2002 and to avoid any measure that could worsen the budget deficit and, naturally, to taking all the steps necessary to return, by 2004 at the latest, to a budgetary position closer to a balance, in the case of Germany, or an actual balance, in the case of Portugal."
"The Council and the Commission considered that such commitments from the German and Portuguese Governments responded to the basis of the concerns expressed in the Commission's recommendations for which they would be forewarned."
"Consequently, the Council rejected the Commission's recommendations and has opted to conclude the process."
"The Council's motives were given in two declarations on the budgetary situation of these two Member States, which were made public."
"I thank the Spanish Presidency for its answer."
"I have a number of follow-up questions."
"Does the Presidency believe it is a good thing that the Commission and the Council should have arrived at different conclusions regarding Portugal's and Germany's budget deficits?"
"Is it laudable that different assessments have been made?"
"How does the Spanish Presidency view the warning issued a year or so ago to Ireland following Irish tax reductions designed to fulfil specific election pledges by the Irish government?"
"Was it a legitimate warning, given the way in which Portugal and Germany are being treated?"
"How do you view the Stability Pact's credibility in the light of the euro's having become weaker as a world currency, especially against the dollar, in relation to which it has fallen from 1.30 to 0.90?"
"Finally, do you believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that this decision is prejudicial?"
"Mr President, firstly, it goes without saying that the decision taken by the Council is not prejudicial."
"The Council would never take a decision that would cause harm either consciously or voluntarily."
"That is unthinkable."
"The Council only takes decisions when it believes they are in the best interests of the Union and its Member States."
"Additionally, with regard to the supposed discrepancy between the Commission and the Council, I can only say that the Commission fully complied with its obligations laid down in the Treaties to monitor the Stability Pact and to propose to the Council the activation of the early warning mechanism, and that the Council carried out its corresponding obligation upon this warning from the Commission, and unanimously decided that, having obtained clear guarantees and commitments from the States involved, it should take the decision it took."
"You ask me to compare the decision taken for Ireland with that taken for Germany and for Portugal."
"In the case of Ireland, the Council took the decision it deemed appropriate - I imagine it took specific considerations into account - and then, in the case of Portugal and Germany, it took another decision it also deemed appropriate."
"That is to say, the limits of the Council's discretion to make recommendations to countries that are in danger of not complying with the Stability Pact are absolutely sovereign and the Council decides on each case according to circumstances, and it goes without saying that the Irish case was not the same as the Portuguese case or the German case."
"In the Portuguese and German cases, guarantees were given that were unanimously approved by Council members and the Council therefore took it upon itself to take the decision, in line with its own competences and responsibilities."
"I have to tell you that several Members have requested to ask supplementary questions, but I can only give the floor to two more Members in the order in which they asked to speak."
"I will now give the floor to Mr Tannock, then to Mr Fatuzzo."
"The one-size-fits-all monetary policy and single currency will inevitably lead to foreign direct investment flowing to the Member State with the lowest income and corporation tax rates."
"How long will it be before there are demands for serious tax harmonisation in Euroland?"
"And how long before the current EU budget - which is capped at 1.27% of the Member States' GDP - is deemed to be insufficient to stabilise a single currency zone, particularly after the imminent enlargement programme, which is presumably going to start by 2004, and particularly if there is an asymmetric shock to one of the Member States, which will need bailing out by some central EU fund?"
"You are all aware that you have to ask questions that are as specific and supplementary as possible."
"The questions you are asking are of course related, but it remains to the discretion of the President-in-Office of the Council whether to answer questions unprepared."
"It is clear that tax harmonisation is one of the European Union's aspirations, not solely for the Eurozone, but for the whole of the EU - for this is an issue which is also pertinent to the honourable Member's home country. I know, however, ladies and gentlemen, that you are aware that this is an issue that must be decided upon unanimously, and that progress is being made very slowly, but progress is being made all the same, and therefore, the Council and Ecofin intend to continue working towards tax harmonisation within the European Union."
"Does the President-in-Office of the Council think there is any truth in the claims made by the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Berlusconi, and the Italian Finance Minister, Mr Tremonti, that when they came into power in 2001 after the previous centre-left governments they found a hole in the budget worth EUR 8 550 million, which had been covered up in the budget by the preceding governments and only came to light when the present government checked the figures?"
"Is it true?"
"Do you know anything about it?"
"Mr President, this issue does not fall within the competence of the President-in-Office of the Council and, therefore, I cannot answer."
"We must now have the last question to the President-in-Office of the Council, because he must leave at 7 p.m. on the dot to catch his flight."
"Mr President, the Presidency has supported efforts to develop the Barcelona Process from the start."
"In the new international climate following the events of 11 September, the Ghent European Council of 19 and 20 October 2001 considered it fundamentally important to encourage dialogue on equal terms between our communities and those from the Arab and Muslim world, particularly within the framework of the Barcelona Process."
"Special attention is therefore being devoted to this issue."
"Taking this into account, the strengthening of activities within the Barcelona process is, in fact, one of the Spanish Presidency's priorities, with the intention that the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Affairs Ministers in Valencia on 22 and 23 April should be a success."
"With the objective of preparing for this conference, from 18 to 22 February we led a mission to countries in the Maghreb and, as a result of this, all the necessary preparations have more or less been made to deal with issues in the three great political, economic and socio-cultural spheres, with the aim of reaching specific agreements at the Valencia Conference."
"I should also like to say that, up to now, we have received more or less the same response from all countries in the Barcelona process guaranteeing their presence at the Valencia Conference."
"I believe that, in view of the difficult circumstances we are facing with regard to the Middle East peace process, the fact that all delegations have announced their willingness to participate in the Valencia Conference is already proof of a spirit of cooperation and a desire to use the framework of the Barcelona Council to overcome the difficulties faced by the Arab and Israeli parties in the Middle East peace process."
"Mr President, I hope that my speech will not cause the President-in-Office of the Council to miss his flight."
"Therefore, in light of the response he has given me, I would like to reformulate my question and ask two that are very specific."
"The first refers to the proposal from the Presidency-in-Office for a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank."
"Is the Presidency-in-Office able to guarantee the success of this proposal or will we have to be content with a simple line of facilities or with the promise of the optimisation of the MEDA programmes?"
"My second, also very specific, question refers to the presence in Valencia, not of third Mediterranean countries, but of Ministers for Foreign Affairs from EU Member States."
"Are you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, able to guarantee that there will be no repeat of the scandal of the last Euro-Mediterranean Conference, where, out of fifteen Member States, only four Ministers for Foreign Affairs bothered to turn up?"
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to make my excuses."
"It is true that I have to catch a plane, and also that in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions to the Council end at 7 p.m. on the dot. Therefore, while I would love to be able to stay here longer, unfortunately on this occasion I cannot."
"In any event, I should like to say that the Presidency is here, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, until the last minute it is required."
"However, having said this, I shall be delighted to answer Mr Obiols' questions because I believe them both to be very pertinent, especially, I am embarrassed to have to say, the second one."
"With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference, we continue to insist on the participation of Ministers from associated countries in the Mediterranean, Arab countries and Israel, and you have reminded us of last year's embarrassment when only four EU Ministers out of the fifteen expected came to this meeting."
"Mr Obiols is aware of the extent of Spain's current concern about this issue, given that Spain was one of the countries that was represented at ministerial level at the Conference, and the extent of their concern as Presidency-in-Office, which is why we have taken all necessary steps with all Ministers concerned, and have repeated to them on various occasions that, with regard to this meeting, which will be important with regard to the revision of the Barcelona process, the physical presence of the Ministers responsible for Foreign Affairs in the European Union is absolutely crucial."
"We have received guarantees from Ministers from all EU States that they will be in Valencia on these dates."
"I hope that when I myself or the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Piqué, give an explanation of the results from this meeting at the session immediately following the meeting or at the next session, we will be able to say that there was full participation, for if this is not the case, we will have to take a serious look at our own consciences."
"This European Parliament should really draw the attention of the EU governments to this matter."
"With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, I am not in a position to give you any definitive plans at this moment."
"What I can tell you is that the Presidency of the European Union is very actively engaged in this regard at this present time, particularly the President-in-Office of the European Council, José María Aznar, by completing the visits we have made to all the EU capitals at the highest level and trying to find a satisfactory solution."
"It would evolve into a more ambitious body than perhaps we could possibly have approved from the outset. Frankly, I believe that it is very possible that we will find a solution to this issue in Barcelona, because we would very much like to be able to put this plan forward in the ministerial meeting that will take place in Valencia with regard to the Barcelona process."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has always fulfilled his obligations, and today he warned me that he would have to end at 7 p.m. on the dot for reasons that could not be avoided."
"Several Members have given up their speaking time, but there is a point of order. Mr de Miguel, you may now go in peace."
"I will take charge of the point of order."
"Mr MacCormick, on a point of order."
"Very briefly, the question which I had on the Order Paper today has been dealt with by Mr de Miguel in an extremely courteous, helpful and kind letter to me, which I received this afternoon."
"I would like to thank him very much for that and say how much my constituent will appreciate the point."
"Mr President, I received a written question from Mr MacCormick, which I intended to answer, but as I also had a letter from him, I rushed to send him a detailed reply in writing, which I hoped he would receive today."
"Naturally, the written reply is much more detailed than the one I would have given here."
"I would like to thank Mr MacCormick for his recognition and for his thanks."
"I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office and Mr MacCormick on their excellent working relationship."
"I never imagined a point of order could be so constructive."
"I hope you have a good trip, Mr de Miguel."
"Mr Ripoll also wanted to speak on this matter, but I imagine he will give up his speaking time due to today's exceptional time restraints."
"Would you like to make a statement?"
"Mr President, I would just like to say that I am pleased Mr MacCormick received his answer, but I feel that, before asking a question of this nature, given the harm he is causing to one of Europe's major tourist destinations, the Balearic Islands, as a result of these inappropriate comments, we would have liked to have had the chance to ask a question, because I believe that the only thing the person Mr MacCormick is representing wanted was compensation and, given that the British company in charge of the trip did not pay up, they thought that the Spanish State should do so, causing damage to its image in the process, which I believe is inappropriate."
"We cannot go any further on this issue, as you will understand, given today's exceptional time restraints. I am sure you will be able explain this to the Balearic public."
"I regret we do not have more time, but we cannot run on any longer."
"As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed, Questions Nos 15 to 33 will be answered in writing"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on three reports by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs:"
"A5-0060/2002 by Mr Lipietz on the supplementary supervision of credit institution, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate (COM(2001) 213 - C5-0159/2001 - 2001/0095(COD))."
"A5-0069/2002 by Mr Goebbels on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse) (COM(2001) 281 - C5-0262/2001 - 2001/0118(COD))."
"A5-0072/2002 by Mr Huhne on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading (COM(2001) 280 - C5-0263/2001 - 2001/0117(COD))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports we are examining today show that the sacrosanct objective of ensuring transparency and a high level of disclosure in the financial markets may conflict with other equally important requirements, such as not overwhelming small enterprises with excessive administrative burdens."
"I believe that the rapporteurs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have done a good job in achieving a fine balance between the various requirements at issue, and I therefore think that Parliament should approve the proposals adopted in committee by a large majority."
"Two points now: the first, which is urgent, concerns the creation of the so-called single passport, designed to speed up and cut the cost of raising capital within the European Union."
"The second point concerns the chance given to the Member States to exempt companies with capitalisation below the EUR 350 million threshold from the obligations arising from the directive, as proposed by Mr Huhne. I believe this is a way of tempering the transparency of information with safeguards for the less small companies."
"In conclusion, I am also convinced by the arguments in favour of allowing the competent authority to be chosen by the issuer, as proposed by Mr Huhne."
"It is a mechanism that may prompt useful comparisons between the practices of the authorities in the Member States."
"In these cases, as always, the scaremongers talk of a race to the bottom or, in other words, a decline in quality."
"I believe that we should instead have more confidence in the ability of the markets to select and reward best practices."
"Madam President, with financial instruments becoming ever more complicated and data being transmitted over the Internet in a matter of seconds, it is no longer easy to distinguish between appropriate use of insider information and abuse."
"So in Germany, for example, only ten charges have been brought, because the definition was not clear enough to justify time-consuming and costly legal proceedings."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs unanimously supports the comitology arrangements, reflecting the Lamfalussy report and its parliamentary counterpart, the von Wogau report."
"We attached a great deal of importance to a new definition of insider information."
"This is information that is not generally accessible and which directly or indirectly concerns issuers of financial instruments."
"It is information which, if it became public knowledge via traditional or electronic media, could appreciably influence share values or prices."
"Manipulation is considered to exist in cases where false or misleading information on important facts is deliberately given and third parties stand to gain directly or indirectly."
"We managed to prevent special rules applying to journalists, who should not be treated any differently to anyone guilty of market manipulation."
"However, freedom of the press is guaranteed in each and every case."
"We have adopted guidance for Member States on the enactment of sanctions and other measures."
"We have agreed on principles as proposals for the Commission, to enable it to exercise its implementation powers."
"We have drawn up a list of financial instruments to ensure that new products fall within the scope of the directive."
"And we have emphasised the importance of ""Chinese Walls"" as a preventive measure in combating market abuse, and have called for specific control of this in individual companies."
"We agreed that a central authority should be set up or expanded in each EU Member State in order to exercise effective control."
"This is intended to bring together the various competences of national bodies so that they can closely cooperate with similarly structured authorities in other states."
"I regard the agreement between Parliament, Commission and Council on most of the proposals as a great success."
"Special thanks are also due to the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels; as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I wish to congratulate him on his ability to work out good compromises which incorporated many of our amendments."
"The work done on revising the directive, which is also geared to new developments, should lead to greater coherence on Europe's financial markets and above all to more trust on the part of investors: the outlook is therefore good for a particularly sensitive area of our globalised economy."
"Madam President, Mr Huhne, although we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted for your report - I am speaking of the Huhne report - that certainly does not mean that we supported it wholeheartedly."
"There are limits to our willingness to cooperate."
"I would like to repeat once again my group's objectives, which are market-oriented and user-friendly."
"The Directive on prospectuses should make the market easy to understand and make products transparent."
"We are in absolute agreement on that."
"Likewise, investors need serious information."
"Cases like Enron or Maxwell must not be allowed to happen again."
"What is clear is that this directive cannot of course prevent fraudulent descriptions of securities, but this directive and all the accompanying measures that we have already dealt with and are already available should help to make sure that in future we are dealing chiefly with serious products."
"My main criticism of the report before us, Mr Huhne, is that you as rapporteur have addressed only, or chiefly, big investors."
"However, the market is flourishing in the private sector, for small investors, and there are various quite different additional issues when it comes to SMEs."
"For example, for SMEs we of course need an attractive capital market and cheap equity borrowing, and our prime objective must be more security and quality for investors buying securities."
"Furthermore, it is absolutely vital that the scope of the obligation to publish a prospectus in Europe should be extended so as to achieve greater market transparency, and that is not yet included in the first reading."
"Unfortunately, for the time being we have only been able to agree on a market capitalisation of EUR 350 million."
"I hope that there will be some additional flexibility on this in the package."
"Otherwise, with such a high threshold SMEs will be largely if not almost totally excluded, thus severely limiting the scope of the directive."
"Mr Huhne, my group wishes to continue to play a constructive part in developing this directive, and I mean that very seriously."
"However, that will require greater flexibility on your part."
"That is ultimately what will determine how we vote on this issue and I hope I can give it my approval."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we shall vote on the draft directive on prospectuses, which should make it possible for issuers to be granted a single passport for prospectuses in the European Union."
"The Commission's proposal is in many respects an invaluable step forward."
"However, closer examination and contact with the market participants have clearly revealed a number of problem areas in the original proposal that need amending."
"Within the limitations of my speaking time I can mention just the major necessary amendments we adopted in committee."
"The issuers must be given free powers of decision-making regarding which Member State's stock exchanges or markets they wish to be listed on."
"There are many different types of securities for which there are no markets in some Member States."
"Certain market places have considerably more experience of these types of securities."
"It would therefore be better for EU issuers if in future they could, as is the case today, have their prospectus vetted by the competent authorities of the country where they are making the public offer or are admitted to trading, rather than in the Member State where they have their registered office."
"Companies that wish to remain in their home country will obviously not benefit from this sort of single market and so will have no need for a securities prospectus of this kind."
"I therefore support the proposal that Member States could grant the right to make an exception in the case of those companies below a certain threshold seeking a listing in only one Member State."
"This would make the work of SMEs, in particular, easier, but would of course also offer them the opportunity, if they so wished, to acquire such a single market prospectus, thereby enjoying the advantages of the single market."
"Translation costs have been a considerable problem and must be reduced to make it easier for companies to be listed abroad."
"Securities prospectuses are usually very long and contain a lot of detail."
"It is quite enough that the registration document should be drafted in the language that is customary in that sphere of finance and that just the Summary Note should be translated into the language of the host Member State."
"This is a clearer solution than the Commission's original proposal and will benefit both issuers and investors."
"The Commission's proposed mandatory annual 'shelf registration' system is also problematic."
"The system would enable companies which repeatedly return to the markets in several countries to raise capital without having to update the entire prospectus."
"This is of course a positive move."
"The approach is not appropriate, however, in the very common cases where finance is being sought just on one occasion or at intervals greater than one year."
"I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, and my other colleagues on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their excellent and constructive cooperation."
"We achieved broad and balanced consensus regarding the necessary amendments."
"I hope that we can remain in agreement in tomorrow's vote."
"Any deviation from the line of compromise achieved by the Committee would considerably hamper the creation of financial markets in the European Union."
"Madam President, I would first like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal on the prospectus that it initially forwarded to us."
"I think we can improve the text but I am afraid that Parliament will ruin it if it supports the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I hope that the vote tomorrow will enable us to make the necessary adjustments."
"We are all in favour of the unification of the financial markets."
"It is essential if we wish to fulfil the objectives that we set ourselves in Lisbon."
"However, let us not forget what happened across the Atlantic."
"How can we fail to mention an affair that is still being talked about even now, the Enron affair, and fail to see that the lack of transparency and the lack of credibility of financial information were also among the reasons for this situation?"
"Neither can we fail to mention the number of start-ups that collapse day after day, even though almost as many are launched every day?"
"We need a financial market that is open, accessible to all, mature, transparent, safe and sound, with no distortion of competition and with protection for all, which means access to cheap financial services for companies but also protection of savers, which means all savers, including small-time savers."
"In order to do that, I think that there are two fundamental principles that we need to restore in the text that we have received from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"First of all, we need a simple rule regarding the authority responsible for monitoring the prospectus, which is the rule of the country where the issuer has its headquarters."
"That is the basic rule in the whole structure of the internal market. Let us maintain it, we need it."
"We need a competent authority with a clearly defined role, with no possibility for delegation."
"These are three key elements as far as the regulatory authority is concerned."
"As far as the scope of application of the directive is concerned, there is the issue of SMEs."
"We need just as much information on SMEs as we do on large companies."
"It may be possible to make allowances by only requiring information from them on a yearly basis, but otherwise it is out of the question to exclude SMEs from the scope of the directive, as that would compromise the virtues of the European passport."
"Madam President, regarding conglomerates I would like to support a number of the amendments adopted in committee."
"The Commission proposal needs significant revision."
"In particular, the provisions on material holdings are unduly harsh and would unduly restrict banks and insurance companies in investing in a range of equities."
"That is particularly important in the context of insurance companies investing their pension funds money."
"This House has made it very clear that it wishes that investors be given access to a wide range of different equities."
"These provisions, as drafted, would make it almost impossible for an insurance company or bank to invest pension funds money in other financial institutions because of the harshness of the deductions."
"I hope, therefore, that the compromises proposed in Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48 will be adopted."
"I am not sure we have exactly the right answer yet, but it is clear that the material holdings provisions need to be altered."
"As regards Article 14 I hope that the Council and Commission will progress the discussions."
"I know they are having to streamline the administrative process related to conglomerates with third-country parents."
"As regards prospectuses Parliament should follow the example set by the committee."
"The Commission's proposal applies a ""one size fits all"" framework designed for large equity issues to the diverse range of European financial markets."
"Parliament should amend the proposal in order to reflect the diversity of those markets."
"Shelf registration should be optional and not compulsory."
"Just because they use it in the American regulatory system, that does not mean we should adopt it here."
"As recent events have shown only too clearly, the American regulatory system is not always a good one."
"We should exempt smaller businesses from part of the proposals, as proposed by the committee, and it is especially important that we recognise that there are particular concerns related to smaller businesses, particularly those which are only raising capital and doing business in one part of the European Union."
"We should retain the current regulatory framework for the professional bond markets."
"Where there are very sophisticated markets - indeed one of the most successfully integrated markets in the European Union - it makes no sense to apply protections designed for retail investors in equities."
"We need issuer choice, otherwise we will have the same problems we have had with the existing prospectus directive."
"That is essential if we are truly going to integrate the market for capital raising."
"On market abuse the Commission's proposal has severe problems."
"I congratulate Mr Goebbels for tackling a number of them."
"I still have a number of concerns about the directive."
"There are significant problems with a directive that penalises wholly unintentional conduct, and I hope the Commission and Council will accept the safe harbours put forward by Mr Goebbels in the compromises, which are based on a safe harbour for acceptable market practice."
"This is particularly important in the context of derivatives, where the scope of the definition of inside information would make it very difficult to hedge ordinary liabilities, relating for example to an interruption to supply or new research revealing details of potential new supplies."
"If such information is instantly disclosable as ""inside information"" it would make hedging impossible and the derivatives markets would grind to a halt."
"I would also urge the Commission, Council and Parliament to look seriously at the amendments we have proposed on that."
"It is vital to recognise Chinese Walls where the proposal is being switched from a law which can be applied only to individuals to a law which can be applied to companies."
"It is very important that we encourage firms to take care to restrict the flow of inside information if at all possible, and I am very grateful to the rapporteur for responding to the concerns that I have expressed on this."
"Chinese Walls can be useful if they are enforced properly."
"We should encourage firms to use them and enforce them properly."
"Finally, it is vital that we have proper protection for freedom of speech and for journalists."
"Hence there need to be some radical changes to the proposals where they relate to the reporting of financial information by journalists."
"The lack of momentum at the Barcelona Summit has been very frustrating."
"In my view, we are proving in the European Parliament today that we have indeed made progress, and I believe the Commissioner will be pleased about that."
"I wish to focus on the report by Mr Lipietz."
"I would also like to congratulate him on his report on financial conglomerates. This is something in which we, in the Netherlands, have a great deal of experience."
"But, I should like to make a few general observations in particular."
"We, in the Netherlands, have been struggling for some time with the issue of supervising dynamic developments within the market at both cross-border and cross-sector level."
"The problem is how to tailor this supervision to these dynamic developments."
"For the time being, the Financial Services Action Plan has settled for the approach of streamlining the rules of the different supervisory authorities in the Member States as much as possible, and working towards a level playing field within the markets on that basis."
"In this pragmatic approach, it is appropriate to leave it up to the Member States to decide on how they will organise their supervisory structure."
"I see this very much as an interim solution which also has some drawbacks."
"However, it is important in my view to focus on the future solution, future supervision, which will need to take place at European level."
"This structure will need to become more efficient, more transparent and less decentralised in order to be truly effective."
"It is impossible to regulate everything down to the last detail."
"In the Netherlands, we have a great deal of experience with an approach whereby the supervisory authority has a reasonable amount of discretionary power. However, this approach will cause problems if it has to be approved cross-border for other Member States, to cater for the large quantity of existing authorities."
"I therefore believe that we will have to hold a debate after all, about a strong, European supervisor, and we will also need to find out how we will distribute this task, and whether this will indeed be done at sector level."
"In my view, this comes too late, but we may ask whether we still nevertheless need to draw a functional distinction between supervision of conduct and prudential supervision."
"The role of the European Central Bank should also be considered in my view."
"I understand that in these circles, more thought is now also being given to a possible role in supervision."
"By way of conclusion, I should therefore like to propose that both the Commission and the European Parliament take initiatives for such a far-reaching discussion."
"Madam President, the regulation of the stock market must be able to reconcile two objectives: firstly, to give European companies more opportunities to obtain money more cheaply, and secondly, to protect the investor."
"I believe that this reconciliation has been achieved in the report on market abuse and also thanks to several compromise amendments in the Directive regulating the audit or control of financial conglomerates."
"Unfortunately, there are three attacks on the principle of legal protection in Mr Huhne's report: firstly, an attack on the definition of the public offer; secondly, an attack on the choice of the authority designated to approve prospectuses; and thirdly, an attack on the obligation to inform small and medium-sized companies."
"I will deal with each issue in turn."
"With regard to the definition of the public offer, the rapporteur proposes that this information should be provided to the investor at the final stage, immediately before the contract is signed."
"In my opinion, this information must be available and made public from the moment that money is requested from the investor and it is clear that my formula, which is in line with that of the Commission, does not exclude this investigation from analysing investment possibilities with professional investors."
"Secondly, with regard to the proposed free election of the supervisory authority, I, who in a former reincarnation was a tax inspector, do not feel it would be a good idea for contributors to elect their tax inspector, nor does it seem a good idea for the financial institutions to elect the ultimate supervisory body."
"I believe that the formula proposed by the Commission is more coherent and gives greater respect to the previous Directives, and shows a greater degree of common sense - that it is the national authority which has the best knowledge of the applicable national law, of which it should inform the investor - and that, above all, it presents the least risks, because the absolute freedom formula, in my opinion, opens up a competition, a race between the supervisory authorities to make things too easy and attract investors who would be a threat to legal certainty."
"I cannot agree with the rapporteur on the last point with regard to the exclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises, even more so when we bear in mind that small and medium-sized enterprises have a capital of ESP 350 million, which would mean the exclusion of 80% of companies quoted on the stock exchange."
"I am sorry that I am not able to finish; I will conclude this dialogue with Mr Huhne, now by letter and I hope, later on, orally."
"Madam President, this is a joint debate on three subjects."
"I should like to start with the report prepared by Mr Lipietz."
"I begin by commending him on that excellent report."
"He has mastered a proposal which is both technically complex and economically important."
"I can therefore accept the following amendments without reservation: Amendments Nos 2, 3, 7 to 10;"
"Nos 18 to 30, 35, 36, 40 and 42. These are welcome reinforcements and real clarifications of the proposal."
"In the same way there are a number of amendments which I can accept in spirit."
"They go a long way in the right direction but need some refinement to avoid confusion or possible contradiction."
"Amendment No 6 could be improved by combining the elements in Amendment No 9 to give a good set of macro-economic criteria to determine which groups are covered by the directive."
"Amendment No 17 clarifies how to cover special group structures."
"That is also a welcome clarification but the wording could be tightened up."
"Amendment No 31 requires the Commission to consult industry."
"I agree."
"But the amendment seems to us to be too limited."
"It restricts consultation to a handful of Brussels federations."
"The Commission is in favour of as wide and as representative a consultation as possible."
"I think that Parliament would also consider that necessary."
"Amendments Nos 32 to 34, 44, 46 and 48 seek to amend what should be deducted from capital to prevent the so-called double-gearing of capital and artificially inflate a company's capital base."
"I agree with the spirit of those amendments."
"The 20% threshold for insurance deductions appears to be a good compromise."
"The proposed wording just needs some improvement to ensure the overall coherence of the text."
"But Amendments Nos 43, 45 and 47, which completely contradict Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48, are then not acceptable."
"There are only a few amendments which I am unfortunately unable to accept."
"Firstly, amendments that significantly narrow the scope of the directive: namely Amendments Nos 4, 5, 11, 12 and 49."
"They will limit the measures to groups with a parent/subsidiary relationship only."
"That does not reflect reality."
"There are groups that are organised on a different basis which would then escape supervision, for example, horizontal cooperatives or mutual groups such as Rabo Bank in the Netherlands or the DG Bank in Germany."
"These amendments also exclude anyone with close links to a conglomerate."
"After the Spanish BANESTO case we all know how important it is to include such cases in our supervision, in particular for intra-group transactions."
"A second group of amendments which I unfortunately cannot support concern the calculation of capital adequacy."
"They are Amendments Nos 15, 16, 37 and 39."
"I can accept moving the substance from the annex to the articles of the directive but I cannot support the additional substantive changes on the definition of capital."
"They would fundamentally undermine the capital standards for our industry."
"Firstly, the English text of Amendment No 16 changes one word in the original proposal and consequently opens the door to acceptance of all types of capital to cover risks, irrespective of the quality of that capital."
"I understand that this is a typing error - these things sometimes happen - but I should like confirmation that the French and German texts, which leave the original text unchanged, are the correct text."
"Secondly, I cannot accept including minority interests in group capital - that is, the last sentence of Amendment No 15 - if all the risks in the group are not also covered."
"The third group of amendments which I cannot support are those that give our financial groups the freedom to choose the way in which they calculate their capital adequacy."
"This concerns Amendments Nos 1, 13, 14, 38 and 51."
"That is the role and responsibility of our public authorities."
"They cannot abdicate this to the industry through self-regulation, and I agree that the authorities should discuss and agree with each group how its capital adequacy should be calculated."
"I am sure that we can work out an acceptable compromise, but I ask for your understanding if I say that these amendments go too far."
"In conclusion on this point, this is a most welcome and supportive report."
"I should like to underline that."
"With a few exceptions which I have mentioned, it really contributes to a rapid agreement and I am confident that it will be possible to work out acceptable compromises on the following amendments: Nos 1, 4, 5, 11 to 16, 37 to 39, 49 and 51."
"Progress is being made in the Council and agreement between the institutions appears quite close."
"On the second issue, which is the report prepared by Mr Goebbels, may I begin by saying that very good progress has been made on this dossier."
"First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, very much indeed for all the efforts he has made while working under heavy pressure, as we all do, incidentally."
"It is a very complex and sensitive dossier and I should like to applaud the fact that the rapporteur has resolutely defended the aim of this directive, namely to enhance substantially the integrity of European financial markets."
"I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Monetary Affairs for their readiness to proceed as quickly as possible."
"I know we all agree that the European Union has no truck with greedy financial cheats."
"We want stable, transparent, integrated and efficient European markets for all consumers and investors."
"This directive must contribute to increasing investor protection and to making European financial markets surer and more attractive in future."
"It must dispel the international concerns expressed over the last few years about insider dealing and manipulation on European markets."
"I am certain all Members are aware that recent events have shown how important those issues are."
"It is not only the attacks of 11 September that have proven the necessity of high market protection."
"Scandals such as the Enron business, which has been referred to at various times tonight, clearly show the need for rules making markets safer and ensuring that they remain free of abuse and fraud."
"The smooth functioning of financial markets and public confidence in them are the conditions for sustained economic growth and wealth."
"Market abuse increases the costs for financing companies, harms market integrity and dissuades investors."
"We must do everything to stamp it out."
"With this directive, we ensure high market integrity, and establish common standards against market abuse throughout Europe, making European financial markets more attractive in future."
"The Commission can agree with all the amendments that Mr Goebbels has proposed in his report, except those additionally proposed by Mrs Echerer, Amendments Nos 75 and 76, by Mr Lehne, Amendments Nos 88 and 89, and by Mr Herzog, Amendment No 87."
"But the Commission still has doubts about Amendment No 2 regarding comitology."
"Firstly, this amendment is not necessary, given that the Commission has already accepted Amendment No 1, which makes a clear reference to the declaration of President Prodi at the last part-session of this Parliament on 5 February and to my letter of 2 October 2001 to the chairperson of the Committee on Economic Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Furthermore, during the debate on the report by Lord Inglewood concerning international accounting standards last Monday, I once again underlined our full commitment to this important declaration regarding the implementation of financial services legislation."
"Secondly, the amendment does not reflect all the elements that have been agreed between our institutions, and there are some differences between the wording of the declaration of President Prodi and the wording of Amendment No 2 which might result in misinterpretations."
"Furthermore - and this is an important point - I would say to Mr Goebbels that I am not certain whether the different wordings would be agreed by the Council."
"I cannot speak on behalf of the Council, but it may well entail difficulties which we would be well advised to avoid."
"The Commission would prefer, therefore, to stick to what has previously been agreed."
"Let me state unequivocally that the Commission will fully respect - and to the letter - the commitments it has made in its declaration in plenary, as well as in my own letter to Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Should plenary adopt the amendments adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, together with some of the additional amendments proposed for today's sitting, I very much hope that the Council will be able to accept this text as well, so we would have only one reading."
"That would be a major achievement for the integration of European financial markets by the year 2005 to which we all aspire, as well as a sign of confidence for the Barcelona European Council."
"I hope that all Members present here and those voting tomorrow will agree and adopt that directive."
"Lastly, we come to the report prepared by Mr Huhne concerning the directive on prospectuses."
"May I again begin by thanking Mr Huhne for his report."
"Many amendments have been proposed and they result in clarification of our proposal."
"Good work has been done to improve the wording on eurobonds, which we broadly support."
"We can accept 46 amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 7 to 9, 13, 18, 19, 22 to 26, 29, 30, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44 to 56, 58 to 61, 63, 64, 66 to 72 and 75, but we may have to redraft some of them to ensure the overall coherence of the text."
"I am worried, however, by some points which Parliament may adopt."
"Firstly, I am concerned that, in the aftermath of Enron, Parliament may even weaken the fundamentals of current EU legislation, i.e. legislation which is now in force, namely, that companies wanting to raise capital among the public have to disclose information in a prospectus approved by the competent authority."
"That is what Amendment No 35 is about."
"Is this Parliament really prepared to support an amendment to the effect that more than 75% of all companies listed in Europe should be able to raise capital without publishing a prospectus?"
"Mrs Berès made that same point a little while ago."
"That would mean that for some EU markets all but one or two companies would be exempted."
"How do we explain that to European investors?"
"For the Commission, the prospectus proposal has two aims: to facilitate fundraising for European issuers, and to ensure an adequate level of investor protection."
"Both these aims are equally important."
"Investor protection has been neglected too often in the discussion."
"The second cause for worry is that some of the amendments proposed will result in more fragmentation, not less."
"We must agree what is good for the EU as a whole, and we do not want any tinkering with national systems."
"Let me be clear on this point, and let me be clear to this House, that my colleagues and I will spare no effort to reach an agreement with Parliament on this crucial text for a single capital market, but we must resolve those problems."
"Let me now briefly address possible solutions to some of the most important political issues."
"On small and medium-sized enterprises the Commission is against their total exemption from the proposal, but it is willing to find a cost-effective solution that would ensure that SMEs should have access to capital markets at the right price and under the right levels of regulation with the necessary investor protection."
"We have always advocated adapting the disclosure rules to the specific nature of SMEs and we would be ready to contemplate an exemption for SMEs from the obligation annually to update the prospectus, as proposed by Amendment No 71."
"As regards eurobonds we agree with the rapporteur's idea to exempt eurobonds with a high minimum denomination but we consider that the level proposed - EUR 50,000 - is too low."
"We therefore support Amendments Nos 66 and 67, as it seems to the Commission that good work has been done here."
"As regards the annual updating of the prospectus, we might contemplate exempting SMEs but we shall certainly stay firm as regards big companies, not least because 300 of our largest companies listed in the United States already comply with this obligation."
"Our investors should have the same disclosure as United States investors."
"I am certain we all agree that our investors are not inferior to the American ones."
"Lastly, regarding the competent authority, we want to retain our position of one administrative authority per Member State."
"We are ready to clarify that a delegation of powers is possible provided that the ultimate responsibility remains with the single administrative competent authority."
"We do not agree with the free choice of the regulator which might lead to the famous ""race to the bottom"", but we would be ready to consider some flexibility for issuers of debt securities and those working out of third countries."
"To sum up, the Commission rejects 29 amendments."
"They are Amendments Nos 2, 5, 6, 10 to 12, 14 to 17, 20, 21, 27, 28, 31 to 37, 40, 42, 57, 62, 65, 73, 74 and 76."
"Regarding Amendment No 10, we accept the amendments on comitology because they reflect our agreement on that matter, but we consider that Amendment No 10 is redundant."
"The situation is the same as for Amendment No 2, on the report by Mr Goebbels, so I do not have to repeat the whole argument."
"We consider Amendment No 10 to be redundant given Amendment No 1, which refers to the resolution of Parliament and my letter to Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Thank you, Mr Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"The next item is a joint debate on two reports by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs:"
"A5-0061/2002 by Mr Pérez Royo on the effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments within the Community (COM(2001) 400 - C5-0402/2001 - 2001/0164(CNS))."
"A5-0048/2002 by Mr Della Vedova on tax policy in the European Union - Priorities for the years ahead (COM(2001) 260 - C5-0597/2001 - 2001/2248(COS))."
"Madam President, so that we can gauge the importance of this debate, I should like to start by reminding you of the remote origins of this proposal for a directive; the Directive on the liberalisation of capital movements of 24 June 1988."
"The authors of this directive were aware of the opportunities arising for the evasion of national capital gains tax as a result of this liberalisation, by investing in a country other than the investor's country of residence; to summarise this situation, we can say that the risk was, and continues to be, that each Member State, each member of the single market that was being set up at that time and is now up and running, would act as a tax haven for the other Member States."
"This risk, as I said, was highlighted by the authors of the Directive on the liberalisation of capital movements, who called on the Commission and the Council to legislate on this matter, the fiscal aspect of the liberalisation of capital movements, within one year, that is to say, in 1989."
"The Commission, and the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Scrivener, presented its proposal on time, but this proposal, basically consisting of the introduction of a deduction at source - withholding tax - for payments to residents in other Member States, was not accepted by the Council and was rejected, and became a sort of abortive legislation."
"In 1997, the Commission made a new proposal, within the so-called Monti package, based on the coexistence model, on which Parliament was able to draw up a report, but at the end of the day this did not receive unanimous support from the Council either."
"The next step in this process is the Santa María de Feira Agreement, in which the European Council - that is to say the Heads of State and Government - taking a proposal from the Ecofin Council, reached a political agreement in principle on the basis of the points I will now explain."
"Firstly, the Member States would be committed to setting up a system for information exchange with regard to the payment of interest to a resident of another Member State, that is to say, this would involve the lifting of banking secrecy."
"Secondly, and as an exceptional and transitional system, it has been stated that certain States, Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg to be precise, should apply, in place of this information exchange - in other words, instead of the lifting of banking secrecy - a system for deduction at source."
"Finally, the implementation of the whole of this legal framework was dependent and still is dependent on negotiations with third countries, such as Switzerland, the United States and Andorra, for the application of equivalent measures, and the application of the same measures by the Member States in territories dependent on those Member States, such as the Channel Islands."
"Our opinion on the proposal for a Directive applying these Feira guidelines is entirely positive."
"We believe, in general terms, that this is in line with the approach taken by the OECD, which is, at this time, the most active forum for discussion in this field."
"The main problem with this scheme, and I will conclude on this note, Madam President - and this cannot escape anyone's attention - are the negotiations with third countries."
"In other words, the problem is how to get Switzerland to lift its banking secrecy."
"However, at the risk of appearing to be a naive optimist, I should like to remind you that everything in life is subject to change and that not even Swiss banking secrecy is what it once was."
"I should specifically like to draw your attention to the following fact; the United States has been able, by means of an internal regulation, to implement a regulation, the so-called Qualified Intermediary Agreement, by virtue of which the Swiss banks and those from other countries are obliged to communicate to the Internal Revenue Service profits made by an American client - a US person - from assets which are also American, to lift banking secrecy with regard to these payments or even to apply a deduction at source of 30%."
"Nobody can escape the fact that this regulation can be avoided simply by investing in non-American assets."
"Recognising that the cases are not precisely the same, with regard to the fight against terrorism, in this case we also find ourselves up against the limitations of the unilateral approach in the fight against improper practices, in this case tax evasion at international level."
"For this reason, I must emphasise the positive contribution a joint action by the European Union and the United States could make in this area."
"We believe that this should be the path to follow in negotiations with the United States and with other countries."
"We have faith - and on this note I shall end, Madam President - in the Commission's ability, and that they will know how to provide the impetus for these negotiations, which will provide a solution to this problem of the taxation of savings, which, to tell the truth, should have been resolved some time ago."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my fellow members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who, especially during the debate and then with countless amendments, have helped to improve this report and, I believe, to finalise a text which I hope will please both the Committee and this House."
"The report gives a generally favourable verdict on two Commission communications: one on fiscal policy strategies, and one on a strategy for a consolidated tax base for Europe-wide companies."
"The verdict is generally favourable as regards the identification of their general objectives and the instruments that can be used to achieve them."
"The first part of the report stresses that the constant growth of the tax burden over the last twenty years - something that has only slowed down slightly and has not stopped completely in the last couple of years - may well be one of the reasons for the poor growth in the European Union."
"By stressing that a certain level of tax competition might be inevitable and might help to reduce tax pressure, the Commission communications appropriately recognise that it has a useful role in the context of rules preventing improper conduct."
"The report takes up the principle of tax competition and emphasises it, pointing out that it is compatible - as the experience of recent years has shown - with constant coordination of fiscal regulations aimed at eliminating barriers to the internal market."
"Tax competition is compatible with the completion of the internal market, which does not imply the absolute levelling-out of competitive conditions, and tax competition is just one of the many variables that determine the competitive regime within each country and between different countries."
"Tax competition, as has been pointed out by the Nobel prize-winner, Robert Mundell, one of the recognised fathers of the single currency, does not run counter even to the introduction of the euro."
"Moreover, in connection with tax competition, it should be reiterated that in reality there is no sign of any 'race to the bottom', that fall in tax revenue that many often dread, fearing that there might be a shortfall in the resources needed by the State."
"We have seen that, in a situation of tax competition, taxation has in fact continued to grow in the European Union over the last couple of decades."
"We are concerned about the tax burden on work - and the report bears this out; but there is no proof and it is not rational to think that this might be a consequence of a reduction in the tax burden on capital: there is no sign of this in the data we have before us."
"I shall now pass on to other points, Mr President, Commissioner."
"As regards VAT, the report stresses the need to set up a system that applies in full the country-of-origin principle - prioritising the definitive system - on which the Commission documents are, in our view, still evasive."
"This objective is specified but the timescales and procedures for introducing the country-of-origin regime are not given."
"The report welcomes certain suggestions for improving the current system, but the introduction of a definitive system is called for."
"As regards excise duties, particularly on alcohol and tobacco, the report reiterates Parliament's position as already expressed in the Katiforis report."
"Then in relation to environmental protection, not only is the 'polluter pays' principle recognised, but also the fact that taxation is not the only way of implementing this principle."
"As regards energy taxation, I must stress that, in actual fact, the current competitive distortions and asymmetries in the energy market make it inappropriate now, at least, to propose tax harmonisation for energy products."
"On the subject of direct taxes, Commissioner, the report hopes that progress towards full implementation of the measures contained in the tax package will be completed as soon as possible and, in particular, that any rules discriminating between residents and non-residents, which leave loopholes for fraud and are incompatible with the single market, will be removed."
"With regard to the strategy for introducing a consolidated tax base for the Europe-wide activities of companies, the report welcomes the Commission's decision and proposes the adoption of the Home State Taxation principle, at least temporarily, pending the introduction of the consolidated base."
"It confirms that determining the rates and levels of taxation should be left to the individual countries."
"In conclusion, as regards the legal instruments to use, I welcome the effort to introduce soft legislation and therefore self-regulation by the Member States."
"Lastly, I should like to highlight the principle of Parliamentary codecision in taxation matters and the change to qualified-majority voting for administrative aspects, but not for the definition of rates and the tax base."
"As the rapporteur, I support the two amendments."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Pérez Royo is to be welcomed for the balanced approach and technical competence employed in its preparation."
"A subject like the taxation of savings certainly ought to be dealt with in such a manner because the field is so sensitive."
"The Commission and the Council have considered at least three hypothetical paths to take in their time, often changing their minds and their strategies."
"They are: a withholding tax, the exchange of information, and both possibilities together."
"In the end, they opted for the exchange of information and, after a heated debate in the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, this was limited to natural persons."
"As shadow rapporteur I fought for the exclusion of legal persons from the directive, because a business, whatever form of company status it may have, is obliged to draw up a balance sheet and have it approved."
"As soon as investments in savings products appear on it, the income they generate must consequently be indicated in the accounts."
"Therefore, extending the communication requirement to legal persons would be not only superfluous but certainly counterproductive, since it would overburden the communication in a manner that is surely avoidable."
"The problem of third countries also needs to be addressed."
"Should any of them fail to accept the mechanism, it would undermine the whole directive because, if at the time of implementation the conditions in the Member States and third countries were not uniform, it would be highly feasible for substantial amounts of savings to be transferred in real time."
"The conclusions of the Feira European Council unequivocally state that sufficient reassurances must be obtained from third countries regarding these or equivalent measures so that the adoption and implementation of the directive may be decided upon no later than 31 December 2002, by unanimity."
"Another important aspect concerns the Member States that are not subject to the communication requirement for a period of seven years: Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg."
"These States, however, as laid down in Amendment No 14 to Article 10 paragraph 1, will be required at the end of the transitional period to fully participate in the automatic exchange of information."
"In the way the directive has been drawn up, all attempts to maintain anonymity have been blocked."
"It will also be necessary to make it work smoothly and fluently, keeping a watchful eye open for any laundering of dirty money."
"Without this opportunity to launder money, national and international terrorism will find it hard to survive."
"From this perspective, my Amendment No 6 to Article 3 paragraph 2 (b) also seeks to establish the full personal identity of all contractual relations made prior to the directive as soon as they show any kind of activity."
"In this regard, it would be desirable to have a European personal data centre to check all major movements of money that may have - or are just suspected of having - connections with international terrorism."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, very warmly for his report, which makes it very clear what progress still needs to be made in this field."
"I would also like to thank Mr Della Vedova very sincerely for his well-balanced proposal."
"We all know what a difficult area EU tax coordination is."
"Virtually no one is talking about tax harmonisation any more."
"At the same time, we also know that tax competition can have very harmful effects on Europe's economies and on the choice of locations for investment in the European Union."
"I would specifically like to thank Mr Della Vedova for having highlighted the issue of codecision by the European Parliament again in his role as rapporteur, since I believe that in the context of treaty reform and the discussions on a European constitution we also need to consider where the boundaries of national sovereignty lie when it comes to taxation policy."
"So we also need to adopt new approaches in order to define where it is in the general interest to set cornerstones for tax policy."
"I therefore believe that the Convention would be well advised to tackle this subject as well and to call for treaty reforms providing for a move away from the unanimity rule and towards the majority rule in EU tax policy."
"We are of course still a very long way from that, if we look at this really excellent paper and the very pragmatic but at the same time very accurate paper by the Commission."
"The Commission has quite rightly taken stock in a rather sobering way as regards coordination."
"The situation on value added tax is certainly disappointing, because we are still a long way from applying the country of origin principle."
"The pragmatic approach adopted by the Commission should therefore be supported, even if we should never lose sight of our ultimate goal."
"However, it is hard to reconcile various other areas of tax coordination with a forward-looking approach."
"I believe that in the case of company taxation we are still a long way from achieving what the Monti Package was at one point attempting to do."
"In any case, we need to make sure that tax havens are finally abolished and that favourable tax treatment for non-resident legal or natural persons, which distort competition, is finally eliminated."
"That should be our objective, together with the minimum requirement for uniform definitions in tax law, ranging from the basis of assessment to definitions of profit."
"I would very much welcome it if we in the European Parliament could agree on a single set of definitions for these arrangements."
"That would certainly encourage national governments to take a more progressive line."
"In my one minute's speaking time, I shall confine myself to the Pérez Royo report on the taxation of savings."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur has adopted the amendment I have tabled in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which states that this directive shall be subject to agreement to be reached between the European Union and a number of third countries which have the same duty of notification."
"This is indeed the thrust of the conclusions which the European Council had reached in Feira."
"In fact, negotiations in this respect are already under way."
"It is good therefore that this condition is expressly included in the text of the directive which, so far, strangely enough, had not been the case."
"In my view, an agreement of this kind involving a number of third countries and so-called independent territories is of great importance in order to guarantee the equal treatment of savings both inside and outside the European Union, to rule out tax avoidance and to prevent considerable flight of capital."
"I do regret, however, that no amendments have been taken into consideration with regard to the application of the directive to legal entities."
"This would preclude the placing of significant savings of individuals into the accounts of companies, with the intention of evading this directive, an act which cannot be condoned."
"Madam President, I am only going to discuss the Pérez Royo report, and I wish to say that I am far from happy with the compromise reached in Feira on the taxation of savings."
"The proposal for a directive that the Commission submitted to us is meant to be cast into a legislative text."
"The result is a compromise."
"The proposal is therefore no longer the result of the right of initiative that is reserved for the Commission."
"If the Commission is happy to act as the clerk that draws up the Council's legislation, it could at least have submitted a draft to us that complied better with the legal requirements that we have the right to expect from a legislative text."
"I am therefore grateful to the Committee on Economic and Monetary affairs for having adopted the majority of my amendments, which I tabled with the aim of ensuring a minimum level of legal security."
"Our Socialist rapporteur had tried to radicalise this proposal for a directive by moving away from the Feira agreement."
"In particular he wanted to extend the scope to legal persons and to propose the taxation without distinction of all investment funds."
"Fortunately these ideas were not taken up."
"I obviously regret the fact that in Feira, the coexistence model was abandoned."
"I remain convinced that the automatic exchange of information between Member States on interest payments is a means and not an essential condition for ensuring effective taxation of cross-border interest payments."
"Withholding tax is, in my opinion, just as valid a solution."
"It would also be a model that could be adopted by the third countries that are our competitors and with which we need to have reached an agreement in order for them to introduce genuinely equivalent measures before the Directive is applied in the European Union."
"Clearly, if Switzerland, for example, rejects the exchange of information due to its legitimate commitment to banking secrecy, there can be no question of my country, for example, which clearly declared its support at Feira for the exchange of information, implementing it."
"I am convinced that the exchange of information will not be the solution that is ultimately chosen."
"The most effective and least bureaucratic solution would be full withholding tax, which, with a reasonable rate, could even become an own resource of the European Union."
"Madam President, unlike Mrs Lulling, I do believe this proposal to be a valid one."
"Surely it is the case that whoever wants to practise good governance should not only draft appropriate laws, but should also ensure that these are complied with."
"And if we notice that Member States are unable to do this, then we should help them where we can."
"Incidentally, in Belgium, we are all too familiar with this."
"We have had monetary union with Luxembourg for years, and it has effectively encouraged cross border payment transactions aimed at avoiding tax on moveable goods."
"The citizens are all too keen to forget that they have to declare the income derived from moveables from another country to the tax administration of their own country."
"It can therefore do no harm to give them a helping hand."
"Ultimately, this can help prevent tax erosion and allows for a more naturally functioning internal market."
"It has always appeared judicious to me to set matters straight in this area, primarily within the internal market, and without necessarily making it subject to agreements with third countries."
"However, if I have understood the conclusions of Feira correctly, this is a stipulation which the Council does want to put in place."
"When I read the Commission proposal, it once again fails to state this in the text which normally should reflect the agreement of Feira."
"This is why I should like to ask the Commissioner once more what, in his opinion, are the advantages and disadvantages of including this stipulation, and I should also like to ask him if he could once again inform us of the current state of affairs in the negotiations involving third countries."
"Parliament would be interested to know whether these are promising, when they are likely to be concluded and how we should couple the timing of the implementation of this proposal with the results of these negotiations."
"Madam President, I should also like to thank Mr Della Vedova for his report on the Commission's communications, on our general tax policy and on company taxation in the internal market."
"I should also like to thank Mr Pérez Royo for his report on the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings."
"I should like to begin with the report of Mr Della Vedova, which I very much welcome."
"It may help if I recall briefly the Commission's motivation for producing these two communications."
"Individual Member States retain, quite correctly, responsibility for many aspects of national tax policy."
"But there is an ongoing demand for an EU tax policy in many areas."
"A key question is: what degree of harmonisation is appropriate?"
"A high degree of harmonisation is necessary, it seems to the Commission, in the field of indirect taxes."
"Such taxes can create an immediate obstacle to the free movement of goods and the free supply of services within the internal market."
"Indeed a certain degree of harmonisation in that area has already taken place."
"I am very conscious that this Parliament has had its differences with the Commission on the issue of rates of excise duty on tobacco and alcohol - an issue dear to the heart of Mrs Lulling."
"It is clear, however, that the existing wide rate divergences between Member States constitute a strong incentive for both fraudulent transactions and legitimate cross-border shopping which lead both to distortion of competition and diversion of trade."
"I am therefore of the opinion that the permanent solution for these problems requires enhanced approximation of rates to a level at which the above effects no longer occur or are brought back to a sustainable level."
"On the other hand, there is no need to harmonise personal income taxes unless they entail discrimination or double taxation."
"But there is an intermediate zone of direct taxation of mobile tax bases - in particular the taxation of companies and capital - where the situation is less clear-cut and which may have direct effects on the internal market."
"The so-called tax package, of which the directive on savings taxation is an important element, seeks to address the potential erosion of tax revenues and eliminate harmful tax competition."
"But to achieve a balance in European tax policy, attention should also be paid to the concerns of taxpayers, both individuals and companies."
"That means addressing obstacles that hinder the exercise of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty."
"This is where our communication devoted to company taxation comes in."
"In that communication we review the tax obstacles faced by companies who operate cross-border in the European Union."
"We have identified a significant number of those obstacles, which, we must all agree is astonishing, given the fact that it is nearly 10 years since the internal market was established."
"We have also identified potential solutions."
"We have examined a number of possible solutions to this problem in the form of both targeted and comprehensive approaches."
"The latter would, in the longer term, provide companies with a consolidated, corporate tax base for their EU-wide activities."
"Naturally I am extremely grateful for the support given to this principle by Mr Della Vedova in his report."
"In pursuing the various objectives I have just outlined in relation to taxation at EU level, the Commission will need to employ a variety of methods, including non-legislative mechanisms."
"Again, I am very grateful for the unqualified support for this policy in Mr Della Vedova's report."
"I now turn to the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings."
"Firstly, I am pleased to note that a substantial number of the proposed amendments correspond to changes agreed by of the ECOFIN Council in the draft directive approved on 13 December 2001, for the purpose of negotiations with third countries."
"The large measure of agreement between the Council and Parliament on the text of the proposal cannot but strengthen the Community's negotiating position in the discussion with third countries."
"The Commission takes the view that the amendments agreed by the Council on 13 December improve and clarify the legal texts, but that they do not substantially change the proposal for a directive."
"The Commission therefore considers that these amendments do not justify presenting a revised proposal for a directive given the particular time constraints that we are operating under."
"A number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs related to the negotiations with third countries and Member States' dependent and associated territories, and more particularly to Parliament's role in these discussions."
"Parliament may rest assured that I intend to keep Parliament fully informed of these negotiations and that I have no intention whatsoever of undermining Parliament's prerogatives."
"I fully share the view expressed by Mr Pérez Royo that this proposal has an important international dimension."
"This is exactly why the Commission asked for and obtained authorisation from the Council to enter into negotiations with the six third countries mentioned in the Faro European Council conclusions."
"They are: the United States, Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino."
"The aim of these negotiations is to secure the adoption of measures equivalent to the system applied within the Community."
"At the same time, Member States are committed to promoting the adoption of the same measures by their own dependent and associated territories."
"The discussions with third countries and dependent territories should hopefully be finalised before the summer."
"I must emphasise that the Faro Agreement provides that these negotiations with third countries and dependent and associated territories should precede the adoption of the directive."
"The Commission cannot therefore accept amendments that would make the application of the directive, once adopted, dependent on the outcome of such negotiations."
"There is a risk that such amendments might undermine our negotiating position vis-à-vis the third countries who quite rightly want to be sure that Member States will implement the directive if they agree to apply equivalent measures."
"On the particular point raised by Mrs Thyssen, the discussions with third countries should precede adoption of the directive."
"Those agreements are a political condition for adoption of the directive."
"Therefore we have to live with that."
"In closing, I once again thank Parliament for its support for the proposed directive on taxational savings."
"I assure Parliament that I shall keep it informed of developments to the best of my abilities."
"Madam President, I asked for the floor on a personal matter."
"I can only express my surprise at what Mrs Thyssen has said about me and about my country."
"Mrs Thyssen is not a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary affairs and did not take part in the discussions in my group on the taxation of savings."
"I would therefore like it to be noted that what she has said on the subject is completely wrong."
"I think that Mrs Lulling has misunderstood me."
"I only referred to the people of my own country."
"I certainly did not attack or ill use anyone in Luxembourg, or at least I hope not."
"And although I am, of course, no longer a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I did fulfil this role for 10 years."
"Since I was shadow rapporteur for my group during a previous round - dealing with the second proposal by the Commission on this subject - I did follow this issue to some extent, Mrs Lulling."
"But I certainly had no intention of offending anyone in Luxembourg or anything of the sort."
"I do not think I did; but if I did, my apologies."
"I would advise Mrs Lulling to read my text carefully, and she will conclude that there is no problem whatsoever."
"The next item is a report (A5-0409/2001) by Mr Carnero Gonzàles, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the legal personality of the European Union [2001/2021(INI)]."
"Madam President, at this late hour, anyone can make a mistake."
"If a market research institute were to ask people if they thought the European Union had its own personality, I think that the majority would say yes."
"They would most certainly be mistaken, but this error would demonstrate at least three things: firstly, the current lack of transparency in the European Union's institutional architecture; secondly, the lack of information for citizens from their governments in areas such as those we are dealing with and, without a doubt, the most important thing, that reality is way ahead of the decisions taken at Intergovernmental Conferences to date."
"The citizens believe that the European Union has its own personality, yet the governments in these Conferences have had no desire to provide it with one."
"The European Union has existed since the Treaty of Maastricht, which is some time ago now, but neither at that time nor since has it wanted to expressly take on a legal personality; the latest example of this was the Treaty of Nice."
"The issue is on the table."
"Why have governments refused to act?"
"Under these conditions, the EU continues to act like a child living under the legal authority of its parents: the European Communities."
"The question I would like to ask is the following: can we really uphold this contradictory and barely understandable situation for much longer?"
"The answer to this question is becoming more and more clear - 'no? - because the current situation causes legal confusion, political confusion, international and internal confusion, institutional confusion and, above all, as I said at the beginning of my speech, confusion amongst the citizens."
"I would now like to give you three examples of this in an international setting."
"We could go to a country such as Equatorial Guinea and see that the Commission delegation there is the Commission of the European Communities and not that of the European Union; we can listen to our representative in the United Nations and notice that he or she is from the European Communities and not the European Union, or, we see that a commitment made by a united Europe to very speedily endorse the Kyoto Protocol is not in fact endorsed by the European Union but the European Communities."
"Furthermore, this report has been produced at the same time as the start of the Convention on the future of Europe, which this Parliament hopes will produce a constitution."
"This will therefore be our first contribution to the Convention after it has been set up."
"It is logical that this issue should also be dealt with."
"We hope that the Convention and subsequently the Intergovernmental Conference, taking on board the issues that came to light at Laeken, will tackle the issue of giving the European Union a legal personality, which will have advantages that cannot be denied: firstly, legal clarity; secondly, the improvement of the Union's image and its capacity to take action on the international stage; thirdly, it will be a key element in establishing a system for the protection of fundamental rights at Union level; fourthly, to give Union policy a higher profile and make it easier for citizens to identify with the Union and, fifthly, to help remedy the dysfunctions caused by the pillar system."
"We also think that a legal personality is needed to bring the process of political union to a conclusion and that the process of the constitutionalisation of the Union will also require it to have its own legal personality."
"In fact, this is a necessary prerequisite to achieving these objectives in a coherent way."
"If this is not the final outcome, what will be the objective of the future constitutional text?"
"Which body will take on the leading role in the European Constitution?"
"The Union, the Communities, one of which is due to expire next Summer?"
"For this reason we ask that legal personality be given to the European Union in the future European Constitution."
"We ask for this in the report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for which I am honoured to be the rapporteur, in agreement with the opinions of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which I think are very positive contributions."
"I believe that this request for the Union to be given a legal personality was also apparent in the last Presidencies-in-Office of the Council, a desire expressed by both the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies."
"This, Madam President, is not an issue for legal experts, but a point that can be easily understood by any citizen: to know that he or she is a citizen of a European Union with its own personality, which can and should govern democratically and transparently, and they demand it fulfils its responsibilities."
". (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur has explained the position as regards the three Communities and the European Union."
"This subject is particularly problematic when it comes to foreign policy."
"For example, in international organisations, in the FAO, we have full membership for one of the Communities, and a seat and a vote on United Nations bodies, but this does not apply across the entire foreign policy spectrum."
"Let us consider in particular the changes that have taken place on the international scene over the last three years, with Mr Solana taking office in 1999, which represented a political step change in European foreign policy, the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 and the objective of a common foreign and security policy by 2003. These are ambitious targets which, however, are no longer rooted in the legal basis provided by the treaties."
"Today, Articles 24 and 38 provide a legal basis for concluding agreements, but they make one of the Communities or the Member States as such responsible."
"And this House also needs to be aware that agreements are entered into at present without Parliament having a chance to approve them beforehand."
"Budgetary commitments are made in international agreements which then have to be honoured by Parliament at a later stage because of our particular role."
"That is why I believe that this issue of the legal personality of the EU needs to be put on the agenda of the Convention again."
"We need this legal personality in order for the European Union to make a stronger contribution to the United Nations, for example, especially following the events of 11 September."
"This is in addition to the role of the Member States and is no substitute for individual Member States' membership of the United Nations, but it would give our foreign policy a higher profile, it would increase our scope for action and above all be more transparent to the public."
"That is the goal that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to see included in the discussions of the Convention."
"Mr President, the resolution on the legal personality of the European Union is one of Parliament's contributions to the Convention charged with drawing up the European Constitution."
"The Carnero González report stresses that the attribution of its legal personality is an essential step towards the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and improves the coherence of the various European policies."
"Opponents of the Union speak of a superstate, a Europe that has fallen into the hands of a stateless bureaucracy."
"In reality, Europe is not a threat to national identities, and national identities are not a threat to Europe."
"Political unity is the only way to prevent the individual countries from being overwhelmed by untamed globalisation or to prevent difficulties from making the ghosts of nationalism re-emerge."
"Anyway, we are not starting from scratch."
"In the past the Treaty has attributed legal personality to the European Communities, but with the birth of the Union there is a legal void to fill."
"The Council has addressed this several times, without, however, reaching clear conclusions."
"Public opinion and all countries that have relations with Europe are convinced that their relations are with an autonomous and unitary system."
"Moreover, in the sphere of foreign policy, defence and security, the European Council can deliberate on procedures that represent the beginnings of a legal personality."
"One has to recognise the benefits for European citizens and for the Union's international image."
"It is not true that we are trying to build our common house from the roof down."
"Construction by pillars reveals a problem, which Mr Carnero's proposal remedies by taking up a 1997 Parliamentary resolution on international law, Community law and the constitutions of the individual Member States."
"This resolution made express reference back then to the need to give the Union a legal personality."
"We cannot, of course, pre-empt the Convention, but this resolution gives a great boost to a constitutional process to which, in our opinion, the future of a democratic Europe is bound."
"Mr President, the Carnero González report raises a fundamental and timely issue, an important aspect of which is the problem of the Union's legal personality."
"It is easy to say what the issue is: the European Union needs at last to be given a face, a clear profile."
"Look, quite recently we were told to be careful: the building of Europe has progressed under wraps, without revealing its features and its intentions, playing on calculated ambiguities to disarm resistance and dodge the stiffest opposition."
"Thus for decades there was a succession of partial achievements and de facto solidarity, to borrow an expression dear to Jean Monnet and enshrined in the Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950."
"Things went forward like that, without too much definition of the political and institutional individual that was growing up, without too much pretence at coherence in the building of Europe."
"Well, we reply, the time has come for clarity, the time has come to explicitly characterise the supranational body that has gradually been taking shape until now we have a single currency."
"The Convention must say who we are and what we want."
"The fact that the European Community may have been an original construction, without historical precedent or pre-established models, cannot mean that it should remain inexpressible or indefinable, and certainly not that it should remain incomplete."
"We must respond to the citizens' legitimate questions and present ourselves as a union that has its own plan, that equips itself with clear institutional checks and balances, that recognises itself through a Constitution, that wants to play a strong international role, and therefore endows itself with a legal personality."
"Hence the coherent, convincing argument of Mr Carnero González's report, which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has fully endorsed."
"Mr President, most people would now say that they want the European Union to play a stronger role in world affairs, but they appear sometimes to be uncertain as to the ways and means."
"This evening, in the splendid Carnero González report, we have part of the answer."
"The acquisition of an international legal personality would be a powerful instrument for the Union."
"First, it will raise its international profile."
"Second, by giving the Union more respectability, it should encourage us to act more responsibly."
"It will open the door for a more proactive part for the Union inside the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank."
"It will consolidate our role and the functions of the Commission in the field of trade and the environment."
"But international legal personality cannot simply be asserted unilaterally."
"It must be earned if it is to win recognition under international law."
"What will assist us in winning this acceptance is for the Union itself to become a contracting party to the Council of Europe's Convention - a move that will complement the development of our own fundamental rights regime funded on the Charter."
"This report prepares those of us in the Convention to take the lead."
"We are grateful to the rapporteur for his sterling work."
"Mr President, giving the European Union legal personality as well as the European Communities, which already have it, would change very little, at least if we consider it in isolation."
"In order for it to radically change the institutions, it would need to be combined, as Mr Carnero González suggests several times in his report, with several other much more significant reforms: merging the pillars, the power to conclude treaties on its own behalf, generally incorporating decision-making into the Community sphere and adopting a supra-national constitution."
"This is why the report is right, in a sense, in saying that this reform would not in itself imply transfers of powers to the Union."
"It is true that a simple association of States making unanimous decisions could have legal personality."
"However, it is wrong to say that this alone could bring about the characteristics of coherence, unity of representation and visibility that the report ascribes to it."
"In other words, this reform is nothing, or if it is to be something, it has to be accompanied by a merging of the pillars, an incorporation into the Community sphere and a constitutional process, which whatever we choose to call it, would be the distinctive signs of a superstate or of something that would strongly resemble one."
"And that is why I am proposing a deal to Mr Carnero González. I am happy to accept the legal personality of the Union if, in exchange, Mr Carnero González agrees to say that, if a European constitution came into being, it should first and foremost acknowledge the superiority of the national constitutions, the freedom of choice of the Member States on the world stage and unanimous decision-making or variable geometry in the third pillar."
"If you agree to say all of that, Mr Carnero González, I would perhaps vote for your report, but you will not say this because your report is in fact hiding something other than what it claims."
"Mr President, on this report the British Conservatives will abstain."
"Within the delegation there is deep disagreement."
"Some believe that what is proposed is a step in the direction of a European superstate."
"Some, after considerable reflection, really do not know; and some believe this is a proposal that will create an entrenched bulwark against a superstate, and so are in favour."
"These views are individually deeply and honestly held, as indeed are my personal and private ones."
"In these circumstances, trying to compel one's colleagues to vote against their views on this kind of topic, in these kind of circumstances, is not only unlikely to work, it will not change their views either."
"All it does is cause trouble."
"While the subject matter of many of the non-legislative resolutions of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is very important, Parliament's resolutions themselves are, in the world of real politics, some of the less important items we vote on; it is therefore folly, it seems to me, and shows lack of judgement, to engage in civil war about things which do not matter all that much."
"Hence we are approaching this and other similar topics here within the framework of a broad church, which has the overriding advantage of being sensible, which I am not sure can be said about any other course of action open to us in the circumstances."
"Mr President, Mr Carnero's report to this House is an important one, and if this call for the EU to be given a legal personality is acted upon, that would be a qualitative leap forward in the unity that Europe represents for the citizens of our countries and also for the EU's partners throughout the world."
"No one understands the difference between the European Community and the European Union."
"It is complicated and confusing and also has many drawbacks."
"Mr Berthu is quite right in saying that this request forms part of the major overall reform that we want."
"Merging the three pillars and streamlining the decision-making structures are all things that we have already approved in the Leinen-Méndez de Vigo report and in various other reports."
"The question of legal personality is a cornerstone that is needed to bring the whole thing together."
"This cornerstone was missing and we are providing it now with Mr Carnero's report."
"I very much support this."
"The Convention is an excellent opportunity to do this work."
"We need Europe to have a single voice in the world."
"Mr Laschet and others have already mentioned examples of this absurdity: in some cases the Community is represented, but not the Union."
"It really is very complicated. But it is also important for justice and home affairs policy."
"I just asked him to say that we have agreed to make EUR 5 million available for Europol."
"That is a good thing, because we want Europol to function, but the funding cannot be accepted, because Europol cannot accept money from the Community budget, but only from the Member States."
"This demonstrates the absurdity of this situation, and I hope that our representatives and others involved in the Convention will take a step forward as regards legal personality and that the rights of our citizens will finally become binding, so that they can take the Union to court."
"On that note, I wish this proposal every success and say thank you to Mr Carnero."
"Mr President, with your permission, I feel I must point out that one person is still listening to the debate from the gallery."
"That deserves our full attention, given the hour."
"The Commission fully supports the terms of the proposed resolution."
"It comes at the right time because the Convention to prepare the next IGC has just started its work."
"It is very important that those who will be taking a position in the Convention and during the next IGC should be aware of the importance of this question for the effectiveness and the credibility of the Union and of the need to find an appropriate solution."
"We know the weaknesses of the current system and how difficult it is for outsiders to understand - just like the other solutions resisted by the Commission in the past, such as the addition of yet another legal personality to the current set-up."
"We have to convince people that it is essential to accord a single, full and complete personality to the Union."
"For this, it is obviously essential to have the active support of the European Parliament, together with the measure of agreement now seen in several parliamentary reports such as the Carnero González and Lamassoure reports, and in the opinions of the various parliamentary subcommittees consulted."
"The European Parliament can count on the Commission to support the terms of this resolution in the forthcoming debate."
"Commissioner, on behalf of our sole but very attentive spectator, I thank you very much."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0050/2002) by Mrs Carlotti, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2001 (2001/2012(INI))."
"Mr President, every year the European Parliament presents a report on the activities of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly."
"Since 2000, however, the Cotonou Agreement has brought about a new context that profoundly changes the very nature of this report. The Cotonou Agreement made profound changes to the cooperation objectives, with the new goal being a renewed partnership that is more balanced and more effective."
"This means that there have to be changes in the JPA's modus operandi. More than just changes in the modus operandi, it requires a real cultural change."
"Where are we in this process?"
"The Joint Parliamentary Assembly is at a watershed."
"After 2000, which had raised great hopes of a new era in relations between the EU and ACP States, 2001 did not fulfil all its promise."
"The working group did undertake a massive adaptation of its working methods, but many delays and a great deal of resistance hindered progress."
"Here are three examples of this: firstly, the European States' inertia in the ratification process."
"Only three countries have ratified the agreement: Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and us, the European Union."
"Although we are aware that the procedures are long in many European countries, this sends out a political message and a negative signal to the ACP countries."
"All European Member States must ratify the agreement before the end of 2002."
"The second example is the untimely use of voting by separate college in the Assembly."
"This is detrimental to its parliamentary nature."
"I propose limited use, and in particular I propose a moratorium on its use among Europeans."
"The question of voting rights is fundamental, and the debate over Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure has led to numerous controversies."
"The principle of representation by parliamentarians alone must be forcefully reaffirmed, and the compromise drawn up by the Working Group, which specifies limited cases of difficulty in which voting by non-parliamentarians is permitted, is the final position that we can accept here."
"We need to get through this bad patch."
"This report proposes a few paths that we could take."
"I will only mention some of them, such as a specific instrument to contribute to democracy: the democratic bonus, financial or material aid to improve the functioning of democratically elected parliaments and a better representation of the opposition."
"For the ACP countries, the principle is one country, one vote."
"In fact, each country speaks with just one voice."
"It is impossible for opposition Members of Parliament in the ACP countries to make themselves heard."
"In order to remedy this, we need to have an open debate, without taboos, on the re-weighting of votes."
"For now, the proposal of three delegates per country, put forward by my fellow Member Mr Martinez last year, is heading in the right direction."
"As a result there is the question of funding."
"Following a rigorous financial assessment by the Commission, a special fund would be reserved to cover the travel costs of ACP parliamentary representatives only and for the organisation of sessions."
"From a more general point of view, the JPA is the only assembly that has no budget."
"It should be given new powers to enable it to exercise financial and political control over the funding of cooperation."
"Finally, my last point: the European Parliament should devote special attention to the work of the ACP countries in a comprehensive debate, at least once a year, here in the European Parliament, on the different aspects of cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Carlotti for her excellent report."
"Mrs Carlotti, your report represents a kind of political road map indicating the route to a genuine parliamentary and democratic assembly."
"It contains many helpful proposals for modifications."
"So it is a good thing that it is to be adopted before the plenary session in Cape Town and can be taken on board in the discussions there."
"Mrs Carlotti has already gone into many of the recommendations contained in the report just now."
"As shadow rapporteur, I would like to comment briefly on a few points."
"The Cotonou Agreement led to a fundamental reformulation of the goals of cooperation between the EU and the ACP States."
"Some of the key substantive and political improvements to that agreement are the result of proposals made by the European Parliament."
"Mr Corrie has done excellent work in this area in recent years as co-President."
"The result is an ambitious agreement that opens up new horizons for cooperation."
"But it now needs to have life breathed into it."
"The working methods and procedures of the JPA need to be streamlined and to correspond to a genuine parliamentary, joint, democratic assembly."
"This process was initiated last year and needs to be continued."
"These new powers should make it possible for the Assembly to exercise tighter financial control over the expenditure of EU development aid."
"Stricter monitoring and budgetary control combined with regular contacts between the Members of the Assembly and Members of Parliament from the recipient countries could help to ensure proper use of EU funds in line with the actual needs of the ACP countries."
"The report calls for enhanced cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organisations."
"In view of the political dimension of the Cotonou Agreement, it seems desirable to establish a dialogue between the public and politicians in the ACP and EU States."
"The obstacles in the way of making the JPA a genuine joint parliamentary assembly need to be eliminated as soon as possible."
"It is very regrettable that ratification of the agreement in the EU Member States is moving forward at such a sluggish pace."
"The risk that this will send the wrong signal to the newly industrialised countries with which the EU has strong historical, political and cultural links should not be underestimated."
"Mr President, Mrs Carlotti's excellent report is both an optimistic declaration of confidence in the potential of the Cotonou Agreement and a call on the responsibility of each and every one of us to make sure that this potential does not end up as yet one more lost opportunity, but rather that the most ambitious plans of the agreement come to fruition."
"The report underlines that Cotonou is a major step forward in the process set out some decades ago for cooperation between the European Union and a growing number of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, with the aim of aiding their development."
"It reminds us that we are facing a process that has matured and that has also adapted to the current situation."
"Europeans have not granted this new agreement to our partners, but have fully and rigorously negotiated it with them."
"This is, therefore, an association agreement between partners that are equals in their mutual respect, recognition and rights."
"It is an agreement which, in addition to its economic and commercial component, introduces an innovative political dimension that should allow the ACP-EU Community, united in its proclaimed democratic values with a great capacity for influence in its pursuit of a just, balanced, free, lawful, peaceful world where prosperity is reasonably divided and shared, to burst onto the world stage."
"However, all the confidence expressed in the report is naturally conditional upon our responsibility to take advantage of the provisions of the agreement."
"Hence the appeals of the rapporteur, first of all, to those Member States who do not consider the ratification of the Cotonou agreement a priority."
"She also calls on the European Parliament to give the implementation of the Cotonou agreement the attention it deserves."
"She calls upon those MEPs who act as Parliament's representatives in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly to act responsibly."
"She also calls upon us to make sure this Assembly is truly parliamentary and well balanced, and to commit ourselves to acting in a way that shows solidarity, and is fully democratic within this Assembly."
"The report also highlights our ACP partners' responsibilities to achieve what is set out in the agreement so that the Joint Assembly can be set up once and for all."
"They will then need to adjust themselves to democratic standards, the respect for human rights and the Rule of Law, as guarantees for their own progress and to effectively contribute to a world of stability and peace which is the objective of the Cotonou agreement."
"Mr President, I too should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Carlotti on her report."
"This is a fine piece of work, and it is also excellent that the work has been completed before the next meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly takes place, which is as early as next week of course."
"It is an important report, and Mrs Carlotti has also put forward a number of theoretical observations."
"I shall examine a couple of them more closely but, before I do so, I should just like to emphasise that it does not of course help a great deal to stand here and talk about the Cotonou Agreement if we cannot get it ratified, and we must once again call upon the Member States to make such ratification possible."
"I believe that, in the course of the last few months, only one additional country has come on board."
"And even if there are many countries that have planned to ratify the agreement, we have still to see the final signatures."
"The situation is a little better where the ACP countries are concerned, but the overall number of signatories is, of course, still by no means large enough."
"The second thing that can be said is that such an agreement is not really, of course, worth very much if we do not arrange for proper aid."
"Here, too, there are, no doubt, difficulties, and I hope that the Commissioner - or whoever he now has to help him - will succeed in getting a process under way before tomorrow's formal meeting of foreign ministers."
"The target I should like to have seen, namely one of 0.7%, will certainly not be adopted, but I have to acknowledge that this target is impossible to achieve at the present time."
"Simply getting a binding process under way will, however, be of absolutely crucial importance."
"I should like now to address two points in Mrs Carlotti's report."
"The first is the issue of our own working methods."
"On that issue, I definitely do not think that we have made enough progress."
"I think we have too many resolutions and too little debate."
"The second point is the composition of the ACP-EU delegation, which is not of course particularly appropriate."
"The fact that the delegation includes only one person from the ACP countries introduces a distortion, democratically speaking, and I therefore also think that we should look again at the composition."
"Should we, for example, have twice as many delegates from both sides and then only meet once a year in order to obtain greater representation? Or can we come up with some other solution?"
"Mr President, I should like to warmly welcome this report by Mrs Carlotti and congratulate her on her very thorough and far-reaching work."
"I am struck, in particular, by how strongly the theme of genuine partnership shines through; how the EU/ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique relationship in modern political life and - imperfect as it is - it can stand as a model for new and innovative relations between North and South, which are perhaps today needed more urgently than ever before to build a more peaceful and sustainable world."
"That does not mean that there is not room to improve the workings of that relationship."
"I commend Mrs Carlotti for the proposal she makes in that regard."
"I would like to expand on a couple of them."
"First, if a partnership is a genuine one, then it must also be a consistent and coherent one; one that manifests itself not only in the EU's development policy but also in the EU's trade and economic policy; not only a partnership within the confines of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, but a partnership that extends into other international institutions like the WTO, the World Bank and the UN."
"At the WTO in particular, there is enormous scope for the EU and ACP working more closely together."
"On trade there are some huge political challenges ahead, not least the negotiation of the regional economic partnership agreements."
"These have the potential to have damaging effects on some of the poorest ACP countries who are simply not ready to open their markets to the EU and who do not have the negotiating capacity to engage not only in this process and the WTO process but also in the process of their own regional cooperation agreements."
"It is therefore essential that the JPA plays an active role in shaping and monitoring this process."
"Greater involvement of civil society will also be key."
"I appreciate the proposals in the report which would enable the views of NGOs to be heard far more systematically in the JPA's proceedings."
"Finally, a partnership must be a partnership of equals."
"We urgently need to find the means and the resources to fund it, to address the basic imbalance between the representation of the EU side, reflecting Parliament's political make-up and spectrum of political views, and a system of representation of the ACP states based on one country, one vote, which prevents different political views being expressed."
"The JPA is a unique instrument of cooperation and solidarity, North and South."
"We need to value it, improve it, and build on it as a model for North-South cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Carlotti's report, a very important document on ACP-EU cooperation, has taken on a new dimension because it also presents the new possibilities open to us following the Cotonou Agreement."
"ACP-EU cooperation has gained a new democratic aspect, and that means that we also need to provide a new democratic dimension in shaping this cooperation."
"That is why the emphasis on the parliamentary nature of the Assembly presented in this report is so important. Flesh needs to be put on the bones of this idea."
"And that is also why it was so important for this report to be approved by this House before the session in Cape Town, so as to give us moral support for the reform of this cooperation process."
"We need a following wind if we are to strengthen the parliamentary dimension and to achieve what we have pledged to do."
"We have been told that the work on the new Rules of Procedure has not been totally without conflict - that is why it will be very important for us to have the support this report so that the negotiations in Cape Town can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion."
"I am sure that we will be able to agree on a structure for the standing committees, which will accordingly change the nature of cooperation in this parliamentary assembly."
"The standing parliamentary committees make it possible to work continuously on problem areas, whereas up to now it has only been possible for us to work in ad hoc working groups."
"I hope that this form of cooperation will facilitate far more intensive work on various themes and closer cooperation with our colleagues on the ACP side."
"The regional meetings will also lend new weight to our work."
"They will also give a voice to other people involved in ACP cooperation who have not so far had an opportunity to have their views heard."
"Mr President, the dominant theme of 2001 for the ACP countries was the entry into force of the Cotonou agreement."
"Its ratification by the European Parliament in January will encourage the Member States to follow that example, thus enabling the financial part to be implemented."
"The Joint Parliamentary Assembly has adapted its work according to the new role that it has been given, in particular to promote democratic processes."
"As a forum for the expression of the will of the people and of democratic values, it has a central role to play."
"But its powers are limited."
"It remains just a platform for political expression, without any decision-making or executive powers."
"It should therefore be given new powers, both political as well as financial and operational, and the logistical resources to go with them."
"A working group responsible for evaluating the involvement of civil society in the partnership should therefore be created."
"In the same way, parliamentarians should be involved in the forthcoming negotiations on the future ACP-EU trade regime."
"We will therefore vote with conviction in favour of Mrs Carlotti's report, which makes excellent proposals on the other points, as she set out a while ago, while pointing out that the way that the ACP countries will become democratic is by making the associated institutions and development cooperation more democratic in general."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Carlotti on her report, which is a reflection of her unflagging dedication to relations between the EU and ACP countries."
"Our current partnerships with 77 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific should set an example for relations between the European Union and the United States, and also EU candidate countries, which we have been very enthusiastically debating in the recent past."
"If EU Member States do not show much interest in these partnerships, which is borne out by the aforementioned fact that only four Member States have ratified the Cotonou Agreement, Parliament should do so, particularly because relations with these countries are based, according to the new agreement, on political dialogue, of which the Parliamentary Assembly is a fundamental pillar."
"On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to ask the Member States, particularly my own, Spain, which holds the Presidency of the Council, to speed up formalities so that the agreement can be ratified."
"The Joint Assembly, like this Parliament, is deeply involved in a process where its Rules of Procedure are being reformed, having, as its aim, the true democratisation of ACP-EU relations."
"Our efforts are directed, first and foremost, towards improving the functioning of the Assembly, converting it into an assembly which is effectively balanced and parliamentary."
"At the moment it is not balanced because, whilst on the European side the range of ideologies and political sensitivities that make up the European Parliament are represented, the ACP countries have only one vote per country; a vote which obviously represents the authorities' opinions; it is not balanced in terms of equality between the sexes either."
"Nor is it parliamentary, because the representatives from ACP countries are not, on the whole, Members of Parliament."
"The credibility of our cooperation with ACP countries, which is far from negligible, is in doubt if it is not accompanied by reforms and the strengthening of the institution that is the most representative of the association, that is to say, the Joint Assembly."
"Last week, in a seminar, we said that 'without democracy there can be no development' and this is a priority objective of the international community and the European Union."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to make resources available to ACP countries to improve their institutional capacity, especially with regard to representative institutions, and to promote the organisation of civil society and their participation in cooperation programming."
"I think this is a good report whose content should be applied."
"Mr, President, let me first add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Carlotti, for the good work she has put into preparing this report and also thank those who have contributed to the discussion tonight."
"I note that in her report, Mrs Carlotti emphasises the importance of the parliamentary nature of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the role it should play in achieving the objectives set out in the Cotonou Agreement."
"I fully endorse this, and can only encourage the Assembly to reinforce its own legitimacy and democratic nature, for example by ensuring that it is composed purely of parliamentarians."
"I have noted what has been said by a number of people about the need to broaden participation to allow for a more representative reflection of views."
"This may prompt something of a discussion, in fact, since such matters are defined in the Cotonou Agreement, but I sympathise with the attempt to make room for opposition parties to express their views within the work of the parliamentary assembly."
"Another important point concerns a revision of the rules on financing to ensure the full participation of ACP parliamentarians in the Assembly's sessions and other meetings."
"The Commission is, of course, concerned that ACP parliamentarians should play their full role, on an equal footing with their European counterparts, to ensure parity between ACP and European members."
"We are prepared to look into a possible revision of the agreement governing our contribution to the fund for the participation of ACP members."
"I hope that we will soon receive the financial forecasts we need from the ACP Secretariat to allow us to do this."
"Mrs Carlotti suggests that a special fund should be set up to finance the Assembly."
"If I understand correctly, such a fund already exists, and is mentioned in the Declaration on the Joint Institutions annexed to the Cotonou Agreement and is, in fact, specified to be in the region of EUR 4 000 000."
"This fund covers financing of the Joint Council and Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and is managed by the ACP Secretariat."
"The Community's contribution to this fund cannot be increased, but with a little planning there should be no problem as to the amount of money available to cover ACP participation."
"We will have to look at this in a practical way."
"Basically, given the relatively large strategic effort to strengthen civil society and to fund directly civil society NGOs in our ACP partner countries, it would appear unfair to leave the work of parliaments somewhat weakened while strengthening the political work of non-elected bodies in our partner countries."
"Hence my sympathy and understanding with regard to the need to ensure that this can actually operate smoothly."
"Mrs Carlotti also suggests that the Assembly be more actively involved in scrutiny of the management of EDF funds."
"I agree with the spirit of her argument, and everything should be done to ensure that the Assembly fulfils the consultative role given to it by the Cotonou Agreement."
"However, I am sure you will understand that this should not lead to the establishment of new complicated procedures and reporting requirements that will add to the problems we already have in making the whole system function."
"I can promise that we will provide information on the implementation and functioning of the EDF, and of course discussion of this theme in the Joint Assembly is to be welcomed. All the more so since in launching the Cotonou Agreement and the preparatory work for the country strategy papers for the 9th European Development Fund activities we have reached out and included parliaments and public in our ACP partner countries in a way that intentionally raises expectations."
"For that reason, it is even more relevant and natural to engage the parliamentarians closely in specific discussions about the overall functioning of cooperation."
"Finally, Mr President, it is true - several Members have pointed out - that we are lagging behind in the ratification process."
"Four or five Member States have completed ratification."
"They are Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UK - and I think France has also completed its ratification process now."
"Technically speaking, this has not raised any real problems until now, but it will do so if we have not completed the process before the summer recess."
"I would not like to see a situation emerging where we have a slowdown in the real disbursement and real level of planning activity because of a failure of one or more Member States to ratify."
"That would simply be too embarrassing."
"I very much appreciate what has been said tonight and urge Members of the European Parliament to encourage completion of this process in their own countries."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0049/2002) by Mrs Carrilho, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation extending and amending Council Regulation (EC) 1659/98 on decentralised cooperation (COM(2001) 576 - C5-0509/2001 - 2001/0243(COD))."
"First of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, and thank her for the efforts she has made in this field."
"I know that the negotiations with the Commission and the Council have not been easy and that, above all, the time available was very short, which brings me to my first point."
"I have the impression that the Commission and the Council, certainly since the European Parliament was granted codecision powers in Amsterdam in the field of development cooperation, have a tendency to try to rush proposals of this kind through Parliament."
"And due to lack of time, there is, in fact, little opportunity for us to discuss these matters in any great detail."
"And if you ask who will ultimately be responsible for how the money is spent, it is not the Council, nor the Commission, but we, the people's representatives."
"It is thus regrettable that there is so little time available."
"I should now like to turn to the report on decentralised cooperation."
"As you know, to us, Christian Democrats, civil society is not just a hollow phrase. And we are pleased that other groups are also gradually beginning to recognise its importance."
"Needless to say, the involvement of NGOs and social organisations in granting aid to developing countries is of key significance."
"It is an important step on the road to greater independence and a higher level of self-sufficiency for the people in the affected areas."
"What we should bear in mind - and various NGOs with whom I have been in contact concerning the report remind me - is the importance of a well-defined framework for decentralised aid in order to prevent this aid from becoming fragmented."
"This brings me to the amendments I have tabled on behalf of our group."
"In order to provide targeted, decentralised aid, it is important for the Commission to give us the expected notification about civil society promptly."
"Mrs Carrilho made reference to this as well."
"The organisations on the ground, those who are actively involved in the countries themselves, would like to know where they stand."
"And the promise was that the Commission would have this notification ready under the Belgian Presidency."
"The Agreement of Cotonou underlines the role of civil society."
"However, it is important for non-ACP countries too for a preliminary debate to be held about this, so that decentralised cooperation can be placed in a more strategic framework and so that we gain more clarity concerning the future of this Regulation; in other words, on what is set to happen after 2003."
"This is why I wanted the Commission to be explicitly reminded of this promise in the report."
"We are all watching the events in Zimbabwe unfolding with sadness."
"We notice how a country which, to a large extent, relies on aid from the EU, treats all appeals from the same EU for fair and democratic elections with contempt, and even forces us to withdraw our observation mission."
"Is this not the ultimate proof that the traditional model of development cooperation does not work?"
"Personally, I am convinced that development from the bottom up, which directly involves small groups of citizens, has a far more positive effect with an eye to the fair, democratic and self-sufficient society which we hope to build."
"Mr President, the European Parliament was behind the creation of a budget heading for decentralised cooperation in the 1990s."
"The Lomé Convention Section 4a also incorporated this idea, thus departing from the principle of cooperation between States."
"Now, according to the Commission, the concept has gained ground and proved that it is valid and effective."
"The Commission is therefore proposing that its application should be extended by two years."
"We can only approve that proposal, although we have reservations regarding its form."
"As well as the fact that it is transitory, the Regulation remains vague."
"It contains a little of everything: decentralised cooperation, civil society and NGOs."
"Could it be that there is a lack of Commission strategy in this area?"
"In the same way, the Cotonou Agreement dedicates the participation of civil society in the ACP countries to the partnership, at the expense of decentralised cooperation, which seems to have disappeared."
"The communication on civil society in developing countries promised by the Commission several months ago should have clarified these notions and set out a coordinated approach for the European Union in this area, but we are still awaiting it."
"The two areas of 'aid for decentralised cooperation' and 'aid for civil society' go hand in hand."
"In both cases, the goal is to support local dynamics, avoiding the cumbersome nature and sometimes the lack of transparency of implementing national programmes."
"The Commission appears to have realised this, as it plans to merge these two budget headings, but the limited adjustments that are being made, without consulting the European Parliament, are not sufficient."
"The transfers of funds from one budgetary heading to another demonstrate a lack of an overall perspective and show little consideration for the budgetary authority."
"We are, of course, in favour of direct aid to projects on the ground."
"But we are somewhat irritated with last minute action."
"This reform of the budget can only be done as part of a thorough review of the concept of decentralised cooperation and of relations with the NGOs of the North and the South."
"These two extra years should therefore be used for in-depth discussion on the European Union's cooperation with local players in developing countries and their contribution to sustainable development."
"We should look at the definitions: what is decentralised cooperation, cooperation between sub-national entities in the North and South or aid to local and regional authorities in developing countries?"
"What is civil society?"
"This question is becoming increasingly urgent with the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The real question is in fact the more general one of governance and democracy."
"In order for the countries of the South to develop they will have to become democratic, which means that citizens need to become involved in directing the country."
"They can take part in several ways: by voting for local, regional or national governments."
"In this respect, support for elections and increasing institutional capacity at the different levels of decision-making and administration are essential."
"They can also take an economic and social role in companies or associations."
"Direct aid to NGOs and SMEs is therefore equally important."
"These two aspects are not contradictory but do in fact complement each other."
"The Commission must continue the debate and continue to push it forward as it is high time that we provided the local populations with the resources for development."
"Mr President, I wish to start by sincerely thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Carrilho for her work on this proposal and especially for the efforts she has made to conclude the legislative process at the first reading."
"The objective of our proposal was simply to extend the legal basis for the decentralised cooperation budget line for an additional period of two years."
"This will ensure the continuity of the budget line and give time for a thorough discussion with all the partners concerned on the role the budget line should play in the strengthening of local actors in the South."
"In his speech, Mr Rod suggested that we have not been engaging in proper consultation, but the fact is that by doing what we are doing, we are, in fact, ensuring that consultation takes place."
"The outcome of this discussion should then provide the basis for a revision of the strategic guidelines for the decentralised cooperation instrument."
"I understand Parliament's concern that the various instruments to strengthen local actors should be integrated into a coherent strategy on the involvement of civil society in the South in development cooperation."
"I agree that there is a need to have a debate on this."
"A communication on a strategy to support civil society in developing countries is planned for the second half of this year."
"As has been mentioned, we had promised this communication earlier, but we started out on too narrow a basis, which did not offer a global perspective."
"And has been said here, we have systems which vary quite a lot among the ACP countries and the rest of our partner countries."
"We expect the debate on civil society involvement to feed into the discussion on the continued promotion of decentralised cooperation and the future of a specific budget line in this area."
"I would like to make one more comment on this: the support we can give to NGOs and non-governmental actors in the future in ACP countries is something that goes far beyond the power and potential of this budget line."
"For countries outside the ACP, the situation is different and much more dependent on the individual strategy that we agree with each country."
"This does not rule out the possibility of similar action if it is agreed with the partner country."
"Furthermore, there is broad agreement on the benefit of urging European NGOs to work in partnership in the South."
"This was, in fact, the main idea behind this special cofinancing budget line."
"In a sense, this budget line could be deemed a phenomenal success because we have brought it into the ACP philosophy and we are now also urging NGOs in general to engage directly with partners in the South."
"This is the background against which we think it useful to have a broader and more open discussion about the virtues of a specific budget line for this item, but my own decision is that we need a broad, open discussion and should give ourselves enough time to allow everybody to participate in the discussion."
"This is exactly what is being made possible by the report we are discussing at present."
"The proposed amendments are mainly intended to ensure compliance with the latest comitology procedures and coherence with other recently adopted regulations in the area of development cooperation."
"They also clarify the eligibility of some civil society actors."
"The Commission is happy to agree with all these amendments."
"They reflect well the fruitful discussions between the rapporteur, the Council working group and the Commission services."
"I hope that the Council will also agree to all Parliament's amendments and that the regulation can thus be adopted as soon as possible in terms reflecting this first reading."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is oral question (B5-0009/2002) to the Commission, by Mrs Berès and others, on behalf of the Parliamentary Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on parental responsibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the lateness of the hour, I would particularly like to mention the ladies and gentlemen in the interpreters' booths."
"Our thanks are due to them."
"They are always there and help us in Europe to understand each other better, and to get on better with each other."
"We now have before us the question on parental responsibility that we have tabled."
"We as a legislature should not lecture people about how to run their lives, but we do need to help them find the right path through life."
"We need to make that right path possible."
"That is why the European Union has pledged itself to honour fundamental rights, both in the treaties and in the Charter."
"The Member States have now been co-existing very well for over 50 years."
"Peace has reigned between very different societies, but within families there is often conflict when love is shattered."
"Generally, it is the children who suffer."
"In such cases we then read in the newspapers about children being kidnapped by their own parents or being unable to develop properly because of the pressure they are under."
"We should not pretend that these things are not happening, and we have to recognise that what are apparently merely family arguments between a few individuals indicate problems with a European dimension."
"Ultimately, it is the rubbing points in cross-border judicial arrangements that grind down families and children."
"That is what we need to put a stop to. That is why our question to the Commission includes points that we have identified in conversation with the people affected."
"Our question includes proposals for solving the legal problems and facilitating judicial cooperation for the benefit of children."
"I do not want to read out the details again here, Commissioner. You have had a chance to read them and I would be pleased if you could agree with each of them."
"You would be doing a great many people a service if you were to do that and if you were to make it clear to even more of our citizens that Europe is more than a legally defined area of freedom, security and justice."
"Please take this opportunity to make it clear, together with the European Parliament, that Europe is an area in which people can feel secure outside their own borders, even if there has been conflict between partners."
"That is why - and our question relates to these three things - we need clear and comprehensive legislation, properly motivated lawyers who jointly implement legislation with a common understanding for people, and, last but not least, good common fundamental concepts."
"I hope that you can also satisfactorily answer this question for us."
"Mr President, I will, of course, do my best."
"The Tampere European Council identified visiting rights as a priority in the creation of a single judicial area where decisions can circulate freely from one Member State to another."
"This priority responds to the social reality of people increasingly relocating from one Member State to another with families breaking up and reforming."
"As the honourable Member has said, the Commission is now working on a new proposal that brings together the Commission proposal on parental responsibility of September 2001, the French initiative on rights of access of July 2000 and the Brussels II Regulation."
"We expect to be able to present this proposal in April 2002."
"As was the case with the Commission proposal and the French initiative, the aim is to fashion solutions that build on the mutual trust inherent in a common judicial area to best protect the child."
"This means going beyond the balance struck in the Hague Conventions while, at the same time, recognising their value in addressing international situations."
"To this end, in November 2001, the Commission presented a proposal on the signature of the 1996 Hague Convention."
"The Commission fully shares your concern about making progress fast."
"This now appears possible, especially in the light of the recognition during the informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Santiago de Compostela in February 2002 of the need for a Community-specific solution giving the final say in cases of child abduction to the Member State of the child's habitual residence with the Member State to which the child has been abducted being able to take provisional measures only."
"We trust that this work will continue to benefit from the support of the European Parliament."
"Honourable Members are perfectly correct in pointing out the importance of mutual trust between national judges for the execution of decisions issued in another Member State."
"For several years the Commission has, through the Grotius and Grotius-civil programmes, continuously supported projects aimed at bringing together judges from different countries to improve mutual understanding of legal systems between Member States."
"A significant number of these projects have focused on family law."
"Support for such projects will continue to be available through the new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters, to be adopted by the end of March."
"The new programme, which will apply from 2002-2006, will be endowed with higher budgetary means than the previous programmes."
"You may wish to know that, as concerns the implementation of the new programme in 2002, the Commission is considering giving priority to training for legal practitioners on Community instruments in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters, including, for example, the Brussels II Regulation."
"Moreover, the new programme will also allow for direct actions taken by the Commission to ensure the sound application and implementation of Community law."
"Such actions will, needless to say, also cover instruments in the family law area."
"Mention should be made of the European Judicial Network in civil matters, which will be operational towards the end of the year."
"The network will also facilitate mutual understanding of the legal systems of the Member States, as well as providing a means of identifying and solving problems related to judicial cooperation in civil matters."
"Consequently, the Commission considers that the necessary instruments - as concerns judicial cooperation in civil matters, including the family law area - are already in place to reach the objectives the Members refer to."
"Building on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all actions relating to him or her."
"As has been pointed out, the 'best interests of the child' is a fluid concept that is open to different interpretations and ultimately rests on the appreciation by the judge of all the elements of the case at hand."
"A multidisciplinary project that sheds light on the state of play as regards the different conceptions of the 'best interests of the child' would usefully complement our work by promoting mutual understanding of legal systems and thus reinforcing the requisite mutual trust for the free circulation of decisions."
"Such a project would be eligible for financing under the above-mentioned new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you have listed a lot of very worthy projects."
"As rapporteur I hope very much that I will receive the tidied-up proposal which is due in April."
"It has been mentioned in the question as well."
"The problem is that there are quite a number of serious practical problems that we have to deal with."
"For example, Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Berès sit on a particular committee in France dealing with these issues."
"I understand that there are, at this very moment, about 50 outstanding cases."
"The biggest problem - from the case-load I have - seems to be where parents are denied visiting rights by the custodial parent."
"I should like to list, for the record of the House, the active cases I am working on at the moment."
"Mr Eric Comet, whose children are in Finland, was granted custody by the courts in Finland."
"This custody he could never exercise."
"His children no longer wish to see him."
"In Sweden we have two cases of fathers seeking visiting rights to their children: Philippe Paquay and Kevin Willoughby."
"In Germany, believed by most people who work in this area to be the country where most of these difficulties exist, we have Mr Guy Foster and Mr Chris McMullen; and probably one of the best-known cases of all, Lady Catherine Meyer, the wife of the British Ambassador in Washington, who has seen her two sons for precisely 24 hours in the past six years."
"In the Netherlands we have Mr Morales-Gouvenne and in Austria we have Noël Dumont."
"The problem is that particularly in Germany, social workers seem to be able, under German law, to make decisions about access and custody which, in some cases, take no note of decisions made in courts in other countries."
"In very many cases, the judges involved have perhaps only one case of this sort throughout their working life and are therefore unfamiliar with what the Hague Convention and hopefully now this new regulation will entail."
"We still see - and unfortunately this is at the heart of most of these cases - parents using their unfortunate children as weapons in the war between the sexes."
"Commissioner, you mentioned the Hague Convention of 1996 which, thankfully, was recognised last November."
"However, it has not been signed by any Member State, nor by the Community."
"This is causing serious problems because at the heart of that legislation is the recognition of the right of every child to know and have access to both its parents."
"Mr President, I hope that you will be able to tell Commissioner Vitorino to what extent the MEPs here are rallying on this issue, that they want to make it a political challenge, because children are not capable of making as much noise as bombs, but that they too need exequatur procedures to be abolished."
"They need policies to be implemented."
"If the Commission indeed wants to make the mobility of European citizens one of its priorities in order to harmonise and promote the European labour market, it should face facts: we will also need European family law within the European judicial area."
"Experts have been working for years on drawing up these texts and are despairing of ever being able to mobilise policies."
"We need to take this task in both hands, and I think that this oral question can contribute to that."
"What European law should we draw up?"
"There are the mechanisms of the Hague."
"There is certainly a particular place for Community law, for law of the members of the European Union."
"From that point of view, I would like to draw your attention to a few difficulties."
"The first is that through European law we should not call into question the principle of the authority of the judge of the resident country."
"This is an inviolable right if we wish to face up to the reality and resolve conflicts in a harmonious manner."
"There is the possibility of developing networks of trust."
"This is essential, otherwise automatic return, which is what should be standard law in the European Union, will never come."
"You mentioned some programmes for developing those trust measures."
"Use them."
"We need them in order to promote exchange, so that when a French judge rules on a child custody case, on return after abduction, he will not be tempted by the nationalist reflex."
"Neither the French judge, nor the English, Irish, German or Finnish judge."
"There is also the hope that came from the Informal Council meeting in Santiago de Compostela, which was a positive sign."
"But as it is the details that cause the problem, it is essential that the conditions for the return of children be respected."
"Whether it is after an abduction or after exercising rights of access or rights to have a child to stay for a limited period, the return should take place according to the law of the country of residence."
"Finally, I would just like to ask you for clarification on the third part of our question: what do you think of the idea that the Commission could launch a working group in order to have a discussion between Europeans of the tricky notion, which pollutes many of the judgments, that of the interests of the child, which we have included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his attendance at such a late hour."
"We have heard a reference to abduction, but of course abduction takes many forms and can be subtle."
"Mrs Banotti has raised the issue of a constituent of mine, Mr Guy Foster; and allow me to summarise the case because it concerns real human lives."
"Mr Foster has been denied access to his child ever since his German wife returned to Germany with the child following their divorce."
"The agreement was for the mother to have the right of abode over the son and for Mr Foster to have full visiting rights."
"However, once in Germany, the mother neglected the child and spent time in psychiatric care, and the child was subsequently placed in the care of its maternal grandmother."
"Despite Mr Foster's persistent attempts to contact his son, he has been cut off from him ever since, unable to speak with or visit him because the mother and maternal grandparents have withheld information."
"A court made a decision on this case, but he was given information about the court appearance after the date."
"Documents were served in a foreign language."
"The handing over of care to the grandmother was thus allowed to proceed without Mr Foster being able to represent his views."
"I believe he has been denied and is still being denied the fundamental right to see this child and has been denied access to justice."
"This is surely wrong in the eyes of those of us who believe that we should always serve the best long-term interests of the child."
"Mrs Gebhardt referred to two key words: help and enable."
"We are fifteen different Member States with different languages and different cultures, but we must never use language as a means of excluding people from the debate or denying them their rights."
"Therefore, I urge the Commission to take action, to be imaginative at Community level and at Member State level to ensure mutual recognition and judicial cooperation, and to put an end to these tragic human cases, which have consequences beyond our own time."
"Mr President, Mrs Gebhardt began by saying that Europe is an area in which people feel secure."
"Indeed, security was the raison d'être for what has become the European Union today."
"The pioneers sought to make a peaceful Europe and they, of course, succeeded."
"Nowadays, we are at peace and people expect to be safe, but too often the European Union is accused of meddling in things that are not important and too much of what the European Parliament appears to do is irrelevant to ordinary peoples' lives."
"Sometimes we discover a real area that needs legislation and yet we are powerless to act."
"As Mrs Banotti and Mr Cashman have pointed out, this is an area that needs legislation and where, I believe, European action would be positively welcomed."
"The cases of access we have heard about; in which parents are denied access to their children, are desperately distressing."
"They make the misery of separation even worse."
"Being separated by time and space, by hundreds of kilometres and expensive flights, is painful and distressing for parents and children."
"President, Commissioner, over the years Parliament, the Council and the Commission have all worked to secure a common market for goods and capital, fair trade and free trade for those with money."
"Now we need to make certain that we have, a fair market and a free trade for people so that families and children can work and move around with rules that are fair, rules that work and European institutions that enforce them."
"Mr Cashman said that the European Union is fifteen countries."
"He is right, but with the addition of ten or twelve more countries in the pipeline, I shudder to think of the possibilities in this area if we do not act and do not succeed in getting legislation that works - legislation that will make the European Union safe and secure for all its citizens, children and parents alike."
"Mr President, I only need to make a few comments."
"Mrs Banotti asked if the proposal the Commission has announced for April will be available."
"It will be."
"Any other course would definitely not be in the interests of the Commission, so we look forward to presenting it and discussing it."
"This is how we shall proceed."
"Mrs Berès asked whether I had forgotten the third part of the question concerning the child's interests."
"I repeat the final phrases of my first contribution, namely: A multidisciplinary project that sheds light on the state of play of different conceptions of the best interests of the child would usefully complement our work by promoting mutual understanding of legal systems and thus reinforcing the requisite mutual trust for the free circulation of decisions."
"Such a project would be eligible for financing under the new framework programme for judicial cooperation in civil matters."
"We see this as a way of moving the issue forward."
"I have noted with great care and interest the different contributions in this discussion and we have moved it another step forward this evening."
"Thank you, Commissioner, on behalf of all the Members present, for your answer."
"(The sitting was closed at 12. 05 a.m.)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for adopting this report by unanimity."
"In addition, I should like to recall Parliament's considerable institutional support to the nuts and locust beans sector. This is evidenced in a number of resolutions testifying to the significance of this sector within the Union."
"At the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July 2001, Commissioner Fischler announced that a detailed study of the Community nuts sector would be undertaken. The Commissioner also stated that if appropriate, specific proposals to benefit the sector would be made, to follow on from the improvement plans expiring in 2001."
"In the light of this situation, the Commission has proposed an additional one-year extension of the improvement plans. I have certainly welcomed this."
"Nonetheless, I would like to make it clear that I trust it will be the last transitional instrument, to be followed by a permanent proposal. Such a proposal must ensure the survival of the sector and put an end to the difficulties and uncertainty European Union producers are experiencing."
"The main aim of our report was to settle the issue of permanent support measures once and for all."
"The nuts sector is very important to the Union from a social, economic and environmental point of view. Over a million hectares are devoted to these crops."
"They extend across the Mediterranean countries, and the land is mostly located in very disadvantaged areas where agriculture is difficult. Much of the soil is hillside or arid."
"These products therefore have to overcome many difficulties to remain on the market and be economically viable without direct support from public institutions."
"The difficulties are exacerbated by strong outside competition. For instance, there are hazelnuts from Turkey and almonds from the United States."
"In both cases the conditions of production bear no comparison to those in Europe. In addition, the outside products benefit from tariff concessions under international agreements."
"The nuts sector is an example of multifunctional production and is essential to the socio-economic survival of many families in rural areas of the Union. This is because of its role in regional planning, since no alternative crops exist, and also because of its part in environmental conservation."
"It helps prevent erosion and is important in combating fires. It also preserves indigenous genetic material, which is of great organolectic value."
"In the light of this difficult situation and lack of competitiveness in 1989, the Commission adopted a package of specific measures. These were aimed mainly at raising the quality and competitiveness of the products."
"The ten-year improvement plans were due to expire in 2000 but were extended until 15 July 2001."
"The results of the plans proved positive. There were notable improvements in production and marketing."
"Unfortunately the same was not true of competitiveness, due to the difficult structural conditions at the outset."
"The Commission's present proposal would allow these last plans to be extended to 15 June 2002 with the Community contribution decreasing from 82 to 75%."
"Taking the specific case of hazelnuts, the payment per kilo is retained for the 2001-2002 harvest. Payments will only be made, however, to members of producer organisations not eligible for the extension."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has attempted to introduce considerable improvements to the executive committee's proposal through its amendment."
"Regarding the restrictions on support for hazelnut production, we believe that it is not acceptable to withhold it from those producer organisations wishing to benefit from the extension of improvement schemes."
"This would amount to discrimination between producers' organisations, giving some of them an unfair advantage."
"As for the level of national cofinancing, the increase on the current commitment proposed for the extended plans cannot be justified."
"In this connection, the percentage relating to nuts is minimal and does not justify the proposal."
"As for the areas covered by the plans and entitled to aid, the percentage should be retained on the basis of the area certified in the last year's plans and not the area for which aid has been requested."
"The Committee on Agriculture is of the opinion that in order to improve awareness and production monitoring, provision must be made to set up a geographical information system. The committee is also on record as advocating the need to establish a permanent framework for aid to the sector."
"Further, the committee has argued for ongoing support in the form of aid per hectare to guarantee maintenance of the producers' income in a situation of sustainable exploitation."
"Hence the advisability of linking this latest extension to permanent aid, the ultimate aim being to consolidate a system of ongoing aid channelled through the producer organisations."
"I must not conclude without mentioning the Committee on Agriculture's specific request that chestnuts be included in the nuts sector."
"The protection of this tree and fruit associated with forested areas and ancient culinary traditions is crucial to preserving a very important ecosystem that is obviously being encroached upon. It also has a bearing on the related environmental issues."
"Finally, I should like to point out that two identical amendments have been put to plenary. They both aim at increasing support to hazelnuts by means of an additional marketing season."
"I am unable to support these amendments although I appreciate and share concerns over the difficulties currently experienced in marketing hazelnuts."
"The request for a permanent regime implies that support to hazelnuts would be covered by that regime."
"It is therefore not appropriate to extend still further a temporary arrangement with a set expiry date that has merely generated uncertainty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I trust we shall be able to continue enjoying the best desserts, the best nougat, and all those products manufactured with the best and most delicious hazelnuts and almonds in the world."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I should first like to warmly congratulate Mr Carlos Bautista Ojeda, the rapporteur, on his excellent work."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should also be thanked for its almost unanimous support for this sector."
"The rapporteur has already described the importance of the fruit and vegetable sector for the countries of southern Europe, so there is no need for me to do so."
"Almost two years ago, the Council requested the Commission to undertake a specific assessment of the situation of the nuts sector in the framework of the report on the operation of the COM in fruit and vegetables."
"This problem has yet to be finally resolved. We are still trying to provide a remedy in extending the improvement plans."
"What is actually required is a final and immediately applicable definition, along with the implementation of support mechanisms to replace the present improvement programmes as they expire."
"A reduction in Community cofinancing is involved, however. In addition, aid to hazelnuts is proposed, but only for farmers not eligible for the extension."
"Nonetheless, it does not allay all of the producers' concerns. As I stated, the latter are calling for a permanent solution, so they can continue to resist the strong competition by almonds from the United States and hazelnuts from Turkey."
"The report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development deals with the gaps in the Commission's plan."
"The amendments adopted call for specific aid to hazelnuts for all organisations requesting it, not just for those participating in improvement plans, as the Commission suggests."
"The amendments also call for the retention of current cofinancing levels for these improvement plans, whereas the Commission wishes to increase the Member States' cofinancing from 18 to 25%."
"The deletion of a reference to gradual transferral of financial responsibility to the producers in recital 2 is also requested. Finally, there is the call to introduce a permanent regime based on the award of aid per hectare, subject to the implementation of good agricultural and environmentally friendly practice."
"Commissioner, these are the main requests from the Committee on Agriculture."
"The Committee also calls for this aid to be extended to chestnuts, a product not currently covered by the improvement plans."
"The key factor is that the European Parliament is in favour of a permanent solution for this sector in the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables. Parliament calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal for the implementation of a definitive support regime for the sector before 1 June 2002."
"Efforts to find a solution to the situation of the nuts sector in the European Union within the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables must therefore be intensified."
"Madam President, I must first congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"You will be aware, Commissioner, that on numerous occasions the European Parliament has expressed its institutional support for the nuts sector in the European Union."
"It has done so conscious of the fact that they are essentially a multifunctional crop which contributes to environmental conservation and helps combat erosion."
"It also has a part to play in regional planning, as it is one of the few activities keeping people on the land in places where other forms of agriculture are not viable. As most of the producer regions in the European Union are disadvantaged, it has economic and social significance too."
"We are not in a position to oppose the Commission's proposal to extend these plans for improving aid to the sector."
"We certainly support the rapporteur's view that it is not acceptable for the Commission to propose excluding producer organisations wishing to benefit from the improvement plans from eligibility for the specific hazelnut aid."
"We cannot either go along with the Commission's intention of reducing Community cofinancing from 82 to 75% in these extended plans."
"Commissioner, we are bound to say that we would like our request for permanent support to this sector to go on record. Such a solution would provide stability and make it possible to produce the crop in Europe."
"This can only happen if we succeed in setting up permanent support targeted at producer organisations and within a stable framework, namely the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables."
"The Commission should pursue this objective and approach during the extra year for which the plans will be extended."
"Madam President, I must first join with the previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur on his report, which has been unanimously endorsed. In particular, I am grateful to him for showing such sensitivity to the needs of the sector."
"The latter is obviously very important in Catalonia. I would also like to thank Mr Bautista Ojeda for being so receptive to the suggestions made by the Catalan regional government."
"I think it is worth recalling that clearly we are not dealing with one of the major agricultural or livestock sectors central to the common agricultural policy (CAP). Nonetheless, this sector extends over a million hectares and makes a specific and significant contribution in the immediate vicinity."
"In my view therefore, the request for maintaining support during 2001 and 2002 must lead, as previous speakers stated, to a permanent support regime per hectare."
"Consequently we are against Amendment No 10 tabled by Mr Fiori, because requesting support for 2002 and 2003 at this stage would essentially invalidate the report's main objective."
"We therefore believe that as outlined previously and in terms of hectare as in Mrs Ayuso's amendment adopted in committee, namely certified areas, this report presents an approach the Commission should certainly consider."
"Madam President, I should first like to thank Mr Bautista Ojeda for his excellent report."
"I am sure he knows he can rely on total support from my group."
"It would be hard to name an issue preceded by more Parliamentary initiatives during the last twelve years."
"The House has witnessed the same debate time and again during this period."
"The principles are unchanged, but the situation on the ground has worsened."
"Turkish economic policy recently caused an artificial fall in the price of hazelnuts and other agricultural products in response to internal pressures."
"This is not a new problem, but it escalated because the Commission failed to tackle it in its proposals."
"I do not believe the Commission's suggestion, namely transferring the nuts problem to rural development, is realistic. This might have been said in the Committee on Agriculture."
"A problem related to the market should be dealt with using the appropriate tools. It is unwise to keep resorting to the second pillar to solve all our difficulties."
"For the last twelve years, the House has been advocating an honourable solution for this sector of production which is experiencing very specific problems."
"The Commission's response has been simply to grant extensions to a regime that does not deal with the problems the sector needs to overcome. The permanent solution put forward by the House on a number of occasions has been ignored."
"One might well wonder whether sometimes the nub of the problem is not in fact the Commission's lack of resolve when it comes to proposing effective measures to deal with the difficulties facing the nuts sector, rather than the difficulties themselves."
"For my part, Commissioner, I hope that is not so on this occasion."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by thanking you for your report, Mr Bautista Ojeda, and for all the time and trouble which you have taken in working out the 16 proposed amendments."
"Before I comment on these proposed amendments, I should like to say a few words about the proposal itself."
"As you probably know, improvement plans have been implemented for some 600 000 hectares sown with nuts since 1989."
"The European Union spent a total of EUR 900 million on these plans up to 2001."
"The purpose of the improvement plans was to enhance the economic basis for nut growing by pooling supplies, improving quality and building up a production and marketing infrastructure."
"These plans were limited to ten years, after which financial responsibility would revert solely to producers."
"However, when the first plans ran out, a one-off extension was granted in Council Regulation No 558/2001."
"The eleventh year of these plans ran out last year, as did the 10-year deadline for a further series of plans and the plans for the remaining 35% of land sown with nuts will run out by 2006/2007."
"On 23 July last year, the Council asked the Commission to launch an in-depth study into all aspects of this sector and called on it to submit the conclusions of the study and any proposals as quickly as possible."
"The study is well under way and will be presented in May of this year."
"The Commission was conscious of the fact that something needed to be done in the meantime and that this interim period needed to be bridged, which is why it suggested that the Council and Parliament approve the proposal for a regulation extending the improvement plans by a further year."
"This draft also makes provision for special aid for hazelnuts."
"Now to the 16 proposed amendments."
"The first group of amendments deals with general issues."
"Amendment No 1 refers to Regulation No 1035/1972, the proposed amendment to the Commission report to the Council on the common organisation of the market."
"Of course we can no longer change the wording of a regulation which has been abolished, but Amendment No 2 is acceptable in principle."
"I also agree with Amendment No 3 highlighting the ecological importance of the nut sector."
"The second group of proposed amendments contains proposals for fundamental changes to the existing proposal."
"All these proposals impact on the budget, some considerably, which is why the Commission cannot agree to them."
"This applies to Amendments Nos 4 to 6, 10 to 12 and 15 and 16."
"The third group relates to the future of the sector."
"Amendments Nos 9 and 13 highlight the need for a permanent support regime for nuts, while Amendment No 8 calls for the benefits achieved with the improvement plans to be preserved, mainly by channelling supplies through producer organisations."
"Amendment Nos 7 and 14 call for knowledge on production and control to be improved using the Geographical Information System."
"All these proposed amendments have repercussions which go beyond the framework of the proposal submitted, which merely recommends a year's extension, which is why I cannot accept these amendments within the context of this proposal."
"However, I can assure you that we have taken good note of your proposals and shall take proper account of them."
"As I have already explained on previous occasions, we are all agreed that there is a chronic lack of competition in this sector and that it does not therefore make economic sense to hang on to the belief that EU producers can hold out against free competition with Turkish hazelnuts or American almonds in the long term."
"In my opinion, therefore, we need an answer to the following questions. First, does the European Union need to produce its own nuts?"
"Secondly, do nuts fulfil a multifunctional role?"
"Thirdly, should the EU continue to invest in maintaining nut production?"
"And fourthly, if so, in what form?"
"I feel that support measures should also help to promote the sustainability of rural areas and protect the environment and should not just be geared to making the sector economically competitive."
"Finally, I should like to thank you once again for your contributions."
"Thank you, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0065/2002) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation fixing the premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco by variety group and Member State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 harvests and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 (COM(2001) 684 - C5-0678/2001 - 2001/0276(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this proposal, the Commission is seeking to amend the basic regulation on the common organisation of the market in tobacco (Regulation (EEC) 2075/92), fixing the premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco by variety group and Member State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 harvests."
"On this basis, one might assume that the Commission proposal is of a fundamentally technical nature and is confined to adapting the main instruments of support for tobacco production, in accordance with changes in supply and demand in the market."
"Furthermore, this adjustment is made necessary by the current arrangements, since producers must be notified about quotas before 15 April and the relevant contracts be drawn up before 30 May."
"Nevertheless, with the excuse that Regulation (EEC) 2075/92 needs technical updating, the proposal goes much farther."
"In fact, it indirectly introduces a reform of a much broader political scope and goes so far as to set the phasing out of tobacco subsidies as the ultimate objective (see recital 5)."
"In doing this, the Commission is in actual fact determining the scope of the decisions which have been proposed and which, in due course and subject to the relevant proposals, will have to be taken by the Community institutions."
"There are two reasons for this: first of all, the Commission launched an evaluation study of the COM in raw tobacco, which should enable an assessment to be made of the effects of current Community policy on the sector, and its conclusions will only be available at the end of 2002; secondly, it was the Commission itself that undertook to submit proposals on the new tobacco policy at the beginning of next year, but only on the basis of the studies that are now being carried out."
"Of course, this proposal will have to be consistent with society's growing demands for sustainable development and high-quality products and, in the same context, must provide an adequate response to the official statements issued hitherto concerning the sector's future."
"Your rapporteur is of the view that the European Parliament cannot allow the Commission to pre-empt and make assumptions about the decisions that both the European Parliament and the Council will be taking in the coming months, on the basis of the evaluation studies and the latest data recorded in this sector, which I have already mentioned."
"In this context, the rapporteur's amendments are confined to improving the Commission's proposals in an essentially technical way and explicitly rule out the possibility of entering into a far-reaching political debate on the future support arrangements for tobacco, which can only be tackled rigorously during 2003, taking into account the studies and reports mentioned above."
"It must be considered, however, that this position of the rapporteur does not simply mean accepting the status quo, which, furthermore, he feels is unsustainable."
"To this end, the rapporteur tabled Amendment No 23, in order to regain the original spirit of commitment towards the Community Tobacco Fund."
"This amendment has two implications: firstly, not only accepting financing by the Fund of actions to prevent nicotine addiction and of experimental action to encourage tobacco producers to switch to other crops and economic activities, but also maintaining the financing of agronomic research into varieties of tobacco that are less damaging to the environment and to health; and, secondly, increasing the levy on producers' premiums from 2% to 3%, thereby rejecting both the present figure of 2%, and the Commission's proposal of 5%."
"And, in order to ensure consistency with this vision of commitment, the rapporteur proposes that we also reject Amendments Nos 9 and 13."
"The around 130 thousand tobacco producers in the European Union, most of whom live in the least-favoured regions of southern Europe, deserve to have the competent Community institutions concern themselves, in a responsible way, with their future."
"Hence, also, the importance of having sufficient evaluation and impact studies of the current situation so that we can make responsible and realistic proposals for the future, but only once we know exactly what the effects of the current policy are."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tobacco is the mainstay of the economy of large rural areas of southern Europe."
"Production of this crop is hardly mechanised, so it has considerable social significance and an impact on employment."
"Tobacco is grown on small family plots in regions classed amongst the poorest in Europe."
"I shall give you an example affecting my country directly."
"Tobacco represents 25% of final agricultural production in the region of Extremadura."
"The argument linking the end of aid to tobacco and consequently the end of its production with health considerations is quite mistaken, unfair and regrettably also hypocritical."
"Nobody would dream of suggesting stopping the cultivation of plants used to produce alcohol through distillation because of the health problems caused by alcohol. Nobody has suggested closing down the factories manufacturing cigars and cigarettes either, or banning the sale of these products."
"It is certainly the case that the withdrawal of aid would put an end to tobacco production in Europe. This would not, however, improve the health of European consumers because the gap left by Community production would be filled by imports from third countries."
"Anyone wishing to continue smoking could do so. What is at issue is simply commercial interest."
"The only way of tackling the health issue is to pursue the approach launched some time ago by the European Union. This involves developing methods of cultivation and introducing less harmful varieties whilst also boosting information campaigns designed to reduce consumption."
"The opinion of the Committee on Budgets is that agronomic research financed by the Tobacco Fund should be intensified."
"The European Commission, on the other hand, wishes to stop research and promote conversion, though no viable alternative is suggested."
"The Commission is exceeding its competence on this issue."
"Its role should be to extend the aid regime, in a spirit of continuity."
"We therefore request the deletion of recital 5, and we believe the legal service of the Council of Ministers agrees with us on this."
"Madam President, Commissioner, whenever we debate the question of tobacco, I always wonder, even if we are all anti-smoking, why do we need to be anti-tobacco?"
"These are two separate issues and I think that the Commission should realise that, as should many of the honourable Members."
"We are against smoking and we must do all we can to stop it from spreading and reduce it."
"I have no objection to that."
"But if we abolish tobacco growing, all we shall do is condemn a number of European citizens to financial ruin and give a fillip to tobacco farmers in third countries."
"All we shall do is reduce our exports and increase our imports."
"All we shall do is increase the dole queues in the European Union."
"Is that what we are trying to do?"
"Is that our objective? In other words, do all those who maintain that, if we grub up tobacco farms in Europe, we shall help reduce smoking, mean to tell us that we need to grub up vineyards in order to fight alcoholism?"
"Do they mean to tell us we should close our car factories in order to reduce the number of fatal road traffic accidents?"
"It is time we stopped being two-faced, faced the facts and dealt with things in the proper manner."
"It is time we sat down together, with an open mind and our eyes wide open, called a spade a spade and worked out a strategy to drastically reduce smoking and its harmful effects and a strategy to develop the economy of the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by congratulating and thanking rapporteur, Mr Cunha, both for the careful and serious approach which he has taken to the subject of tobacco in his report and for the sensitive and understanding manner in which he dealt with the interventions of the members of the Committee on Agriculture."
"For the rest, however, as he himself has said, the subject of tobacco as dealt with in this specific proposal for a Council regulation is a purely technical matter concerning the 2002, 2003 and 2004 crops."
"The Commission was wrong to try and introduce political criteria into the debate; apart from the fact that they have nothing to do with the aspects of the issue at debate here, they are also completely groundless, premature and even, I would say, provocative as regards the more general working of and prospects for the common agricultural policy."
"We all know that tobacco is a prime example of a very labour-intensive crop grown on family-run farms and poor, barren soil, meaning that, apart from anything else, it allows man to live and work in areas which, if deserted physically and ecologically, would have incalculable social and environmental repercussions."
"The Commission knows all this and it was the Commission which used to take every opportunity to reiterate it."
"Lately, however, motivated perhaps by the expediency of supporting its misguided intervention in Gothenburg, it has omitted to repeat its earlier references and is in danger of putting the debate on this issue on the wrong footing."
"The right footing is exactly as suggested by Mr Cunha in his report with the support of the Committee on Agriculture, which plenary is called on to endorse and which the Commission is called on to respect in any future action."
"Madam President, we too welcome the Cunha report, which we support."
"The statistics show that approximately 130 000 farmers and around 400 000 seasonal workers are involved in tobacco growing, in addition to all those involved in the production chain."
"This is therefore a serious matter which we feel requires greater analysis on the part of the Commission, not least in the light of Communication No 264 of 15 May 2001, which contains a clear statement to the effect that, should the Commission decide on a political proposal for action, all the repercussions and implications of this strategy for tobacco growing and the reduction of aid to growers would, indeed, be assessed."
"For this reason and also for the reasons expounded by other Members regarding the limited actual effect the measure would have on cigarette consumption, as regards the issue of smoking, it is therefore important, moreover, to preserve the research fund, particularly for agronomic research on broad-leaf tobacco, for that represents our only hope if we are to reduce the harmful effects of smoking and contribute to the right of all consumers to health too."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Cunha quite rightly said, this report is an extremely political document, despite the fact that it appears to be technical."
"It raises the key question as to whether we should continue to subsidise the cultivation of a plant, the main use of which is in the manufacture of a product recognised as being extremely harmful to human health."
"Tobacco, I am sorry to say, is a hard drug, and we must have the courage to say this."
"The problem dates back a long way and the Commission is using this proposal for updating the regulation to clearly say that we must move away from the system of tobacco subsidies."
"However, as we must give farmers the time to change activity, the debate initially focuses on the time they are given to do this. And Mr Cunha's proposal was, from that point of view, very reasonable."
"It is natural to allow them time - but not too much time - for the planned assessment."
"The Greens believe that the current situation must be tackled now, whether or not we are continually told that these are poor farmers."
"As far as I know, Alsace and Andalucia are, in terms of farming, fairly prosperous regions."
"The question is to determine whether, at this point, we must subsidise, in other countries, growing dangerous products such as cannabis, for example."
"And we must, at this point, have the courage to say so."
"There are two points to the second question which is that of the Community Tobacco Fund. The first point is the level of the deduction to be introduced as of 2004; the second is the tasks given to researchers who are funded in this way."
"We believe that an increase from 3% to 5% for this Fund is a positive step; in this area, the Commission's proposal has very wisely used the carrot and stick approach in order to refocus these tasks over the long term and to replace agronomic research into making tobacco slightly less harmful with measures to support specific initiatives that encourage tobacco growers to switch from tobacco into other crops."
"We must not forget, however, that products other than the cigarette can be produced from tobacco."
"It can be an aid to medical research, for example."
"It is also an excellent natural insecticide."
"But these are specialist niches, and there is a great deal too much cultivated tobacco for these uses."
"The Greens will not, therefore, vote in favour of the amendments which have undermined Mr Cunha's patient work. Instead, we will support the Commission in this area."
"Madam President, I must first thank Mr Cunha for his excellent report."
"It is a considerable achievement, if we take into account that he has had to cope with a scenario created by the Commission, which, as stated by a previous speaker, is plainly hypocritical."
"We might agree that tobacco is a danger to health."
"Taking this argument to the extreme, one could suggest banning the import of tobacco."
"I suspect, however, that few Members of this House would be prepared to vote in favour of closing our borders to tobacco from the United States."
"Treasury Ministers are delighted with the income generated by tobacco, whilst Health Ministers rail against it."
"Just now, for the first time, charges of smuggling have been brought against multinational companies bringing tobacco into the European Union and attempting to avoid paying the duty due."
"There are a number of lessons to be drawn from that and from the prohibitionist experiments conducted in Europe and elsewhere."
"In the first place, ceasing cultivation without stopping imports has no impact on the availability of a harmful substance. What it does is make the Community market more attractive to goods from third countries."
"Secondly, prohibition does not stop consumption. Instead it boosts smuggling, to the detriment of health checks and of the Treasury."
"Thirdly, tobacco production generates more employment and stimulates more economic activity than many other agricultural practices such as meat production. Yet the Commission often displays undue leniency towards these other practices."
"In conclusion I also believe that the confusion the Commission may create between the documents submitted to the European Council at Göteborg and the conclusions of the Council is totally unacceptable, and drastically alters the institutional balance."
"In my view therefore, the Commission's assessment of the Göteborg European Council destabilises the principles and operation of the Community institutional relationship."
"I trust the European Parliament will reject it, taking account of the Council's Legal Services' contribution to the work of the COMIT."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is taking the opportunity provided by the reform of premiums and guarantee thresholds for the period 2002-2004, to make a change that spells disaster for producers and for the social and economic balance of entire regions."
"This change involves paving the way to phase out tobacco production without providing an alternative."
"However, tobacco production is valued by disadvantaged areas and by many small- and medium-sized growers."
"The workforce employed underpins the economic activity of rural areas."
"The European Union produces 5% of the world's tobacco and imports 70% of its requirements."
"By ceasing this production, Europe will be dependent on imports and consumption will not be affected in any way."
"Tobacco has serious implications for public health and our approach to this subject must take this into account."
"Our priority must be to educate young people to deter them from smoking."
"Manufacturers also play a part in prevention by financing the Community Fund, which should have been used to inform consumers and also to make progress in research into the harmful effects of products."
"Unfortunately, no calls for tenders have been issued since 1997."
"By maintaining production in Europe, we are giving ourselves the means to control the quality of tobacco production and processing."
"We are also giving ourselves the means to develop less harmful varieties."
"Producers will not agree to increases in levies on the premiums to finance something that will lead to them being put out of business."
"Our group can do nothing other than to reject recital 5 of the Commission's proposal, which spells disaster for small- and medium-sized growers that help to maintain an agricultural activity throughout the Union's territory."
"Commissioner Fischler, like everyone, we obviously share the Commission's concerns regarding the dangers nicotine addiction poses to public health."
"But, given the European Union's tobacco deficit, our action must, of course, be based on demand and not on supply."
"Let us bear in mind two figures: we consume 800 000 tonnes of raw tobacco and produce 250 000 tonnes in the European Union."
"Europe imports 70% of the raw tobacco it needs, and so the European Union is far from being the world's biggest importer."
"It is therefore obvious that any action that seeks to reduce production would only increase our dependence on imports."
"It is, however, the social effects of such measures that give me cause for concern."
"Need we point out that tobacco growing is very labour intensive and involves 130 000 growers and 400 000 seasonal workers, which amounts to more than 500 000 jobs?"
"Need we point out that the first processing stage provides 18 000 permanent and 40 000 seasonal jobs in rural areas?"
"Need we point out that tobacco growing is carried out on small family-run farms of between one and two hectares of tobacco, and, on average, tobacco production makes up 60% of the family's income?"
"Need we point out that most of these farms are situated in disadvantaged regions which many people have left to go to live in towns, which have experienced rural depopulation and problems farming the countryside in rural villages?"
"Need we point out that tobacco growing, which brings in a steady income, greatly assists in maintaining the farming population and therefore trade and public services?"
"That is why we must take an extremely careful approach to changing the set-up of the COM in tobacco."
"When the reform of the COM in tobacco was approved in 1998, Parliament and the Council planned to carry out an assessment of this reform at the end of 2002."
"This assessment alone will provide a basis for an appropriate consideration of the future of tobacco growing in Europe."
"I therefore share the view of the rapporteur that no decision should be taken on the future of the existing tobacco regime until we have the results of the studies that are currently being carried out."
"And I would point out that the Commission must submit a new proposal on the tobacco sector in 2003."
"For these reasons, I am pleased that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has refused the planned quota and premium reductions which would have severely affected farmers' income, would have hampered the restructuring of plantations and would not have encouraged farmers to switch to other crops."
"We also oppose the plan to increase farmers' contribution to the Community Tobacco Fund, given that this Fund - which has an annual budget of EUR 20 million - has been substantially under-utilised."
"Lastly, we also rejected the Commission's plan to refocus where support from this fund is directed."
"To sum up, Madam President, the Commission has put before us a flawed reform, one that, let it be said, also has a tinge of shallow populist rhetoric and hypocrisy, and could have serious social consequences for this sector."
"The Committee on Agriculture supported the wise recommendations of our rapporteur who has drafted suitable and solid proposals which do not confuse tobacco and nicotine addiction, and I hope that the House will follow suit."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have read the Commission's proposal with some concern and I must pay tribute to Mr Cunha and the Committee on Agriculture for producing the very balanced report before us today."
"It is always difficult to talk about tobacco, for we always end up falling into the trap of populism."
"We know that today's report is only one of the stages in the discussion, for the real debate on tobacco will start with the Commission's proposal next year."
"However, there are three fundamental points to note. Firstly, apart from some rare exceptions, tobacco is produced in the poorest and most depressed areas of Europe."
"The populism we talk about is also a characteristic of conversion plans: in those areas - and I am referring to the situation of my own country, Italy, but the same applies to parts of Spain or Greece - it is not possible to convert production."
"And this populism continues to confuse production with consumption."
"As a great French writer said, although it is certainly possible to kick a habit, it is very difficult, for superhuman willpower and, above all, a great deal of time are needed."
"Well then, when it comes to smoking, it may well be that we should invest heavily - and this could be part of the Committee on Agriculture's proposal - in an educational process which starts with schools."
"As regards this sector of agriculture, we must endeavour to realise that entire family networks are dependent on tobacco for a living and that sudden decisions such as those contained in the Commission's proposal would lead to social and economic collapse that we cannot afford."
"Madam President, I too welcome the work done by Mr Cunha in the Committee on Agriculture."
"As an aside, it was stated that Andalusia is a very rich agricultural area."
"I have to say that I would be delighted with an income from agriculture as high as that enjoyed by the citizens represented by Mrs Auroi, and so would my Andalusian constituents."
"I side with those in favour of retaining aid to farmers, although I do not smoke myself and advise everyone not to take it up or to stop."
"I believe it would be a mistake to reduce the cultivation of tobacco or do away with it altogether. My reasons are that this would entail a high social cost and that no suitable alternative crops have been identified."
"It should also be remembered that those who advocate cutting off aid to the sector on the grounds of health protection fail to take into account that subsidising European production would have no impact on consumption. This is because the European Union imports 70% of its raw tobacco."
"Nonetheless, we have already been presented with a proposal providing for gradual elimination of tobacco without the relevant studies to ensure alternative sources of income following replacement of this crop."
"There are no such alternative sources of income at present."
"Discussion of reform can only begin when the results of assessment of the COM in tobacco are available, not in any event before 2003."
"The Commission aims to replace agricultural research with action to support the development of specific initiatives encouraging tobacco producers to change to other crops and engage in alternative economic activities generating employment. Deductions from the producers' premiums are to be implemented progressively starting in 2004."
"The Community Fund financed by deductions from the subsidies has been underused. This was due to serious mismanagement by the Commission."
"If the latter handled the existing budget so badly, I have grave misgivings as to whether it would do better with a significantly larger sum. It should be recalled that there have hardly been any calls to tender so far."
"The Fund must of course continue to serve its purpose and pursue research into varieties more suited to demand and causing as little harm as possible."
"Obviously it must also investigate alternative uses for raw tobacco and its environmental impact."
"Increased deductions should not be an excuse for covert reductions of the producers' premiums."
"I should like to conclude by emphasising the important social and economic role played by tobacco cultivation. It calls for a sizeable workforce on family plots."
"The debate on tobacco and public health should not therefore be restricted to the agricultural context, targeting the weakest link in the chain of tobacco production."
"Madam President, we should like to express our opposition to any attempt to abolish or gradually reduce aid to tobacco, as proposed by the Commission, because it will wipe out tobacco production in Europe."
"We disagree with any proposal which is based on the premise of abandoning tobacco production and tries to gild the pill by allegedly seeking alternative forms of employment and income for producers."
"We all know full well that tobacco is grown in disadvantaged areas in the south, mainly barren mountainous areas, and that it is a crop traditionally grown on holdings on which nothing else will grow. It is the sole source of income and means of survival for people living in these areas, for whom there are no alternative forms of employment."
"It is infuriating that proposals such as this are being made at a time when smoking is on the increase and 70% of the tobacco used is imported."
"Consequently, any reduction in tobacco growing in the Community will wipe out thousands of small and medium-sized holdings and increase imports and merely serves the predatory interests of the huge tobacco industry and distribution monopolies, at the expense of producers and consumers alike."
"The only thing we should be reducing are imports, not the income of European farmers, and every suitable measure should be taken in order to do so."
"Any other proposal is anything from hypocritical to highly suspicious and a smoke-screen for unlawful interests."
"As far as the Cunha report is concerned, it contains a number of good points, but it too accepts the objective, albeit with reservations, of reducing tobacco growing in the Community, perhaps over a longer period of time."
"This is clearly illustrated, for example, in Amendments Nos 7 and 12, calling for tobacco growers to be encouraged to switch into other crops, which is why we shall be voting against it."
"Madam President, there were a couple of dissenting voices in the Committee on Agriculture about a subsidy for tobacco and I was one of them. I make no apology for that."
"I support the Commission very much on what they are trying to do in phasing out tobacco subsidies and I would encourage them to continue at a faster pace, rather than a slower one."
"We cannot justify European taxpayers' money being spent on tobacco production."
"One of the key objectives of the common agricultural policy is to produce good, wholesome food for the consumers of Europe."
"I cannot quite see how tobacco fits into this scenario."
"I have a great deal of respect for Mr Cunha, the rapporteur, but on this occasion he has got it wrong."
"He is a little like King Canute, who wanted to stop the tide coming in but was unsuccessful."
"The Committee on Agriculture did not face up to the realities."
"Over the past ten years we in Europe have spent GBP 6.5 billion or EUR 10 billion - GBP 2 for every citizen in Europe - to subsidise tobacco."
"One third of this tobacco is of very low quality and is seldom smoked at all."
"Another third is dumped on Developing World markets which then destroys their markets for tobacco."
"Is this a role of the common agricultural policy?"
"It is a role we have tried to avoid."
"Only one third of this tobacco is smoked in Europe."
"We cannot, therefore, justify the support that we are giving."
"We all accept the need to support farming in rural communities, but we have to find different crops and different ways of supporting them in the future."
"The final point I wish to make is that, of all the areas of this support that I dislike, the continuation in Amendment No 17 of the support for very low-quality tobacco is the most wrong."
"If anything should be corrected it is this. I urge the Commission to phase out the growing of this very low-quality tobacco immediately."
"Madam President, I have one very brief question to ask Commissioner Fischler."
"Today we received the opinion of the Council's legal services, questioning whether recital 5 of the Commission proposal is legal."
"The Council's legal services question whether recital 5 is legal."
"My question to Mr Fischler is this; does he intend to withdraw recital 5?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking you, Mr Cunha for your excellent report, which is obviously based on an in-depth analysis of the Commission proposal."
"This proposal fixes the premiums and guarantee thresholds for the next three years, changes the scope of the Tobacco Fund and slightly simplifies the common organisation of the market."
"As far as premiums are concerned, the Commission proposal is that the current amounts should remain unchanged, with the exception of variety group 5, which Mr Parish referred to earlier, where we propose a 10% reduction."
"This being the case, we cannot accept Amendment No 17; the reduction in premiums for this variety group has only been proposed because the market situation is now totally untenable, with prices in free fall and very high stock levels which will affect future developments on this market."
"As far as guarantee thresholds are concerned, the Commission proposal is that they should gradually be reduced by 2.6% to 334 000 tonnes by 2004."
"This figure more or less corresponds to quantities produced in the 1999 and 2000 financial years."
"Amendments Nos 18 and 19 are not acceptable to the Commission because the suggested guarantee thresholds and the way in which they are broken down bears no relation to current production demands and efforts to encourage varieties for which there is greater demand."
"Recital 5, which the honourable Member referred to earlier, reflects the political framework underlying the proposal as regards the Tobacco Fund."
"This proposal is a twofold proposal."
"First it amends the scope of the Fund, by dispensing with funding for agronomic research in order to support producers switching to other crops and, secondly, it gradually increases the amount retained to 5%."
"The Commission has created a new political framework in its communication on a strategy for sustainable development."
"We are working towards phasing out aid for the tobacco sector because we are required under Article 152 of the Treaty to guarantee a high level of human health protection in all Community policies."
"We too are aware of the fact that there is no direct relation between tobacco production and smoking levels, that is, people will not stop smoking because we provide less support for tobacco growing."
"The political question lies in Article 152, which quite clearly states that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in all Community policies, that is, including all aid policies."
"Which means that the other question no longer applies."
"The deletion of this recital suggested in Amendment No 2 is therefore unacceptable."
"Nor is the suggested reference to the European Parliament's resolution in Amendment No 3 acceptable because it has nothing to do with the proposed regulation."
"Amendments Nos 4 to 6, calling for an assessment of the social and economic impact have already been overtaken by events."
"We are already carrying out a comprehensive assessment which also deals with these aspects."
"The Commission cannot therefore decide on a timetable for abolishing aid here and now, as called for in Amendments Nos 25 and 26."
"The Commission is aware of the potential impact of phasing out aid to tobacco growing, especially in various production areas such as Greece, Spain and Italy, where the social and economic structure is particularly fragile."
"The Commission communication therefore makes provision for measures designed to create alternative jobs and profitable economic activity under rural development plans to support producers switching to other crops."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 11 calling for continuing aid for agronomic research are unacceptable because promoting measures to switch into other crops is now a strategic priority and we must move decisively in this direction."
"The Commission takes the view that tobacco producers must be offered new ways of diversifying into other crops or other sectors."
"Funding can be provided for research under the Community research policy."
"Information campaigns on the harmful effects of tobacco consumption need to be extended and new information campaigns need to contain more comprehensive information on the harmful effects of smoking."
"That is why we propose gradually increasing the amount retained to 5% by 2004 and why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 or 9."
"Amendments Nos 22 and 23 calling for an additional 5% to be retained are unacceptable because they will overstretch a great many enterprises financially."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 16 are unacceptable; they are superfluous because the assessment due for completion by 2002 also deals with these aspects."
"The same applies to Amendments Nos 10 and 24."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 8 are unacceptable because the derogation for cooperative undertakings is difficult to justify."
"However, may I remind you that the auction procedure is optional for producer Member States and they are free to decide whether or not they consider it advisable to introduce this procedure."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the individual components of this proposal, by which I mean maintaining premiums at current levels, adjusting thresholds to current production levels, the three-year period of validity and promoting diversification, form a balanced entity which is tailored to producers' requirements and takes account of new prospects."
"In the first quarter of 2003, the Commission will present new proposals to the European Parliament and the Council for the future of the sector thereafter, based on the results of the assessment, which should be available by the end of this year."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify what he just said."
"Commissioner, you stated that the Commission is proposing certain measures and alternative employment opportunities in the context of rural development."
"That at least is what I understood you to have said."
"May I therefore enquire, Commissioner, whether you could provide tobacco farmers with assurances on alternative employment?"
"Are you in fact guaranteeing jobs?"
"I would be grateful for clarification."
"Mr President, it all depends on what the honourable Member understands by the term guarantee."
"What we are doing in this proposal is as follows, as I have already explained: in order to be able to take account of the Commission communication to the European Council, we must develop alternative forms of employment for people at the same time as phasing out tobacco subsidies."
"We do not just want to apply a wait and see policy here; we want to test out various alternatives in a sort of pilot stage and see what the best and most promising alternatives are."
"Some of the 5% funds which I referred to will be used for this."
"If you take a close look at the Commission communication on sustainable development, you will see that what we are starting to do is to phase out tobacco subsidies and develop suitable alternatives in the areas affected at one and the same time."
"That is what I explained and that is exactly what we want to do."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0045/2002) by Mrs Langenhagen, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the fish processing industry [2000/2303(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to extol the virtues of fish as a healthy food."
"With food scandals left, right and centre, there is surely nothing wrong with highlighting the benefits of healthy eating."
"Which is where fish come in."
"It is an established fact that an ever increasing proportion of the pro capita consumption of fish is in the form of processed products."
"That includes not just canned fish but the whole range of fish on offer, from smoked to frozen fish."
"In terms of turnover, the fish processing industry in the European Union is almost twice as large as the fisheries sector."
"Given the financial clout of this industry, with turnover in excess of EUR 10 billion, and its vital contribution to the food supply in the EU, I am surprised - with all due respect, Mr Fischler - that the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy pays such scant attention to this sector, especially when the statistics are as follows."
"First, it provides almost 100 000 jobs throughout Europe."
"Secondly, it involves thousands of enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, often located in structurally-challenged regions with few alternative forms of employment."
"Thirdly, it has a long tradition of added-value processing in its many and varied forms."
"All this clearly illustrates that the few sentences on the fish processing industry in the Green Paper are far too little and fail to take proper account of this sector, which is why I proposed this own initiative report, to draw attention to this neglected sector and, more importantly, to test out the room for political manoeuvre here in the run up to the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"A hearing on the subject in the Committee on Fisheries gave us an interesting insight into the many and varied working conditions, production methods and problems in Europe."
"There are a few problem areas which I should like to highlight. First and foremost, the supply of raw materials."
"The fish-processing industry depends on imports for over 50% of its supplies."
"Admittedly, these are raw materials which the EU fleet cannot supply, which is why we need to improve conditions and guarantee security of supply."
"That includes reducing customs tariffs."
"Secondly, environmental measures."
"The profitability of the processing industry, with its piecemeal structure, has been drastically reduced in certain cases by the environmental measures taken by the EU."
"Environmental protection is important, whether it concerns waste water, packaging or emissions."
"But we need to avoid unnecessary distortions as the result of specifications coming too thick and fast."
"What good is the cleanest water to us, if there are no jobs left in coastal regions?"
"Thirdly, food safety."
"One thing is clear; the fish-processing industry does not cause pollution and toxins."
"Rather, it is the victim of these, which is why it should not be left to shoulder the burden alone."
"Surely the purpose of consumer protection is not to set limit values on the basis of the principle: 'Value XY might be dangerous, so let us stick a 150% safety margin on top of it'."
"Reliable, toxicologically proven limit values make sense, rush jobs and thrashing about in the dark do not."
"I should like the Member States in particular to take good note of that."
"Fourthly, enlargement."
"The candidate countries are knocking at our door."
"Some countries have done exemplary work on hygiene and health protection."
"But there are still massive problems to be resolved before adequate standards can be reached."
"Fifthly, fundamentals."
"We need more information on this sector, which is why we have called for an analysis from the Commission."
"The impact of aid from the FIFG must also be examined carefully, because we do not want a sector which is drip-fed by the EU, we want an industry which is vital and can hold its own in the twenty-first century."
"Waiving aid in favour of self-help should relate at most to areas which are highly dependent on fisheries in future."
"The moral of the story is that the fish-processing industry needs a higher profile in Europe."
"This was the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, with just one vote against."
"I therefore trust that I can count on your full support for this report when we vote on it at 12 noon."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the proposal of the PPE-DE Group that an own-initiative report should be drawn up on the fish processing industry was a good one."
"And, in light of the magnificent report that has been produced, I also welcome the fact that it was drafted by our rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, whom I wish to congratulate once again on her work."
"As our rapporteur said, we feel that the Commission is not addressing the issue of this industry with the appropriate seriousness."
"The Green Paper is a clear example of this."
"This is why we expect more from the Commission in terms of its proposals, and I would say that this report is apt for that very reason."
"The Langenhagen report addresses the problem as a whole."
"In 1998, we drew up a specific report on the canning industry - for which I had the honour of being rapporteur - but this report provides an update and, furthermore, encompasses the entire industry, including frozen products and the marketing aspects, as well as the products of aquaculture."
"From Mrs Langenhagen's report I should like to highlight her observations on both the global and European frameworks, taking account of enlargement."
"In the first case, she considers the liberalisation of imports of raw materials, which is very important, and makes specific exceptions for sensitive products such as tuna loins."
"She also refers to quality, to the environmental and health and hygiene standards of European products compared to imports, in order to protect European consumers from labelling fraud, which has occurred in the cases of sardines and tuna."
"At European level, as has been said, plans are being made to deal with the consequences of the candidate countries' accession, but in a way that does not damage the industry in regions which are behind in economic terms, and which are currently experiencing difficulties."
"Lastly, the report calls for our fisheries products to be promoted more vigorously and for more assistance with R+D to be given to our companies."
"I wish to conclude by stating, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, that we will be supporting the three amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists but that we shall be voting against Amendment No 4 by the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, because we feel that the text submitted by our rapporteur is better."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I wish to say to Mrs Langenhagen that we fully support her report and that we congratulate her on her excellent work."
"We socialists have tabled two amendments, to which I should like to ask the rapporteur to give her express support, on the social aspects of the processing industry, urging the Commission, the Member States and social operators to boost the collective negotiation designed to improve the quality of employment in this industry, especially bearing in mind that the majority of these jobs are performed by women, who have very little social protection and who, furthermore, commonly work on a highly casual basis."
"It is our view that adopting this approach would bring us closer to the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit to improve the quality of employment."
"We believe that improving the training of these nearly 100 000 workers in the processing industry and its conditions of employment, together with this sector's own capacity for innovation and its dynamic, will help to ensure that this industry remains viable and that it has a future."
"Indeed, this initiative is sound, and so is the report. Yet, I would still like to make a few observations."
"In the original recital G, it is stated that the import of fish and fisheries products from outside the EU by the processing industry could lead to conflicting interests."
"This is not always the case. Such imports often provide good incentives for the processing industry and can thus help maintain a good price level for European fishermen."
"Such a misconception is indicative of a general problem which, in my view, we are facing in our committee."
"There are many areas where we - to a greater or lesser extent - lack sufficient insight into how matters stand."
"Unfortunately, we frequently have to make new policy without having all the relevant information on which to base it."
"We must therefore try to obtain more insight into how things are."
"I am of the opinion that, with regard to research, the emphasis must be on reliability and speed."
"I would ask the Commission to ensure that we can have concrete, up-to-date information at our disposal, so that we can take the right decisions in all these areas at the right times."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her report."
"The fish processing industry employs 18 140 people in the UK, that is, 20% of the EU jobs in this sector."
"The majority of these jobs are in Scotland, and in some of the most peripheral areas of Scotland."
"These jobs provide a lifeline to so many people living in rural areas."
"Much more than that, they provide us with the finished fish product."
"Without the workers in this industry we would not enjoy the fish we take for granted."
"That is why the Committee on Fisheries held a hearing and saw that the priorities for the industry were supply, continued employment, the environment, food safety, imports and also the consequences of enlargement."
"We know that some of our stocks are at seriously low levels, and therefore when there is a ban on cod fishing, it is not just the fishermen, but the processors that lose out too."
"We have to work towards availability of supply, but balance this with high hygiene levels and sustainability of that supply."
"The processing industry is an important one, which we should never lose sight of in any fishing debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating you, Mrs Langenhagen, as rapporteur, and the Committee on Fisheries for this own initiative report."
"Like the European Parliament, the Commission also sees the European fish-processing industry as an important sector of the economy."
"This sector of the economy supplies quality fish products and creates jobs, especially in regions which depend on fisheries, and we are well aware of the challenges which it has to cope with."
"There are four main problem areas."
"First, the inadequate supply of raw materials from EU waters, secondly, import restrictions on raw materials, thirdly, strict health, hygiene and environmental standards in the EU compared with third countries and, fourthly, increasing international competition."
"Now to the individual points in your report."
"You complain that we have forgotten this industry in our Green Paper."
"May I remind you that it is addressed in our structural policy, especially in items 4 to 7, 14 and 22 and have already supported measures to modernise the European fish-processing industry."
"The structural fund for fisheries has earmarked EUR 637 million for this purpose for the period from 2000 to 2006."
"I wholeheartedly agree, however, that we need the results of the study into the impact of structural funds on the sector as quickly as possible."
"This study will be available in time for the interim review of the structural fund period in 2003."
"Now to the supply situation."
"I fully agree that we need to develop our supply policy."
"In the final analysis, it is the competitiveness of our own processing industry which is at stake."
"We shall submit a proposal along these lines before the end of this year."
"I expressly welcome your call for the liberalisation of port services in the EU to be harmonised to promote fair competition in the processing industry."
"The Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on this in May last year."
"On the question of health, hygiene and consumer protection inside and outside the Community, I should like to remind you that the relevant provisions of Community law obviously also apply to imports from third countries and we have a comprehensive inspection programme in place in the Member States and third countries in order to ensure that this is the case."
"We want to improve these controls still further and the relevant provisions are being revised as we speak."
"In addition, the European Food Safety Agency will provide us with substantiated scientific opinions on food and animal food safety in future."
"Another question closely related to that of consumer protection is labelling, which was set on a new legal basis in last year's new regulation and which also applies to a whole range of processed products, including smoked, dried and frozen fish."
"As far as preparations for enlargement are concerned, the SAPARD and PHARE programmes include measures to ensure that candidate countries quickly come up to our standards in fisheries."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the new common organisation of the market makes greater provision for cross-sectoral producer organisations which allow the various industries in the fisheries sector, from fishing to processing and sales, to make use of their common synergy potential, for example, by adapting products to market requirements, improving product quality, developing quality labels or environmentally-friendly production methods and so on. So you see, we have already addressed certain aspects of your initiative, although much still remains to be done and you may be sure that we shall put your proposals into practice as best we can."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0041/2002) by Mr Lage, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1587/98 of 17 July 1998 introducing a scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guyana and Réunion as a result of those regions' remoteness [COM(2001) 498 - C5-0446/2001 - 2001/0200(CNS)]."
". (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Regulation No 1587/1998 introducing a scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guyana and Réunion as a result of those regions' remoteness, like the regulations that preceded it, has proved to be a fisheries policy instrument of enormous and undeniable use in economic and social terms and even for safeguarding certain cultural values associated with fishing activities."
"Nevertheless, pursuant to Article 6 of the same Regulation, the Commission should, by 1 June 2001 at the latest, have presented the European Parliament and the Council with the evaluation report on the measures adopted in the fisheries sector for the outermost regions, which, as we all know, should receive special aid, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, which granted them a special status."
"The Commission failed to fulfil that objective by not meeting the deadline set and by using as an excuse for this omission the need for a more detailed analysis using external consultants, against the backdrop of the global revision of the common fisheries policy on the basis of the Green Paper, which has already been opened to public debate."
"The results of these studies determine when this report is to be presented, with the Commission proposing to delay its presentation until 1 June 2002, and, as a logical consequence, to extend the scheme in force by one year, until 31 December 2002, thereby guaranteeing the continuity and stability of the current scheme of compensation for additional costs."
"In short, there is nothing to worry about. This is just a pause for thought."
"I therefore proposed that the Committee on Fisheries deliver a favourable opinion together with some appropriate amendments to the regulation."
"First of all, the scheme of compensation for additional costs must clearly be permanent, with an end to time limits, because the disadvantages faced by the outermost regions as a consequence of their distance from consumer centres are not factors that time and progress will alleviate, being of a structural nature, unless we wish to see the total disappearance of the fisheries sector in these outermost regions one day."
"I should like, in order to make these debates a little less formal, to use the powerful metaphor that José Saramago, winner of the Nobel prize for literature, worked into his novel 'The Stone Raft', in which he imagines a split occurring between the Iberian Peninsula and the European continent and the peninsula consequently drifting away from the continent."
"I do not think that anyone would dare, even ironically, to imagine that the outermost islands could, even at some point in the distant future, become close once again to the European continent, thereby rendering the current concept of remoteness redundant."
"It is now, therefore, proposed that we maintain indefinitely the scheme of aid for the additional costs of marketing certain fishery products, maybe allowing them to be gradually adapted. The future regulation must, therefore, take account of this requirement."
"As far as I am concerned, there is no reason why it should not change at some point in the future to become a model of income support for the fishermen in the outermost regions based on the model that is being adopted and developed to support farmers."
"Whatever the case, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishing activity in the Azores, which employs around 8 000 people and has a huge socio-economic impact on the Archipelago, the 1 500 fishermen of Madeira, the fisheries sector in the Canary Islands, which employs around 13 000 people, as well as the thousands of fishermen from French Guyana and Réunion, cannot be subjected to uncertainties or to the whims of fate."
"They need security and stability, all the more so because they have faced some tough challenges recently, with the failure of the agreement with Morocco, which dealt a cruel blow to fisheries in the Canary Islands."
"I therefore think it is crucial that we increase aid for fishing activities in the outermost regions and are even more generous than we are at the moment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that the compensation scheme for additional costs incurred by outermost regions in the marketing of certain fishery products - incorrectly referred to as the 'Fish POSEIDOM' - is based on a simple principle, namely to support the marketing of species that are most commonly sold outside the European Union, in conditions similar to those in which the economic agents in Europe operate."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which meets the expectations of the representatives of the European Union's outermost regions."
"However, as shadow rapporteur, I would like to make two additional comments."
"In the comprehensive list of disadvantages facing the outermost regions, the rapporteur has failed to mention a difficulty which, in my opinion, is of utmost importance, namely the problems of reaching these areas as a result of the transport links between the regions and the continent and the prices charged for this travel."
"And for us in the far-flung regions, this problem can increase prices by around 30%."
"I also note that the rapporteur bases his report - and this is obviously something that I welcome - on Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which recommends that the special characteristics of outermost regions be taken into account in each of the European Union's policies, especially in the case of fisheries."
"I think, however, that it would have been more logical to refer in full to Article 37 of the Treaty, which represents the very foundation of the fisheries and agricultural policies, had this Article not proved lacking as regards the EU's outermost regions."
"It turns out that it is totally inappropriate in its current form since it takes into account continental fishing conditions only and fails to consider situations related to remoteness."
"Lastly, I fully support the rapporteur's proposal which calls on the Commission to forward to the European Parliament a copy of the report carried out for the Commission by external consultants on the impact of all Community measures adopted to date in the fisheries sector for the outermost regions."
"If we were familiar with the content of this document, it would certainly give us more accurate information to consider when taking into account the specific problems of the outermost regions of the EU."
"Mr President, the outermost regions have a special status, recognised in Article 299(2) of the 1997 Treaty on European Union, but I would say that this status has existed since the founding of the first European Economic Community, in 1957, because this Treaty laid down special provisions for the French Overseas Departments."
"When Spain and Portugal joined the Union in 1986, the Act of Accession of these two countries included special provisions and what Article 299(2) does is to acknowledge a situation that already had a legislative identity, by means of all the special provisions of the various programmes and specific options dealing with the outermost regions, known for short as COP 6."
"The Community Treaties and legislation, therefore, recognise the reality of the enormous distance of these regions from the continent, making it impossible for them to be competitive, which is what we are always calling for in the European Union."
"One only has to visit these territories, which on the face of it seem to be paradises, but which have a host of economic and social problems, to realise what this means."
"And Commissioner Fischler is one of the few people to have made the effort to go there."
"And I repeat; it is an effort to visit, because although these territories are beautiful, the lack of time and space and our knowledge of their situation make it clear that they are far from being a paradise."
"This report by the Committee on Fisheries is an acceptable proposal; the rapporteur has done a good job and has tabled some very reasonable amendments and, in my view, Parliament can approve the report."
"Of course, the Socialist Group gives its support to the report by Mr Lage and we hope that the Commission continues to develop these special approaches to the fisheries sector."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again in this House we are debating European regional diversity; in this case, the dimension of remoteness, as a result of the report by Mr Lage, whom I congratulate on his work, and which affects one of the most characteristic sectors of production in the outermost regions: fisheries."
"I hope that, once the report is approved, we can find a permanent way to address the structural costs of remoteness in the marketing of some fisheries products from these regions which, as you know, are by and large far off, remote and fragmented, where natural energy is scarce and where there is a high dependence on the outside world."
"In my opinion, however, the most important aspect of this report is its recognition of the fact that the legal base for adopting this type of measure has been Article 299(2) of the Treaty, acknowledged at the Amsterdam Summit."
"I am therefore grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Lage, to the Committee on Fisheries and to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for understanding and accepting my amendment, which was, in fact, intended to consolidate the unique legal code that applies to these outermost regions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Lage for his support for our proposal."
"It is true that fisheries play a very important role in the economic and social development of remote regions and a system of aid for marketing specific fishery products from these regions was introduced back in 1992."
"This aid helped producers to offset the additional costs of transporting their products to mainland Europe."
"What we are now proposing is to extend the present scheme by a year, that is, until the end of 2002."
"Why a year?"
"The Commission will be submitting a report to the European Parliament and the Council in June of this year on the implementation and efficiency of the measures which currently apply, together with a detailed appraisal of these measures."
"We can then make any adjustments needed on the basis of this appraisal when the common fisheries policy is revised."
"Now to the proposed amendments: Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern the legal basis."
"We have suggested Article 37 of the Treaty because these measures are no different from the provisions of the Treaty on Community policy or general principles."
"However, we cannot agree to extend the scheme indefinitely."
"The whole point of the extension, as I have said, is to give us time for a detailed appraisal of the measures taken so far."
"I must therefore reject Amendments Nos 1 and 3."
"Nor can I accept Amendment No 2, because the Commission report will not just reflect the results of the study; the report which we present will also need to take account of the impact of the measures and their application by the Member States."
"Amendment No 6 is problematic because, as I have said, the study is just one of numerous documents which we may need to take into account in a proposal for a new regulation."
"It would not therefore be appropriate to mention it separately in the regulation."
"However, I can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5. Thank you for your attention."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0040/2002) by Mr Maat, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Gabonese Republic on fishing off the coast of Gabon for the period 3 December 2001 to 2 December 2005 [COM(2001) 765 - C5-0040/2002 - 2001/0301(CNS)]."
"First of all, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the fact that he has succeeded in reaching an agreement within the framework of Gabon at a time when it is increasingly difficult to conclude fisheries agreements."
"This illustrates the fact that fisheries agreements and the European Union are a matter of particular concern."
"They are partly based on historic schemes, and they now offer not only financial compensation to the countries involved, but simultaneously provide very specific development aid in a large number of African countries."
"With regard to the Gabon agreement, the European Union has earmarked EUR 5 million for a four-year period; 30% of this is financial compensation and 70% is spent on education and structural aid for the coastal region."
"For the sake of clarity, this therefore shows that these agreements contribute greatly towards development cooperation with African countries."
"Incidentally, the amount in annual terms is 70% higher than the current agreement or the agreement that has just lapsed."
"This increase is partly due to the acquisition of additional fishing options in the 6 to 12-mile zone."
"And indeed, the question then arises - and this is also addressed to the Commissioner - to what extent the relevant fisheries organisations in Gabon are actually involved in this agreement."
"Gabon is required annually to submit a written justification for 70% of the amount."
"Fisheries account for 1.4% of Gabon's gross national product."
"However, if we realise that two thirds of Gabon's GNP originates from oil revenues, this means that the fishing industry is indeed an important industry for the country."
"Interestingly, only 70% of the catch capacity was used between 1998 and 2001."
"The Commissioner might be able to account for this."
"It is also striking that, with regard to coastal fishing in the true sense of the word, in other words, fishing within the 12-mile zone, only the capacity of ships has been laid down in the agreement, and not the tonnage quota."
"This is remarkable because, in the EU's internal policy, we always talk about actual catch quotas and not about the capacity of the ships."
"Perhaps the Commissioner can also indicate that the extension of the agreement from a 6 to a 12-mile zone has no implications for Gabonese coastal fishing."
"At the moment, it is insufficiently clear what the actual costs and benefits of the agreement with Gabon will be, also for European fishermen."
"Although the European Commission tries hard to describe the previous agreement in its evaluation report, information about the cost-benefit ratio, the state of the fish stocks and the impact of the agreements on the regions in the EU merit further elucidation, in my view."
"Mr President, I have already indicated that I congratulate the Commissioner on this agreement and that fisheries agreements are of paramount importance to a number of coastal regions in the European Union."
"In that sense, this agreement buttresses the economy in those regions and also gives a structural impulse to the European fisheries industry, which is already under strain."
"This does not detract from the fact - and we cannot turn a blind eye to this - that these agreements meet with increasing criticism, inter alia from the World Wildlife Fund and other non-governmental organisations."
"In future discussions about fisheries agreements, we must underline more emphatically the importance of the social support base of these agreements, both in Africa and in Europe."
"It would be good if the Commission too were to stress that these agreements definitely boost development cooperation with a large number of African countries, for this has not yet struck home where many people are concerned."
"With regard to the report itself, I have indicated in a number of recommendations the points that require extra attention."
"Among the aspects to which I request that more attention be given are control measures, since the Gabonese Government is not sufficiently able to carry out the control tasks adequately, and information about how the money is actually spent and to what extent the coastal regions are actually strengthened."
"Regarding the implementation of this agreement, I would appreciate it if the evaluation of development measures were to be submitted to the Council and the European Parliament every two years."
"The amendments as adopted by the Committee on Fisheries receive my unqualified support."
"In fruitful cooperation with my own coordinator, Mr Farela, I have once again explained our true intentions in Amendment No 2."
"For that reason, I much prefer this amendment to Amendment No 9 tabled by the Liberal Group."
"This means that I would warmly recommend Amendment No 2, while I consider Amendment No 9 by the Liberal Group to be redundant."
"I should also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation for the report and the information, and I would thank them for their input, since this too contributes to a broader support base for agreements of this kind."
"Mr President, some schemes, which are perhaps the product of the intellectual laziness of their authors, seek to present a picture of a Community fleet that preys on the resources of developing countries."
"Today's report could serve to cast doubt upon this stereotype, because Gabon is a country with enormous resources, mainly oil, which is extracted by Western oil companies, and has a very similar per capita income to Poland's, as well as an enviable annual inflation rate of 2%."
"It goes without saying that the Community boats of four Member States, which will be fishing under this agreement, will of course do so in compliance with the principles of responsible fishing and under the strict conditions imposed by the CFP."
"Many of us, however, are bound to wonder, as we do with regard to other agreements, whether this is a fisheries agreement or a development cooperation programme financed from the CFP, since, out of the total sum, 70% is earmarked for activities designed to develop the local fishing sector."
"This is why we are asking the Commission to direct some of this money to support measures to control and preserve stocks."
"Mr Maat, the Socialist Group will be voting against Amendment No 2 and I hope the Commission will do the same, because the fees that should be paid by shipowners whose boats fish under this agreement cannot be different to those paid under other agreements unless we take Greenland as an example, where the shipowners pay not a penny of fees."
"I wish to conclude by saying that those who are attempting to prevent Gabon from being able, like any other country, to sell part of its fishing rights at more than three times its market value are doing it no favours."
"By the same token, they should be against Gabon exporting its oil and its minerals to places such as the Netherlands, the United States, China or France, for example."
"Mr President, my views on third-country fishing agreements are well known but once again I wish to record my disgust at the fact that the European Union is entering into agreements which, despite the honeyed words, are nothing short of economic imperialism."
"What is particularly striking today is the sheer impotence of this Parliament, together with the contempt with which it is treated by the Council and the Commission. Today we are being consulted on an agreement which came into force in December 2001 - nearly three months ago."
"If this House had any dignity whatsoever it would protest against such cavalier treatment, but of course it is mute."
"This supposed watchdog has been very effectively muzzled."
"But even if the whole House rose up and voted to censure this proposal, it would not make a blind bit of difference."
"As ever, to its eternal shame, the Committee on Fisheries approved this agreement."
"But even if it had objected to it unanimously, once again that would not have made any difference whatsoever."
"So as we move to a vote I am sure that this House will do what it always does and rubber-stamp the decision already made by the committee."
"As a democratic institution one has to say that it is nothing more than a sham."
"But my question, Mr Fischler, is how many hundreds more black Africans need to be killed by European Union boats before you start listening?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Maat for his report and for backing the Commission proposal."
"This is a new protocol, in which we have been able to use the excellent results from the previous agreement to increase fishing opportunities for tuna to 10 500 tonnes per annum."
"There is now a new segment with fishing opportunities for shrimps and cephalopods, in return for which Gabon will receive financial compensation of EUR 1.2 million a year, a good 70% of which will be used to develop local fisheries in Gabon, that is, as development aid."
"We have also made several changes to the technical measures, in order to help guarantee the sustainable use of fish resources."
"They include, for example, a system of catch declarations and observers' reports."
"Now to the individual proposed amendments."
"As far as Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 5 are concerned, we agree materially."
"We already meet these requirements under the current interinstitutional agreements, especially the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission of 5 July 2000, which is why these proposed amendments are redundant."
"The Commission must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 9."
"Joint financing of catch opportunities negotiated is a fundamental aspect of Community foreign fisheries policy."
"What happens with agreements with third countries is that the financial compensation comes out of the Community budget and the shipowners pay the licences."
"I should like to say, with respect to Amendments Nos 3 and 7, that the Commission obviously considers the sustainability of fisheries and the needs of local fisheries when it negotiates fisheries protocols."
"I therefore have nothing against these proposed amendments but I think that they are self-evident and do not therefore necessarily warrant separate mention."
"As far as Amendment No 8 is concerned, fish stocks are evaluated before any protocol is renewed and both contracting parties can demand that the joint committee be convened at any given time in order to adjust the current protocol if problems with fish stocks should arise."
"I therefore feel that Amendments Nos 3, 7 and 8 are unnecessary."
"I cannot accept Amendment No 6."
"According to standard practice, no new mandate is required for periodic protocols renewing fisheries agreements."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.56 a.m. and resumed at 12.02 p.m.)"
"Mr President, this so-called compromise amendment was submitted to us late last night and then despatched this morning, initially - and inadvertently - with our name."
"That was then revised."
"I think it is wrong to vote on such a technical text at such short notice, which is why I have serious reservations about voting on it now."
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, it has to be the House which decides whether to vote on this compromise amendment or not."
"(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)"
"Regarding Amendment No 59"
"Mr President, I have the same misgivings as before."
"We cannot agree to vote on it, hence our request that you put it to the House."
"Does the House agree to put this compromise amendment to the vote?"
"(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)"
"Regarding Amendment No 52"
"I have a question, Mr President."
"When did the 'honourable' Member receive this compromise amendment?"
"All the compromise amendments were proposed in one go and given to Mr Radwan at the same time."
"At 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon, he decided to take the first and ninth amendments - you will see in your documents that their numbers have changed - and as for the others, Mr Radwan refused them."
"His two previous comments were made purely and simply in order to manipulate the House."
"Nevertheless, the House has the right to express itself pursuant to the Rules of Procedure."
"(Parliament adopted the amendment)"
"Regarding Amendment No 44"
"Mr President, the original proposed amendment increases the thresholds from 10% to 25%."
"Having consulted the Commission and the Council and the other groups, we have agreed to reduce this to 20%."
"I trust that this will not be interpreted as manipulation on my part and that there will be a broad consensus."
"Mr President, Mr Radwan's oral amendment is incorporated in the compromise amendment AC55 which, in my view, should be voted on before Amendment No 44 as it includes the following amendments."
"Therefore, since the usual order is that we firstly vote on the amendments that deviate the most from the committee's report, I would propose that we now vote on AC55, which includes Mr Radwan's oral amendment, as per the discussion we had yesterday at 5 p.m., and which also includes Amendments Nos 44 and 33."
"The House accepts the rapporteur's position."
"(Parliament agreed to table the oral amendment)"
"Regarding Amendment No 46"
"Mr President, here too the increase is from 10 to 20%, not 10 to 25%."
"The same applies to the next oral amendment."
"Mr President, we have exactly the same problem."
"The oral amendment is part of compromise amendment AC53. AC53 contains aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32."
"The adoption of Mr Radwan's oral amendment, which I approve, does not in any way imply that we are rejecting those aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32."
"I therefore support the proposal - a logical one at that - for the compromise amendment, which includes all the proposals by various Members, to be voted on first."
"I think it is totally unacceptable that, in the previous vote, the amendment of one of the points rendered other points null and void which had nothing to do with what was a global compromise amendment, whose aim was to make the House vote on this relatively technical problem as quickly as possible."
"Therefore, if we do not agree to start with the compromise amendment, we will first have to vote on Mr Radwan's amendment, then Amendments Nos 46 and 32, which have not lapsed in spite of Mr Radwan's amendment."
"Mr Radwan, if the oral amendment is adopted, I believe that Amendments Nos AC53 and 32 will no longer be valid."
"However, I call upon the House to decide whether to agree to your request."
"(Parliament agreed to table the oral amendment)"
"Regarding Amendment No 54"
"Mr President, I am dreadfully sorry, but I did not invent the procedure."
"The proposed amendment arrived very late last night."
"Just so that Mr Cohn-Bendit also understands: the two which were accepted were relatively straightforward."
"The others, as the rapporteur himself explained, are very complicated amendments which run through the entire text and I would be more than happy to explain them to you in detail if you cannot follow them."
"In any event, we are opposed."
"Once again, I call upon the House to decide whether to put the compromise amendment to the vote."
"(Parliament decided not to vote on the amendment)"
"Regarding Amendment No 48"
"Mr President, this again is the increase from 10% to 20%, not 25%."
"Once again, ladies and gentlemen, the increase from 10 to 20% is a thoroughly complicated issue which cannot be tabled just before we are about to vote. I think, however, that the compromise amendment submitted to Mr Radwan at 5 p.m., which he approved without hesitation, should certainly be taken before Amendment No 48."
"I could play the imbecile and say that since Mr Radwan is using tactics that discredit the House, I shall call upon my friends to join forces to reject his oral amendment."
"As for myself, in the interests of the stability of the financial markets in Europe, I think his amendment is fine."
"Therefore, I approve it and I ask you to agree to vote on it, and then to adopt it."
"But I would point out to you that Mr Radwan's thoroughly devious tactics have also caused amendments approved by the Council and the Commission, as well as many Members, to lapse and I think that devious tactics of this type are a discredit to Parliament."
"Mr President, the shadow rapporteurs have reached a new compromise on this point and I should therefore like to withdraw Amendment No 76 on behalf of the Greens."
"We accept this compromise."
"Mr President, it seems that there is some confusion."
"Mr Mann, of the Group of the European People's Party and I tabled compromise Amendment No 79, which was to be voted on in three parts."
"The first part was adopted, but I do not think that we have yet adopted the second part, since you proceeded to the vote on Amendment No 22 by the committee which should, in principle, be contained in the amended Amendment No 79."
"And then we have the third part of compromise amendment No 79: Article 1(2)."
"I was going to propose, on behalf of Mr Lehne, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on my own behalf, this oral amendment, which Mrs Echerer also supports."
"I think that we must then vote in favour of Article 1(2)(b)c and lastly, on Article 1(2)(b)d."
"I am sorry that this is complicated, but life sometimes is complicated."
"Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?"
"It seems not."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, as rapporteur I wish to move an oral amendment."
"There is a compromise amendment proposed by the Socialist Group. It involves an exemption from the need for a prospectus on behalf of the most creditworthy Member States."
"We should make it clear that we want this exemption to apply only to debt securities, so that they would not, for example, be able to undertake a privatisation without a prospectus, and therefore insert the word ""debt"" at the beginning of the compromise on No. 65."
"Mr President, this is the first of three documents on European Union initiatives in the field of the movement of money, insurance undertakings and banks."
"In particular, this first report lays down more stringent rules for the supervision of the activities of banks and insurance undertakings."
"As representative of the Pensioners' Party, I support this document because it is important that those who invest and deposit their money in banks and insurance undertakings have guarantees that their money will be well spent and will yield that fruit which is so important for many citizens, including the less well-off, which category, of course, includes pensioners."
"I was therefore very pleased to vote for the motion."
"- (NL) It is surprising to read how anxious a green economist is about safeguarding the burgeoning financial services markets against systemic risks."
"Following on from the Lisbon Summit in the spring of 2000, which wanted to turn Europe into the world's most competitive economy, Mr Lipietz wants to make the EU the safest haven for financial activities."
"This is why he would like legislation which offers the financial markets opportunities to develop."
"In his view, it is not the Member States that decide which of the three methods are used for the calculation of the supplementary capital adequacy."
"Instead, the financial conglomerates can make that choice themselves, provided that they make their decision public."
"I find little concern for people and the environment in his vision and too much understanding of the requirements of companies involved in capital management."
"However, I am aware that it is preferable to regulate these markets than to leave them to their own devices on a world scale, whereby those with the greatest spirit of adventure are given free rein and the most immoral companies elbow the others out of the market."
"I consider his proposal as a first step which will make it easier to draft rules later on in the interests of the financing of public services, the fight against poverty, democratic control and care for the environment."
"The proposed directive establishes prudential rules (capital adequacy requirements and supplementary supervision) with regard to financial conglomerates."
"We believe the aim is the socialisation of these sectors (credit, insurance and investment) because the purpose of these rules, in our view, stems from a public service approach."
"In a rational economy, funding should be granted according to social need for investment, and insurance should be integrated into social funds for investment and social protection."
"This directive is a feeble attempt to regulate the financial markets, the chaotic workings of which are now seen to be the cause of financial crises and social catastrophes throughout the world, as the Enron affair has illustrated."
"I voted in favour of the directive without any illusions, if only to curb the ambient ultra-liberalism and because we are not in favour of making things worse in order to further our own ends, which would amount to waiting for faults in capitalism to result in a final crisis."
"Social campaigning alone will put a stop to the erring ways of an uncontrollable system."
". Key elements of subsidiarity and effective choice of a proper regulatory body as the final arbiter give cause for concern in this report."
"Similarly, the call for statistical information to be made public as a solution to public awareness of what affects markets is impracticable and impossible to achieve."
"The subsequent costs to industry also amount to a disproportionate effect."
"The directive proposes to reduce some forms of financial crime, and we welcome this fine objective."
"We must be wary, however, of being totally naïve, first and foremost, because, as the rapporteur points out, 'it would have been better to have had recourse to a Community regulation."
"But the Treaty does not allow it'. The fact that criminal penalties fall within the remit of the Member States leaves the net wide open and encourages, as is the case in fiscal matters, criminal operations spanning several countries."
"Furthermore, we do not believe to any degree that capitalism can work in a transparent and equitable fashion."
"Capitalist competition is a form of war by all available means, such as pacts, lobbying, organised accounting practices and fudged audits, as current events illustrate."
"We do not see money-making institutions taking swift measures to try to monitor their methods."
"As for 'insider dealings', we do not see how they could be dissuaded by declarations of intent - even if they are called a directive - when this does not provide for any genuinely restrictive penalty."
"In spite of these reservations, I voted in favour of the directive so as not to obstruct the minimal measures therein."
"Mr President, as I explained last night, I am not thrilled with the compromise reached in Feira on the taxation of savings income."
"I voted in favour of all the amendments in Mr Pérez Royo's report because I authored the greater majority of them."
"I am also very grateful to the rapporteur for no longer including these overly radical amendments, as I explained to the House last night."
"I also voted in favour of the report in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market so that it could be placed on the agenda."
"Although I decided nonetheless to vote against the report on this occasion, it was in order to register that I am, in principle, against the fact that, at Feira, we abandoned the co-existence model which would have enabled Member States to choose whether to withhold tax or to exchange information on savings income received."
"I also believe that we can no longer have a situation where Member States adopt and publish a directive on this issue before ascertaining whether the same measures will be applied in dependent or associated territories, and before having concluded negotiations with third countries on the application of equivalent measures, on the understanding that withholding tax is not the same as the exchange of information."
"Mr President, Mr Fernando Pérez Royo's report is on a proposal for a Council directive to ensure effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments within the Community."
"Shivers ran down my spine, Mr President, and my hair stood on end when I read the title of this report: effective taxation of savings income."
"Of course, it is right to pay taxes and, as this directive says, it is right to inform States that their citizens have come here, for example, and that they must be taxed on the interest on any savings they may have, but should we not decide once and for all not to make people who save pay interest or tax to governments just because they have been saving money?"
"Saving is a very good thing."
"It was with great difficulty that I voted for the report."
". (IT) Taxation on savings has always been a hotly debated issue."
"There are some who support a withholding tax, implemented as a tax levied at source which settles the tax position of the person concerned."
"The other, which is certainly more up to date, is the information system: in this case people do not settle their own tax liability because it will be subject to a subsequent levy on their income tax return."
"From the point of view of fairness, the second method certainly provides the Community with a guarantee that the income, whatever it may be, is taxed in its entirety. However, this method is only fair if applied by everyone."
"As soon as one country decides not to adopt it, for historical or opportunistic reasons, the structure that has been built upon it is blown apart."
"All this applies to the Pérez Royo report, which has taken the information method as the basis for taxation on cross-border savings."
"For this directive to work effectively, it must be implemented when the third countries adopt it."
"Therefore, agreement with the third countries is a sine qua non for this directive to enter into force."
"Implementation without an agreement would cause a disturbance in the savings market, the negative effects of which cannot yet be readily assessed."
"The liberalisation of movement of capital has been achieved, not only within the EU but also in non-Community financial centres. It is therefore obvious that the introduction of a new tax, as well as a policy for the exchange of information that is limited to the 15 Member States, will have a negative impact on financial transactions."
"The introduction of such a tax would give rise to considerable tax evasion."
"For these reasons, we believe that it is essential to introduce effective savings income within the Community in the form of interest payments, which is, in other words, also provided in a number of third countries as well as in all the autonomous territories that depend on a Member State."
"Therefore, the entry into force of this directive should categorically depend on the conclusion of agreements on the introduction of identical measures in the countries and territories in question."
"Since there is much work that has to be done before this last condition is fulfilled, we were unable to give our backing to this proposal for a directive."
"- (NL) Banking secrecy makes it appealing to have savings outside one's own country as a means of evading income tax or property tax."
"The EU has been unable to solve this cross-border problem for the past 13 years."
"All proposals to make the existence of foreign capital visible to national tax offices have, further to opposition, subsequently been withdrawn."
"Precisely in this area, each Member State in the Council has the capacity to thwart a regulation."
"If a scheme is not put in place in time for the expected accession of ten new Member States in 2004, it will probably not enter into force in the foreseeable future."
"For me, this is a reason to approve the compromise whereby Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria can continue to levy tax at source for another seven years while the other Member States adopt a scheme for the cross-border exchange of information."
"Despite this, the problem is not completely solved by a long chalk, as long as wealthy people can transfer their capital to a separate legal entity which falls outside the scope of such an exchange of information."
"I have noted that a majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wish to exempt this latter group, which contravenes the proposal of the rapporteur."
"In addition, the condition agreed among the ministers only to apply the scheme if, for example, Switzerland adopts the same scheme can, once again, lead to inertia."
"I voted against the adoption of the report by Mr Pérez Royo on the proposal for a Council directive to ensue effective taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments within the Community."
"The text of the amended proposal does not mention the agreement reached on this issue at the Feira European Council nor does it mention, more specifically, the following crucial point, which is worded as follows:"
"'Once sufficient reassurances with regard to the application of the same measures in dependent or associated territories and of equivalent measures in the named countries have been obtained, and on the basis of a report, the Council will decide on the adoption and implementation of the directive no later than 31 December 2002, and do so by unanimity.'"
"This has become an essential condition for the entry into force of the directive."
". Whilst the Labour Group supports the ""Feira"" approach to this matter, it is concerned that amendments in this report voted through undermined the cooperative basis already agreed."
". Mr President, for too long the EU banking sector has been permitted to operate in a culture of secrecy for fiscal purposes."
"Not only does this contradict the EU's aims to have more transparency and openness, but it also creates a situation whereby there is unfair tax competition."
"Therefore, I wholeheartedly welcome moves by the Commission to tighten up this situation and combat harmful tax practices once and for all."
"However, it is vital, as this report points out, that this directive should apply to dependent territories, such as the Channel Islands."
"If these were to be excluded, the entire directive would be undermined by those who choose to bank in certain preferential tax havens."
"This directive will do much to ensure that the single market is not distorted by asymmetric tax regimes and it will create a situation whereby, after a transition period of three years, Member States will exchange information on savings income received by non-residents."
"These moves will enhance European citizens' rights vis-à-vis big banking corporations."
"Mr President, the British Labour Members did not support this report."
"We do not support the extension of the marketing scheme for nuts."
"We recognise, however, that production is commonly found in less-favoured areas, principally in Spain, and that much of the production is barely competitive and brings little economic return."
"For these reasons it would make more economic sense to support the affected regions by a comprehensive programme for alternative crops or other activities that could be financed through the Rural Development Programme."
"Our vote accordingly urges the Commission to bring forward proposals to this effect."
"We realise that these views are not universally popular but believe that they should ultimately result in a higher standard of living for the people affected."
"This is preferable to continued subsistence living and uncertain financial provision from CAP funds."
"We are critical of Mr Bautista Ojeda's report on certain nuts and locust beans."
"In our view, the amendments tabled represent, in general, an out-of-date agricultural policy which does not meet the conditions and needs of modern global society."
"In the light of this, and with a view to the impending general review of the EU's agricultural policy, we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety."
"The support regime for making the nut, locust bean and hazelnut sector more efficient has helped modernise production."
"This process has been justified on the grounds that the sector is an important source of employment in parts of the Mediterranean region."
"However, support of this kind cannot be provided for ever."
"It is only right that these sectors should be covered by the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables."
"It is not, however, reasonable for the committee to propose a statement to the effect that the support system should be made permanent in order to guarantee the survival of the sector."
"Instead, the Commission should conclude its analysis of how competitive production is (while the present support system is extended by a year in accordance with the Commission's proposal) and then decide as to the consequences."
"Mr President, the British Labour Members voted against the Cunha report."
"Our objective is a fundamental reform involving withdrawal of financial support for tobacco production."
"The proposal to extend the present financial provision is unacceptable."
"So too was the amendment in the report which would reduce the Commission proposals for higher premia for the Community Tobacco Fund."
"However, the economic and social importance of tobacco in certain regions must be taken into account."
"The Commission must bring forward measures to develop alternative sources of income with a greater degree of urgency than it is currently showing."
"Recognising this as the priority we voted for Amendment No 21."
"Mr President, the Cunha report, which deals with the regulation permitting the financing of tobacco growing in Greece, Spain and Italy, especially, has forced me - like Mr Ebner, who spoke a moment ago - to abstain because many pensioners are smokers, and therefore I cannot be against tobacco, but many of them unfortunately become seriously ill and die partly because throughout their lives they have breathed in the smoke from cigarettes smoked by others in their presence."
"I am therefore in favour of those who want to smoke, provided they do so outdoors, in the open air, because it is their own business, and I am also in favour of doing everything possible so that those who do not want to breathe smoke-polluted air are not forced to do so."
"I therefore abstained, and I hope the problem will soon be solved in this way, which I think is very fair."
". (EL) The Commission proposal for a regulation on tobacco is unacceptable."
"It is unacceptable politically because it disadvantages tobacco farmers, on the pretext of protecting health, when the Commission has spent millions on products such as red meat and alcohol, which are also harmful to health."
"It is unacceptable socially because it disadvantages tens of thousands of tobacco-growing families in the poorest areas of the European Union, who are unable to grow alternative crops."
"It is unacceptable to the state because phasing out subsidies for Community tobacco will not reduce consumption by a single cigarette."
"All it will do is increase sales by American multinationals."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development accepted my amendment to delete recital 5 which talks of phasing out tobacco subsidies."
"It also accepted my amendments on replacing premiums on Tsebelia - Mavra and on conducting a special study into the ratio between Community production, imports and tobacco consumption."
"Despite the fact that I beg to differ with the Committee on Agriculture's resolution on certain points, it is on the right track if tobacco growing is to be maintained and it has my support."
"."
"(DE) We need to look at the 'tobacco' sector as a whole and take a balanced approach to the various areas (CAP and the environment, economic and social cohesion, public health)."
"Studies by the Commission into this are under way and their results and findings will need to be incorporated in specific proposals."
"We should not delude ourselves that, if we reduce tobacco growing, everyone will stop smoking in the EU."
"We must accept that tobacco will then be imported from third countries, where we cannot do anything about tobacco growing, while jobs are being lost in the EU."
"We have a duty towards the people who earn a living from growing tobacco and we must offer them reasonable alternatives."
"Restructuring measures could be funded from the new area within the Community Tobacco Fund, the budget for which needs to be increased by 3%."
"I also call for information and awareness campaigns to be stepped up on the damage which tobacco consumption causes to health."
"In August 1967, the Commission consulted the European Parliament for its opinion on the first proposal on a regulation to establish a common organisation of the market in the tobacco sector."
"I was appointed rapporteur by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which examined the proposal over the course of nine meetings, adopted my report in April 1969 and debated it in Strasbourg in May 1969."
"Why am I recalling this?"
"Because, at that time, we proposed a new type of market organisation based on a contract system, providing, within the framework of the Community preference, a fair income for producers, as well as social measures and assistance for changing activity."
"I would like to make it clear that I do not believe that, on the pretext of combating nicotine addiction, we must phase out raw tobacco cultivation in the Community."
"There are regions where tobacco growing is a major source of income for small farmers and where changing activity, either to undertake growing other crops or to carry out other economic activities, is extremely difficult, if not impossible."
"In 1969, we had already written that social measures and assistance for changing activity could be justified much more easily than financing excess production of varieties which do not find a buyer on the market."
"We pointed out that measures for changing activity as well as those aimed at enhancing tobacco growing in a quantitative and qualitative manner should be integrated in the regional policy and the policy for improving agricultural structures."
"We even warned that selling surpluses on the global market could only harm associated countries and the interests of the Community's external trade policy."
"As it is never too late to make amends, it is justified that we support our rapporteur today in order to restrict ourselves to changing the Commission's proposals solely from a technical perspective and to postpone the in-depth political debate on the future regime on raw tobacco until 2003."
"(Speech shortened pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"We are critical of Mr Cuhna's report on leaf tobacco."
"In our view, the amendments tabled represent, in general, an out-of-date agricultural policy which does not meet the conditions and needs of modern global society."
"In the light of this, and with a view to the impending general review of the EU's agricultural policy, we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety."
". (NL) The European Union pursues a policy which, on the one hand, discourages the smoking of tobacco products while, on the other, encouraging the production of tobacco by granting subsidies to tobacco-growing farmers."
"Fortunately, there are now plans afoot to phase these subsidies out, but the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is still opposed to these plans."
"This committee draws attention to the socio-economic importance of the production of tobacco, which is located in the poorest regions of the EU, and to the difficulty of switching over to other crops."
"In the same way, this committee could refer to the importance of the production of the raw materials for cocaine by the farmers in the poorest regions of Columbia."
"The difference is that, in one case, we provide subsidies and, in the other, we tolerate a situation in which, under American influence, armed action is taken against these farmers and foreign aircraft take off from Dutch colonial territory to carry out reconnoitring exercises with a view to spraying toxins."
"Applying double standards lacks all credibility."
"The money used for the tobacco subsidies could be better spent on informing the public about the harmful effects of tobacco consumption and on supporting regions that switch to other crops."
"I emphatically condemn the rapporteur's opposition to this solution."
"It is, in the long term, unacceptable for the money of EU citizens to be used to subsidise tobacco cultivation in certain Member States."
"It is important, particularly from a public health point of view, to stop subsidising tobacco cultivation."
"The high levels of subsidy militate against conversion to other crops."
"The Christian Democrats are therefore in favour of phasing out tobacco subsidies in line with the Commission's proposal."
"Tobacco growing plays a very important role, especially in the less favoured regions of Europe."
"About 130 000 landowners and 400 000 seasonal workers are involved in tobacco production and processing in the European Union."
"These figures alone are enough to justify and provoke a study on the social and economic costs of suppressing aid to tobacco, even before we get to the political debate on this crop's future in the European Union."
"In any case, restrictions on tobacco growing in Europe would have no effect on consumption except to turn European consumers towards tobaccos from outside the European Union, which are of much poorer quality and certainly more harmful to health."
"Added to this is the fact that Commission document COM (2001) 264 of 15 May 2001 on sustainable development stresses that 'political leaders should determine the pros and cons for other political contexts and take them into account."
"A thorough evaluation of all the effects of a proposed political action must include estimates of its environmental and social impact both inside and outside the EU.'"
"As European Republicans, we therefore believe that the Commission should make a concerted effort to promote studies and research into possible alternative crops that would maintain the rural fabric in a sustainable manner."
"We agree with the draftsman, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, that the political debate on tobacco should be held over until Parliament has received an evaluation report on the management of the fund, with any proposed amendments and improvements."
"For the reasons given above, we say 'no' to the under-cover gradual elimination of subsidies for tobacco growing; we call for the current contribution levels for the research fund activities to be maintained for 2002/2003/2004, since agronomic research is today one of the most important ways of making tobacco consumption less harmful to health; and we support the amended report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"- (NL) According to the Dutch Government, European agricultural policy is in need of reform."
"This is reportedly due to enlargement and the fear that, soon, a huge contribution will have to be made to the EU budget."
"As we all know, the Dutch watch their pennies."
"I support the call for a policy review. However, my reason for doing so is not enlargement, but the fact that agricultural policy includes schemes that are completely unrelated to healthy agriculture."
"The common organisation of the market in the raw tobacco industry is, for a variety of reasons, unhealthy."
"Although I recognise that agricultural policy must address the social dimension, as well as the economic dimension, of operational management, this common organisation of the market has swung completely towards social policy."
"An industry is being maintained which is both harmful to public health and unprofitable."
"The premiums remove all incentive from the farmer to adapt his agricultural plan."
"In this way, he stands to lose out all round."
"Tobacco is a product which damages public health."
"I should like to invite MEPs who wish to challenge this notion to initiate proceedings against the warning on cigarette packets."
"The argument that the market demands tobacco and that current European production must thus be maintained is a specious argument quoted by various Members of this House."
"After all, market demand does not mean that production must be subsidised."
"If this is set to become a commonly held notion in agricultural policy, the net payers in the Union are in for a rough ride."
"Adjustments to the common organisation of the market in the rough tobacco industry must encourage growers to look for alternative crops."
"The Commission proposal is promising. Reference is made in no uncertain terms to the gradual abolition of subsidies, while measures are introduced to develop alternative sources of income."
"The rapporteur, Mr Cunha does not do Europe any favours by wishing to delete this Commission comment."
"This is why, together with 31 other Members of this Parliament, I have tabled an amendment whereby this report would expressly call for tobacco production subsidies to be phased out."
". (PT) We are still waiting!"
"The specific measures in force for the outermost regions are inadequate and only cover the fields of agriculture and fisheries - a much more modest framework than the one established ten years ago when the POSEI programmes were launched and one which squanders the possibilities opened up by Article 299(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and this is both incomprehensible and unacceptable."
"Even in the fields that the measures do cover, their overall financial provisions have remained the same, and so, in relative terms, they are worth less today than when the measures were launched."
"In agriculture, some small improvements have been made to the framework of measures, and in fisheries, aid has been extended for the disposal of certain products, as is now being proposed once again, for a further year."
"What is needed are permanent schemes, periodically adapted and supported by sufficient overall financial provisions, not only in agriculture and fisheries but also in energy, the environment, communications, the new technologies and support for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Community system of support for the disposal of some fishery products in certain outermost regions, including the Autonomous Region of Madeira, a system established in 1992 following on from the POSEI programmes, has been subject to successive extensions and revisions."
"The need to adopt specific measures for the outermost regions with Article 299(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community as a legal base has been constantly reiterated by Parliament."
"There can, therefore, be no doubt that it is appropriate to maintain instruments of support for the outermost regions, as laid down in the proposal for a Council regulation presented by the Commission."
"I therefore offer my unreserved support to this proposal for a regulation, which seeks to extend the system in force by one year, until 31 December 2002, thereby ensuring the continuity of the legal framework of the system to compensate for the additional costs incurred as a result of remoteness in the marketing of certain fishery products."
"A one-year extension will enable the Commission to come up with a new support system to enter into force after 1 January 2003, in light of the assessment currently being made of the impact of these support measures on the fisheries sector in the outermost regions."
"- (NL) The conclusion of fisheries agreements by the EU with Developing World countries, which include many former colonies of current EU Member States, sounds better than it is."
"Everyone talks about the mutual benefit."
"For those countries, the shortage of funding is solved to a certain extent; for us, the shortage of fish."
"It means that European ships can use those waters for fishing at the expense of the European taxpayer who pays for three quarters of the compensation paid to the less wealthy countries involved."
"These are countries which have to sell their rights due to poverty."
"Gabon, which is once again selling fishing rights for a three-year period, is itself obliged to import fish."
"Agreements of this kind are at the expense of these countries' own coastal fishing, certainly if it is assumed that the protected territorial waters which fall outside the scope of the agreement extend for only six, instead of twelve, miles."
"The rapporteur dutifully refers to the need for scientific research, the environmental drawbacks, alternative funding, development aid and the disadvantages for the countries involved."
"I share his views on many of the aspects he includes in his recitals but, unlike Mr Maat, I am not in favour of continuing with agreements of this kind."
". We are very unhappy with the fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries as we are aware that within this agreement with the Gabonese Government 40% of the money should be set aside for conservation measures."
"Due to a lack of good governance, we are concerned that these funds may not be used for the purposes for which they were intended, and thus the Conservative Delegation abstained on the final vote."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"We must face the fact that the rate of biodiversity decline and loss in Europe and throughout the world continues to increase."
"The existing measures do not seem to be sufficient to reverse current trends, particularly the decrease in the number of species and their habitat, ecosystems and genes."
"Europe must fulfil a specific role, boosting initiative and providing impetus in this area and it must not merely voice pious hopes that will not be followed up with action."
"To begin with, Europe must ensure that environmental legislation is applied."
"Too many Member States, for reasons connected with their national political situation, resist transposing certain directives into their law in a swift and efficient manner. This is particularly true of the birds and habitats directives."
"We must also take action in the areas of agriculture and fisheries."
"Agriculture must play a key part, and the new CAP must be radically reformed and account taken of the requirements of sustainable development."
"In the area of fisheries, it is essential that we provide for short- and medium-term coherent measures in order to preserve or restore biological diversity where it is at risk."
"Lastly, preserving biological diversity does not mean we have to put a stop to the research effort and the development of knowledge."
"Also, in the area of GMOs, for example, although we must not disregard the precautionary principle, we must support objective and step-by-step scientific validation of these experiments."
"- (NL) In less than a century, mankind has changed the world beyond recognition, and certainly not only for the good."
"The world population has risen enormously, previously virgin territory has been bisected by traffic connections, and large areas have been seized for the production of food, the growing of industrial crops and urbanisation."
"Tropical forests are being cut down or burnt down on a massive scale, animal species become extinct due to economic exploitation, oceans are emptied of fish stocks, indigenous peoples are driven out of their territories, and plants and animals are being patented."
"What until recently was still considered progress is nowadays increasingly seen as a threat to the future."
"This is why it is so important to do more to protect what is left of natural plant and animal life and to promote the survival of people who, since time immemorial, have lived in sparsely populated areas surrounded by rich fauna and flora."
"This group of people are becoming significantly impoverished and are therefore forced to move to the cities or destroy their natural surroundings to allow for more industry and intensive agriculture."
"Appropriate measures include support for non-governmental organisations, adapting development plans for the Developing World and changing the EU's agricultural policy."
"In the midst of all the changes for the worse, the adoption of this proposal with a view to protecting bio-diversity represents a little ray of hope, although I am not confident about its outcome."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"The European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, consider the protection of citizens, their environment, their daily lives and their health to be of great importance."
"Balanced texts on these subjects are very often approved at Community level."
"It is apparent to us, however, that the transposition of a number of directives by the Member States is being unjustifiably delayed."
"The directive on urban waste water treatment is an example of a directive that has been poorly applied."
"It was adopted in 1991 with the aim of protecting the environment against the effects of urban waste water and biodegradable waste water discharge from the food industry."
"When it was applied, the directive brought about a measured improvement in water quality."
"The Member States' main duty is to put in place systems for collecting and processing waste water and to respect a pre-established timetable."
"However, not only are some Member States delaying in passing on all the information required to carry out an objective assessment of this directive but, even worse, others are not communicating any information on this subject."
"This is absolutely unacceptable!"
"I therefore demand that the time the Member States take to do this should not increase, that all the information is passed onto the Commission, as stipulated in the directive which was adopted in a timely manner by the Council."
"I came out in favour of the Commission's launch of infringement procedures in cases where the criteria for identification of sensitive areas have not been respected or taken into account."
"- (NL) Candidate countries are keen to call attention to the way in which the city of Brussels treats its urban effluent and thereby conclude that environmental rules only apply on paper and not in practice."
"Of the 527 agglomerations comprising more than 150 000 inhabitants, 94 discharge their effluent unprocessed into the environment and 134 others provide insufficient information."
"More than 43% are therefore in default."
"The data for the reference date in 1998 is not yet available, and it is even unknown how many infringement procedures are pending at the European Court of Justice."
"All of this confirms that the EU is mainly an economic community which sets large multinational companies free from national rules that hinder their operations."
"Other matters receive far less attention, and useful rules remain hollow phrases."
"In this case, it is not irresponsible companies that are to blame but failing government."
"It is important, however, to identify the cause of this failure."
"Large cities have many problems and receive far too little funding from their national governments, which economise with a view to reducing taxes and enhancing the profitability of industry and the stability of the euro."
"This is why these cities fall into disrepair and are unable to carry out the necessary renovation works."
"This too could be clarified if we were to back the rapporteur in her just endeavours to secure openness."
"Industrial and domestic pollution has become the main cause of degradation of our European waterways, only 40% of which are attaining the quality objectives set according to different uses."
"To tackle this potentially harmful situation, the Council and Parliament reacted by adopting the so-called 'urban waste water treatment' directive in 1991."
"Like most of my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I condemn the fact that 11 years after its adoption and four years after the deadline for cities with a population equivalent of above 10 000 to be provided with collecting systems and waste water treatment plants, there are many Member States who still do not conform to this directive's legally binding timetable."
"I also regret the fact that the Committee on the Environment has not adopted one of the amendments that I tabled, namely a common sense amendment which explained the reasons why so many Member States have not yet applied this directive."
"It is probably because the very short deadlines imposed by Directive 91/271/EEC (six and a half years for water treatment in sensitive areas) did not take into account the situation of several large Member States' cities."
"These cities still did not have an urban waste water treatment plant in 1991 and also had to conform to other common European standards in the areas of the award of public contracts and studies into environmental effects."
"Need we point out that the average time limit for awarding public contracts in the sector is three years, need we also stress that a water treatment plant with a connection system for collecting sewage costs an average of EUR 400 million?"
"To sum up, a good piece of Community legislation is one which chooses between what is desirable and what is feasible."
"We must note that the drafting of the 'urban waste water treatment' directive has failed to adhere to this essential rule."
". (EL) The 'steel crisis' is proof most positive of the shortcomings of the market economy and neo-liberal system which the USA and the European Union are determined to impose on the world."
"It demonstrates yet again that the capitalist system is in too deep a state of crisis to respond to any measures to manage it, even the World Trade Organisation's 'rules of good conduct' for free trade and free competition."
"The United States has no hesitation in violating any agreements made in order to defend their interests."
"This crisis has once again brought the antagonism within the international imperialist system and the more general conflict between the centres of imperialism vying for hegemony to the surface."
"The American imperialist system has no hesitation in taking measures which hit the economy of the European imperialist system and the European imperialist system has no hesitation in hitting back, despite its amazing willingness to tread the same path and vie for its share of the spoils of military opportunism."
"The demands of the American trades union have clearly been used as a pretext for the decision by the Bush administration to impose customs tariffs, a decision taken on the back of the more general crisis to hit the capitalist economy after the worst year's international trading for 25 years and after a fall of 38% in American steel imports over the last three years."
"The workers stand to gain nothing from this wrangling."
"In the end, American workers will not escape restructuring and unemployment and European workers will not ward off the spectre of redundancies by running to the WTO."
"What the USA and the ?U are doing their best to save are the profits of the steel industries."
"But even if they manage to limit the fallout from the present crisis, another one will be along shortly."
"This is typical of social systems which have long run out of anything to offer society, and capitalism is one such system."
"The only way out is to overturn it, however difficult that may seem under present circumstances."
"Crises like the steel crisis bring new opportunities for action by the working classes; they can be used to rally the workers and they lay bare the ugly face of capitalism."
"The European Parliament resolution only skims the surface of the problem and tries to deal with it within liberalist parameters."
"It is interesting that the European Parliament resolution accuses the United States of failing to restructure the steel industry promptly, as the European Union did."
"In other words, it accuses it of failing to close enough companies and make enough workers redundant unlike, for example, the Greek steel industry."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Europe voted against the resolution."
"The attitude and decisions adopted by the US in order to shamefully protect its steel industry at the expense of European interests, perfectly illustrate that, beyond wonderful speeches and liberal statements, what now dominates the world is the law of the strongest. This is what George W. Bush is relying on in this case; take another look at the fable of the Wolf and the Lamb by Jean de la Fontaine."
"That is why Europe must take firm action using the legal means provided for within the framework of the WTO, but also using all the other available means of exerting pressure at a time when the United States continues to call on other shared aims in its fight against terrorism."
"This situation is proof of the true nature of American-style globalisation."
"It sums up the speeches on the benefits of free competition that is lacking in rules."
"It reassures those who believe that we need a political Europe that is capable of existing and also to influence the management of world affairs."
"- (NL) For years, the US has been the champion of free trade, insofar as this means that others have to open up their markets for American products without import restrictions."
"There is a continuous threat of trade wars if American products are subjected to requirements in terms of the environment and consumer protection."
"The EU has largely adopted this free trade ideology. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that this free trade too is subordinate to American self-interest and is only supported if it leads to the favouring of American companies."
"The leading group in America considers its own country to be the best in the world."
"Like the Soviet Union and China in the past, the US derive from this pretension the right to do everything they do not allow others to do."
"Accordingly, international impunity is demanded for American war criminals, unilateral threats are made to use nuclear weapons and European steel is banned from the American market by means of an import levy."
"One of the lessons the EU should draw from this is that free-trade ideology leads to accidents."
"Europe should focus more on economic self-sufficiency, in other words autarchy, rather than on promoting imports, exports, globalisation and growing mutual dependence on the US and Japan."
"This is the best way to steer clear of any trade wars and economic instability imported from outside Europe."
"Transatlantic relations are currently in turmoil."
"The root of the problem is the offensive of the US Government, which is using its military victory in Afghanistan to strengthen and consolidate its superpower."
"However, America's quest for global supremacy is also giving rise to clashes and tension amongst the ruling classes in countries at both the centre and the fringes of the globe."
"The current conflict concerning the tax introduced by the United States on steel imports is an obvious manifestation of this."
"American imperialism is willing to impose 'global deregulation', but does not rule out the use of protectionist measures when it feels its interests are threatened."
"I did not, however, vote for this joint resolution."
"The European Union's opposition is merely a way of supporting European multinationals in a ruthless economic war."
"Above all, we support workers throughout the world, including those in the United States."
"We do not support the interests of multinationals against other interests."
"The more the EU continues to 'combat' the United States, the more of their policy it adopts."
"Therefore, the 'Lisbon process', whose aim is to transform the EU into 'the most competitive economy in the world', seeks to erode, through liberalisation, privatisation and excessive commercialisation, the living conditions of the working population in Europe and in the Developing World."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"This recommendation is based on a realistic and modern vision of the European economy."
"The economic slowdown in the United States is having repercussions within the European Union."
"However, this fact alone cannot explain the weak results posted by a number of Member States."
"There are, in fact, domestic problems that must be resolved, and structural reforms are expected."
"All European consumers must be able to freely choose their service provider."
"Furthermore, an innovative competition policy, resisting all the dominant positions, is emerging within the European Union."
"This approach must be encouraged, particularly by involving all the parties concerned so that we can be more effective, both personally and collectively."
"This does not mean reforming against the actors, but to make these sectors develop in conjunction with them."
"It is also essential to take specific measures in the areas of education, training and research development if we wish to retain highly competent employees and ensure that our businesses are as competitive as possible."
"This report also proposes to increase the retirement age for workers who wish to remain active."
"Today's widespread practice of compulsory retirement is an enormous waste of skills, talent and experience."
"These experienced people can still fulfil worthwhile tasks in our businesses."
"Lastly, analysts show that the current economic slowdown could have been much more serious were it not for Monetary Union."
"Therefore, those who are now driven by concerns regarding their domestic policy and are advocating a return to the past, have got the wrong century, and are confusing personal interest with general interest."
". (EL) Yet again, faced with a Commission recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines, the European Parliament report has endorsed the anti-grass roots policies of the European Union which demolish the rights acquired by the workers for the sake of monopoly interests."
"Yet again, the workers are being called on to pay the price of the slump caused by antagonism between imperialist systems, the way in which the monopolies operate and act and the shameless goal of increasing the return on capital."
"The report goes overboard about stability and convergence programmes and coordinating the Member States' application of anti-grass roots policies ""which take into account the complex nature of the world recession""."
"Under pressure from the monopolies, taking political decisions which result in lower labour costs and national insurance contributions, circumventing collective agreements and working hours and introducing lower-paid, flexible forms of work are all applauded and re-tabled as proposals."
"The 'problem of Europe's aging population' is being used as a pretext for reforming pension systems or extending people's working lives by raising the retirement age and cutting pensions, that is, by phasing out the state's social security obligations and encouraging privatisation of the health and welfare sector."
"Dismantling the insurance system and arranging working times to suit employers by making part-time work and 'flexible' working arrangements the rule will simply create a huge army of employable people with no rights or entitlements, enslaved to the unaccountability of big business."
"Pressure to sell off the national silver is being stepped up, with the call for faster privatisation by liberalising the electricity, natural gas and transport sectors and privatising the utilities and liberalising services of general interest, never mind the impact on workers or consumers."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against this report, which secures a guaranteed level of poverty for the workers and maximum profits for big business, which is getting stronger and stronger and intends to demolish workers rights and make part-time work the rule."
"The workers will condemn and oppose these barbaric and inhumane policies by fighting to try and calm the impending storm and we shall be by their side."
"The report by the former trade unionist Mr Bruno Trentin begins with a guideline which has the merit of being perfectly clear at least: 'the priorities?should involve reducing labour costs'."
"It continues with incoherent proposals whereby we could reduce taxes and social security contributions, while at the same time ensuring 'that pensions and health services are fully maintained'."
"Due to a lack of understanding of the reasons behind the economic recovery of 1997-2001 and the recent economic downturn, the report proposes solutions, such as the strict application of the inapplicable Stability and Growth Pact, which can do nothing more than to aggravate the current recession."
"The report stresses efforts to promote training and R&D, as if, in the area of employment, spending on these could replace demands for salary increases and an overall reduction in working time."
"It dares to mention 'social cohesion' whilst the lower taxes and social security contributions that it recommends can lead to nothing more than the formation of inequalities."
"I therefore had no reservations in voting against this mediocre and hypocritical report which should bring shame upon its authors."
"From the outset, the title of this report clearly expresses its objective: to provide the EU with a harmonised taxation policy."
"It is disconcerting, therefore, that the Della Vedova report begins by making a sort of semi-sincere confession that tax policy must remain within the exclusive competence of the Member States whilst the rest of the text goes on to advise how the Union can go about acquiring the same prerogative."
"It is true that we have had a close shave."
"The text that was voted for in committee was a vast improvement on the proposal of the rapporteur, who perceived a European tax to be an opportunity to reaffirm the federal principle of European integration."
"The majority of Members of this House thought it was more prudent to delete this excess candour and replace it with a text which, in the end, hides behind a certain type of liberalism, recommending lower taxes before eventually demanding moving to the use of taxation policy instruments that are controlled by Community authorities, the Commission and Parliament itself."
"By inching its way along as usual, the House is making progress, admittedly, but in much the same way as a crab."
"And we have still only made half as much progress as we intended."
"The proposals regarding VAT are not bold enough."
"We should have, on the one hand, reaffirmed that each nation is sovereign in this area and, on the other hand, made broader proposals than those which aim to make NGOs exempt from paying VAT and to include, for example, all the cultural events staged by non profit-making associations."
"A report that clearly stated that tax policy is a matter for each nation and which recommended improved coordination between the Member States in this area would have received my vote."
"Unfortunately, the report contains nothing of this nature."
"- (NL) Nobody likes to pay taxes but, without taxes, our lives would be in chaos, and only the fittest would survive."
"Without taxes, there would be no universally available education, no health care, public transport or safety on the streets, and anyone suffering from long-term illness or unemployment would be condemned to a life of begging on the streets."
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has other priorities, and the Italian radical Della Vedova is a faithful supporter."
"He complains about the tax burden which, since 1970, has risen, on average, from 35% to 45% and hopes that tax competition between the Member States will lead to a tax cut for companies."
"Although he refers to the tax level as a domestic problem for every Member State, at the same time he pushes for companies to be able to choose their registered offices in a state where the tax burden is lowest."
"He then goes on to focus on indirect taxes, such as VAT, and deems direct taxes, such as income tax, to be an unfair barrier to income from labour."
"I agree with him that a tax on environmental pollution can be a viable alternative, but this will no longer be effective once the environment has become truly clean."
"The emphasis on VAT, on the other hand, means that everyone pays the same amount for inevitable basic expenses and, as such, it widens the income gap between the rich and the poor."
"This is why I reject his approach."
"The Della Vedova report on the EU's fiscal policy is an ill-assorted compilation of fiscal affirmations and claims."
"Some of these requirements also blatantly contradict the Treaty, which provides for unanimity in fiscal matters."
"For these reasons, I was forced to vote against the motion for a resolution."
". Paragraph 12 is inconsistent with the EPLP line that tobacco and alcohol excise duties should be harmonised upwards in order to achieve the social goal of reduced use and to indicate the strength of feeling held - that is, that you can tax for social reasons."
"We voted in favour of the report as a whole because we believe that the EU should, for example, be able to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights, something that requires the EU to be given legal personality."
"We believe that a change of this kind can, in itself, be made while retaining the existing decision-making models and institutional structure."
"We do not therefore believe that the three pillars which at present constitute the EC and the EU should be combined in a single pillar."
"The pillar structure reflects the political distinction made between supranational and intergovernmental areas of cooperation, and the fact that the pillar structure gives rise to a complicated legal situation is not a good enough reason for abolishing it."
"If there had been doubt regarding the content of the Carnero González report - which calls on the European Union to acquire a legal personality - this was removed by yesterday's debate."
"The speakers attacked with federalist zeal, thus demolishing all the precautionary comments that the rapporteur had made to prove that his reform was perfectly innocent."
"Mr Napolitano spoke of establishing a supranational entity."
"Mr Duff mentioned the need for the Union to become a fully contracting party on the international stage."
"Jo Leinen said that granting the Union a legal personality was essentially the final piece of the jigsaw of all the federalist proposals."
"And lastly, the Commission declared that this was an 'essential' reform, and that it would support the proposal."
"It is clear, therefore, that the aim of granting a legal personality to the European Union, as well as the Communities, is to create a competent new actor on the international stage, which will use all the opportunities provided by Article 24 of the TEU (particularly since its revision after the Nice Summit) to gradually remove from Member States the autonomy of their foreign policy."
"Europe would then have entered the era of the super-state, before the citizens have decided whether this is what they actually want."
"We believe, on the contrary, as we explained in the minority opinion attached to the report, that the European Union must remain a unique organisation of major and responsible States - in other words, major and responsible national democracies - which are organised in a network."
"It will be the work of the Convention coming together over the coming months to find the combination that best encourages voluntary synergy, without abolishing the freedom of choice of the people."
"I cannot vote in favour of Mr Carnero González' report for the following reason, among others:"
"I am in favour of intergovernmental cooperation, while the report is clearly supranational in character."
"The rapporteur's proposal that the EU be given legal personality is a threat to intergovernmental cooperation within the EU."
"Transforming the EU into a legal person would be one more step towards a European federation, and that is something I cannot support."
". The overwhelming message of this report is that the European Commission has neglected the fish processing sector."
"The sector is confronted with the impact of a whole host of EU legislation, from CFP management measures to hygiene and food safety, to the environment, and yet it is all too often ignored."
"The waste water directive is a prime example where the concerns of the processing sector were overlooked."
"I am therefore pleased that the Committee endorsed my amendments which emphasised that the impact of legislation should be fully assessed, and specifically, that the Commission should provide support for the development for water recycling systems, such as the one recently established by a processor in my own area in the north-east of Scotland."
"Greater attention needs to be paid to structural support."
"Processors have been hard hit by CFP management measures, from quota cuts to decommissioning, but received little or no assistance."
"Structural support should be positive, not just reacting to management measures, but being proactive in supporting the sector, promoting new technologies and encouraging effective marketing."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 13.38 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"We shall begin with the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"(B5-0146/2002) by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on Colombia;"
"(B5-0149/2002) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on Colombia;"
"(B5-0159/2002) by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the situation in Colombia;"
"(B5-0160/2002) by Mr Lipietz and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the kidnapping of Ingrid Betancourt and the breaking off of the peace process in Colombia;"
"(B5-0167/2002) by Mr Medina Ortega and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the breaking off of the peace process in Colombia;"
"(B5-0168/2002) by Mr Marset Campos and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on Colombia."
"Mr President, we are all bound to regret the breakdown of the peace process that President Pastrana pushed forwards with so much political courage at the beginning of his mandate."
"I must confess, Mr President, that having taken part, together with other Members of this House, in a meeting in Los Pozos with 'Tirofijo' and the leadership of FARC, this decision comes as no surprise to me."
"On that occasion we begged for the release of the European Union citizens kidnapped by FARC and also, at the request of his wife and daughter, of a Colombian senator who was ill."
"Needless to say, we achieved nothing."
"Today, Mr President, this Parliament must raise its voice once again to condemn all the murders, including the recent murder of senator Marta Catalina Daniels, all the violations of human rights in Colombia and to demand that FARC releases all the people it has kidnapped, including the Presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt."
"Our Parliament has always demonstrated its commitment to the way of peace and of dialogue to solve the conflict, but in the knowledge that dialogue must be sought by both parties and that a society cannot remain forever deaf, dumb and blind to violence."
"Last Sunday, Colombian society demonstrated civil courage and democratic maturity."
"This is why, Mr President, today more than ever and on the eve of the forthcoming Presidential elections, the international community and this Parliament and the European Union in general must continue to show solidarity and their support for Colombia's legitimate government, for the entire spectrum of democratic forces and of civil society, with the demand, as always, that in order to overcome the serious problems affecting the country we must insist on the way of peace, harmony, reconciliation, justice and dialogue, and insist that the problems cannot be overcome by violence, because Colombian society is crying out for peace."
"To conclude, Mr President, I feel that this Parliament should stand side by side with Colombia in this crucial exercise of the Presidential elections."
"Mr President, once again we are talking about Colombia, a dearly loved country on the American continent but regrettably, once again, we are doing so because of the negative issues affecting it."
"If we study recent events in Colombia, we generally see a discouraging and tragic picture, in which the human rights situation leaves much to be desired."
"Nevertheless, we are optimists and must have faith and hope in the way of negotiation and of dialogue and in respect for tolerance, in order to achieve peace in Colombia once and for all."
"Perhaps it would be appropriate on this occasion to mention an illustrious European, the German naturalist, Alexander von Humboldt, who, exactly 200 years ago, travelled to that part of the world and established the bases for cooperation between peoples and the defence of human rights."
"Mr President, I can actually speak before Mrs Auroi, in order to give her time to arrive."
"Various political groups tabled motions for resolutions and then we agreed on a joint motion for a resolution, that should now - I believe - have the support of most of the House."
"As previous speakers have said, the situation in Colombia is a painful issue for all of us, because we had great hopes for the successful conclusion of the peace process."
"President Pastrana has dedicated his mandate almost entirely to these efforts, with a series of very generous concessions to the guerrilla organisations: he has opened negotiations, both with FARC and the ELN and yet has achieved little."
"In specific terms, he has given FARC a territory the size of Switzerland, an entire enclave in which they can travel with absolute freedom, and lastly, when it still looked as though negotiations might break down, President Pastrana even extended the agreements or negotiations, in an attempt to conclude an agreement."
"During this extension phase, FARC launched a campaign of kidnappings and murders, which culminated in the murder of Senator Daniels and the kidnapping of a presidential candidate, Mrs Ingrid Betancourt."
"At the same time, FARC is continuing its extortion activities, claiming a supposed right to impose taxes on drug-trafficking organisations, which I believe has completely stripped it of any legitimacy, because an organisation that takes part in acts of gratuitous violence and which, furthermore, tries to make money out of drugs trafficking, ultimately loses any basis for legitimacy."
"At the moment, therefore, we are rather disillusioned and feel a degree of despair, although this does not mean that we are going to give up on the possibility that an agreement can be reached."
"In other words, the first aspect is to state that FARC has failed to meet its commitments and has all but abandoned the peace process; it has made it impossible for the government to negotiate, because you cannot negotiate with killers and kidnappers."
"On the other hand, it is necessary to try to restart the peace process and to leave the door open for negotiations."
"We in the European Union have always supported this process of negotiation, including practical proposals, designed to alleviate some of the specific social problems."
"It has become clear that the definitive solution to the problem of Colombia does not simply involve an end to the violence, but that we must get to the root of the social and economic problems that are causing this."
"In order to reach that point, however, peace must first be achieved on the ground."
"I do not know at the moment whether it is possible to add a little trust and calm to the situation, but I would say that the European Union has - where the problem of Colombia is concerned - the advantage of distance and, furthermore, the willingness it has always shown to help Colombia with its exports, for example, in a range of key sectors."
"Our resolution aims, therefore, on the one hand, to illustrate the responsibility of those who have caused the breakdown of the peace process and, on the other, to leave the door to negotiation open and to call on the European institutions to patiently continue with this lengthy and complicated task, by providing the aid necessary to make this process easier and, of course, by not giving in to despair, and instead by trusting that, ultimately, there will be a return to reason and to the negotiating table."
"I believe that the European institutions can work together in this aspect, and we hope that the Commission can indeed help to resolve this deadly and longstanding conflict."
"Mr President, I shall begin by reading a very short extract from the document that we were given today in the delegation to Central America, and I say 'read it', because I do not want anyone to believe that I am giving it my own interpretation."
"The interventions I have heard so far strike me as somewhat lacking in balance."
"I shall read the words of the non-governmental human rights organisation 'Human Rights Watch': 'The human rights situation clearly deteriorated in the course of last year."
"In the first ten months of the year, the office of the Public Advocate recorded 92 massacres, which they defined as the killing of three or more people at the same place and at the same time."
"Most were linked to paramilitary groups, followed by guerrillas."
"The national epidemic of kidnappings, half of which were committed by guerrillas, gave no signs of abating.?"
"The report also states that two million Colombians have been displaced and that this year, more people than ever before - 300 000 - have been displaced."
"It also states that human rights workers, trade unionists, journalists, government investigators and community leaders continue to be murdered because of their work."
"Mr President, we will be voting on a resolution today."
"I prefer the resolution we voted for last year, which I felt was more balanced, because it noted and clearly condemned the ongoing fumigation of crops and the fact that alternative crops were not being promoted to prevent human disease and the constant attacks on biodiversity."
"Last year's resolution also stated that the European Union should adopt a different, non-militaristic position, which supports the defence of human rights, dialogue and peace."
"We repeat this demand today and I agree with my fellow Members that this should be done."
"This resolution also condemned the fact that, since 60% of Colombians live on less than one dollar per day, it is very hard to achieve dialogue, agreements, or peace."
"This is why, Mr President, I felt that some balance needed to be added to the previous interventions, although I agree with what most of my fellow Members have to say."
"But it was necessary to mention other parties involved in the war in Colombia, who exert an enormous influence in the absence of peace."
"Mr President, you will understand that, as a member of the Greens, it is particularly moving to be presenting this resolution as co-author, since Ingrid Bétancour is still currently being detained by members of the FARC, the violent paramilitary gang which has previously carried out assassinations of trade unionists or representatives of social movements from Colombian society."
"My fellow Members have reiterated how much the Colombian people need peace and tranquillity, rather than this type of action."
"Today, we still do not have any news regarding Mrs Bétancour's situation which could put our minds at rest."
"The governments involved and the Commission must therefore try to obtain some information and assist in Mrs Bétancour's release."
"But apart from this, as other speakers have said, we must welcome the statement by President Pastrana, who stated that he wanted to step up his fight against this type of action and provide effective guarantees for the security of the civil society in Colombia."
"It is perfectly clear that, if President Pastrana leaves the door to negotiations open, then these negotiations must relate to the respect of human rights and restoring order in Colombia so that genuine democracy can finally be established in this country."
"The European Union must therefore provide greater support for cooperation efforts, which will improve the human rights situation, and it must ensure that the European aid achieves its objective, in other words to assist civil society in Colombia."
"Mr President, it is difficult for any of us in this House to comprehend why one human being should kill another, and yet in Colombia members of guerrilla and paramilitary groups kill each other and thousands of civilians without qualms, and in some cases with relish."
"This resulted in over 400 massacres in 1999."
"Sadly, for those 400 massacres committed by the government, paramilitary groups and guerrilla groups, not one person was brought to trial."
"The ordinary people of Colombia live and suffer in an environment of oppression caused not only by these paramilitary and guerrilla groups, but often at the hands of a government which is either unwilling or unable to protect them."
"As a body that has consistently upheld fundamental human rights and social justice, we need to do what we can to contribute towards bringing peace to a country that has been living under the horrors of civil war for over four decades."
"In our individual Member States, and collectively as the European Union, we must exert whatever pressure we can to bring the government and FARC back to the negotiating table, under a real ceasefire agreement genuinely observed by all parties to the conflict."
"We must also support those groups working for peace within Colombia, which have provided a safe haven for civilians but have recently been under attack from the AUC and FARC."
"Additionally we must persuade the United States to fund peace initiatives rather than simply giving more money to the Colombian Government for military and drug eradication purposes."
"The people of Colombia are tired of the fighting."
"We, as a democratically elected forum, must use our moral authority to help the people of Colombia in their struggle to bring to an end the conflict in their country."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the basic question is, are we going to stick to the peace process set up between the Colombian Government and the guerrillas or are we going to try and resolve the problem by some other means and, if we try to resolve it by some other means, exactly what means are we going to use?"
"The only way forward we can accept is the peace process which, apart from anything else, is combined with changes urgently needed to Colombian society if it is to avoid going down the same road as Argentina."
"The decision by President Pastrana is a decision to condone violence."
"At the same time, apart from anything else, it legitimises action by the paramilitary groups which have murdered so many people in Colombia."
"Unfortunately, the European Union, together with the United States, is supporting President Pastrana, meaning that it is supporting violence."
"However, as you and I well know, ladies and gentlemen, violence begets violence, and more violence and yet more violence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares Parliament's concern about the current situation in Columbia and also shares the view expressed in the resolution, that negotiations are the only feasible way of helping to resolve the long-standing conflict in Columbia."
"This position has been expressed in numerous statements."
"The direct role which the individual Member States have played in this respect also deserves recognition here."
"The Commission also welcomes the proposed support for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota."
"We have already helped here and we shall continue to offer our help in the future."
"The Commission is also supporting the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Colombia."
"The Commission is standing by its commitment to the peace process, hence Commissioner Patten and the Columbian foreign secretary recently signed an agreement on financing initial peace work."
"We intend to continue supporting Columbian civil society in its efforts to establish peace through regional development and peace programmes."
"The Commission is currently examining in which specific areas projects can be funded."
"At the same time, we are offering the victims of the conflict our direct support in the form of humanitarian aid, which is being distributed by ECHO and non-governmental organisations."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"(B5-0132/2002) by Mr Watson and others, on behalf of the Group of the European, Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on the observer status of Taiwan in the WHO;"
"(B5-0138/2002) by Mrs Frassoni and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on the observer status of Taiwan at the May 2002 annual meeting of the World Health Organisation in Geneva;"
"(B5-0147/2002) by Mr Collins, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the observer status of Taiwan in the WHO;"
"(B5-0150/2002) by Mrs Langenhagen and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the observer status of Taiwan at the May 2002 annual meeting of the World Health Organisation in Geneva."
"Mr President, this debate is about Taiwan and the WHO, and all the political groups are agreed that we wish to give Taiwan the opportunity to participate as an observer at the Geneva Summit in a few weeks' time."
"Taiwan is a country with a very ambitious public health programme, and its people are among those with the longest average life span in Asia."
"Infant mortality is low, and many of the diseases that a large number of countries in the world are still combating, such as cholera, chickenpox and malaria, have been eradicated."
"A delegation from the Taiwanese health ministry visited us here in Strasbourg during the last part-session, and we had the opportunity then to hear a little about Taiwan's experience."
"Many valuable lessons have been learned in Taiwan, and there is a great willingness to be of help, both economically and in terms of sharing knowledge."
"We know that the WHO is in great need of financial aid."
"I also want to say something about Taiwan as a political entity."
"My political group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, supports democratic developments in Taiwan."
"We view what has been happening there with a very great deal of sympathy and support the Taiwanese people's right to decide their own future."
"A few months ago, we invited President Chen Shui-bian here to award him the Liberal International Freedom Prize, but the French authorities would not give him a visa."
"We then tried to invite him to Belgium, and the Belgium authorities would not give him a visa either."
"Instead, they referred to an EU agreement not to invite the President of Taiwan, because to do so would threaten relations with China."
"Last week, we invited him to Sweden under a private arrangement, and he was not given a visa for my country either."
"When I recently investigated what rules apply, I learned that there is no such agreement at EU level."
"It would be illuminating to be told what really applies."
"I think it is disgusting to grovel in this way to the Chinese dictatorship."
"It should go without saying that a democratically elected leader should be given a visa when, for example, he receives an invitation from his Liberal colleagues."
"Mr President, I concur with the previous speaker; 23 million people live in a democracy in Taiwan, an established democracy, and Taiwan is by no means a country which causes us continual headaches."
"Nonetheless, it is the topic of this urgent debate."
"These 23 million people and their democratic society are excluded from international organisations."
"This is not a country which is first and foremost an aid beneficiary; it is a country which actively supports international organisations."
"Taiwan has been actively involved in the WHO."
"It would be a mistake if this country were unable to join the international community, which is why we could make a start by giving it observer status and letting it work with other international organisations in the future."
"Perhaps there is some sort of half-way status which Taiwan could be granted. My question to the Commission is, are you prepared to support Parliament here?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is not just a political and economic success story; we have also achieved health standards which many other countries can only dream of."
"A good, healthy constitution is important to everyone here on earth, but it is only through access to information and medical care that public health can be improved."
"And there is much that can only be done jointly and in synergy."
"I am thinking, for example, of infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and others."
"The World Health Organisation and its current complement of 199 members have nailed their colours to the mast and are committed to improving health throughout the world."
"Health is a valuable commodity which everyone has the right to enjoy, which is why I take the view that, in an area which affects everyone, no one who wants to help improve the welfare of people in their own and other countries should be excluded."
"Taiwan has expressed a desire to help the WHO, both financially and technically, which is why I think there is not just good cause, it is imperative that Taiwan be granted observer status at the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly."
"I have first hand experience of the political problems and tensions affecting Taiwan and, as in most cases, it is not just one side which is to blame."
"But I am firmly convinced that we should not be led by political differences to stop a country joining international efforts in the health sector and I therefore call on the House to support this joint resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission does, in principle, support Taiwanese efforts, and not just in the area under debate; it supports all its efforts to become involved in the work of international agencies and organisations, provided that there are sufficient economic or other relevant grounds for such involvement."
"However, its involvement must be compatible with the status of Taiwan and the EU one China policy."
"We pushed for Taiwan's membership of the WTO and, together with the United States, we helped oil the wheels of its accession."
"We have also supported Taiwan's involvement in several international organisations, including the OECD, its involvement in the Kyoto agreement on simplified, harmonised customs procedures and its involvement in several international fisheries organisations."
"We are well aware of what Taiwan has achieved in the health sector and its increasing commitment in international aid and health operations, which is why we are in favour of extending contacts between Taiwan and the World Health Organisation, provided that the rules of the WHO so allow."
"Unfortunately, however, it looks as if Taiwan does not meet the criteria set out in the WHO constitution for membership of the organisation, because only states can join."
"There is some legal uncertainty as to whether the WHO rules would allow Taiwan observer status at the World Health Assembly."
"We and the Member States shall be considering the legal situation in order to formulate a suitable position in the run-up to and at the forthcoming World Health Assembly in May."
"We are also prepared, with the Member States, to re-examine the possibility of Taiwanese involvement in the work of the WHO in some other form, mainly through non-governmental channels, provided that any such involvement complies with the relevant WHO rules."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"Zimbabwe"

"(B5-0162/2002) by Mrs Napoletano and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on Tunisia;"
"(B5-0171/2002) by Mrs Boudjenah and Mrs Eriksson, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on human rights in Tunisia and the case of Mr Hamma Hammami."
"Zimbabwe"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, initial indications of the election result in Zimbabwe seem to point to a majority for President Mugabe. This was to be expected."
"No effort has been spared to achieve this result, although the majority was smaller than anticipated."
"Nevertheless, I see this as a moral victory for the opposition, which itself uses the term 'stolen elections'."
"Following the stolen elections in Chad and the rigged elections in Zambia, this is the third round of elections which, with the best will in the world, cannot be considered free and fair according to international standards, no matter how moderate a view some other African countries, for reasons probably known only to themselves, still take."
"After all, the writing was on the wall: 4.5 million voters expected and 7.5 million ballots printed so as to be prepared for every eventuality; too few polling stations to enable everyone to vote properly; and the inevitable confusion about who had to vote where, since different elections needed to be held for different levels on the same day but at different locations."
"These are only the technicalities which typify Mr Mugabe's craftiness."
"More important was the terror which preceded this, the obstructions put in place by the ruling elite in order to prevent the opposition from meeting, the monopoly of the state channels, the prevention of journalists from doing their job, the obstacles placed in the way of observers, the incidents of torture and the abductions, including even the abduction of important union leaders. The list goes on."
"Even the ploy involving the distribution of corn, far away from the polling stations, was predicted by the opposition."
"The performance about re-opening the polling stations was the icing on the cake, and yet we need to ask ourselves: what now?"
"The elections were not conducted freely and fairly, but do we need to condemn them altogether?"
"The elections in Zambia and Chad were not free and fair either."
"However, we do need to maintain the sanctions."
"I am not in favour of extending these, but they do need to be applied and monitored."
"I do call for negotiations between the members of the majority and the opposition, for the country is anxious about a civil war."
"Finally, I hope that a government of national unity, involving the opposition, will be set up."
"The generation of independence fighters have belied their own nature."
"The elections in Zimbabwe were an incredible farce, even by African standards."
"Mr Mugabe made every effort to stay in power, using extremely brutal means."
"Nothing was too extreme for the purpose of eliminating his opponents: violence, intimidation, murder, large-scale arrests and accusations of high treason."
"Election laws were changed at the last minute."
"There were selectively too few ballot stations, identity cards were seized, the media was not allowed to do its job and the observation of the elections was a joke."
"Politically blind South African observers made absolute fools of themselves by declaring that the elections had been conducted fairly and freely."
"Mugabe wants - by hook or by crook - to pursue his ill-fated policy which has led Zimbabwe to the brink of starvation, where 80% of the population live beneath the poverty line and 60% are unemployed."
"Tougher sanctions must be used in order even further to isolate Mugabe internationally."
"We should not punish the population for the wrong-doings of its leader."
"What is the scope for tougher sanctions, according to the Commissioner?"
"What will the Commission propose to the European Council in Barcelona?"
"Unfortunately, democracy in Africa often leaves a great deal to be desired."
"African solidarity with the dictator Mugabe is sadly a very bad omen."
"This is why we must focus our political efforts not only on Zimbabwe, but also on the other countries in that region."
"South Africa receives a great deal of aid from Europe but is unconcerned about the justified criticism levelled at its neighbour."
"I pity Africa, I pity the population that has to suffer so much at the hands of incompetent, power-crazed and corrupt leaders."
"When will we finally have a generation of democratic leaders in Africa?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would certainly appear that Mugabe has won the elections."
"I can still remember electoral victories claimed by presidents who were very soon overtaken, and were very soon presidents no more."
"I do not wish to draw any direct parallels, but it seems to me that he should not be too quick to celebrate his victory over his opponents."
"Especially as the elections were held under the worst possible conditions, with intimidation, police action against members and supporters of the opposition and so on."
"What saddens me is not just the situation in Zimbabwe itself, but the fact that numerous African Heads of State and Government and President Mugabe are indirectly providing a shield, even as they acknowledge his election victory."
"Perhaps this hides the fear of more neo-colonialism on the part of Europe or the United States of America and other countries."
"That certain parties may be entertaining such thoughts is, of course, no concern of ours."
"It may be the case, but it is not the policy of the European Union."
"What concerns us is the people who are starving there, who are suffering repression there."
"A few days ago, I was on a jury which awarded a prize to the Nobel prize-winner Amartya Sen. This man has stated time and again that democracy and development go hand in glove and cannot be separated."
"Which is why I think that the European Union should do everything it can to create democracy and the conditions for economic development here too."
"We, by which I mean everyone from the European Union due to attend the session of the ACP/EU joint parliamentary assembly in Cape Town, shall no doubt be addressing these concerns."
"Most importantly, we must call on South Africa to do proper justice to its hugely important role in southern Africa."
"Unfortunately, we shall also have to step up sanctions, despite the economic difficulties."
"But, and I say it again, if his African neighbours were to work with the European Union in taking against this dictatorship, success would come quickly and we could really help the people in this sorely afflicted country."
"Mr President, between 2000 and 2001, this Parliament tabled and adopted more than six motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe and today, after last weekend's elections, we are continuing to call for the rule of law and democracy to be re-established, for the process of land reform, which remains an unsettled issue, to be started and for the continuing land occupations to cease."
"It was clear that, out of 15 000 independent observers, only some were given accreditation, that restrictions were imposed on the representative of the European Union and on the opposition and the European Union, therefore, considers that fraud clearly took place."
"And as is so often the case, Mr President, it is the people that are suffering as a result of this situation, with more than 550 000 malnourished and more than 80% living below the poverty line, with the health and education systems collapsing and with more than 2 000 people dying every week of AIDS."
"This situation will only get worse unless we continue to put pressure on the Zimbabwean Government and sanctions are imposed and the only way we can contribute to democratic change is by helping the people, whilst at the same time exerting pressure on the government."
"Mr President, in this seriously flawed presidential election, we have good grounds for believing that Mugabe in reality lost the vote, but merely contrived to win the count."
"He will now be able to have his foot on the neck of the Zimbabwean people for another six years."
"It represents a new low for democracy in Zimbabwe and a disaster not just for Zimbabwe, but for the whole of Southern Africa."
"Mugabe personifies all the most negative strains in African development: corrupt and authoritarian power with state leaders lining their pockets at the expense of the people, racial division, the exploitation of envy, political violence and economic backwardness."
"Zimbabwe is a beautiful and once prosperous country with the potential to be the bread basket for the region."
"Instead, the economy is in chaos, with rampant inflation and unemployment and half a million of its people living on the edge of starvation, sustained only by world food aid."
"Mugabe's re-election will seriously exacerbate all of these problems."
"I have to say that Mugabe realised that his game might be up some two years ago, ZANU-PF came close to losing the general election; and that is why for the past two years - not just the past two weeks - he has been trying to fix the political system in his favour by a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation against anyone who opposed him."
"This Parliament should pay tribute to Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC activists and all those who have had the courage to stand up to Mugabe for all this time."
"I have to say it is a pity that the international community took so long to wake up to the situation in Zimbabwe and that the European Union waited until the eleventh hour before imposing targeted sanctions."
"At least we in this Parliament can hold our heads up. We have been active throughout the last two years."
"The attitude of African countries has been particularly disappointing."
"We always felt that South Africa, in particular, held the key to restoring genuine democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe."
"However, South Africa's leaders were found wanting."
"They could not find it in their consciences to condemn what they perhaps saw as one of their liberation brothers."
"What a pity for the people of Zimbabwe - all the people of Zimbabwe."
"At least the Southern African Development Community election observer mission has felt able to recognise in its announcement yesterday that: 'the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the norms and standards for elections in the SADC region'."
"What they mean, I think, Mr President, is that the election was clearly rigged."
"Certainly, that is the opinion of the few other international observers that remained."
"How else do we explain, for instance, the bizarre declaration that turnout in the city areas loyal to Tsvangirai was low, while in the ZANU-PF rural strongholds, it was remarkably high?"
"How else do we explain the missing ballot boxes which suddenly turn up stuffed up with Mugabe votes?"
"The international community must maintain its resolve. It must not recognise the legitimacy of this election result."
"There must be an intensification of the hunt for looted assets held overseas by Mugabe and his cronies."
"There should be an extension of the EU blacklist, and we need to take further tough measures."
"South Africa must begin to show leadership and demonstrate that it is committed to democratic principles in the region."
"Our aim must be to help restore democracy, human rights and the rule of law to Zimbabwe and assist in the process of economic progress there."
"Our tough resolution today is a contribution to this, and I hope the Council and the Commission will listen to us."
"Mr President, the elections in Zimbabwe are a democratic joke."
"The opposition's election workers have been threatened, persecuted, imprisoned and killed."
"Freedom of expression is non-existent."
"Many Zimbabweans queued for hours and were still not allowed to vote."
"Mr Mugabe has broken promise after promise and driven his country into the ground."
"Under his leadership, Zimbabwe, a country with fantastic potential, has headed straight for the abyss."
"It is worrying that so many African leaders have tried to explain away what has been happening in Zimbabwe and maintained that the elections were fair."
"I assume that the Foreign Ministers and the Commission will discuss Zimbabwe in Barcelona and decide upon suitable, wider sanctions and a strategy to involve the whole region."
"A lot of pressure must be exerted upon South Africa."
"In no way can we recognise these elections as fair."
"We waited far too long before taking action against Zimbabwe."
"We hoped and believed."
"Our former colleague, Mr Schori, had to be thrown out of the country before the sanctions were introduced."
"We must not betray those who are fighting for democracy in Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, as was to be expected, on 1 April, Zimbabwe's current president, Robert Mugabe, will be sworn in as Head of State for another six years."
"In my country, the Netherlands, 1 April is often associated with jokes."
"If only that applied to the people of Zimbabwe."
"In actual fact, the extension of Mugabe's term of office is a bitter reality."
"It is based on the official result of last weekend's extended presidential elections, which was published yesterday."
"The run-up to, as well as the course of, these elections is captured neatly in Zimbabwe as 'flee and fear elections'."
"In short, these Zimbabwean presidential elections were neither free nor fair."
"The mere fact that many ballot stations are used as torture centres at night, where Mugabe's uninhibited militia torture and humiliate political opponents, speaks volumes."
"This abhorrent fact marks out the sinister context of Mugabe's ruthless campaign to stay in power."
"It is completely understandable why Mugabe's main rival, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, has rejected the election result as nothing but voter deception."
"In this extremely difficult situation, what Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, needs most of all is level-headedness and wisdom."
"He is reportedly looking for legal means to fight and revoke the official election result."
"Tsvangirai and his men are certainly not seeking confrontation, according to their own sources."
"Given the desolate political and socio-economic situation to which Mugabe's thirst for power has led Zimbabwe, this attitude on the part of the Zimbabwean opposition deserves the support of the Council and the Commission. For an escalation into civil war will suck the country deeper into the quagmire."
"Meanwhile, I would urge the Council and the Commission to join forces with the US administration in order to give Mugabe's regime an even stronger international warning."
"At the same time, we must consider how we can continue to bolster the constructive forces in Zimbabwe."
"Those Western reactions to Mugabe's disputable re-election which I have noted to date elicit this expectation."
"This is so unlike some African opinions which claim the elections to be 'free and fair on the whole'."
"If this is truly the regional, political benchmark, then southern Africa is directly on course for instability."
"Consequently, a European appeal to the South African authorities, in particular, is just as much called for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, obstruction by the government notwithstanding, the European Union was able to follow the elections in Zimbabwe very closely and I should like to start by expressing my immense admiration of numerous people in Zimbabwe for their civil courage and for standing by their democratic convictions under such difficult circumstances."
"The European Union has been observing events in Zimbabwe with growing concern."
"Misgivings about the electoral process which the European Union voiced when Article 96 still applied have proven to be wholly justified."
"I expect the Heads of Government will discuss this issue in Barcelona and that the European Union will be quick to make a statement on this."
"Most of the election observers have come to the conclusion that the elections did not reflect the will of people of Zimbabwe and list a whole range of shortcomings in the election process."
"However, we can emphasise that, however disappointing the outcome of these elections, the main point is that the international community has turned its attention to Zimbabwe and is doing everything it can to contain the crisis there."
"A broad show of force would have serious, mainly regional repercussions."
"In the short term, South Africa would face a refugee crisis and, in the long term, any such crisis might jeopardise regional prospects for economic growth and sustainable development, all against a backdrop of a serious food shortage."
"The Commission, together with other partners, will be giving humanitarian requirements a high priority."
"It is also extremely important for us to work with the SADC governments and the ACP countries in order to find a common basis for overcoming the crisis in Zimbabwe."
"The European Union is planning to send a high-level troika in the near future, to discuss our misgivings about Zimbabwe with our SADC partners on the basis of our common commitment to the rule of law and democracy."
"I trust that the European Parliament will be able to play an important role here."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, as a neighbouring state, Moldavia is a sort of foster child to us."
"We have long hoped that, even with a Communist regime, this country would stick to economic development and the road towards the European Union."
"That hope has now been dashed and the Communist government knew that it was playing with fire when it introduced the Russian language and made it compulsory to teach a Stalinist slant on history."
"Language and culture have already sparked one military conflict in this country, which was only quelled within a few days thanks to a broad social compromise, with stability being established in the country through long-term action by the OSCE."
"The government has now destroyed all that, and in one of the poorest countries in Europe."
"I think it is wrong that the government is now trying to keep dragging out excuses."
"We have seen this over the last few days, with the government maintaining that others are responsible for the political crisis."
"It is responsible because it has tried to revoke this compromise, in one of the poorest countries in Europe."
"If this country now falls into political crisis, just when it is on the verge of becoming a neighbouring country, it will also affect us, which is why I think the government urgently needs to give in, reverse these decisions and do something about creating economic and political stability in this country."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to apologise for not participating in the debate earlier on account of some sad events with my stagiaire."
"I am satisfied that we are finally taking the initiative and discussing Moldova."
"The Liberal Group tried to do this back in January."
"Everything that Mrs Schröder said is true."
"We have before us a very difficult situation which could lead to developments similar to those in Belarus."
"We must be clear-sighted and see that it is Vladimir Voranin who has stopped economic reforms."
"These events have led to a suspension of funding from the international institutions."
"We know the means used to turn Moldova eastwards and to create problems with Romania."
"For instance the Moldovan Government refused to allow the people to set up an Orthodox community attached to the Romanian Orthodox Church."
"This has been condemned as contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Transdniestria does not need mentioning further; we know about it and the present attitude of the government is not helping to solve the problem there."
"The Christian Democrat party has been mentioned."
"What has been said over the last few days in the Russian Duma, which has accused Romania of interference, is worrying. What has been said in the Russian Duma is not accurate."
"We now have a situation where a Romanian diplomat has been declared persona non grata. This is creating a good deal of tension."
"Parliament and the Commission need to focus much more on Moldova for the reasons mentioned by Mrs Schröder."
"We must avoid being confronted with a new Belarus."
"We need intelligent sanctions, intelligent measures, because it is such a poor country."
"Those of you who have been to that country know that the children in Moldova are the worst off in Europe."
"Mr President, I agree with the two previous speakers, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs Thors."
"It is time that the European Parliament took an active interest in Europe's poorest country."
"The people of Moldavia have, for a long time, suffered not only poverty but also exploitation."
"For example, tens of thousands of women have suffered degradation within the so-called sex industry in Western Europe."
"I am personally acquainted with Iurie Rosca, Party Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, the largest opposition party in Moldavia, as well as with the deputy chairman, Vlad Cubreacov."
"In common with the party's general secretary, Stefan Secareanu, who is mentioned in our resolution today, they are exposed to attacks whereby the Communist government headed by President Veronin is attempting to revoke their political immunity."
"I wish to protest against the fact that, not long ago, the Justice Minister, who is also from the dominant Communist Party in Moldavia, suspended the political and financial activities of the Christian Democrats, who at present are in practice the only real opposition party in the country."
"Those who are standing up for a multiparty system and for democracy in Moldavia deserve our esteem and encouragement."
"The Christian Democrats have taken fundamental issues as their basic themes, including language, culture, schooling and the country's Western democratic leanings, something which has aroused the anger of the Communists."
"I also wish to protest against the fact that the Bessarabian Orthodox Church in Moldavia is not allowed to operate freely."
"Moldavia is a poor country in material terms."
"We do not want it also to become poor in terms of democracy."
"We have a big responsibility for Moldavia."
"When, after the elections a year ago, a Communist government took up office in Moldavia, it was, of course, only a matter of time before that country was the subject of discussion in this Parliament, and that day has now come."
"I would have preferred us to use our direct contacts with the parliament in order to raise a few issues which would possibly be the topics of debate at a later date, but I understand that some groups want to discuss this today."
"It seems like a good idea to me."
"It is important for the European Union to devote more attention to what is already considered Europe's poorest country."
"A country riddled with problems, not only political problems, but also major social problems including those involving poverty, health care and the care of seriously disadvantaged children."
"Precisely in a situation of this kind, it is, of course, very frustrating that it is the government that should be encouraging these contradictions in a country that is, in fact, disoriented, that is unable to choose between the East and the West, a country that is rather divided."
"What struck me was that the recent protests were not only against the government but also mainly in favour of Europe, and this shows how the contradictions are evolving in that country."
"In my view, the government has made a huge mistake by presenting controversial proposals which, precisely in the areas of language and the teaching of history, have caused a great stir."
"Fortunately, the government has since realised that things are not that simple and has retracted a number of these measures, partly under pressure from the loud protest from outside Moldavia."
"Today, too, we must stress that the government should realise that it should stop interfering with, and sabotaging, the opposition."
"A warning has been issued about lifting the immunity of certain politicians. This is not acceptable, in my view."
"The opposition must be left alone, reflecting the dignified manner in which the opposition protested against the government measures."
"What should be avoided at all costs in that country is a situation in which one group tries to force the other in a certain direction, either the direction of Russia or that of Europe."
"This is something on which the people themselves must be able to decide in their own time and in a democratic climate."
"I already mentioned that this debate is also an opportunity to say that the European Union should do more."
"I have understood that the Commission is looking into the possibility of granting more direct aid to the people in the country itself. By aid, I mean health care, social development and such like."
"In my view, we can, above all, ask the government and all the people in Moldavia to create a situation in that country in which the international community can operate more effectively, for we are often very hampered in what we want to do there."
"Finally, it is important in my opinion to urge the countries in that region to contribute to Moldova's stability and to help find a solution to the problem involving Transdniestria, for that is also a heavy burden resting on Moldova. It is an issue on which Romania and Russia should exercise restraint, in my view, but to which the European Union in particular, together with the OSCE, should look to find a solution."
"Mr President, Moldavia is a wretchedly poor country, it is true; but culturally it is a rich, beautiful country to the east of central Europe, linking the crisis-stricken region of the Balkans with the crisis-stricken region on the Black Sea and in the Caucasus."
"That alone shows just how important this tiny country is for us in the European Union, quite apart from the fact, as Mrs Schroedter rightly pointed out, that it will border on the European Union once Romania accedes and, hopefully, will itself one day become part of the European Union."
"Nor should we forget why Moldavia went down the terrible road which it has had to endure over the last few decades."
"Moldavia was the victim of the Hitler/Stalin pact and, for decades afterwards, it was plundered as a European outpost of the Soviet Union."
"With such a history, Moldavia does not have the strength to get back on its own feet and, as one speaker rightly said, what we have here is a very dangerous crisis waiting to happen."
"On one side, Russia is directly involved via Transdniestria or the so-called Dniester Republic which, from Russia's point of view, is a sort of advance guard of nationalistic and militaristic circles in Europe while, on the other side, it has cultural and historic links with Romania, and it will become a dangerous bone of contention between an EU candidate country on one side and the European Union's most powerful neighbour on the other, unless we do everything we can to stabilise this country, by which I mean we must stand up for human rights, for the rights of our Christian democrat and other counterparts in the Moldavian Parliament who are under attack, we must stand up against neo-colonialist efforts to bring this country under control through language and by rewriting history and we must stand up for democracy and the rule of law."
"I also think, Commissioner, that we should be more active than we have been in the past in helping with institution building, with establishing democratic institutions in this country."
"It is in our interest to exert a stabilising influence here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is seriously concerned about political and economic developments in the Republic of Moldavia, as my colleague Mr Patten made clear at his meeting with the Moldavian foreign secretary, Mr Dudeu, last month."
"We therefore welcome this resolution by the European Union."
"Moldavia is the poorest country in Europe and is still no closer to resolving its conflict with the rebel region of Transdnistria."
"The Moldavian Government has refused to meet representatives of Transdnistria since last summer and a bitter fight is waging over border controls in which Ukraine has also been caught up."
"An uneasy air of confrontation has recently arisen between the Communist Government of the Republic of Moldavia and the Romanian-speaking nationalists."
"The reform process is suffering from constant setbacks and the IMF has refused to grant any more loans."
"In the meantime, there are also worrying indications that the government is looking to Russia to resolve its problems."
"The main reasons for the country's poverty are of a political nature."
"The failure to resolve the Transdnistrian conflict is having a particularly serious impact."
"The European Union is currently examining how it can support OSCE efforts to improve the situation."
"We have set up a relatively generous aid programme."
"A provisional sum of around EUR 40 million has been set aside to support this country over the next two years with technical assistance, food aid and special macro-economic financial aid."
"However, we need a guarantee that Moldavia will also make an effort to put its finances on a more viable basis."
"It is true that ECHO has pulled out of Moldavia because ECHO's job is to provide emergency aid, not resolve structural problems."
"But even if ECHO's work can be continued using other instruments, such as TACIS, we must not forget that aid alone will not resolve political problems."
"In any event, the Commission is willing and able to see what measures can be taken with the means available to help resolve the Transdnistrian conflict."
"Kyrgyzstan is not yet a democracy."
"There is no division of powers, and no independent judiciary power."
"Human rights, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, etc. are continuously violated. There is an enormous abuse of power by the government, and people are thrown into prison at random under false accusations to eliminate political opponents."
"There is repression against independent journalists, and the press is the government's monopoly."
"What can we then expect as democrats?"
"Despite this, there are people who, with great courage, try to uphold democracy in their country, despite major personal risks, as Mr Beknazarov found out."
"Democratically elected people, journalists and citizens who uphold the rule of law are oppressed and even subjected to torture."
"But they should know that the European Union is on their side on this."
"We must apply pressure on the government."
"We have, in the framework of the partnership and the cooperation agreement, the chance to pressurise the government into engaging in dialogue with the opposition, ending the torture and ensuring that the country is on track to becoming one in which the rule of law applies."
"Mr President, too often we have to come to this Chamber on a Thursday afternoon to make speeches we would rather not have to make."
"That is certainly true today."
"I have been to Kyrgyzstan several times in recent years, as it emerged from those dark days of the Soviet empire and set the pace for the region in terms of political, economic and health reforms."
"I paid tribute then, as I have done since, to those periods of progress."
"But in the last couple of years we have become worried about progress in that country."
"President Akayev, who came from a background of the Academy of Sciences, was elected in a free vote in 1991 and re-elected in 1995, has subsequently become more of an oppressive president than a democratic one. Both parliamentary and presidential elections in 2000 sadly highlighted the flawed nature of the electoral process."
"We were concerned about candidates being banned on technicalities not least because of their knowledge of the Kyrgyz language; about the press being suppressed and repressed; about community groups being prevented from playing their part in the process."
"Symbolic of all this has been the arrest of Azimbek Beknazarov, chairman of the parliamentary committee on judicial and legal reforms."
"He was arrested in January and brought to trial in February."
"The trial was then postponed until this month."
"This is a country with many problems within its borders, including a lack of natural resources, racial tensions and incursions from abroad."
"Eighty-eight per cent of its population lives on an income of under USD 4 a day."
"It does not need the opprobrium that will come from world opinion if it makes a mess of its democratic processes, its independent judiciary and its freedom of speech."
"That is why we move this motion today, asking them to listen. We will be watching for results."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is violation of human rights in Kyrgyzstan, a country supported by us through the central Asian delegation to which I belong."
"Time is short, so I shall address what seem to me to be two particularly important points."
"First, when I visited the region, I saw clearly for myself that the people were raring to go and move towards our values."
"Unlike all the countries which have since joined and will soon join the EU, the countries of central Asia are basically making their own way towards democracy, without the huge amounts in aid being received by other countries."
"The only aid is TACIS."
"The European Union is providing Kyrgyzstan with financial and technical assistance in setting up ministries in the agricultural and social sectors."
"If you just stop to consider the different mentality, the cultural differences, religious differences and their completely different historical development, then you will begin to understand the huge difference between our and the central Asian understanding of democracy."
"What I mean to say here is that we must be careful not to be too harsh on other countries in our demands for democracy and human rights."
"Secondly, as partners and friends of central Asia, it is our duty to point out serious scandals in due and proper form, especially as Kyrgyzstan is in receipt of a certain amount of aid from us under the TACIS programme."
"This European Parliament resolution takes account of the dilemma to which I referred."
"As I said, on the one hand, a recognition of what are surely difficult circumstances and, on the other, the difficulty in establishing a working democracy which guarantees the involvement of all sections and groups of the population."
"I should like to make a point of acknowledging what has been achieved so far."
"However, when it comes to human rights, as Mr Bowis very impressively pointed out, there appears to be more retrogression than progression and I must express my very serious concern here."
"Human rights and human dignity are the basis of a modern society and a stable democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission services are monitoring the human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan daily, including the cases of Felix Kulov and Topchubek Turgunaliev and now the more recent case of Beknazarov and his associates."
"Of course, the Commission does not want to interfere in the legal affairs of a sovereign state, but the overkill on the part of the Kyrgyz authorities in the Beknazarov case is particularly worrying."
"It includes isolation and possibly maltreatment of Mr Beknazarov on grounds which appear to boil down to professional misjudgment on his part or perhaps to professional misconduct seven years ago."
"In addition, the proceedings against Mr Beknazarov have unleashed general disapproval among the people and could seriously undermine the credibility of the government and, in the end, the stability of the country."
"The Commission is also alarmed by the fact that the Beknazarov case appears to be just one in an increasingly long line of judicial proceedings against the government's political opponents."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament that Kyrgyzstan has put its good reputation on the line over the last two years."
"The Commission has never failed, nor will it fail this time to stress just how much importance it attaches to Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement requiring contracting parties to promise to respect democracy, the principles of international law and human rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Tunisia is a country in which there are major infringements of human rights."
"Sometimes the infringements appear to pass unnoticed."
"The opposition is persecuted, there are at least a thousand political prisoners in jail, freedom of expression is minimal and freedom of assembly is restricted."
"Journalists and workers for democracy are harassed, and lawyers are not permitted to work."
"A number of Tunisian human rights campaigners have been nominated for the Sacharov Prize, and we have criticised Tunisia on several occasions in this House."
"Now, there is cause to do so again."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about the proceedings against Hamma Hammami and his colleagues in the banned Communist Party."
"Their trial is a farce, and the way it is being conducted completely unacceptable."
"There have been protests from all around the world."
"Even in my own country, where Tunisia is rarely mentioned, there have been a number of indignant press articles in the last few days about the way in which the members of the Tunisian Communist Party are being treated."
"Mr Hammami, Mr Madouri and Mr Taamallah decided of their own accord to come forward and stand trial."
"Subsequent developments have been alarming and very far from being in accordance with the principles of a constitutional state."
"The three have been maltreated, they are not allowed to see their lawyers, and the trial itself is one big legal farce."
"We are agreed that they are prisoners of conscience who must be treated decently and in a manner appropriate to a constitutional state."
"The trial is to begin again on 30 March and, until then, they should be set free."
"Because they themselves have given themselves up, that is only right."
"We must send a message to Tunisia to the effect that we are keeping an eye on the country and watching the trial, which we shall be following extremely closely."
"The EU must address the issues of Tunisia and of human rights in the Association Agreements and in the context of cooperation."
"We have been silent for too long about these issues."
"We make tough demands on ourselves and on the candidate countries, but almost no such demands upon Tunisia."
"That must not continue."
"Human rights issues must be highlighted in our continued contacts with Tunisia."
"We must stop grovelling to Ben Ali."
"Above all, attention must be given to this case."
"Mr President, Tunisia made a commitment to respect human rights and it is a key element of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement."
"We now believe, however, that these undertakings, which were reiterated at the Association Council session of 29 January, have been flouted by the way in which Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants are being treated by the Tunisian Government."
"The defendants, who voluntarily came out of hiding, a state in which they were forced to live following their infamous trials in 1997 and 1998, were again convicted on 2 February before the Court of First Instance and their sentence was confirmed in a farcical judicial hearing which, unfortunately, confirms the serious defects in the rule of law that has been in force in Tunisia for several years."
"Two hundred lawyers gathered in support of the defence."
"They were set upon by the police and the prisoners were violently assaulted."
"Hamma Hammami began a hunger strike on 26 February to protest against the conditions in which he is being detained."
"He was moved to the area in Tunis prison that is reserved for those sentenced to death, despite the fact that he is a political prisoner."
"This situation is in breach of the Treaties, particularly Article 2 of the Association Agreement with the European Union on the respect of human rights."
"It is now crucial that, a few weeks before the start of the Conference on Foreign Affairs (Barcelona V), which is being held in Valencia on 22 and 23 April, we, as Members of the European Parliament, call upon the Tunisian authorities to release Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants."
"This is a first step which is essential for the respect of the rule of law in Tunisia."
"We also call on the Commission to demand that the Tunis authorities comply with international law and to instruct its parliamentary delegation to raise this subject more firmly with the Tunisian Government."
"In 1999, Mr Hamma Hammami and three other leaders of the Tunisian Communist Party were convicted in absentia for dissident activity."
"Last month, after the defendants surrendered to the authorities, those sentences were confirmed in less than one minute without a presentation of evidence by the prosecution or defence or an examination of the witnesses."
"There are also accusations of widespread abuses by the government against other dissident groups."
"Democracy and the rule of law are attributes enjoyed until recently by few countries even in Europe."
"They take time to evolve and can appear fragile in the face of threats."
"In states such as Tunisia, it may seem an achievement merely to resist the kind of radical socialism or Islamicism that has blighted the lives of so many in the Arab world in recent decades."
"We ourselves have to be careful, when we urge greater pluralism and respect for democratic norms around the world, that we do not undermine governments which, however imperfect, are moving in that direction."
"I believe, however, that the EU has an important role to play in helping to provide an example for countries which want to move away from a spiral of poverty, extremism and repression."
"Nor can we entirely isolate ourselves from the problems experienced by neighbouring countries such as Tunisia."
"By encouraging economic and political reform together with foreign direct investment, and with respect for good government, democracy and human rights, we help others and we also help ourselves, by reducing not only the resentment often felt against the West in the Arab world, but also the migratory pressures that are generating serious problems in our own societies and which themselves require urgent solutions."
"For that reason, it is right for the French Government to highlight the importance of giving aid to the Maghreb countries, many of whose citizens are settled in London, which I represent, as migrants or refugees."
"It is also right to begin to open EU markets, including our agricultural markets, to poorer countries that wish to trade with us, in ways that benefit them more directly and prevent future migratory pressures by the long-term stabilisation of their own economies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, convicted in absentia in 1999 to nine years and three months in prison for membership of an illegal association, incitement to civil disobedience, distribution of pamphlets inciting violence and dishonestly spreading false information liable to disrupt public order, Hamma Hammami came out of hiding in order to challenge this judgment on 2 February 2002."
"At the end of an eventful trial punctuated with incidents, the Court of First Instance in Tunis confirmed the original verdict and ordered the accused Hamma Hammami to be imprisoned."
"The appeal trial began on Saturday 9 March before a number of foreign observers, including journalists, Western diplomats posted to Tunis, barristers from France, Switzerland and Belgium, as well as delegates from human rights organisations."
"A dozen lawyers appealed, one after the other, to the bar to request to be given time to read through the dossier that they had been unable to access and to deplore the fact that they had been prevented from visiting their client as under normal circumstances."
"After some deliberation, the Court of Appeal postponed the trial until 30 March and refused the request to release the accused men."
"These are the facts."
"The European Union has expressed to the Tunisian authorities its concern regarding the human rights violations, but has merely hinted at the fact that these violations may compromise its Association Agreement with Tunisia, which was the first bilateral pact between the European Union and a Mediterranean country and which was signed three years ago."
"Last January, Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission, met with the Tunisian authorities in Tunis whilst on an official visit to North Africa."
"In a speech that he gave on that occasion, Mr Prodi stated that the negotiations related to trade and cooperation."
"Instead of taking this opportunity, whilst speaking publicly, to raise the issue of human rights, Mr Prodi welcomed the economic reforms undertaken in Tunisia."
"He stressed that the European Union respects the political sovereignty of Tunisia and does not wish to interfere in Tunisia's internal affairs."
"However, at a meeting held in June in Tunis with President Ben Ali and the Prime Minister, Mohammed Ganouch, the European Commissioner, Mr Chris Patten, paid more attention to the issue of human rights."
"On 14 December 2000, the European Parliament adopted a resolution engaging the European institutions to use all the means provided for by the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights and, whereas the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement lays down the promotion of human rights as a key element, it regrets the fact that this frank and open dialogue had not sufficed to encourage the Tunisian authorities to advance along the path of democracy and human rights."
"Mr President, I ask you to ensure that this resolution be forwarded to the Council and to the Commission and to the Tunisian Government and parliament for its information, and that we stress that we will follow events closely in the run-up to 30 March."
"Mr President, once again, the House is due to vote on human rights violations in Tunisia and today we are dealing with the conviction of three activists from the Communist Workers' Party of Tunisia."
"After four years of living in hiding, the three activists decided to appear freely before the court in order to challenge their sentence in a court of law."
"The trial of 2 February, as other Members have said, was a sham."
"The defendants were seized from their seats, taken away by the police during the court proceedings, and swiftly condemned to harsh prison sentences - Hamma Hammami was sentenced to nine years and three months."
"These men were not given the chance to defend themselves and were not given access to their lawyers."
"All this happened before a number of Tunisian and foreign observers and protesters."
"They are being detained in a civilian prison in disgraceful conditions."
"This trial is a real parody of justice."
"In response to this situation, the Tunisian Lawyers Council declared a strike."
"Hamma Hammami and Abdel Jabarmadouri decided to go on hunger strike in protest at their conditions of detention and to demand that their lawyers be given the right of visit."
"These events are part of a continuing campaign of intimidation and repression, which targets political opponents, human rights protesters, journalists, trade unionists, students, lawyers and magistrates."
"We note that the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, stipulating that relations between the two parties are based on the respect of democratic principles and human rights, has once again been flouted."
"We ask for an exceptional meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council to be organised as soon as possible to tackle the issue of human rights."
"Parliament must demand the release of Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants, and that Article 2 of the Agreement be respected."
"The Council and the Commission must use all the means provided for by the agreement in order to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights in Tunisia."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, large numbers of Europeans from my country like to holiday in Tunisia, where they find beautiful beaches, a beautiful landscape and a different culture and where, thanks to the security precautions taken in Tunisia, they feel safe."
"Nonetheless, we cannot overlook and we are deeply saddened by the repeated violation of human rights in Tunisia, the most recent case being the sentence passed on Hamma Hammami and his colleagues."
"These human rights violations were really not necessary, not in a country like Tunisia."
"The type of trial, the procedures surrounding the trial and the argument which Tunisia keeps on using, that democracy is being established, that slow progress is being made is, more is the pity, just not true."
"Or the steps, the progress being made, is so small as to be indiscernible."
"I therefore take the view that the current agreement should also be used for dialogue on this issue."
"I do not see this sort of agreement as a futile endeavour; on the contrary, agreements such as these with countries such as Tunisia give us the opportunity to ensure that the human rights issue is a subject of serious dialogue."
"I also take the view that human rights organisations, non-governmental organisations, should be more closely involved in the European Union's support instruments, especially as far as the MEDA Democracy programme is concerned."
"I have said before both on several occasions in this House and in conversation with Tunisian colleagues, and I shall say it again: the important and legitimate fight against fundamentalism and, more importantly, against potential terrorism, cannot be fought, let alone won if it is paid for by violating human rights."
"Human rights violations will not give the country greater security; on the contrary, all they will do is jeopardise the security of the country in the long term, and that is something which neither we nor Tunisia wants."
"I therefore call once again on Tunisia to start practising its professed faith in human rights at long last."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union in general and the Commission in particular condemn human rights violations in Tunisia and are monitoring the trial against Hamma Hammami and two other members of the Communist party very closely."
"On 9 March this year, a representative of the EU presidency attended the court hearing as an observer."
"The Foreign Ministry was notified of his attendance in advance."
"We welcome the postponement of the trial to 30 March to give the defence more time to prepare its case."
"The Commission shall continue to follow developments at the trial very closely through its delegation in Tunis."
"The EU is taking every opportunity to strengthen the human rights dialogue with Tunisia."
"At the most recent meeting of the association council on 29 January this year it expressly urged the Tunisian authorities to step up their efforts towards pluralism, democracy and the rule of law."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"

"(B5-0172/2002) by Mr Vinci and Mrs Frahm, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Sri Lanka."
"Mr President, I am very glad to have the opportunity to address Parliament on this most important of issues."
"The motion calls for justice and reparations for the Muslim and Tamil communities being persecuted in Sri Lanka."
"If 60 000 people were killed in the developed world - that is the magnitude of the atrocities we are looking at now in Sri Lanka - then every possible means would be deployed to address the matter and bring those responsible before the courts and establish the rule of law."
"There is serious and flagrant discrimination and economic underdevelopment in the areas of the country where the majority of the Tamil population lives."
"This is an area where the European Union could play a meaningful role, through funding programmes to address the imbalance and further the cause of peace and reconciliation."
"We must act concertedly here or more innocent Sri Lankans will join the half a million people who have already fled the country."
"The use of child soldiers and sexual assaults on Sri Lankan women is endemic."
"To turn our backs on this matter would deliver a serious blow to the important causes we often champion here of democracy, freedom and social justice."
"Our attendance at the donors' meeting in Sri Lanka, scheduled for May, is vital."
"I also call on the presidency to ensure forthwith that this resolution is conveyed to the Council, the Commission and the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka."
"Mr President, as the European Union's Chief Election Observer during the 2000 and 2001 elections, I witnessed at first hand the terrible consequences of violence in Sri Lanka."
"I was therefore particularly pleased to be there on the historic occasion of the signing of the ceasefire agreement, which hopefully will herald a new dawn of peace and prosperity underpinned by the strengthening of human rights."
"I acknowledge the courage shown by those who are signatories to this agreement and the role that the Norwegian Government and its Ambassador to Sri Lanka played in bringing it about."
"I also recognise that the silencing of guns, though welcome, is not peace, but merely the first tentative step on the road to peace."
"It is only realistic to expect that many problems will lie ahead - some will be minor, others more serious."
"However, if good-will and determination exist on all sides, and the LTTE recognises that the only way forward is exclusively through peaceful dialogue, nothing will be allowed to derail the peace process."
"It is much better to be guarantors of a peaceful future than prisoners of the past."
"The prime minister and the leader of the Tamil Tigers, together with their supporters, have indeed taken huge risks for peace."
"Their efforts deserve to be rewarded by the international community, including the European Union. As well as providing important political and moral support the international community should provide substantial funding to underwrite the peace process."
"If the people of Sri Lanka, especially the doubters, were able to see that there is a peace dividend, this would underpin the agreement and encourage support for it."
"It is much better for the international community to invest in peace now rather than having to spend money later picking up the pieces caused by continued conflict and violence."
"I wish Sri Lanka well and I would urge all the political leaders on the island and its citizens to support this peace process and cherish the hope that it will bring permanent peace to their country."
"Mr President, a surge of violence is destroying the tropical island in the Indian Ocean."
"Will the armistice hold at long last?"
"When will the government and the Tamil Tigers realise that there are no winners in this civil war, and when will long-term peace be established?"
"Now that there is a new government, we should strike while the iron is hot."
"It is of the utmost importance for all parties to agree on the basic principle of lasting peace."
"The President and Prime Minister must at long last sing from the same hymn sheet; otherwise, they will be playing into the hands of the Tigers."
"In the past, the Tamil Tigers have repeatedly violated armistices."
"Seven years ago, the last peace negotiations were unexpectedly broken off by attacks by the Tigers. And they continue to recruit soldiers, including children, even to this day."
"The politicians should remain vigilant, at an international level too."
"The monitoring by 30 observers seems very meagre indeed."
"Are they capable of doing a proper job?"
"And what, I ask, can the European Union do to ensure that the weapons are put under lock and key for good and that the violent storm on this paradise-like island at long last subsides?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago the SAARC delegation of the European Parliament visited Sri Lanka."
"I was there in my capacity as vice-president and was able to visit both the north and the south of the island."
"In the vicinity of Jaffna, the army had just managed to reclaim large tracts of land formerly occupied by the Tamil Tigers."
"We saw villages razed to the ground, land laid waste and a demonstration by fishermen and farmers wanting to return home but prevented from doing so for security reasons."
"Back in Colombo, foreign observers and the local non-governmental organisations told us the war in Sri Lanka had become an institution."
"At all the talks we backed the Norwegian intermediaries who have been trying to set up bilateral negotiations for years now."
"Only a few of us believed then in an end to a civil war which had lasted nearly twenty years and claimed over 60 000 lives."
"Since the elections, which were won by the United National Front on a manifesto which included a peaceful resolution to the conflict, the situation has changed."
"Economic sanctions have been lifted, fishing restrictions reduced, the transport embargo relaxed and sea and air links established."
"Following the ceasefire, which hopefully will hold up, prisoners of war have been exchanged and Norway has again asked for assistance."
"Commissioner Fischler, I am pleased to say that the European Union has not been sitting on its hands."
"Our main help has been humanitarian."
"Since 1993, some EUR 13 million have been collected through ECHO."
"EUR 1 million was recently provided to improve the food and health situation, for medical care and medication and to pave the way for better hygiene and cleaner water."
"The European Union should not only take financial action at the donor conference in Sri Lanka in May."
"More importantly, it should exercise political pressure so that the ceasefire and the initial peace talks, which are just tender shoots, are not just a flash in the pan, as has been the case so often in previous years, and actually come to something this time round."
"We must hope for a lasting peace process for this country and its people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the ceasefire between the Sri Lanka Government and the LTTE signed on 24 February, we hope that both sides will now be able to return to the negotiating table and broker a comprehensive peace agreement."
"This would give momentum to the reconciliation process and pave the way for reconstruction measures."
"I should like here to express my recognition of the Norwegian Government, which has worked tirelessly in the wings brokering the peace process."
"The Commission has assured the Government of Sri Lanka that it is prepared to join in international efforts to support a reconstruction programme if the peace process shows real progress."
"In the meantime, the Commission has taken a whole host of measures."
"EUR 2.7 million will be provided for humanitarian aid programmes this year in order to help displaced people, following on from the EUR 3.3 million provided for this purpose last year."
"EUR 4 million are to be provided for this programme next year and again in 2004."
"Experts from ECHO are already on site assessing the emergency humanitarian aid requirement for this year."
"In April, missions will be sent to Sri Lanka to work out proposals for programmes and projects, for which development aid of EUR 10 million and economic aid of up to EUR 5 million will be provided in the years 2002 to 2006."
"The EC/Sri Lanka development aid working party is due to meet in Colombo next week to discuss how the Commission's rapid reaction mechanism can be used to boost confidence building and conflict prevention."
"The working party is also due to meet in June, following the World Bank's development forum, in order to discuss development aid and economic cooperation."
"The Commission has deliberately built a great deal of flexibility into its programming of humanitarian aid, so that, if the ceasefire is successful, measures can be taken to move and resettle people, to promote education and economic recovery, and to restore incomes."
"A comprehensive peace agreement would allow us to launch a broad reconstruction programme together with other partners."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischler."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B5-0135/2002) by Mrs Rodríguez Ramos, Mrs Sornosa Martínez and Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the United States' boycott of imports of clementines from Spain;"
"(B5-0136/2002) by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the United States' trade ban on Community clementines;"
"(B5-0144/2002) by Mr Bautista Ojeda, Mr Mayol i Raynal and Mrs Auroi, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on clementines;"
"(B5-0154/2002) by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on clementines."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be speaking to Parliament and to be addressing you in the presence of Commissioner Fischler on the issue of clementines, which falls within his jurisdiction."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the border closure that the United States is unilaterally imposing on our clementines sector is an unjustifiable trade action, which this Parliament must condemn."
"The debate we are holding today must result in a resolution that urges the Commission, the Council and the Spanish Government to do their job and to do it well."
"Our objective is simply to protect something that we have been working on for the Community agricultural sector."
"The Commission must, therefore, act rapidly to put an end to this trade ban whose only purpose is to serve the interests of the United States' own production."
"We ask the Commission, in contrast to what the current Spanish Government has been doing, to set aside the philosophy of contentedly pursuing bilateral dialogue."
"We cannot enter into dialogue as if nothing had happened, with a party that is doing so much harm to the Community citrus fruit sector."
"The Commission must deal with the conflict without losing sight of the fact that the United States has acted unilaterally, reneging on the agreement on health and plant-health measures and on the provisions of the World Trade Organisation in general."
"To put it another way, the Commission must take over the half-hearted action of the Spanish Government which has, to date, only obtained one proposal from the Americans, made with veiled threats and which consists of making changes to the protocol regulating our citrus fruit exports."
"Lastly, it is crucial that the President-in-Office of the Council plays an active role in this dispute."
"The President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers must, without fail, appear before this House to explain the initiatives he proposes to achieve this return to normality of citrus fruit exports and how he intends to compensate producers, since they have already been seriously affected by this situation."
"This is what we are asking of you, Mr Fischler, and I hope that you will be able to meet our expectations."
"Mr President, I should like to make a few comments on the joint resolution that we too have signed."
"First of all, there has been a range of considerations and requests in relation to the unilateral decision of the United States to suspend imports of Spanish clementines into the US."
"For this reason, the resolution states that the unilateral decision of the United States is in breach of World Trade Organisation agreements because, as stated in the resolution, restrictions to trade must be proportional to the risks, non-discriminatory, and must not be imposed without scientific proof."
"Everything suggests, therefore, that the United States' ban on Community clementines is simply an excuse for a trade barrier to prevent Community clementines from entering the United States' market and, therefore, to prevent the introduction of non-Community citrus fruits into the United States."
"This is unacceptable and I wish to point out that, in the resolution, parallels are made with the issue of steel products, because the United States is breaching WTO rules."
"Secondly, there is a series of problems or consequences that the resolution analyses in relation to the major losses suffered by producers and exporters in the current citrus fruit season and, as stated in the text of the resolution, an indication is also given of the delay that occurred in the Community's taking action."
"I also wish to quote some dates given in the resolution: on 30 November, the United States suspended imports of clementines and definitively ratified this decision on 5 December and, on 14 February 2002, the Spanish Government asked the Commission for its help in this dispute and to use its power to intervene."
"To conclude, there is a range of actions that the Commission has been asked to undertake: to rapidly put forward proposals to compensate those affected; secondly, to seek to resolve the dispute with the United States as quickly as possible, because we cannot start the next season with this problem unsolved since that would have extremely serious consequences; and, thirdly, in the event that a solution is not found, the United States must be called to account before the WTO."
"I wish to conclude by thanking the Commission for the way in which it has acted to date, because it attended very promptly when the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development asked it to."
"The Commission gave a commitment to inform us rapidly and, since they have done so, I think it is only fair that we thank the Commission for everything it has done so far."
"Mr President, Commissioner, due to a complaint from a customer in Maryland, who found Mediterranean fruit fly larvae in clementines, the United States took harsh unilateral measures with regard to Spain."
"In fact, as you know, it is not a plant health problem but a trade barrier that the United States has now established."
"It is true, as Mr Jové Peres stressed, that the Spanish Government lost time by failing to inform the Commission immediately and instead waited until 14 February to do so, despite the fact that the problem came to light in November 2001."
"But the problem exists and Morocco is also currently experiencing the same problem for the same reasons."
"The fly that bit the American Government, if I can put it like that, is more of an electioneering insect rather than a citrus fruit parasite from the Mediterranean."
"The attitude of the United States towards clementines is the same as it is towards steel products, as my fellow Members have already said."
"It marks a return to protectionist ways and to unilateralism with complete disregard for WTO obligations."
"The United States cannot carry on closing their borders when faced with the urgency of the elections or ignore the WTO agreements when the European Union poses them problems."
"Therefore, as recommended by the resolution, I call on the Commission to instigate proceedings at the WTO against the United States if an immediate solution to the situation is not found."
"Next, the Commission must present proposals to compensate the people affected, until the conflict is resolved."
"Lastly, the Council should inform us, through its President-in-Office of the Council, of the latest initiatives that it is taking to resolve this conflict."
"Mr President, I wish to express my personal pleasure at the fact that we have achieved a unanimous resolution on this issue and congratulate my fellow Members on this achievement."
"The issue of clementines is not an isolated incident, but is one link in a chain of tensions that exists in trade relations between the United States and the European Union."
"I shall not waste time listing them all, but I shall refer - as I did yesterday, in the debate on transatlantic dialogue - to the problem of hormone-treated meat, to the banana war, to aid for North American airlines, which has led to our own airlines becoming less competitive, and to massive export subsidies, which have been deemed illegal."
"The most serious aspect is not that this should have happened but that, apparently, we are entering a new era of protectionism, which has become evident on the steel issue, which we discussed yesterday, and also on the issue of clementines."
"I also wish to emphasise that the issue of clementines is, if possible, more serious than the issue of steel."
"Steel will have entry conditions imposed on it that will make imports more expensive; on the issue of the clementines, the borders have simply been closed."
"This is why I said yesterday that I shall be demanding the same rigour and the same energy on the issue of clementines as on the issue of steel, if we wish to maintain credibility and be able to hold our heads high in the World Trade Organisation."
"I wish to correct Mr Jové Peres, who has fallen into the temptation, in passing, of making the Spanish Government out to be the villain of the piece."
"The Commission has long been aware of this issue and, if it had followed proceedings more closely, it would have seen an answer from Mr Lamy in which he told me that, as early as December, the United States trade representative, Mr Zoellick, had a meeting with the representative of the Commission, who was fully informed of the situation, through the Government and because I had tabled a question on 12 December."
"But, when all is said and done, this is a piece of cheek that I can tolerate and understand, since you are a member of the opposition."
"With regard to the request that has been made, I agree with what the speakers have said."
"What needs to be done, first of all, is to compensate those who have suffered losses; secondly, to pursue dialogue with the United States because, as we know, a poor deal is better than no deal at all, especially when a good deal could take years to conclude and ruin our production and, thirdly, to initiate, as soon as possible, proceedings in the 133 Committee."
"I must emphasise that this is more as a means of exerting pressure and imposing negotiation in order to bring the United States to the dialogue table than in order to initiate proceedings that could drag on forever."
"I would emphasise that the Spanish Government - whether Mr Jové Peres likes it or not - started this issue in December, as Mr Lamy has shown."
"Therefore, look elsewhere for the villain and let us all work together to protect Spanish clementines, which is my only objective at the moment, as I am sure is true for the President, who - in his enthusiasm - has generously given me more speaking time than I was due."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by clarifying exactly who is responsible here."
"It is true, as Mrs Martinez said, that I am responsible for clementines, but the primary issue here is the Mediterranean fruit fly, and that is my colleague David Byrne's area."
"And if a WTO problem arises as a result, that will be Pascal Lamy's responsibility."
"That is all, just to clarify matters."
"But one thing is right and that is, whichever way you look at it, the Commission is responsible."
"For over 15 years, Spain has exported clementines to the USA under the terms of a bilateral protocol agreed with the USA on the risk of introducing the Mediterranean fruit fly."
"Problems have already cropped up here and there in the meantime, but have always been very quickly resolved."
"Now a few fruit fry larvae have been found under somewhat questionable circumstances and the USA's unreasonable reaction has been to issue a complete ban on imports of clementines."
"Spain takes the view that the best and quickest solution would be to conduct bilateral talks with the USA and change the protocol, with the new protocol to be accepted by the USA in time for the next season's deliveries starting in October."
"That may sound optimistic, but we shall know by next month, by April at the latest, if this will work."
"As things stand, it would be the best solution."
"On 14 February, Spain also officially asked the Commission to check if the import ban was compatible with the WTO agreement and, if necessary, to file an objection in Geneva."
"The Commission has started to check this and its first step will be to raise the matter at the SPS committee meeting in Geneva on 20 and 21 March."
"At the moment, the Commission has serious doubts as to whether the US measures, which appear to infringe several basic principles governing the introduction and application of trade measures, are compatible with WTO rules."
"Nonetheless, the Commission takes the view that a negotiated solution which takes proper account of both sides' interests would be best."
"However, if insufficient account is taken of Spain's concerns, the Commission is prepared to take the necessary measures, including further steps at the WTO in Geneva, if our initial impression that WTO rules are being infringed is confirmed."
"I should like to point out that citrus fruit producers have applied to the US courts for the ban to be lifted temporarily."
"At a legal or judicial level, that would appear to be the best way forward at the moment."
"As far as compensation is concerned, EU rules do not make provision for direct compensation in such cases."
"However, the Commission will do all it can to minimise the adverse impact of the US measures on the Community sector affected."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Mr President, we have had hot-headed arguments in the groups about speaking times and about which subjects can be included on the urgent list and which cannot."
"We have wrangled over minutes and then we end up finishing half an hour early!"
"Something has gone dreadfully wrong with the mathematics and I would be most obliged if you would examine how we can make full use of the sitting time up to the vote."
"Thank you Mr Posselt."
"Please rest assured that your comment has been noted and will be examined."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The next item is the report (A5-0029/2002) by Mr Bautista Ojeda, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation extending the financing of quality and marketing improvement plans for certain nuts and locust beans approved under Title IIa of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 and providing for a specific aid for hazelnuts (COM(2001) 667 - C5-0652/2001 - 2001/0275(CNS))."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 14 March 2002."
"Colleagues, at the very moment when the European Union at the European Council in Barcelona has taken significant steps forward on economic reform and modernisation, yesterday evening in Bologna terrorists assassinated Professor Marco Biagi, a Professor of Labour Law in the University of Modena and an adviser to the Italian government on labour and employment policy."
"Professor Biagi is survived by his wife and two children."
"Terrorist acts are always vile and in this instance the attack also was clearly targeted."
"In assassinating Marco Biagi, the terrorists had in their sights a man who was highly regarded both professionally and personally, and a creator of the indispensable policy of labour market reform to promote employment in Italy and in Europe."
"He was also a strong advocate of social dialogue and solidarity, as well as progress and modernisation in his own country and was strongly committed to the European ideal."
"For all these reasons, this murder not only has an impact on Italy, but strikes at the very heart of our common European ideal."
"I send my deepest condolences and sympathy to Mr Biagi's family, to his university colleagues, and on behalf of our Italian colleagues and all of this House, I convey to the Italian authorities our deep sense of shock and outrage."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Colleagues, it is our pleasure to have with us today in the Diplomatic Gallery, a delegation from the Croatian Parliament, the Hrvatski Sabor, led by Mr Ivo Skrabalo, Chairman of the Sub-Committee for relations with the European Parliament and Chairman of the Committee of Interparliamentary Cooperation of the Croatian Parliament."
"Colleagues will recall that only a few months ago, on 12 December 2001, the European Parliament gave its assent to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which is an excellent basis for our future cooperation."
"Later today our distinguished guests will be meeting the European Parliament Delegation for relations with the countries of South East Europe, chaired by Mrs Doris Pack, for the 10th European Parliament/Croatia Interparliamentary meeting."
"We all particularly appreciate your presence with us, Mr Skrabalo, at this important time for the development of stability and peace in South East Europe, and we thank you for joining us in Parliament this afternoon."
"Before we begin the debate, I should like to communicate a number of important items in respect of our timetable and procedure."
"The President of the European Council, Mr José María Aznar, must leave at 16.30 in order to attend the international conference on financing for development in Monterrey, Mexico."
"He will thus lead the debate, respond to its first round, and will then be replaced."
"The President of the European Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, who will attend the same conference in Mexico, in the dramatic circumstances of the assassination of Professor Biagi, who was a close personal friend of Mr Prodi, feels obliged to travel this afternoon to Bologna in order to pay his respects."
"I know the House will understand his personal conviction in this matter."
"He will therefore also attend the first part of the debate on the Barcelona European Council and will then be replaced by Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission."
"Before introducing the debate, I would like to say that last week in Barcelona, for the first occasion during my Presidency of this House, I had the honour to address a European Summit meeting on your behalf."
"My emphasis was on our contribution, on the work which so many rapporteurs, committee chairs and political group coordinators had led and participated in."
"I want to thank everyone in this House who made such a special effort to deliver in substance and to deliver on time."
"It was wonderful position as President of the European Parliament to be able to have made such a major contribution to the Barcelona Summit meeting."
"In the course of that meeting, I stressed our Parliament's desire to develop a new, more mature partnership and dialogue with the European Council on a wide range of issues."
"I hope and believe that we have begun the process which will make this possible in the near future."
"The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the outcome of the European Council meeting held in Barcelona on 15 and 16 March 2002."
"I am very pleased today to welcome to our debate the President-in-Office of the Council, Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar, and also the President of the European Commission, Mr Romano Prodi."
"Since late last year when the Commission wrote a note to my predecessor saying that there was a delivery gap, we have done our part, in our way, to close that gap."
"Lisbon, and then the Barcelona review and outlook, have fixed new deadlines for delivery."
"This Parliament has delivered for Barcelona and will continue to do so in active partnership in terms of our legal responsibilities."
"I have suggested to the Presidency that in the matter of simplifying and improving the regulatory environment - in other words, identifying how to achieve better law-making and governance in the EU - that all of our institutions: Parliament, Council and Commission, could benefit from a new and more mature prospect for dialogue."
"I have commended this view to the President-in-Office."
"I am pleased to report that there is a recognition at the political level that this is a desirable development."
"I hope, between now and Seville, through the good offices of Mr Aznar and his colleagues in the Presidency, and through those of Mr Prodi and his colleagues in the Commission, to bring this objective to fruition."
"Against that background, it is my great pleasure to invite the President-in-Office to introduce our debate on the Barcelona Summit."
"Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Council I wish to add my voice to that of the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, to condemn with the utmost energy the murder, which took place yesterday in Bologna, of Professor Marco Biagi, advisor to the Italian Labour Minister, Mr Maroni."
"On behalf of the European Council, I extend our condolences to the family of Mr Biagi, which we also extend to the Italian authorities and the Italian people."
"The fight against terrorism is a fundamental priority in the European Union."
"Terrorism, as we all know, is a threat to liberty and democracy, and must be fought firmly and steadfastly, with all the means available to us under the Rule of Law."
"We must, therefore, reaffirm our most decisive determination and confront terrorism serenely and with political courage, out of solidarity with the victims, and in order to uphold our democratic dignity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to appear before this House, as I had the opportunity to announce in January, when I presented the priorities of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union, to inform you today about the results of the Barcelona European Council."
"Two years ago, at the Lisbon European Council, the Heads of State and Government wondered how Europe could deal with the enormous changes that our societies are currently facing as a result of globalisation and how we could respond to the challenges of a knowledge-based economy."
"We then established a strategic goal for the European Union for the coming decade: to transform Europe into the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs, and greater social cohesion."
"Two years later, and after the Barcelona European Council, I am pleased to say that the Lisbon process of social and economic modernisation has not only been consolidated, but has actually been strengthened."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the success of the modernisation of our economies depends on the political will to undertake a series of reforms."
"I would like to highlight and thank the honourable Members for the great contribution of the European Parliament to the progress of the Lisbon Process and to the good results obtained in Barcelona."
"This recognition was unanimously expressed to President Cox during his first appearance before the European Council."
"You have accomplished a great deal of work and taken numerous decisions regarding the Lisbon Process."
"I would like to point out, among the long list of matters that have been discussed by the honourable Members, that it was thanks to the report on 'the implementation of legislation regarding financial services? that a matter as essential as the creation of integrated financial services in the European Union was resolved."
"Your decision to press ahead on this subject has not only helped significantly to create competitive financial markets, but has also contributed to the future adoption of a series of measures that may lead to the additional yearly growth of 0.5% of the European Union's Gross Domestic Product."
"I would also like to highlight your resolutions on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and on sustainable development, and the reports adopted last week regarding the internal market for electricity and gas, and for cross-border trade in electricity."
"The substantial contribution of the European Parliament to the Barcelona Council has therefore not been limited to the specific sphere of economic reform, but has instead covered a wide range of different fields."
"This House's contribution will undoubtedly permit the establishment of new guidelines for cooperation between the Council, the Commission, and the European Parliament, in order to strengthen the political and institutional partnership based on a spirit of mutual trust."
"This is clearly stressed in the first of the Conclusions of the Barcelona European Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before I refer to the contents of the discussions and the decisions taken at the Barcelona European Council, I would like to emphasize in particular the participation of the candidate countries in an ordinary working session in the framework of the Council."
"This European Council noted with great satisfaction the commitment given by the future Members of the European Union to the Lisbon reform strategy."
"We can state that the candidate countries have become, even before they join the Union, decisive supporters of the reforms."
"The good results of the Barcelona European Council must not let us forget the long road that still lies ahead before we can achieve the ambitious goal of transforming Europe into a society that enjoys full employment at the end of this decade."
"That is why, as I present to you the results of the recent European Council, I will place equal stress on what has already been achieved, and on what we still need to achieve in the next eight years."
"In my judgment, the Council broadcast two important messages in Barcelona: its confidence in economic recovery, and the rekindling of the Lisbon 'spirit?."
"We have agreed that economic recovery has indeed begun, and we trust that this recovery will strengthen as the year progresses."
"Its solidity and duration are guaranteed if we are able to make progress on our Agenda for reform and create a stable framework that favours growth."
"The European Council has stressed the importance of complying with the requirements of the Stability Pact."
"To that end, all the Member States have given a commitment to achieve or continue to approve budgets that are almost balanced, or have a surplus, by the year 2004, and at the same time, coordinate our economic policies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we can divide the matters addressed by the Barcelona European Council into four large groupings."
"The first is the group of decisions that will improve the operation of the Internal Market and will strengthen the integration of the European economic area, the best way we have of creating greater wealth."
"In this regard, the Conclusions include the commitment by Member States to reduce levels of public subsidies as a percentage of GDP, and that such subsidies be used more transparently."
"The European Council also asked the Finance Ministers to evaluate the transparency of our accounting, consultancy and auditing regulations."
"We shall never have really efficient regulations unless we can guarantee that they are complied with."
"Therefore, the Council has decided that before the Spring European Council of 2003, fully 100% of directives whose inclusion in legal codes takes two years must have been transposed."
"The European economic area we are aspiring to will only become a reality, if in addition to a transparent and flexible legal framework, we move towards the openness and interconnection of key sectors such as transport, energy, and telecommunications, and towards a financial system that permits a correct allocation of savings, and financing at the lowest possible cost."
"It is in this field, perhaps, where the progress made by the European Council has been most relevant."
"On the subject of financial markets, and after the agreement between the Commission, the Council, and Parliament, it will be possible to comply with the deadlines to achieve an integrated stock market in 2003, and the complete integration of the financial markets in 2005."
"To achieve this goal, we have identified seven Directives and one Regulation that must be approved this year."
"As regards energy, we have made progress both in opening the markets and in European integration through interconnections."
"As you know, it has been decided to open the gas and electricity markets in the year 2004 for all European businesses, which means that approximately 70% of the European energy market will be open to competition."
"As for the rest of the market, the European Council laid down that a decision is to be taken prior to the Spring European Council of 2003."
"These measures to open the energy market are completed, on the other hand, with the goal of an electrical interconnection of at least 10% of installed production capacity of the Member States by the year 2005."
"Once this goal is achieved, we will no longer be able to talk about fragmented national markets; instead we will have a genuinely open and integrated European electricity market."
"As regards transport and telecommunications, we have designed a working programme that will make a substantial contribution to improving the efficiency of the internal market."
"Thus, this year we shall approve a review of the Trans-European Transport Networks, which will allow us to remove bottlenecks in such areas as the Baltic Sea, the Alps, and the Pyrenees."
"Furthermore, we have agreed to launch the Galileo Programme, which will have not only a clear effect on the development of European transport and communications, but also has a major technological component."
"We have also reached agreement on the entry into force of the 'Single European Sky' in 2004, which will reduce flying time, cut air travel costs, and make air traffic management more efficient, and, finally, we have agreed to give top priority to developing broadband networks, as the essential element in developing the Information Society."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the second grouping of matters I wanted to refer to, regards the Sustainable Development Strategy that we approved at the Gothenburg European Council."
"The European Council has agreed on the entry into force of the Directive regarding energy taxation in December 2004, coinciding with the opening of the energy markets."
"As the honourable Members know, the European Community and its Member States have decided to ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"The Council has requested that all national ratification procedures be concluded by June, prior to the Johannesburg Summit."
"Finally, and as regards the Monterrey Summit, the fifteen Member States have reached agreement on increasing the European Union's average Official Development Aid to 0.39% in the year 2006, as an intermediate step towards reaching the commitment of 0.7%."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the third grouping of issues addressed at the Barcelona European Council covers employment and social matters."
"As the honourable Members know, on the afternoon prior to the European Council, we held a Summit meeting with the Social Partners."
"The specific result of that Social Summit was the commitment of the social partners to the Lisbon strategy and goals."
"Throughout the European Council, there was widespread agreement that the Member States should make an effort to remove the obstacles that make it difficult for Europeans to enter the labour market."
"These are obstacles involving the taxation and social protection systems, and barriers to the free movement of workers within the Union."
"To this end, we have approved the creation of a European Health Card, which will make it easier for citizens to receive medical care when they are away from home, and we have decided to create a European website for job offers."
"We have insisted on measures targeted at two very specific population groups: first of all, to encourage access to day care centres for most children, as a measure to reconcile family life and professional life, and secondly, given the low birth rate and the ageing of our population, we will implement measures to increase the average retirement age in Europe by five years, before the end of this decade."
"Finally, the Council also focused its attention on matters involving education and technological research, development, and innovation, factors which should be a major part of Europe's competitive advantage."
"The European Council considers that a quality education is one of the essential features of prosperous and open societies."
"That is why we approved the ""Working Programme for 2010"" for educational systems."
"In terms of specific educational elements, the European Council has supported the teaching of at least two Member-State languages, with children starting to learn when still very young, and the widespread teaching of IT and the Internet, starting in secondary school."
"In the field of technological research, development, and innovation, I would like to underscore the very important commitment we gave in Barcelona, which you are undoubtedly aware of: to increase investment earmarked for these categories until it reaches 3% of GDP in the year 2010, two-thirds of which will come from the private sector."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in Lisbon, it was decided that each spring, the European Council would hold a working session devoted to economic and social matters, to ensure overall coherence and the effective supervision of progress towards the new strategic objective."
"In line with this mandate, the Barcelona European Council devoted the bulk of its work to the Lisbon Strategy."
"Nonetheless, this did not prevent the Council from dealing with other matters, regarding the European Union's foreign policy, and other institutional matters."
"Among the latter, I would like to mention the conversation that was held at the European Council at the initiative of the Irish Prime Minister, regarding the ratification of the Treaty of Nice by the Republic of Ireland."
"The European Council gave a warm welcome to the approach proposed by the Irish Prime Minister, has reiterated its desire to support the Irish Government in the ratification process for the Treaty of Nice, and has agreed to raise the matter again in Seville."
"The European Council will also be the first to devote a working session to study the progress of the discussions regarding Europe's future."
"A report by the Chairman of the Convention will give us first-hand knowledge of the progress of the reflections at this preparatory forum for the future Intergovernmental Conference."
"Finally, and regarding institutional matters, we have complied with the mandates of the Gothenburg and Laeken European Councils."
"As agreed at the latter European Council, the Council's Secretary General presented a report, from which we shall have to extract the relevant operational conclusions for reforming the European Council at the Seville meeting."
"In the coming weeks, the Presidency and the Council's General Secretariat will make the required contacts to achieve that goal."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a good deal of the discussion on foreign policy matters was devoted to the situation in the Middle East."
"We also studied the agreement that has been concluded between Serbia and Montenegro, relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance, and the future role of the European Union in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Furthermore, I also wish to highlight the special support of the European Council for the Brussels Process on Gibraltar."
"Through the 'Barcelona Declaration', which it has adopted, the European Union has once again stated its condemnation of all terrorist attacks, and at the same time pointed out that it is the task of the National Palestinian Authority, as the only legitimate authority, to fight against terrorism."
"In this regard, the European Council has called for all restrictions on the freedom of movement of the President of the National Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat to be lifted immediately."
"On the other hand, the European Council has stated that Israel must withdraw its forces from the areas that are under the control of the Palestinian Authority, put an end to extra judicial executions, remove its blockades and restrictions, impose a freeze on the building of settlements, and respect international law."
"The European Council has reiterated, with this declaration, the Union's traditional dual objective in the region: the creation of a democratic, viable, and independent Palestinian State, which would put an end to the 1967 occupation, and Israel's right to live in peace, with secure and recognised borders, guaranteed by the commitment of the international community, and in particular, of the Arab countries."
"Only by tightly coordinating the actions of the European Union, the United Nations, the USA, Russia, and other countries in the region, will we be able to contribute effectively to resolving this conflict."
"Ladies and gentlemen, European policy towards the Balkans is underpinned by a clear principle: the principle of the inviolability of borders, and respect for the territorial integrity of States."
"The agreement reached on 14 March by the leaders of Serbia and Montenegro is a good step in that direction, because it ratifies the maintenance of their constitutional unity and their territorial integrity."
"This agreement will be a good test of European aspirations for the Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and the European Union will determine its degree of commitment according to its success."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council has expressed its readiness to continue supporting the process of stabilising, reconciling, and rebuilding the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Based on the philosophy that has led the European Union to decide to inherit the policing mission in Bosnia Herzegovina starting on the first of January next year, the European Council has expressed the Union's readiness to accept responsibility for an operation that would take over from the one currently being carried out by the Atlantic Alliance, on the understanding that the permanent cooperation agreements between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance have come into force."
"To that end, the European Council has requested Spain, as holder of the Presidency of the European Union, to pursue, together with the High Representative, the appropriate high-level contacts in order to obtain a positive result that would permit this situation to be resolved."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Sub-Saharan Africa was also included in the discussions of the European Council, which expressed, on one hand, its satisfaction the ceasefire announced in Angola, after more than twenty-five years of conflict that have had disastrous consequences for the population, and, on the other hand, condemned the lack of political guarantees provided in the recent elections in Zimbabwe."
"The European Union also expressed its concern at the changes in the situation in the Republic of Congo, and at the news of a possible stoning of a woman in Nigeria."
"The European Council called on the government authorities in that country to fully respect human rights, specifically those of women."
"In Monterrey, I will have the opportunity of personally asking the President of Nigeria to listen to the demands from all quarters to prevent this act of stoning to death a human being, a woman, from taking place in that country."
"(Applause)"
"I also want to stress the enormous satisfaction with which the European Council received the decision of the United Kingdom and Spain to relaunch the Brussels Process regarding Gibraltar, established in November 1984, and supported the commitment of both governments to overcome their differences where Gibraltar is concerned, and to achieve a generally accepted agreement before the summer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, there has been a lot of talk lately about the need to bring the process of European integration closer to the citizens."
"In recent times, the European Union may have given the impression that it was taking care of matters that were apparently too distant from the daily life of its citizens."
"I believe that the Barcelona Council has proven that precisely the opposite is true."
"We have dealt with and have taken decisions that will affect the specific reality and the daily life of the Union's citizens."
"The result has been a very complete and significant agenda for the coming years."
"This year, the GALILEO Programme will be launched, the review of the Trans-European Energy and Transport Networks will be approved, the proposals regarding port services, public service contracts, and rules for allocating flight slots will be approved, and seven directives and a financial services regulation, plus an important regulation regarding trans-border electricity flows, will also be approved."
"Seville will have to pay attention, among other matters, to the approval of the Sixth R&D Framework Programme, the EU's common strategy for Johannesburg, the new e-Europe 2005 programme, and the reform of the Council in addition to the discussions regarding enlargement."
"In 2003, we will achieve the complete application of the telecommunications package, the launch of the European job search website, and the launch of the European Health Card, as well as the integration of the European Stock Markets."
"In 2004, the gas and electricity markets will be opened for all European businesses, the Member States will have a surplus budgetary balance, the directive on taxation of energy products will come into force, and the Single European Sky will be implemented."
"In 2005, we shall achieve fully integrated financial markets, 10% of electrical interconnection capacity, and fully developed broadband networks."
"And in 2010 we shall be close to 3% of GDP devoted to research, development and innovation, we will have applied the working programme to educational systems, the reconciliation of the labour market and family life, and we will have achieved a gradual increase in the effective European retirement age."
"I sincerely believe that the goal of launching the calendar of reforms that we agreed in Lisbon has been substantially and reasonably achieved."
"I also believe that today we have 'more Europe', and above all, a 'better Europe' than we had before we held the Barcelona European Council."
"And finally, I believe that we have contributed with our agreements to boosting and to speeding up economic recovery."
"Those were precisely the major goals that the Spanish Presidency had for the Barcelona Council."
"The Member States, showing the required ambition and flexibility, have made a decisive contribution to reaching these balanced and positive agreements."
"The European Commission has submitted documents that have constituted an excellent working basis for the European Council, and has very actively backed European commitments and progress."
"Naturally, the European Parliament, with its extraordinarily important proposals and activities, has played a dynamic role as a full participant in all the fields of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I would like, therefore, to end my speech as I began it: with my sincere thanks for your contribution towards achieving results, which I sincerely believe have been worth the effort."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to discuss the outcome of the recent European Council in Barcelona."
"For my part, I would like to start by paying tribute to a man whom many of you in this Chamber knew: his name was Marco Biagi - he was a friend of mine - and he was murdered last night in Bologna."
"He was 52 years old and married with two children."
"A professor at Modena University, he was an expert in employment law and adviser to the Labour Minister in the present Italian government, as he had been adviser to other Labour Ministers in previous governments, including the government I headed."
"He had worked all his life to encourage the dialogue between the social partners in his and my country, Italy, and in Europe."
"Appointed by the European Commission, he was a member of the High Level Group on the future of industrial relations which prepared the report on social dialogue, the very report we debated together a few days ago at Barcelona."
"To pay tribute to Marco Biagi, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we must strive to preserve the unity between our societies and combat terrorism together; we must strive to defeat terrorism, the unrelenting enemy of democracy."
"As we know, social development and justice and mutual solidarity must go hand in hand in our society."
"These are the values on which we want to build Europe: a free, democratic Europe, a Europe whose principles exclude the use of violence as part of the necessary exchange of ideas."
"These are the values we must never, ever forget, especially at times like these."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today, then, to report to you the outcome of the European Council held at the end of last week in Barcelona."
"As Prime Minister Aznar said, the Barcelona European Council was a success."
"A success for Europe in that it was a major step towards the practical implementation of the Lisbon strategy."
"A success too for our method and for the institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"It was a success for the Commission, whose Spring Report guided the debates within the European Council and the proposals reflected in the conclusions."
"It was a success for the Council Presidency, which provided judicious guidance and organisation, and I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr Aznar and his team for their work."
"It was a success for Parliament too, which debated and endorsed practically all the proposals put forward for Barcelona during the weeks leading up to the Council."
"This means, as you rightly pointed out, President Cox, that we have moved from a 'culture of conflict to a culture of change'."
"The spirit of partnership between the institutions and our commitment to a more effective reform process has thus been indissolubly cemented."
"President Cox, I therefore wish to express my sincerest thanks to you too."
"I particularly appreciated your statement at the opening of the Council. It was the best possible start to two days of constructive work."
"You stressed that Parliament was determined to play a key role in the reforms and the progress of European integration."
"I am totally behind you on this."
"In particular, Parliament has got through a huge amount of work recently under the codecision procedure. We are all proud of this achievement and I am particularly grateful to you."
"These developments give me much satisfaction, especially as they shorten the 'delivery gap' between the announcement of a policy and its actual implementation."
"Last November and then again in the Spring Report, I highlighted the dangers of allowing long periods of time to elapse between policy statements and practical implementation."
"Indeed, my overriding fear is that we will keep creating fresh expectations among the citizens and then disappointing them."
"If we really want to bring Europe closer to the people, we must decide and act smartly."
"Today, I am glad that we set a clear timetable for the coming years at Barcelona with clear deadlines."
"This timetable has already been outlined by Prime Minister Aznar."
"Let me now focus very briefly on a few highlights, Mr President."
"At Barcelona, we set a date for the opening up of the electricity and gas markets."
"This project had been at a standstill for months. It prevented European firms from benefiting from reduced costs and the resulting gains in productivity."
"By the end of 2004, non-household consumers will have the freedom to choose their suppliers."
"I would also point out, however, that the opening up of the markets will be regulated to ensure that public service obligations are fulfilled."
"Indeed, this Commission has already shown on past occasions that it is particularly sensitive to the need, or rather the obligation, to reconcile the demands of competition and productivity with the responsibilities attached to the provision to services of general interest."
"Moreover, Barcelona has put the Galileo project back on track and given it new impetus."
"This unexpected result represents a major step forward and its political and economic implications are great."
"I would also draw your attention to the great milestone achieved in the opening up of the financial markets."
"The Council reaffirmed its commitment to implementing the Financial Services Action Plan and achieving fully integrated markets."
"This means that the securities and risk capital markets will be integrated by 2003 and the financial services markets by 2005."
"The decision may have received less press coverage than the decision on the electricity market but its importance must certainly not be underestimated: in terms of economic impact it is even more important, for a Europe-wide integrated capital market coupled with the single currency will bring great benefits for consumers and investors."
"In the run-up to the Barcelona Council, progress was also made on consolidating the interconnection of Europe's telecommunications and electricity networks."
"This matter may seem rather technical, but it will step up market integration and improve productivity for European industry."
"Lastly, agreement was reached on a new e-Europe 2005 action plan consolidating our strategy for the dissemination of new technologies in areas such as commerce, health care and public administration."
"Furthermore, the Council also came to an agreement which will improve its coordination of economic policies, particularly in the euro zone."
"The Barcelona results are therefore a major achievement and must not be played down."
"Indeed, we cannot continue always to bank on success and just focus on areas where we are lagging behind or failing to deliver the goods."
"The Spring Councils have already become important political occasions for reviewing and giving new impetus to the process we are pursuing."
"The coordination of economic policies is a crucial part of this process."
"As I have said on a number of occasions, the time has come to capitalise on the tremendous success of the launch of the euro."
"Now that the euro is in circulation, action is needed at policy level. We must turn our attention to the matter of defining and implementing an economic policy for the euro zone involving greater coordination of Member States' economic policies."
"In particular, we need to work on the basis of a set of agreed principles and rules for Member States' budgetary policies."
"I welcome the European Council's expression of its support for this idea, which will make structural budgetary policies more consistent and less unpredictable."
"This shows that the Spring Councils have taken on the responsibility of providing political guidance for this process of shaping the governance of Europe's economy."
"They are also ready to play their part in carrying out an annual review of this overall economic strategy."
"The economic base underpinning the euro is thus strengthened and a virtuous circle created between monetary policy and the actual economy."
"Mr President, at Barcelona, we gave strong impetus to the economic reforms that were lagging behind schedule, but we did not give those objectives precedence over the social issues."
"Issues such as job creation and creating the conditions to enable people to stay competitive on the labour market were high on our agenda, together with environmental issues."
"Moreover, as the Commission's Spring Report said, the fact that we have decided to concentrate on some priorities certainly does not mean that we have forgotten the others."
"We need to keep up the pace of reforms in all areas for, as we are well aware, this integrated approach is vital if we are to achieve our ultimate goal."
"Our efforts must be two-fold: we must act swiftly to follow up the Barcelona results and continue to strive towards achieving the other objectives of our strategy."
"This is not a zero-sum game: it is a positive-sum game."
"In our policy decisions, giving priority to one area does not mean neglecting another."
"We will thus continue to bind the social and environmental strands into our overall policy decisions."
"Clearly, other actions must follow: we must never forget that our strategy spans a ten-year period."
"Our achievements will be assessed when the decade is up. Let us not lose sight of that fact."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it was with deep revulsion and regret that we learnt of the murder of Marco Biagi, and our sympathy goes to his family."
"My group has a message for all terrorists, in Europe and throughout the world - we will never give in to terrorism."
"Giving in to terrorism means undermining the democratic order."
"We will use every democratic and constitutional means at our disposal to resolutely combat terrorism in Europe and worldwide."
"I would like to thank the President of Parliament, Pat Cox, very warmly for the very practical and political proposals he presented to the European Council."
"I believe that they provided a good basis for debate."
"The President-in-Office of the European Council and the President of the Commission, whom we wish a safe journey to Italy to pay his respects to his murdered friend and his family, have already indicated how indebted we are to Mr Cox for his contribution."
"However, I would also like to say a special word of thanks to the President-in-Office of the European Council and to pay homage to the fact that he is speaking to us here in the European Parliament three times during the Spanish Presidency."
"Today is the second time."
"I hope that this will set a good example for future presidencies."
"The Barcelona Summit was one which we too in general view positively."
"But a good many wishes have still of course to be fulfilled."
"The language used is interesting."
"Mr President-in-Office, the European Council is calling on us - Parliament and the Council - to open the energy market for supply companies within a specific time frame."
"We would have been grateful if the European Council had also called upon us to open the European energy market for consumers, because we would have been very happy to do that."
"The indecisiveness of the Council, which can be attributed to a single Member State - and I know that the President-in-Office of the European Council has made every effort in this respect- and this negative attitude have been obscured by this request to the Council and the European Parliament."
"We really wanted more than that."
"We wish to warmly congratulate you on your decision."
"Mr President-in-Office, I am also aware of the personal commitment that you made to ensuring that the Galileo Programme now has a future, which is of strategic importance for Europe."
"I am pleased that it has been possible to overcome both the political and financial obstacles."
"We are also delighted to see you declaring your belief in stability and calling for a near-balanced budget for all the Member States of the European Union by 2004."
"But we would have been a great deal happier if the Barcelona European Council could have said that it welcomed the Commission's approach in wishing to send two Member States of the European Union a warning letter, which, as we all know, was ultimately blocked by the finance ministers because of the specific attitude of one Member State. We hope that this positive statement about a near-balanced budget will also be implemented in practice in future, with the Commission receiving support for its efforts to achieve stability in its relations with the Member States of the European Union."
"It would also lend credibility to the European Council if the finance ministers were also to take appropriate and concrete measures."
"Mr President-in-Office, we sincerely welcome the fact that the Heads of State and Government have adopted such a strong line on the Middle East."
"We are very much in favour of the Palestinians being given a state in a dignified manner, and we are also very much in favour of Israel being able to live within secure borders."
"But that involves combating terrorism on both sides."
"We do not think it is right, and I am glad that you referred to this, for the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, to be placed under house arrest, and for it still to be doubtful whether he will be able to take part in the Arab summit in Beirut."
"We need to ensure that he can participate in that summit."
"We have of course decided to invite Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres to the European Parliament."
"We want to be free to invite these figures, and also need to be sure that they can return home again afterwards."
"(Applause from the right)"
"I would like to address two other aspects that follow on from Barcelona."
"The first of these is the reform of the Council."
"Mr President-in-Office, back in January you said that you were in favour of an interinstitutional working group bringing together the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and we have heard from your side that this is now actually to take place."
"However, we have received information that this is to be blocked at a certain level, and I do not mean a political level."
"We wish to encourage you to go ahead with this interinstitutional working group at political level, amongst other things by ensuring that the President of the Parliament is represented by a Member of this House, so that we can achieve positive results in Seville."
"If we can achieve good results in Seville, that will be to the credit of the Spanish Presidency and also to your personal credit."
"We all stand to benefit from that."
"A conference on the Mediterranean dialogue is to be held in Valencia on 21 and 22 April, to be chaired by your Minister of Foreign Affairs, but I am sure you will also be present."
"I have just returned from Algeria and my impression is that however much we are looking towards the candidate countries from the East, we also need to look to the South, as developments in some countries in the southern Mediterranean area are so dramatic that that will also have to be a focus for our policy."
"We cannot be satisfied with theoretical policy decisions; we also need wide-ranging cooperation as regards our economies, the financial sector and also between the peoples involved."
"I would urge you to pay careful attention to the Barcelona Process in the context of the Mediterranean dialogue."
"My group will certainly support you in this, and we wish you every success for the second half of your presidency."
"If you listen a little to us and to the Commission, then I am sure that it will be a very successful presidency."
"I wish the Spanish Presidency every success."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like on behalf of the Socialist Group to express our solidarity and condolences, in association with the European Parliament's statement, in relation to the murder of Professor Biagi, and point out that terrorism will not beat us."
"Furthermore, we condemn the cowardice and impunity which are unfortunately still prevailing in opposition to the idea of freedom and the European cause."
"With regard to the Barcelona Summit, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am going to begin where you left off."
"You spoke of public opinion."
"I believe that the Barcelona Summit, as well as turning Barcelona into an open and cosmopolitan capital for Europe, has demonstrated something which refutes a criticism which we usually make: it is always said that the citizens are not interested in what we do."
"They have shown that this is not true with the euro and they have demonstrated it in Barcelona."
"Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated peacefully in Barcelona, and that shows that what we do in the European Union is of interest to them, and it also shows something else: that we do not need to suspend the Schengen Agreement, because the people know how to behave correctly and lawfully."
"As for the content of the Summit, I believe that the Barcelona Council has managed to put the Lisbon process back on track and, since you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are currently the driver of the Council train, I must point out that my group was enormously concerned about the clear risk of the whole train derailing as a result of the statement you yourself made saying that you were in confrontation with the Socialist majority in the Council in terms of the Barcelona Summit."
"I believe that to organise the process in a balanced fashion helps all of us within a process which must maintain the balance between growth and social protection in order to guarantee full employment and sustainable development."
"For us, combining policies is very important."
"We believe that liberalisation, which means regulated deregulation, makes sense if it offers better services at a better price."
"But it requires - and this is in the Council's conclusions - better regulation and monitoring."
"It requires that public monopolies are not replaced with private monopolies and above all it requires -and I address this to the Commission - the realisation of the proposed framework directive safeguarding services of general interest."
"(Applause)"
"We believe that this is absolutely fundamental."
"With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, we are in favour of growth."
"Why do you not review that pact?"
"I have never understood - and I believe that the people do not understand either - why, if a country has a deficit approaching 3%, it has to be fined."
"All that would do is make things difficult for the country."
"Therefore, a pact that was established according to the ideas of German conservatives requires a degree of revision in order for it to make more sense."
"(Applause)"
"Having said this, Mr President, in relation to the labour market, I believe that reforms also have to be made, but I would draw your attention to the situation of the Directive on the regulation of working time, I would also draw your attention to something positive, which is the network of childcare centres, and I believe we should consider the issue of the retirement age given that Europe's population is ageing."
"Mr President, I will conclude by saying two things: the first is that we fully support the Declaration on the Middle East, and the second is that my Group does not understand why Ecofin can do more than the European Council in terms of creating a Euro-Mediterranean Bank."
"I believe that Ecofin must be subordinate to the European Council and not vice versa ?"
"(Applause)"
"?"
"And next I would ask the President to deliver the message that we are beginning to recover our aid - and we take it seriously - in view of Monterrey."
"A final point, Mr President."
"You have offered the Council an olive branch in the form of practical and pragmatic dialogue."
"We are going to make this a reality."
"In January, President Aznar committed himself in this House to an interinstitutional agreement on better European regulation and legislation."
"This point does not seem to be reflected in the conclusions of the Barcelona Summit."
"There is a reference to the phantasmagorical Mandelkern report in paragraph 19 and we are asked, in paragraph 35, to approve eight directives in one fell swoop on the liberalisation of financial services."
"Why do we not actually sit down and reach an interinstitutional agreement to improve European legislation?"
"We are prepared to do so. The ball is in the Council's court."
"Mr President, I would like to associate myself with the sentiments of the previous speakers on the subject of Mr Marco Biagi."
"President, I congratulate you on the success of your first summit as President of this House."
"You set out to establish this Parliament as a credible and reliable partner in the interinstitutional dialogue and to demonstrate that Parliament, for its part, has closed what Mr Prodi described as the ""delivery gap""."
"You succeeded admirably on both counts."
"President-in-Office, Liberal Democrats welcome a number of solid achievements at Barcelona."
"The increase in overseas development aid to an EU average of 0.39% of gross national income is a positive step."
"If the Union can go on to meet the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income, we will no longer deprive the poor of EUR 100 billion per annum in development assistance."
"We also applaud the Summit's emphasis on making work pay and on reducing the tax burden on the low-paid, and the agreement on the energy tax directive."
"We need more economic growth but it must not be at the expense of our natural environment which we hold in trust for future generations."
"On the Middle East, we welcome the declaration made by the European Council."
"We urge the Israelis and the Palestinians to start fresh talks based on United Nations Security Council Regulation 1397, to accept international observers, to respect the Geneva Convention and to renounce terrorism and indiscriminate violence."
"I would also like to congratulate the High Representative, Mr Solana, on the deal he brokered between Serbia and Montenegro: truly a first for European Union diplomacy."
"British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the Barcelona Summit as a ""make-or-break"" occasion."
"He may now regret that hyperbole, because although Barcelona undoubtedly represents a step forward on the road to economic reform, it is clear that this road will be long and winding."
"We must ensure that the delivery gap identified by Mr Prodi does not turn into a credibility gap due to the Council's failure to meet the multitude of targets that it sets at every Summit."
"One such example of a credibility gap is the partial agreement on energy liberalisation."
"What credibility will it have in the eyes of the our citizens if we deny them the benefits of more choice and lower energy prices?"
"We urge the Council to support Parliament's call for a second stage of energy liberalisation to include domestic customers by 2005."
"The EU's credibility is also at stake in financial services."
"The pension funds directive has remained blocked in Council since it was adopted by Parliament at our first reading in July of last year."
"This is a prime example of a delivery gap which Parliament has closed but which requires more than warm words from the Council."
"The Council has other ambitious aspirations too, such as reaching agreement on the European Patent by May, and the Public Procurement Framework."
"If the credibility of these spring economic summits is not to be undermined, then Prime Ministers must apply themselves to banging heads together to make sure their national ministers make progress on these issues."
"If we are to close the gap, President-in-Office, between the European Union and its citizens, this will not be achieved by suspending people's rights to free movement, especially if those people wish to exercise their democratic rights to express their views in protest."
"Moreover, bringing the EU closer to its citizens requires progress on transparency."
"Paragraph 51 of the conclusions calls for ensuring greater transparency of the legislative process."
"However, it foresees no specific measures before June and moreover, the Secretary-General's report to Council limits the documents to be covered by transparency to those laws adopted by co-decision."
"This contravenes the regulation we adopted on access to documents last year which sees a much wider definition of legislative documents."
"You are already four months late in implementing this."
"We call on you to do so."
"Finally, in paragraph 20, the Council conclusions envisage the creation of a group of wise men."
"I wonder whether, at a time when you recognise the importance of women's participation in the labour force and when you express concern for the welfare of women in Nigeria, you might not, at least in this third millennium, talk about of a group of wise persons."
"Mr President, before I start, I and my group would like to join our fellow Members in paying tribute to Marco Biagi; after Ezio Tarantelli and Massimo D'Antona, he is the third senior law expert to have been killed in recent years."
"These men were searching for ways to strengthen and reinvigorate social dialogue and cohesion: it is efforts such as these that are now threatening terrorism and I feel that it is imperative that we do not lose sight of that in our debate on Barcelona today."
"The Barcelona European Council has confirmed something which my group believes has been a problem for some time: the inability of this kind of meeting to address major issues and produce coherent general guidelines."
"I refer, for instance, to the extraordinary omission to talk about Iraq and the negligible attention afforded to the strategy for sustainable development."
"On the other hand, there is a growing desire to address issues which are not the direct responsibility of the European Council such as how many computers schools in the European Union should have for their pupils to use in the coming years."
"This is a serious situation, not least in that it makes things even more confusing for the citizens: the citizens cannot distinguish between the parts of the conclusions that will be transformed into decisions at national level, the parts intended to be a practical guideline for the Union institutions, particularly for the Council of Ministers, and the parts which, on the other hand, are merely rhetoric and will be duly overlooked at the Summit or during the next Presidency."
"I have to say that we too were misled when we rejoiced at Gothenburg that the penny had at last dropped that there can be no sustainable approach to development and prosperity which is not integrated, which does not take the social and environmental factors into account along with economic factors."
"Apart from the small section on sustainable development, there is only one mention of the environment in the conclusions."
"It is my conviction that, despite the constructive atmosphere and spirit of Barcelona, there was no overall vision of the direction the economic reforms should take if we are to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives."
"In my opinion, the 500 000 protesters were perfectly aware of this."
"I would now like to focus briefly on the issue of liberalisation, for I wish we could, for once, free ourselves from a standard ideology and realise that, at this point in time, the problems have yet to be resolved."
"The abuse of a dominant position and the distortion of the market in favour of nuclear energy are currently our main problems."
"Indeed, we are quite aware that public companies such as EDF, EON and RVE are distorting the market by using the funds set aside for nuclear waste management and the dismantling of nuclear power stations to acquire other European companies."
"Moreover, the increase of interconnections between Spain and France to 10% will do nothing at all to change the dominant positions of Endesa and Iberdrola, and so hardly anything will change for consumers."
"I would like to end by putting two specific questions to Prime Minister Aznar, if he is listening, on the issue of the Middle East."
"I would like to know why the motion for a resolution on the Middle East contained a reference to the protocol to the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians in wartime and why this reference was not present in the final version of these conclusions."
"I would like to know the reason for this and I am sure that the matter is of interest to Parliament as a whole."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to fully support your initial comments and to express my own absolute condemnation of the appalling act of terrorism which has cast a shadow over Italy."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, in some ways, the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council tell us more about the state of the European Union than any speech on the subject."
"Let me quote three examples to illustrate my point."
"As a rule, the annual spring summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Community of Fifteen stresses the social dimension of European integration."
"So what did the Barcelona Summit achieve in this respect?"
"Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned the decision to put back the effective retirement age by five years."
"Another example is the solemn undertaking to respect the Stability and Growth Pact by limiting public and social expenditure and through wage moderation."
"Then there is the issue of introducing flexible working - what others might call precarious working conditions."
"Do you think our fellow citizens can accept this approach?"
"Mr President-in-Office, what is your assessment of the progress achieved since the Lisbon Summit two years ago towards the target of full employment announced at that time for 2010?"
"Are unemployment and poverty on the way to being overcome?"
"Why did you not refer to the figures that the Commission itself has published on this subject, for example, the 60 million people living on the poverty line in the Member States after social transfers?"
"What conclusions would you draw from this?"
"What progress have we made so far with the implementation of the social agenda agreed in Nice?"
"I would like to hear some replies that go beyond the extremely broad-brush comments contained in the conclusions of the summit."
"My second comment relates to the issue of services of general interest."
"We particularly note the call on the Commission to draw up a proposal for a framework directive on this subject."
"We will very closely follow the content and effective scope of this document."
"In that context, Mr President, on 13 November last year the European Parliament called for a rapid and precise comparative assessment of the real impact of the policy of liberalisation of services of general interest before embarking on further stages of liberalisation."
"What has become of that study?"
"It has not been prepared and yet you have still driven forward the process of liberalisation."
"Are we to conclude from this that you have no respect for the specific requests of Members of Parliament and of Europe's citizens?"
"Turning to the electricity sector, do you not have any lessons to learn from the fiasco in California or from the collapse of Enron?"
"What is more, there are five countries operating in your own country, Spain, and all of them are private."
"The company that is most important in the Barcelona area, in particular, is incapable of guaranteeing supplies for its customers, and Catalonia was plunged into darkness last December."
"The chairman of another Spanish company has warned that worse is still to come."
"And just to put the tin lid on it, your government is about to pay these companies EUR 7.8 billion raised from Spanish taxpayers to help them prepare for even greater deregulation."
"Is that true or false, Mr President-in-Office?"
"Is this the model whose widespread implementation is supposed to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world, to quote the rather high-flown and somewhat presumptuous phrases at present in vogue in our institutions?"
"Finally, before, during and after the Barcelona Summit there was what ""El País"" in its headlines rightly called a major demonstration in favour of a different kind of globalisation."
"And this was - this is my own point here - despite the unacceptable limitations that you imposed on the freedom of movement of hundreds of European citizens."
"In what way, Mr President, did you take into account this unprecedented call from our respective societies to leading European decision makers?"
"It certainly seems that the motto of the European Union in Barcelona was based on the three words you yourself used to define your philosophy at a recent conference at the Estorial, if I may quote you: ""liberalisation, privatisation and competition""."
"This may make entrepreneurs' and shareholders' mouths water, but it certainly will not appeal to most of our fellow citizens."
"That is because a good many of us have different ambitions for Europe, which involve offering the world an alternative to the liberalising, predatory and ruthless approach which underpins globalisation at present."
"We in my group and others fully support the demonstrations by the public, activists and trade unions which represent the new order the day."
"See you in Seville!"
"Mr President, after the Barcelona Summit, two events have taken place whose severity has shaken not just Italy but the rest of Europe too."
"The murder of Professor Marco Biagi focuses the debate on terrorism once again."
"The fatal, tragic attack took place on the day that one of his articles was published in the leading financial daily, Il Sole 24 Ore, in which Biagi presented a clear analysis of the need for Italy and for Europe as a whole to achieve rapid reforms making it possible, at last, to boost employment and liberalise the labour market, in order to combat the scourge which has been tormenting all 15 Member States for years: the millions of unemployed and the new poor."
"We must tackle terrorism vigorously and clear-sightedly, both the terrorism which strikes and kills thousands of people, as in New York, and the terrorism which destroys individual lives, not just seriously jeopardising the reforms but threatening democracy itself."
"Along with the many initiatives envisaged by the Spanish Presidency with a view to bringing about ever-increasing integration and greater development of information systems for combating terrorism, the Barcelona measures must be speeded up without delay; moreover, we are determined that, although Professor Biagi's life has been lost, his ideals and projects for reform will live on."
"The second tragedy is the landing of ships containing almost 1 000 Kurds, including 360 children who were being used by the adults as shields, and the presence of further ships waiting to discharge their passengers on Italian and European soil: further thousands of wretched people who include, moreover, common terrorists and criminals who have taken advantage of this historic exodus to hide among the crowd."
"The arrival of these ships forces us to focus once again on that major phenomenon of our time: immigration which is caused not just by poverty but by the complicity of the governments of certain countries and by the appalling living conditions imposed by certain regimes which force their people to live in inhuman conditions."
"Indeed, there can be no cooperation with those who do not control their own borders or those who violate every kind of human and civil rights."
"The Commission and the Council must make the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue their absolute top priority, promoting growth, employment and socio-economic structures which are more compatible with market economies."
"We feel that a limited financial instrument such as a Euro-Mediterranean investment fund would be inadequate and that it is now essential to create a genuine Euro-Mediterranean development bank with its own autonomy and resources."
"We would stress, moreover, the urgent need to launch the Western Balkans stabilisation project, for that region is crucial to security and peace."
"We call for the commitments made by the Feira European Council in 2000 to be made good, not least in view of the forthcoming accessions."
"We would point out that there are still bottlenecks in the transport networks in some regions such as the Alps, and these bottlenecks are impairing the free movement of goods and distorting the functioning of the internal market."
"We have too long been accustomed to hearing optimistic plans and dispassionate predictions after each Summit."
"Now, the conditions are right for our best intentions to be realised."
"It would be a shame if, as is often the case, the optimism were to be reduced to an attitude of cynicism and the predictions were then not borne out by reality."
"We hope that the Spanish government, which has all the potential necessary to respond to these urgent needs, and this entire House will bring about the freedom and justice, democracy and progress compatible with human dignity as that is what we and what the citizens desire."
"Mr President, the summit has now appointed a working party that is to produce reforms of the Council's work, which are greatly needed."
"At present 70% of all legislation in the EU is adopted by officials in the Council's working parties, 15% is adopted by the ambassadorial musketeers in COREPER, while 15% reaches the Council of Ministers."
"I do not have the percentages for what the ministers see. However, I know that legislative power belongs with the electorate and elected representatives, but that in the EU it has been seized by officials and their changing ministers."
"We could replace our own ministers, but we can never vote for new legislation via elections."
"If a law appears not to be a good law, it can only be amended if we get the Commission to table a proposal and have it adopted on the strength, as a rule, of 62 out of 87 votes, cast behind the closed doors of the Council."
"The European Parliament is able, with an absolute majority, to submit amendments and reject a law during the conciliation procedure, but the European Parliament has not been given the legislative power of which the electorate and our elected representatives in the Member States have been deprived."
"We still have a growing democratic deficit."
"I should like to propose that every EU law be dealt with in parallel by the national parliaments."
"It is there that people can follow what is going on. It is there that democracy begins."
"The next reform is, then, to open up the Council's deliberations to the public."
"Laws should be debated in public, just as they are in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament."
"The voting should also be publicly accessible."
"Elected representatives should have access to all the documents of the Council's working parties. Why not, moreover, also look at the Ombudsman's proposals for administrative reform?"
"During the debates on the regulation on public access to administrative documents, Germany, France and Spain were the three biggest opponents of greater openness."
"Now, Mr Aznar López has an opportunity to give Spain a different image."
"It could be the June summit in Seville that goes down in history as the place where the EU was genuinely opened up to its citizens."
"I hope, too, that it will be the place where we put an end to the big countries' attempts to conquer the presidency of the EU."
"There should be no group presidencies in which each of the five large countries gets four or five small states to join them in a group presidency. There would then be the risk of the large country's taking the lion's share of the power."
"Small countries must also be able to represent the common foreign and security policy to the outside world."
"We must be seen as a form of cooperation between independent countries - not as a new state."
"If the large countries want to act jointly, they must merge to form a common state."
"They must not be allowed to use our common institutions to marginalise the smaller Member States."
"Mr President, in his last editorial published yesterday in the Sole 24 Ore, Professor Marco Biagi listed the results of the Barcelona Summit and called for the Member States, particularly Italy, to pay more heed to the Council's demands for labour market reforms."
"He paid for his ideas on labour market flexibility and welfare reform, for his efforts to help governments make his ideas reality, with his life."
"Our unfailing response to violence must be to turn devotedly to democracy, to its familiar rules, to its dialectic and its capacity to enable dialogue and disputes - even where there is bitter feeling - to be conducted in a non-violent manner."
"However, we cannot fail to condemn the way, in recent days, people in positions of great responsibility in Italy with wide media coverage have adopted a cynical, populist approach to the reforms called for by the European institutions and strongly advocated by Marco Biagi, labelling them barbarous, cruel and a violation of fundamental rights."
"President-in-Office of the Council, we are in danger of making Lisbon an all-purpose slogan; indeed, it might be better if we were to stop invoking the decision made by European leaders two years ago to make the European economy the best and most innovative economy in the world within the space of ten years, almost as if the previous leaders might have planned to do the opposite."
"In my opinion, we should only discuss reforms and goals which have or have not been achieved."
"I do not want to undermine the decisions of the Barcelona Summit, but I feel that we are once again in danger of setting new priorities and new goals without having made tangible, incisive progress on what we had planned to do."
"I am referring, of course, by way of example, to the liberalisation of the electricity markets."
"We do welcome the fact that some steps forward have been taken, but our predominant feeling is one of dissatisfaction at what has not been done, at the failure to achieve full liberalisation for household users too."
"I therefore feel that our conclusion must be that the best possible result was achieved at Barcelona, but that this result is not good enough if our goal is to see Europe compete on the international markets, most importantly the United States market."
"We must do more, we must step on the reform peddle."
"As regards the coordination of economic policies, as mentioned by President Prodi, I want to remind myself, the House and the President-in-Office of the Council that Europe does not need coordinated economic policies so much as sound economic policies, and history has shown that the two do not always go together."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I would like to thank the various spokespersons for their comments and contributions to the debate on the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council."
"I think it is important to refer first of all to an issue that you have all mentioned; the fight against terrorism, which, as you know, is the fundamental priority at the moment, as the Spanish Presidency has pointed out; let us make it our priority of priorities."
"I have had the opportunity to say on certain occasions, in relation to the decisions taken in view of 11 September, that the European Union has been able to respond to the circumstances when required to do so in terms of the progress made in the fight against terrorism."
"I believe that extraordinary progress has been made on this point, which would have been unimaginable a few months ago, and I would like to point out that, clearly, and unfortunately, it is not the Spanish Presidency which has to be encouraged to adopt measures to combat terrorism; it must instead be a sustained and active effort on all parts, with full consideration given to anyone suffering as a result of terrorism, whoever they may be, which is never justified in any way."
"We must understand that all terrorism is the same, that it must be fought in all its forms and that its only fate must be destruction and ultimate eradication."
"We have sufficient instruments for doing this, which can be updated if necessary."
"In relation to the Barcelona European Council, I would like to refer to the issue of the Summit and its location."
"The Barcelona European Council, as an international meeting, had certain precedents which had to be taken into account: the meeting in Seattle, the European Council in Nice, the one in Gothenburg and the meeting in Genoa."
"I would like to point out that, in June 2001, the World Bank decided, of its own accord, to suspend the meeting it was going to hold in Barcelona."
"Therefore, as well as applauding the civil attitude of the city of Barcelona and its people in the clearest way possible, and whilst applauding the peaceful spirit of the great majority of demonstrators in Barcelona, I wish to say that there are obviously other groups that are not so peaceful and, it must be said, are not interested in being peaceful and are not even interested in demonstrating, but rather they believe they can carry out violence with impunity."
"If Barcelona has been a much calmer city, although 17 members of the Spanish security forces have been injured, if it has been much calmer than on other occasions, it has been because all the relevant measures have been taken, including preventing the people who were intent on violence, with all its consequences for Barcelona, from reaching the city, and that is a service to citizens everywhere and also, in this case, to the Spanish citizens, the European citizens and democratic legitimacy."
"Furthermore, I hope, and feel that, there are undoubtedly different ways in a democracy to express needs, demands, aspirations and objectives."
"There is one I especially believe in, and that is the one which derives and bestows the democratic legitimacy of its representatives by means of the ballot box."
"I would like to say sincerely, and with total respect for demonstrations of all types, that majorities and minorities in a democracy are decided on in elections, by the citizens who vote, and the hundreds of thousands of citizens who took to the streets in Barcelona are as worthy of respect as the millions and millions of European citizens represented by their legitimate representatives in the European Council, who have not taken to the streets anywhere and who have attentively followed the debates in Barcelona and peacefully wish Europe to prosper and continue to make progress with the process of reform which has been evident in Barcelona."
"(Applause)"
"Therefore, the citizens will determine through the ballot box whether or not there will be new majorities, which is something I would hope everybody knows and accepts."
"I believe that one of the fundamental characteristics of Barcelona, ladies and gentlemen, is that we have moved closer to the spirit of the citizens and when we talk about political elements, about the decisions of the Barcelona Council, we must take account of the fact that all of them affect the citizen directly."
"When we talk about transport, energy or employment, or when we talk about savings and investments or research, or when we talk about education, we are always talking about the citizens."
"On the subject of full employment, can there be any greater social ambition than full employment?"
"I can say quite frankly that I would prefer to have the satisfaction of full employment and twenty million jobs in Europe than full subsidisation."
"I will do whatever I can to take account of achieving full employment in the creation of policies in all the European countries and in the European Union."
"What can we do to create full employment?"
"There are issues which are clearly fundamental: one is maintaining the correct approach decided on at the Lisbon European Council, which is the strategy of reforms, of openness, of liberalisation, and we are clearly adding the objective of sustainable development."
"But there are issues which we must not forget, especially at times of recovery; stability and stability policies do not need to be modified, in my opinion."
"They need to be ratified because they are the essential basis for having healthy economies and allowing stronger and faster economic recovery in our countries."
"Reasonable budgetary stability requires low interest rates everywhere, reasonably low inflation rates and greater possibilities for growth and consequently employment."
"But if we send the message that reaching a 3% deficit is no problem, by the same token it could be assumed that reaching 5% is no problem."
"I believe that it is a problem and if growth opportunities are missed, we will miss employment opportunities and opportunities for greater prosperity for companies and for families."
"The same is true in the case of liberalisation policies, which I believe means offering opportunities, as far as possible, both to companies and to domestic consumers."
"To replace a public monopoly with a private one is not liberalisation."
"It is the opposite of liberalisation."
"The main problem is not whether a company is public or private, but whether it is a monopoly, and liberalisation is just the policy to put an end to monopolies, whether the result is private, public or a combination of the two side by side."
"And what we have to do in Europe is firstly to prevent monopolies, and therefore to liberalise, with all its consequences, and this would create better services at lower prices, and at the same time promote electrical interconnections, because there clearly may be markets with monopolistic tendencies, which hinder competition and are poorly connected electrically."
"Spain, which some of you have given as an example, has 3% electrical interconnection."
"What has been agreed?"
"To achieve 10%."
"What does that mean?"
"It means an extraordinary change from the point of view of energy."
"That, together with liberalisation and competition, is an objective benefit which I hope will reach all the citizens of Europe as soon as possible."
"It will reach 70% of the market in 2004 and I hope it will reach 100% in accordance with the decision we take before the European Council in the spring, which is exactly what we agreed in Barcelona."
"Finally, I would like to say that from the point of view of the significance of the process of balance, the commitment to balance between the three pillars of the Lisbon strategy, economic growth and reforms, employment and sustainable development, I believe we can be reasonably satisfied."
"Some issues have been raised in relation to Galileo and the Middle East."
"I fully support the statement on the Middle East."
"Draft declarations are being presented for debate by the Heads of State and Government, and those drafts are subject to corrections on one, two or seven points, about which I clearly cannot go into more detail. I believe that a good statement has been made on the Middle East."
"It is a statement which has had, and is having, an effect in relation to the current situation of the region and we hope to be able to continue working in the immediate future to improve the situation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, from an institutional point of view, I would simply reiterate the position I explained in this House in January."
"I would like to point out that there is already a meeting scheduled for 5 April to deal with the European Parliament's access to confidential documents, on a temporary basis, and the objectives of interinstitutional cooperation for better regulation which will be attended by Spanish Secretaries of State, the Secretary-General of Parliament, the Secretary-General of the Commission and the Secretaries-General of the political groups in the European Parliament."
"It is scheduled for 5 April and therefore, in accordance with what was established with the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission, I believe that we can also make progress with the improvement of the institutional relationship that will clearly come to fruition when this work has been concluded."
"I would like once again to thank the Commission for the work and initiative it has carried out, and the European Parliament for its encouragement and understanding."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Thank you, Mr Aznar, for being here today to report on Barcelona."
"I know that you must leave to travel to Monterrey."
"Let me, on behalf of the European Parliament, wish the presidency success on the International Conference on Financing for Development and bon voyage."
"Despite the pre-summit hype in the run-up to Barcelona, which suggested that the agenda would be considerably skewed in favour of neo-liberalism and structural reform, the outcome maintains the essentials of the policy mix established at Lisbon, namely mutually supported economic reform, full employment, social cohesion and, from Gothenburg, the issue of sustainable development."
"The one element that we would have liked to have seen further developed in the overall mix at Barcelona is that of sustainable development."
"We think that it needs to be stitched into the other policy strands and cannot simply be dealt with as an add-on."
"Barcelona did, of course, touch upon the issue of liberalisation concerning the opening of the electricity and gas markets."
"I have two points to make in that respect."
"The first is that, alongside the liberalisation debates, we very much welcome the key decisions reached in Barcelona to guarantee high-quality public services in the European Union as a fundamental guarantee for citizens, and in the interests of territorial and social cohesion."
"The second is that, for us, liberalisation in sectors such as energy is not an end itself."
"It must be harnessed to the achievement of improved qualitative and sustainable growth, improved social cohesion and a better, cheaper, more effective service for citizens."
"Prime Minister Aznar spoke about targets for 'inter-connectiveness'."
"From what I hear, however, liberalisation in Spain has led to a number of broken connections, with blackouts occurring in Madrid and in other areas."
"That is the sort of thing we need to avoid."
"The EPP and ourselves have tabled a compromise text which I hope will win support in this House."
"There are two further points from that text which I would like to emphasise."
"First, there is a need to strengthen Europe-wide economic investment policy in order to encourage public and private investment as a crucial element in the stimulation of economic activity."
"Second, there is a need to recognise that labour market reforms have to be geared towards the creation of better-quality jobs, with a clear emphasis on the requirement for substantial investment in people and their potentials."
"This the point Parliament made in the Bullman report."
"This investment particularly needs to go towards education, training and life-long learning."
"The proposal adopted by the Commission today concerning temporary agency workers is an important contribution in this respect."
"It will help promote a proper balance between flexibility for enterprises and a proper degree of security for workers working within and moving between those enterprises."
"It will also bring about improved employability."
"It is therefore a very welcome step."
"The essentials of the policy mix remain in place, and the compromise resolution which is tabled before us clearly sets out the steps we need to take in the weeks and months ahead."
"I hope the House will support it."
"Many of the achievements of Barcelona are, of course, welcome, and I join with those who have been recognising the enormous efforts of the Spanish presidency and the European Commission in pushing forward those achievements."
"We should be no under illusions, however: the method by which these summits are organised is now in crisis."
"We are all suffering from ""summititis"", a condition in which wildly inflated expectations puff up before each summit."
"It must be said that this situation is not helped by some rather hyperbolic rhetoric from certain European Union capitals, for example describing the summit as a ""make-or-break event""."
"These expectations are then inevitably dashed when set against the realities of grubby deal-making in the European Council."
"This harms the credibility of all of us."
"It really is time to stop the illusion that suggests that European Union competitiveness can somehow be invented at annual spring European Union summits."
"That is not how to create competitiveness."
"Creating competitiveness requires a much more prosaic approach."
"The Lisbon 2002 objective requires constant hard slog and a consistently-applied approach across many policy fields, not an endless diet of symbolic and tokenistic rhetoric."
"My final point: competitiveness is not just about how you launch initiatives and how many targets you set."
"It is also about how legislation and regulation is designed and crafted to ensure that it has the impact for which it is intended."
"Too often, European Union legislation and regulation have effects which run directly counter to the wider aspiration of competitiveness."
"I was glad to hear this view echoed by Mr Barón Crespo earlier."
"I welcome Paragraph 19 of the Barcelona summit conclusions and look forward to the new interinstitutional approach, which we hope will install regulatory impact assessments applicable to the work of all European Union institutions."
"We look forward to that initiative appearing at the Seville summit."
"Mr President, Mr Aznar gave us a rather flattering picture of the Barcelona Summit."
"I do not share his enthusiasm."
"Neither the form nor the content of this meeting were worthy of the capital of Catalonia."
"As far as the form was concerned, the city suffered several days of terrible disruption: there were traffic restrictions and a climate of insecurity because of the presence of a massive security force."
"Catalonia, one of the most Europhile nations in Europe, was treated with contempt."
"You, Mr President, were received by the Council."
"The same cannot be said of the President of Catalonia."
"That is a pity, but I believe that my compatriots will draw the obvious conclusions from that."
"In order to be recognised, we have to establish a Catalan republic by democratic means and join the Union on an equal footing."
"Mr Aznar's capitalist ardour was slightly cooled by his colleagues who face elections soon."
"Nevertheless, the dismantling of public companies is continuing, which means, whether you like it or not, the winding up of public services."
"The average length of working life is to be extended by five years."
"In order to keep older people working, payments will be paid to the young unemployed."
"Flexibility and mobility are the bywords of European employment policy and we are relying on employers, if possible, to carry out the restructuring process in a humane fashion."
"The result of this policy is insecurity for everyone, stress, poorer human relations, violence, and perhaps, in the future, a Europe-wide disaster of the kind we have witnessed in Argentina."
"Mr President, when I look at the stars that make up our flag, I see a different kind of Europe, a fraternal Europe based on culture, solidarity, mutual exchange and giving."
"That is the Europe that the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in Barcelona want to see."
"It is tomorrow's Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we may well agree on the importance of the Barcelona Council, but there is obvious disagreement regarding the assessment of its outcome. The large and peaceful demonstrations calling for a more social Europe are abundant proof of that."
"The Presidency of the Council talks of Barcelona as a sequel to Lisbon. It claims to be striving for competitiveness through reforms affecting social protection and liberalisation."
"Both approaches challenge the European social model. Further, they fail to take into account that at Lisbon, a 3% sustained growth of GDP was considered necessary to achieve full employment by 2010."
"Currently, however, a 1.3% growth of GDP and a 0.2% growth in employment are predicted for 2002. Unemployment is, therefore, set to increase across the Community."
"It is not enough for the Presidency to state simply that the economic situation is in the first stages of global recovery after the steep decline in 2001."
"A more flexible labour market and moderate wage claims distribute the social product in a regressive manner. They also reduce job security and contribute to the emergence of pockets of exclusion and unemployment in society."
"A cut in unemployment benefit is proposed too, punishing the unemployed still further. In addition, there are plans to reduce employment costs, increase the retirement age and make early retirement less attractive."
"In my view, all these policies run counter to the objective of full employment to which the Union claims to aspire. Full employment calls for stable high-quality jobs, with full rights."
"An over-literal interpretation of the Stability Pact does not even spare public investment when it comes to setting excessive deficits."
"This would be a reasonable and sensible approach. It would allow the Union to regain an adequate flow of investment despite the current economic uncertainty, the inevitable demands of enlargement and the declared aim of increasing general commitment to research and development and innovation."
"The European Union must agree to prioritise growth and employment, promoting the genuine integration of the economies of the Member States."
"The Spanish Presidency attempted to bring about further liberalisation of the energy and transport markets."
"It has been obliged to moderate its aims following the Summit. Nonetheless, it does not seem appropriate for the European Union to go ahead with the liberalisation of these sectors without first considering the problems which arose during the first wave of deregulation."
"The Barcelona Council should have assessed the present state of public services and general interest services before adopting new measures."
"The mantra that liberalisation leads to higher quality services at a lower cost is propounded as a scientific truth."
"There are, however, many examples where precisely the opposite has proved the case. The supply of electricity in Spain and the British railway and health systems are but two of these."
"It is important for us to revive the sense of public service as we build Europe, and also to foster debate on the features and objectives of general interest services."
"We should be mindful that at Barcelona the need to continue working 'with a view to consolidating and specifying the principles on services of general economic interest, which underlie Article 16 of the Treaty, in a proposal for a framework directive? was recognised."
"Of course, there have been a number of positive outcomes to Barcelona. I could mention the European Health Insurance Card, the go-ahead for Galileo, provided of course that it remains under civilian control, developments over Gibraltar, the declarations on the Middle East, inadequate though they are, and development aid."
"Nonetheless, there have been some worrying omissions in the field of foreign affairs."
"The European Council made no reference to two serious situations, namely the United States' declared intention of resorting to nuclear weapons and the threat of an immediate attack on Iraq."
"How could the European Council have failed to charge the CFSP High Representative with making representations to the United States urging them to cease creating tension in the world and adjust their strategy in order to reduce the risk of nuclear build-up?"
"In conclusion, I am bound to say that for the reasons I outlined, the Barcelona Council has failed to meet the expectations of my group."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor in this debate as representative of a far-off region in the middle of the Mediterranean, Sardinia, to speak about issues which concern a wider area, the whole of southern Italy, but my comments will, I think, serve the genuine interests of the Community as well as the legitimate interests of certain communities and, indeed, some of the communities which are having the greatest difficulties in the 15-Member State Europe."
"I am talking about the Mediterranean question."
"The forthcoming enlargement - an excellent project which we all support - will actually have the effect of centring the European Community on a more northerly axis, both in its actions and on the map."
"We are not asking for a halt to be called to this process but we are calling for a reinvigoration of the policy for the southern Mediterranean."
"We are asking this on behalf of regions and communities which have always contributed greatly to the European Union, which believe in the Union, which want to continue to be part of it and which are simply asking to be given the opportunity to share in balanced development on a level with the other areas of the Union."
"I am making this request today, in particular, because, with a view not least to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference next month, I want to draw your attention to a project which is of particular importance to my homeland and to many southern regions, I am sure, namely a project for a gas pipeline to take methane gas from Algeria through Sardinia and Corsica to mainland Europe."
"This is a project that we have already outlined to Commissioner de Palacio - whom I would like to welcome to this House today - a project of which the Commission is already aware, a project that has already been endorsed by the Italian government and given initial funding."
"In this major Euro-Mediterranean policy, it is a project which, believe me, ladies and gentlemen - you will agree with me, Commissioner and Spanish representatives from the Council, for you are also familiar with such issues - is of appreciable importance."
"Europe is more than just northern Europe: it is the Europe of the people of the Mediterranean as well."
"Mr President, it is remarkable that on the eve of a European Summit involving Heads of State and Government, so much should be said about what needs to be decided during the Summit."
"The intention this time was that the Summit must be one that breathes new life into old objectives."
"One of these old objectives I should like to mention is the integration of the environment into socio-economic policy."
"The final declaration of the Barcelona Summit once again underlines the importance of keeping the balance between economic and social policy."
"This is to be welcomed, but something is missing: there is little trace of the integration of the environment in the conclusions."
"There are plenty of specific economic objectives, but too little attention has been devoted to the implications of economic growth on the environment."
"However, it is gratifying to see that energy taxation is being worked on."
"The taxation of energy can contribute towards energy being used in a responsible manner and towards a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases."
"The use of economic instruments as a means of achieving more efficient energy use receives my unqualified support."
"However, with regard to this decision to introduce energy taxation, I should like to ask Commissioner Loyola de Palacio what, in her opinion, the effect will be of energy taxation on the trade in the way of greenhouse emission rights?"
"On a final note, although progress was made at the Summit, it did not deal with any key political issues, although this should have been the case."
"Heads of State and Government are expected to map out the future of Europe."
"Dealing with the nuts and bolts, however important this may be, does not belong in a Summit."
"In short, there are too many summits and too few keynotes."
"Mr President, the concluding report by the President-in-Office on the Barcelona European Council makes pretty depressing hearing."
"Mr Aznar's formula for the construction of a more flexible labour market expresses with enthusiasm the obituary of the European social model."
"As a matter of fact, that is why the Spanish Government sent huge numbers of police into the streets of Barcelona with the excuse that Batisuna would unleash violence between them and anti-globalisation demonstrators."
"Fortunately, Mr Aznar has not succeeded."
"The basic clash we all witnessed in Barcelona was that of the presidency's stronghold ghetto and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people marching in the streets of Barcelona."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to express my sympathy to the family of Professor Marco Biagi, with whom I was personally acquainted."
"Mr President, I do not believe that this debate is about sounding trumpets or sweeping things under the carpet. What is at issue is as objective and balanced an assessment as possible of the results achieved at Barcelona."
"In my view, a reasonable balance between the desirable and the possible was struck at Barcelona. The European Union will now be able to make progress."
"The impact will be felt in both its internal affairs and in its external dimension. A number of decisions were taken regarding certain key areas."
"Clearly, Europe cannot be united without further progress to improve infrastructures. One of the many reasons for this is that integration of markets is not merely a political or legal concept."
"There is much talk at the moment about speeding up adjustment and about the many challenges facing a changing Europe. It is essential to have a clear idea of what can and cannot wait."
"In the process, it emerges that infrastructures cannot wait. A sluggish system would make it impossible to overcome any accumulated delays."
"The same is true of social dialogue."
"When it comes to ideas, I do not feel their hue is of much consequence."
"Of course, in referring to ideas I am excluding the statements made by Mr Gorostiaga, who speaks for the ETA terrorist group in this House. He ought to take it onto himself to express his condolences to the victims of those whose opinions he propounds in the Chamber."
"Returning to ideas, I was saying that their political hue is irrelevant. What is important is whether or not they are sound."
"I am sure that nowadays nobody would maintain that the more flexible a system, the less unemployment it involves."
"What can I think be stated quite categorically is that no single person or group can have a monopoly on social issues. Unemployment figures constitute the true indicator of any policy's social nature, together with the quantity and quality of services provided by the state for its citizens."
"We therefore prefer to leave the idealistic task of building a social paradise on the rubble of economic theories to other political groups."
"Only prosperous societies can cope effectively with the social needs of the population."
"In this connection, I believe it is important to reform so as to retain the core values of the European social model."
"It is essential to take into account that the competitiveness and productivity of our economies are crucial to moving this process forward."
"Competitiveness and protectionism simply do not go together."
"Down through the ages, the economic history of nations has made it abundantly clear that barriers and protectionism always harbour inefficiency and result in poverty."
"The fall of the Berlin wall brought everything swept under the carpet out into the light of day. I do therefore welcome the Barcelona conclusions."
"They set us on the road to regaining the competitiveness of the European economy, a process that starts in primary school. They should also get Europe back on track as regards growth, and help combat the scourge of unemployment."
"On behalf of my group I should therefore like to thank the Commission for its efforts. Thanks are also due, of course, to the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union."
"I note, Mr Gorostiaga, that you wish to make a point of order."
"If you want to make a personal statement you are entitled to do so under Rule 122 at the end of this debate."
"Mr President, the Barcelona Declaration on the Middle East is an initial attempt by the European Council to stop talking officialese and to get away from the mistaken principle of equidistance which up to now has been the hallmark of the Council's common positions."
"The European Parliament had already opened up the way with its resolution in February, as did the United Nations Security Council with its Resolution 13/97."
"At the same time, it is evident that the doves are making their presence felt in Israel itself and I am delighted that our own Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy decided yesterday to invite Yossi Beilin and Abed Rabbo, the key figures in the Coalition for Peace."
"In view of the spiral of unparalleled and ruthless violence in recent weeks, it was certainly time for more specific language, and to point the finger of blame not only at the acts of Palestinian suicide terrorists, which we condemn, but also the provocation, destructive acts, extra judicial executions, excessive use of force and the isolationist measures used by the Sharon government in relation to the Palestinians."
"During a recent trip to Ramallah, two members of my group, Mr Menéndez del Valle and Mr Sakellariou, were able to see for themselves the Palestinians' extremely precarious living conditions."
"However, what I would call the European U-turn does not mean specifically pillorying Israel's violations of international law and in particular of the Fourth Geneva Convention. It means rejecting the policy of security at all costs that Mr Sharon has adopted since his election, with the results that we know."
"I would like to quote the sentence which I believe is key to finding a solution to the present situation: ""it is essential to address the security, political and economic aspects as inseparable and interdependent elements of a single process""."
"The political aspect on which the European Union should really forcefully insist is the withdrawal of the Israeli army of occupation to within its internationally recognised borders, that is to say the 1967 borders."
"Unfortunately, it is not Mr Arafat who holds the key to ending this nightmare, but Mr Sharon."
"If, however, against all expectations, and flying in the face of the advice of the entire international community, Mr Sharon's government persists in seeking a military solution to the conflict, then, Mr President-in-Office, the European Union should suspend its Association Agreement with Israel, as one of the essential conditions of that agreement is no longer being complied with."
"I also believe that the European Union should present Mr Sharon with the bill for investments financed by European taxpayers that have been deliberately destroyed by his army."
"Mr President, it is rather odd that we find ourselves dissecting Council documents the day after summit meetings."
"I too have been doing so, having a privileged look at the transport sector, and I have seen some interesting things: the Single Sky, the Gibraltar affair, the railways, Galileo; in short, there are several good and interesting pieces of news."
"I was, however, rather concerned to read the part about the trans-European transport networks, although it started off positively enough."
"There is mention of carrying out a quick review by December 2002, and then it is said there is a need to improve transport conditions throughout the European Union and to reduce the bottlenecks in regions like the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Baltic Sea."
"In the White Paper, however, instead of 'reduce' it says 'eliminate', which is certainly better."
"I think, therefore, that we will have to work hard at this project of eliminating the bottlenecks, particularly considering the situation in the Alps."
"In this context, I should like to point out that unfortunately these declarations do not mention the Mont Blanc question."
"I must say to the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, that this is turning into some kind of joke: after three years we still do not know what is going to happen."
"Will it reopen to heavy goods vehicles or not?"
"For now, only cars can drive through."
"I really would like some clarification on this."
"Our position as inhabitants of the Val d'Aosta is well known: we want a limit imposed, for safety reasons and for reasons of environmental pollution."
"All the rest is liable to be just gossip, but it creates a feeling of real uncertainty amongst the public and also, I must say, a certain mistrust of the institutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Aznar Lopez, I too visited Barcelona, not with the intention of playing an active role in the Summit, but because the Summit coincided with a joint conference of NGOs on sustainable development which involved NGOs of employers' organisations, NGOs of environmental organisations, the European Environment Agency and the social platform."
"Sustainable development should have been the topic of this Summit too."
"Those who attended the NGO conference were bitterly disappointed by the fact that - and this has also been raised by Mr Blokland - very little actual progress has been made in the area of integration of economic, social and, above all, environmental policy."
"The Laeken Summit may have produced a few structural indicators in the field of environment, but integration has clearly not been achieved."
"A growth of 3%, or thereabouts, does not yet mean long-term sustainable growth."
"This is one of the problems we are facing."
"In addition, the social NGOs and employers' organisations have made it abundantly clear that although they naturally favour full employment, all kinds of conditions are lacking in order to meet this objective, and that it is not easy to achieve mobility or flexibility, for example, within this labour market when a number of conditions required for this are not in place."
"Somewhere in the Minutes of the Council declaration, it is stated that what matters is flexibility and social security."
"However, at the moment the temporary employment directive, for example, which could lead to more flexibility and security, is meeting with a great deal of resistance."
"All manner of obstructions are being placed in front of this directive."
"This also applies to a few more areas."
"The social platforms mentioned aspects related to the liberalisation and its implications for the service industry."
"We recently held a debate here on the liberalisation of services that are of general interest."
"The evaluation of this liberalisation was very mediocre."
"Consequently, the employers' organisations and social NGOs are anxious about the implications of any further liberalisation of the energy markets where only a minimal energy levy is planned to benefit the environment."
"They need clarity on aspects such as the future of health care and education, as well as the implications for our service industries in general."
"I should simply like to draw the attention to these concerns once more."
"These concerns were expressed by the hundreds of thousands people who took part in the protest and subsequently by the two or three hundred thousand people who do not see eye to eye with the anti-globalists."
"We will have to try to back up our intentions with facts, concrete directives and answers to questions raised."
"And that is what causes me some level of concern."
"Mr President, every four months now, at each summit, we see Europe giving itself a pat on the back and indulging in a quarterly self-celebration, whilst the number of demonstrators in the streets of Gothenburg, Nice and Barcelona increases and the people of Europe patently feel more support for the demonstrators than for their leaders who are gathered to hold their fine debates under ever-greater protection as we move from one summit to the next."
"The reason why the European Union is now wholly opposed to ultra-liberal globalisation is because everyone has realised that it has become globalisation's main shoehorn, including at the last WTO summit at Doha."
"Europe - well, what you call Europe - the European institutions, in other words, have essentially become a funnel, which is trying to make the people of Europe approve a rule that is as old as the hills and that is the rule of money."
"European citizens no longer believe in your Europe which is worn-out, ageing and tired - as the French Prime Minister would say when speaking of his opponent - and the people, in a perfectly healthy response, are in the process of rediscovering their personality in a vote expressing their national identity."
"Their personality is currently expressed by a vote for the right, since Europe is undoubtedly more of an out-moded internationalist, and so now globalised, idea, and I think that Parliament, like all the European institutions, is severely under-estimating how much Europe's credibility is harmed."
"The latest Eurobarometer survey - yes, I will finish in a moment - the results of which, in my view, have not been sufficiently communicated, shows that if the European Union ceased to exist, 50% of Europeans would be indifferent, 28% would be pleased and 21% would be unhappy."
"And there is the same contentedness, every four months, after each summit, the same satisfaction with all this."
"I must admit that I am beginning to wonder whether these meetings still have any real purpose."
"Mr President, the Barcelona Council reiterated the Member States' commitment to reach a budgetary objective that would be close to balance or in surplus by 2004 at the latest."
"It is easy to imagine how restrictive this objective is for countries which are currently running national election campaigns."
"That is why we must be cautious regarding the proposal put forward by the French Prime Minister, who suggested establishing a shared government budget for the eurozone which is an essential complement to the single monetary policy."
"The concept of a single European budget is, fundamentally, in line with the new integrated monetary system."
"At the same time, however, everyone can see that the aim of this manoeuvre is to reduce the deficit of negligent Member States by using the surplus of the Member States that pay their way."
"This illustrates that the euro can have a perverse effect in that it takes away responsibility from the national governments, something that is already well underway with each country's exchange rates being abolished."
"Since the spontaneous discipline of the market upon the national administrations is gradually disappearing, it must be replaced by establishing a central administrative authority which will hand out orders."
"This explains why the Barcelona European Council came to the logical decision, in the light of previous events, to strengthen the existing mechanisms of budgetary coordination and called on the Commission to present proposals on this issue after the general elections have been held in France and Germany."
"Mr President, the consequences of the euro are beginning to be felt."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to welcome the statement from Barcelona with regard to the Middle East and I trust that the intentions and ideas put forward there will be followed up by intensive diplomatic activity on the part of the European Union."
"Could I remind my colleague, Jonathan Evans, that the decision in Lisbon was for the most competitive European economy in the world based on social inclusion, social cohesion and territorial cohesion."
"We all know that the market on its own will not deliver social justice for the people of Europe."
"It simply cannot and never will do it."
"We know that despite the ideology purveyed by the Tories in the United Kingdom who have lost two elections in a row based on their approach to the economy and the people of the United Kingdom."
"My response to Barcelona is one of relief that the hype about liberalisation and privatisation was in fact just hype, that the balance of political power on the Council still remains with the centre-left, with the common sense to know that the people of Europe want a social Europe as well as a market Europe, and that the balance between social policy and economic policy, of employment policy and sustainability needs to be maintained."
"I welcome the fact that the Council in Barcelona recognised that reality."
"I wanted to specifically welcome one particular aspect, namely the commitment to a directive for a framework for public services."
"This is a critical area for delivering a people's Europe."
"We know the people of Europe want high-quality public services, we know they want them at an affordable price and they want them delivered universally."
"The companies who operate universal public services and the Member States have a responsibility to ensure that they are delivered and that the workers in these companies have legal certainty."
"The Commission, Council and Parliament know what needs to be in a framework document of that kind."
"So why does it need to be put off until December?"
"In my view, it should be brought forward in Seville."
"My final point relates to the call on the Commission to produce a regulation for a block exemption for services of general interest in the event that the European Court may find such support for services of general interest to be in breach of competition law."
"Why do we not bring that regulation forward immediately and not have our hands forced?"
"We should do it now while we have the time and the calm to do it and, as I say, guarantee the services we need in Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to join with other honourable Members in expressing my grief at the murder of Professor Biagi, and unequivocally condemning terrorism."
"With regard to the outcome of the Barcelona European Council, I believe it has been positive, as the Liberal Group stated. The results do indeed fall short of the Presidency's expectations."
"There are also clear commitments to work towards the objectives set at Lisbon. Both the President of the Council and the President of the Commission have already spelt these out."
"I should however say that this morning I discussed these issues in the Committee on Economic Affairs with Professor Issing of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee. We agreed that the progress made is welcome, but we also agreed that it is inadequate."
"You will recall these targets, namely a sustainable economy, competitive at global level, based on growth and ensuring economic and social cohesion. The progress made is also insufficient to consolidate the incipient growth currently noted."
"I believe I have exhausted the time at my disposal, but I would like to draw attention to the fact that a warning call was sounded at Barcelona. It concerned the alienation of public opinion and what is doubtless a distorted image of the European Union."
"This came across clearly."
"We need to make an effort to put things right."
"Refocusing the Council's work is on the agenda for Seville. I believe this is essential."
"We should also bear in mind that regions enjoying full legislative capacity ought to be involved in order to bring all parties together. After all, they are closer to the citizens."
"I must first join in condemning terrorism and the attack on Mr Biagi. Secondly, I would like to express my condolences to his family and friends."
"The European Council had adopted the so-called Barcelona Declaration on the Middle East in the hope of pressing for a solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians through dialogue. Congratulations are certainly due on that account."
"Unfortunately I do not believe that the same applies to Mr Aznar and the Spanish Government when their conduct with regard to the historical and political conflict with the Basque people resembles that of the proverbial dog in the manger, which neither eats nor allows others to do so."
"On the one hand, Mr Aznar refuses to engage in democratic dialogue on this issue. On the other, he disregards and undermines efforts made by pacifist organisations such as El Karri."
"He has even gone so far as to bring the whole weight of Spanish diplomacy to bear on the United States' Senate and Congress, in an effort to prevent them from debating the Basque situation."
"They voted through various resolutions condemning terrorism, calling for respect for the Basque people's right to self-determination, and the promotion of democratic dialogue as a means of achieving a peaceful solution to the situation in the Basque Country. The latter is located within the Union, between France and Spain."
"Perhaps he does not wish to hear what the nationalists have to say. Finally, I trust that my comments will not lead Mr Salafranca to accuse me of speaking on behalf of some terrorist group."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the wording adopted in Lisbon was courageous, ambitious and high-flown - the EU was to become the most competitive and dynamic economic area in the world by 2010."
"These good intentions were very welcome, but the outcome of the Barcelona Summit was less so."
"The long overdue complete opening of energy markets was not forthcoming."
"Instead we got a lazy compromise. A properly functioning internal market is the key to growth and employment."
"The 'Neue Züricher Zeitung' neatly summed up the outcome of the Barcelona Summit in one sentence: 'Europe caught between ambition and action'."
"I agree with Mr Solana's critique of this kind of conference diplomacy."
"Mountains of paper are generated, private and not so private discussions are held, and all in all a great many good intentions are announced, as is the desire to play a major economic and increasingly political role on the world stage in the general interest."
"The delay in the liberalisation of energy markets is an example of how far removed Europe is from being able to act."
"Especially in a core area like the internal market, I regard this as being extremely damaging in terms of economic policy, and, as Mr Evans put it, ridiculous politically speaking."
"Mr President, to ignore the demands for modernisation that have come out of Barcelona would basically be a selfish decision, the kind made by those who only think of themselves and do not imagine a better future for their own children."
"Solidarity is effective if one really tries to build a different, more just society."
"It was with these words that Marco Biagi yesterday ended a speech of his on the Barcelona Summit."
"This Parliament cannot but share the words of the economist and adviser to the Italian Government, who was assassinated yesterday evening in Bologna, and sharing his thoughts is the best way for us to remember him here in Brussels."
"In effect, the European Council has made it possible for progress to be made in the fight against unemployment."
"These are new messages in favour of flexibility in the labour market which, if implemented, will allow the youth of Europe to escape from social deprivation."
"The decision to encourage enterprise and competitiveness together with the expected global recovery gives us hope for the future."
"The decision favouring the liberalisation of the gas and electricity sectors is also positive, but resistance from supporters of public ownership still survives within the Union and needs to be overcome."
"We are also pleased to see the launching of the Galileo programme and the decisions to work for peace in the Middle East."
"Many positive decisions were made by the Barcelona Council, under the Spanish Government's lead, which we think was positive, and the results of the work carried out are also positive, although a few shadows remain over three questions."
"With regard to transport, all obstacles to free movement, competition and the operation of the single market must be overcome."
"We would not like Italy to be penalised in future by wrong decisions."
"More could also have been done for the Mediterranean: in future we must think not so much of a Euro-Mediterranean Fund but of a real Mediterranean Bank."
"For the Balkans, too, there is a need to intervene to strengthen the process of stabilisation and association."
"We are convinced that, in the course of the six months of the Spanish Presidency, these subjects will be addressed and favourably resolved, just as the fight against terrorism will also be addressed with great determination."
"This is one of the priorities mentioned by the President-in-Office, Mr Aznar, in his presentation of the Spanish Presidency: a fight that must know no distinctions among the political forces who sit in this House, who are all committed, I believe, to defending democracy and preventing terrorism from gaining new followers."
"Mr President, I am a firm believer in the Lisbon strategy because it consists of a great many different policy areas that have to be coordinated."
"I felt very concerned before the Barcelona Summit, and about two matters in particular."
"The first of these was the balance of the strategy."
"I was afraid that the balance would be disturbed, and that the talk would merely be of deregulation."
"My second anxiety was as to whether the sustainable development strategy would be given enough space in the document."
"Where the first point is concerned, I am glad that matters did not turn out as I had feared."
"I believe that the process is well balanced."
"It contains proposals for deregulating the gas, electricity and financial markets, together with proposals in the social sphere such as those for improving child care and increasing employment, all of which entails a strengthening of the social model."
"When it comes to the proposals on sustainable development, I have to state however that these are insubstantial."
"It was as I had feared."
"All that is really clear is the proposal that countries sign the Kyoto Protocol."
"That is undoubtedly important, but the document is otherwise far too flimsy and consists merely of notes where certain matters are concerned."
"The ecological aspects will clearly disappear in the future."
"Another aspect of sustainable development is the relationship between ourselves as rich countries and the developing countries."
"The target set for development aid falls far short of the UN's target."
"The objective of coming up with one half of the 0.7% established by the UN is not nearly good enough."
"Seen in relation to what the Commission proposed, the fight against poverty is being undermined."
"I have high hopes for the Lisbon process."
"I also hope that it will be possible to maintain the balance in the future and that, at forthcoming spring summits, the ecological dimension and issues surrounding sustainable development will be integrated more clearly into the process."
"That is crucial if the process is to survive."
"Mr President, by striking down a man like Professor Biagi, the Red Brigade terrorist assassins were seeking to silence a brave intellectual, an adviser to the Minister for Employment, Mr Maroni, whom they have not forgiven for having upheld the very principles affirmed at the recent European Council and for having placed his great abilities at the service of his country's government in order to carry out a review of Article 18 and Italy's employment legislation in general, which still includes points that stand in the way of the modernisation of our labour market, one of the most backward in Europe."
"The lesson we must learn is to realise, as this martyr to employment often pointed out, that only through truly reformist political action on employment legislation will it be possible to open up real areas for employment and hence for our children's future in Italy and Europe."
"The Barcelona Council, however, leaves open and unresolved the great question of the future direction Europe will take in the economic and social field."
"We believe that only if Europe is thought out and constructed from the bottom upwards, from the territories and regions, only if it takes account of specific conditions and the different development models established over the decades, will it achieve its objective of striking a true, genuine balance between the modernisation of employment, productive development and social guarantees."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to unreservedly congratulate those concerned on the preparation of the summit by the Spanish Presidency and by the team of Prime Minister Aznar, the President-in-Office of the Council."
"As far as the outcome of the summit is concerned, I would like to carry on where our group chairman left off and refer to the double standards employed in writing up the outcome. Was the reality such that only words like ""welcome, request, reaffirm, expect"" were appropriate?"
"Would the Council not have greater credibility if it were to criticise and regret certain types of behaviour and make specific declarations, just as the President-in-Office of the Council has done here today?"
"Those who block, delay and put on the brakes need to be named and shamed, instead of always reducing everything to the lowest common denominator and thus turning their backs on Europe's real needs."
"Just who does the Council consist of?"
"Many of the forms of wording it adopts give the hypocritical and misleading impression that the participants in the summit have nothing to do with the European Council and the various specific ministers, although they are responsible for their behaviour."
"Yes, we need to give more support to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is why I welcome Paragraph 15, which is based on the European Parliament's decisions with regard to supporting SMEs."
"That is why I am calling on every Council to consider the Basle Committee negotiations, so that the Six and the Nine are brought together."
"Yes, we need more rapid implementation once directives have been adopted."
"That is why we are calling for a reduction in implementation times."
"We are calling for a greater role for Europe in terms of achieving the Lisbon targets and thus Europe's role on the world market."
"Yes, we need the action plan for financial services and stability."
"That is why I am calling on the Council at long last, after two years, to adopt a common position on pension reform."
"I am calling for criticism of the ECOFIN Council for undermining the Commission."
"Yes, we need more transparency."
"That is why we are calling for Council meetings to be open."
"Yes, we need to remove the barriers, blockades and restrictions."
"That is why we are criticising the fact that election dates in France and Germany, for example, and monopolies such as EdF's have undermined the European objective of liberalising energy markets and the decision taken by Parliament."
"Mr President, I am told the House was somewhat startled by certain comments Mr Aznar made about this sitting. He seems to have spoken in an undertone but with the microphone still on."
"Far be it from me to contradict Mr Aznar, if indeed this report is true, particularly at this late hour."
"I am obviously not the President of the Council, but I would be grateful if you could convey the following suggestion to Mr Aznar on my behalf, Mr President."
"How should I word it? Perhaps along the lines that in future he ought to moderate his language and choose less offensive vocabulary."
"As is becoming the norm on these occasions, the run-up to the Council was in stark contrast to its aftermath."
"Great expectations were raised beforehand by political personalities, notably those involved in the proceedings. Afterwards, they made triumphal assessments."
"On occasion, they even released the latter in advance. On the other hand, the media and many observers highlighted the discrepancies and the more or less guarded or even pessimistic assessments."
"To paraphrase the headline in a Brussels' daily, Barcelona was different in that it turned out to be a colourless summit accompanied by a colourful demonstration. The new and active European social movement showed its strength."
"They demonstrated in a peaceful, public-spirited and constructive manner, clamouring for more Europe and a more social Europe. In particular, they called for Europe to show greater solidarity and become increasingly involved in a world where globalisation is gathering pace."
"These demonstrations revealed the extent to which Europe's citizens are concerned about the building of Europe and the latter's role in creating a fairer world."
"Curiously, the classical saying seemed to be reversed. Both before and after the demonstrations what arose was an accusatio non petita which actually implied an excusatio manifesta, not an excusatio non petita."
"It was as if those statements blaming the citizens for demonstrating were in fact aimed at excusing or concealing the real problem. The latter consists of a lack of communication, understanding and empathy."
"There is also a worrying gap between the citizens and the conduct of European affairs, which is undertaken essentially at intergovernmental level."
"Let us hope that the Convention, that great landmark in the history of European democracy, will serve to establish a positive synergy between the democratic institutions and civil society, which made its presence felt in Barcelona during the European Council."
"Mr President, before it even opened, the Barcelona European Council created apprehension and suspicion in the minds of some people, who were afraid that it would go back on the Lisbon strategy."
"Although we were aware of the enormous ambition of the objectives defined in Lisbon and of the different and more difficult current economic climate, we never doubted that the progress that has been made in the field of social policy would be honoured by the Member States, as it has been, and in particular by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union, whom I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate."
"In this regard, I wish to highlight the boost given to creating active policies for full employment, and the reform of the labour market is a step which is crucial to job creation. Of particular importance is the emphasis given to pursuing EU policies in the field of providing incentives for competitiveness and of improving employment, increasing the professional and geographical mobility of workers, which requires greater attention to the training of the workforce and ensuring that it is better qualified to work within the knowledge society and the recognition that the ageing of the population requires new and creative answers."
"The proposal intended to create legislation providing for partial retirement as an instrument to enable older workers in the labour market to take voluntary later retirement, without undermining the need to speed up the reforms of the pensions system, is, therefore, very welcome."
"One of the groups most badly affected by unemployment in the European Union is women. We must encourage their participation in the labour market, which will remain a utopian ideal unless active measures to reconcile family life with professional life are adopted."
"A joint effort at Community, intergovernmental, regional and local level is, therefore, crucial to create infrastructures for childcare and to support the elderly, specifically by making available and implementing appropriations from the European Social Fund, in addition to adopting tax and social measures."
"We feel that there is a clear need for coordination and synchronisation between the social and economic dimensions."
"In fact, only through the greater creation of wealth, which is distributed fairly and equitably, can there be greater social justice."
"Mr President, this Summit was announced as the Summit of liberalisation and ended up addressing longer working hours."
"In itself, I have nothing against longer working hours, and I think that this topic merits a debate."
"However, the question is whether Europe will endear itself by persistently bringing out statements of this kind only. In my view, it does not show much leadership when a presidency focuses on aspects of this kind rather than other aspects that are at least as important."
"Discussion at Lisbon mainly concerned the knowledge economy and the importance of knowledge and human resources in this connection."
"However, were decisions taken about lifelong learning, for example?"
"No, this decision is being shunted to Seville where we are to get a resolution."
"In my view, we should be very careful that this does not become an academic exercise."
"If we want to take concrete steps, these will, above all, need to establish benchmarking."
"Let us clearly agree on how much of our GNP we want to spend on education."
"Let us make it clear that learning and the right to learning are not solely determined by labour market data."
"However, I do not only want to be downbeat."
"In my view, the Summit has taken some important decisions, one of which is undoubtedly that on energy taxation."
"We must prize this decision, and I hope that it will be implemented effectively."
"A second point on which I should like to congratulate the presidency and the Summit is the attention to language learning."
"Language education is increasingly in jeopardy."
"In a number of Member States, it is considered unimportant, but I do not think this is fair, and we should address this issue as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, the Council's most bitter critics were those who attended late at night and turned out at the demonstration in the morning. So far, the worst they have been able to say is that Barcelona was a small step."
"By way of clarification I should say that I think it is a step in the right direction because now we are no longer discussing the issues which concerned us five days ago."
"We are not discussing the dogma of price stability any more, nor are we arguing for or against the Stability Pact. We have also ceased to debate the need or urgency of speeding up structural reform to attain three aims, namely a functioning market, the principle of social compensation, and sustainable development."
"It is undiluted Müller-Armak."
"I should like to make two brief points on economic reform."
"In the wake of Barcelona it is now crystal-clear that as far as energy and gas are concerned, liberalisation does not necessarily equate to privatisation."
"Those wishing to retain public concerns are free to do so."
"It is also evident that liberalisation must take account of the basic principles of general interest services such as equal access, continuity of supply and consumer safety."
"Speeches made from other benches calling for liberalisation to be postponed further therefore amount to excuses from a bad payer. I simply cannot understand why it is supposed to be good for industry to be able to chose a supplier whilst denying household consumers that same choice."
"I only have one message for the Council regarding financial markets."
"Parliament has shown considerable generosity in approving the von Wogau report."
"It has also shown considerable efficiency in approving the relevant measures."
"I can take it on myself to provide an assurance that if the Council forwards us the eight modifications it proposed regarding financial services by express post, the relevant reply will also be dispatched by express post."
"Please send us the common positions."
"I should like to make one last comment on the subject of the institutional structures needed for these reforms: Seville."
"The Council and the Commission would do well to consider what action is required at institutional level to ensure that the outstanding reforms are carried out."
"What is the role of Parliament and of the Council in the legislative procedure (Article 202)?"
"Who actually controls economic policies?"
"To put it another way, are we heading towards an economic government or not?"
"Who represents the euro on the international stage?"
"Should we retain unanimity for fiscal issues when we number 27, so the smallest of all can veto any decision?"
"These are the issues the Council has outstanding."
"I congratulate the Presidency-in-Office on the success of Barcelona. Congratulations are also due to the Spanish Government."
"The latter would have been blamed for not providing enough police if unrest had taken place. Since there were enough police officers on duty, the authorities are being criticised instead for providing too many."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, votes are what counts, not shouting in the streets, and the signs are encouraging."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the previous speaker, who thinks that too few measures have been taken, I have to say that, as a Member and as vice-chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the measures proposed by national governments give me great cause for concern."
"In the areas mentioned, the European Council is formulating objectives that in some cases are clearly cutting across the competence of Member States."
"Even if open coordination is not specifically mentioned as a particularly suitable policy tool for these areas of policy, that cannot disguise the fact that the procedure that will continue to apply is that based on objectives and guidelines whose implementation by the Member States is subject to scrutiny at European level."
"The end result is open coordination."
"This procedure is highly undemocratic."
"Neither the European Parliament nor national parliaments are involved in it."
"It amounts to a violation of the relevant treaties."
"However, it is also an affront to the objective formulated by the governments in Laeken in December 2001 for the next intergovernmental conference and the most important theme of the convention, that is to say the dividing line in competence as between the EU and Member States."
"What has become apparent from a constitutional point of view is the statement by the Barcelona Council that there should be a simplification of the process for the European Employment Strategy, and that in particular the number of employment policy guidelines should be reduced."
"So who initiated this process?"
"It would be very difficult to demonstrate the need for a distinct division of competences more clearly."
"All I can do is to call on the Heads of State and Government to respect the competences laid down in the relevant treaties and not to arrogate rights to themselves that are found neither in national constitutions nor in the European treaties."
"The Council's exhortation to Member States to introduce more flexible working arrangements at national level will undoubtedly have a greater impact than utopian European targets and guidelines."
"The Heads of State and Government should avoid not only the inflation of targets, but also an inflation of Councils, and should concentrate on realistic tasks for the European Union which are covered by the treaties."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the presidency and the European heads of State and government for their support and positive contribution to the process of revisiting the Treaty of Nice by Ireland."
"Last June's referendum result was a major disappointment, particularly given the 30% turnout."
"I continue to be perplexed at our Taoiseach's attempt to once again play the neutrality card in Barcelona in an effort to get the Nice Treaty supported."
"I hope the Irish government will invest sufficient time in explaining the Treaty accurately and sincerely to all our citizens the second time around."
"Irish people have, regrettably, been sold the benefits of the EU solely in economic terms while the moral and political imperative of assisting the countries of eastern and central Europe to rejoin the European family of nations has not been promoted."
"I am confident that once this is done the Irish people will vote for the Nice Treaty and embrace the fact that it is a necessary provision for the enlargement of the EU."
"If our Taoiseach's strategy is to insist upon a European Council declaration that Irish military neutrality is not affected by the Treaty of Nice, then he has once again misrepresented both the Treaty of Nice and Ireland's role in Partnership for Peace to his own people."
"I would like to see him advocate unequivocally Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace and not play this duplicitous game."
"It is, however, not surprising, coming from a government that has been talking out of both sides of its mouth on the EU for the past few years."
"Difficult issues which this Irish government must face are attributed to Brussels bureaucracy or over-regulation, whilst any good news is claimed as an Irish ministerial achievement."
"This attitude of risking the future of the fledgling democracies and emerging economies of central and eastern Europe has fed the eurosceptic vein in Ireland and is reflective of a government which would rather play short-term national political games for the sake of a few votes in an upcoming general election."
"In conclusion, Mr President, for the record, Ireland has never been neutral nor could we afford to be."
"It is not in our constitution nor our statute law."
"Successive Taoisigh of the present government's persuasion including DeValera, Lemass, Cosgrove and Lynch have expressly stated that Ireland has no traditional policy of neutrality and would take foreign policy decisions on a case-by-case basis."
"Ireland is today, and effectively always has been, a non-aligned country eager to play its own modest role in protecting peace and security around the globe."
"The Nice Treaty in no way affects this status."
"It will be up to the Irish parliament to decide what defence missions our forces become engaged in."
"We are a proud people, proud of our long-term record of peacekeeping and peace-enforcing by our defence forces throughout the trouble spots of the world."
"I believe we need to spell out clearly our present security and defence policy to the people of Ireland."
"We must have an end to this type of dishonesty that characterised Fianna Fáil's approach to the question of joining Partnership for Peace."
"The Nice Treaty makes no change to the emerging Irish and European security architecture but it is the crucial next step to heal the historic divisions of Europe caused by war and destruction."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, at this time in the afternoon, after all the previous speeches, one feels that the vast majority of the points that can be covered have already been made."
"Therefore, as a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to focus on and limit my speech to a few matters that were considered and decided upon at the Barcelona Summit, which many feel explain the success of the Summit and justify why it has been said that it went reasonably well."
"As we can now see the end of the economic slowdown, there is a clear and determined commitment to get back to the Lisbon Strategy and to achieve the crucial objective that it set: full employment."
"At times Europeans find it hard to believe, or, to look at it in another way, they tend to think, that Europe is always concerned with looking at what will have to be done in the future and that it is actually doing very little."
"I would like to specifically highlight the decisions and agreements made at the Barcelona Summit, which, if properly presented, will enable those citizens who are currently not exactly enthusiastic to change their views."
"There is, of course, the commitment to achieve full employment with more and better jobs and, what is more, before the end of this decade."
"There is also the commitment to tax reduction for the lowest salaries and to accentuate measures to motivate people to seek employment, to control unemployment and of course to encourage the incorporation of women into the labour market through various measures, many of which had already been highlighted here. In addition there is the strategy for flexible extension of the length of the working life in view of the changes in our demography, the improvement in the transfer of social rights and employment mobility in general."
"These are all feelings and ideas, and therefore decisions, through which as European citizens we can take hold of and perceive Europe more and, what is more, we are going to take hold of it by strengthening the role of social partners, which makes us all jointly responsible in this magnificent task of constructing Europe, a Europe that is much more supportive and therefore fairer."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I really have nothing to add to what the President-in-Office of the Council said in his first speech, particularly given that the majority of the Members that have asked me questions are not present."
"In any case I would like to applaud the professionalism of the Presidents of the Parliamentary groups of the People's Party and the Socialist Party, who at least are present."
"In any event, I would like to thank all those who have taken a positive view of the effort that the Spanish Presidency made in Barcelona, and say to those who expressed disappointment that it is logical and in the nature of things that the Presidency of the Union should be ambitious in setting these challenges, and it is also logical that not all the ambitions are realised, because that is part of the everyday life of the Union and has been since 1955. We are not going to create a new Union right now."
"I would therefore say that in this effort to adapt our ambitions to the realities of life and of political necessities, I think that it can be said that the results of Barcelona have been extraordinarily positive."
"There have also been those who have highlighted certain elements while ignoring others, who are not aware of the true essence of the Lisbon Strategy, because the Lisbon Strategy provides a good balance between reform and economic liberalisation, social cohesion, the needs of education and research and sustainable development. We cannot go further on some matters than on others."
"We need coordinated progress, and I think that there has been coordinated progress, because in all the areas that we have dealt with there has been positive and substantial progress that can be measured, and this is reflected in the conclusions."
"Specifically, I have heard the repeated criticism that sustainable development has not been sufficiently reflected."
"It surprises me that it should be said here that it is not enough that for the first time the Union has said that it wishes to, and formally undertakes to, ratify the Kyoto Protocol and that at the same time it has reached an agreement on development aid in Monterrey, which I think are two very important matters."
"I think that this is much more than anyone could have expected."
"The reason that Johannesburg was not mentioned more is that the Barcelona European Council cannot discuss Johannesburg further until the preparations for it begin in the United Nations."
"We will discuss Johannesburg in detail in Seville, which is where the mandate will clearly be given in order for the Union to have a common position."
"What there is in Barcelona at present is therefore sufficient and desirable."
"Also, I would like to remind those who expressed their opinions on the demonstrators, attaching more importance to the demonstrators in the street than to the remainder of the European Council, and saying that they represent civil society, that, although those demonstrators are indeed European citizens, behind the European Council there are also many millions of silent citizens who voted for the parties represented by the governments that are there, sitting on the European Council, and that they are the true civil society."
"That is the true civil society."
"I do not wish to take away any legitimacy from those who demonstrate on the streets, but neither should we take away legitimacy from those who, through their political parties, support the governments who make the decisions."
"I think that many of those who attach so much importance to those who demonstrate on the street have not learned the major lesson that European citizens taught to all of Europe when it came to accepting the euro."
"They are the same people who said that people did not want anything to do with Europe or the euro, and so within a fortnight all European citizens accepted the euro, spontaneously and entirely voluntarily."
"I therefore think that we need to learn a great deal from this about what people on the street think, and not think that it is only those who demonstrate, in what is a more than festive atmosphere, on the occasion of a European Council, who have democratic legitimacy in the Union, because that is not the case."
"I would like to conclude by clearly expressing the Presidency's astonishment at the statement made by the representative of Herri Batasuna condemning the murder of an Italian politician by the Red Brigade terrorist group, while he has never protested about the numerous victims murdered by the terrorist group ETA, for which his party provides a political cover."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"I would first like to say that I think the results of Barcelona were positive overall. No one can deny this, although maybe there are those who wanted even more, and those, as we have heard today, who even wanted less in some respects, but in general the results were positive."
"To a large extent the results were positive due to the work of three institutions: Parliament, the Commission and the Council, in other words, simply due to the correct functioning of the Community method, and I think that this is the first reason why we have to congratulate everyone here."
"Barcelona produced results. Barcelona made progress insofar as, for a considerable amount of time, we have been working shoulder to shoulder, with particular cooperation from Parliament, making a considerable effort to enable those results to be produced."
"Mr President, in Spain we say that the perfect is the enemy of the good, and that is what I would say to those who did not think that it was very much."
"I think that we have to look at the results in all areas, including in foreign policy, on issues as important as the declaration on the Middle East, and I do not want to go on to other issues that are to a lesser degree within the scope of the Commission."
"The balance is positive if we focus on matters that are very specifically the responsibility of the Commission and part of Community policy, when we talk about the progress on guaranteeing pensions, on employment, on the integration of the markets, on the creation of Europe, on providing a backbone in physical and spatial terms for its territory, for example through the interconnection of energy and transport, on support for environmental policy, not only in the specific environmental chapter, in which there are very important elements that were pointed out by Mr de Miguel a moment ago, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Monterrey agreements."
"The same should be said of specific policies when, for example, in the transport chapter, in answer to one of the specific comments that has been made, we talk about promoting more environmentally friendly transport, such as the railways and maritime transport."
"Considerable progress has also been made on energy, with a directive on the taxation of energy, something that is without doubt a key issue within the development model that we are advocating in Europe, which is in no way based on cheap energy, but quite the contrary."
"When we look at all the progress that has been made, I repeat that the perfect is the enemy of the good, that there is a great deal of good and that the Community method has worked."
"Finally, Mr President, very briefly, I must say that as a politician and a Member of Parliament for more than thirteen years - and I hope that one day the confidence of the Spanish people will mean that I can take on those tasks again - I want to make something very clear: political legitimacy lies in parliaments and democratically-elected governments, full stop."
"Other types of demonstration, which represent what is called civil society, are very important, and any politician who wishes to continue to have popular support will take good note of what those demonstrations mean, and will incorporate what those social groups say as much as possible, but obviously what we cannot do is replace democracy and the democratic and political legitimacy of the votes that are cast for the representatives of the people with demonstrations, however important they may be, because they are completely different things and should not be confused."
"They are different issues."
"There were hundreds of thousands of citizens who demonstrated peacefully, as is usually the case with this type of demonstration, except at the last minute the hooligans appeared, whom we know and who unfortunately had not been intercepted by the State security forces in advance."
"And there were a few problems."
"However, Mr President, we repeat that legitimacy lies in this Parliament and in the national parliaments, and there was clearly legitimacy in the European Council with the Heads of State and Government of 15 democratic countries along with the Commission, which was taking part."
"To conclude this debate the Presidency has received six motions for resolutions, which will be voted on at 7.00 p.m."
"Mr Cox said at the end of the debate I should put forward my point of order so I request the floor."
"You have the floor, Mr Gorostiaga, for a point of order."
"Under Rule 122 I shall confine myself to rebutting the statement of one angry right-wing Spanish nationalist that breaches even the most basic norms of parliamentary courtesy."
"It would be quite unacceptable if I were to refer to that colleague as the spokesman of the Spanish torturers, even if there is evidence of torture in Spanish police headquarters."
"Such personal attacks must be ousted from this House forever."
"I am confident that President Cox will do his best to avoid this kind of incident in the future."
"Mr President, I am going to answer Mr Gorostiaga because I understand that he talked about me, and I will show respect where he has shown disrespect and parliamentary courtesy where he has shown discourtesy."
"I just wished to point out that what I did in my speech was clearly point out that each time the President of Parliament courageously speaks out to condemn the cowardly murders by the terrorist group ETA, Mr Gorostiaga, taking advantage of the freedom that he has as a Member of this House, a freedom that his friends in the terrorist group ETA trample on every day, takes the opportunity to justify the unjustifiable."
"Therefore, Mr President, the only thing that I wished to do was to ask how long we are going to have to tolerate this type of statement in this House, which is an offence to the memories of the victims and makes a mockery of the positions taken by Parliament?"
"Thank you Mr Salafranca."
"This point of order has been sufficiently dealt with and we will now move on to the next item on the agenda."
"The next item is the Commission and Council statements on the Annual Political Strategy for 2003."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 27 February the President, Mr Prodi, told you about the decisions taken by the Commission that day, most importantly the Commission's policy priorities for 2003 and the Commission's requirements in terms of human and financial resources."
"As we said then, this year, for the first time, the three main institutions will conduct an in-depth dialogue on policy priorities and on the legislative and working programme for the coming year."
"The dialogue will be conducted on the basis of the new understanding presented to the Conference of Presidents on 31 January and a new Council consultation procedure."
"On 4 March we outlined the policy priorities for 2003 at the General Affairs Council, and we are involved in a structured coordination of work with the Greek and Italian Presidencies so as to achieve the best possible results with medium-term programming."
"What we want to do is to base programming on a political dialogue with Member State representatives and citizens, thus using as a foundation the exercise of the Commission's exclusive right of initiative under the Treaty, in a process in which the different positions participate, and are listened to, as much as possible."
"Of course in the final analysis the Commission must, I repeat, shoulder the responsibility laid on it by the Treaty."
"But we shall exercise that prerogative in a way that is not only politically responsible, but also honest."
"It should be done out in the light of day, not with a shopping list of 'good? intentions negotiated in the backrooms of any of the institutions."
"In this respect I would like to urge the President of Parliament and Parliament as a whole to continue in their political efforts to promote the institution of Parliament as the supreme organ of democratic debate and codecision that can rise above questions of mere detail and of simply defending a few specific positions."
"As you know, the Commission has set itself three priorities for 2003: firstly, enlargement, secondly, stability and security, and thirdly, a sustainable and socially inclusive economy."
"From the time that it took up office, the Commission has been committed to the success of the enlargement process."
"Because enlargement remains a fundamental priority for the second half of our mandate."
"From this point of view, 2003 will be a crucial year: we have to prepare to welcome into the Commission all the representatives, all the Commissioners from the new Member States and tackle the fresh challenges facing the Union."
"But the Commission has decided to give priority to another area of action: first and foremost, stability and security."
"Inside the Union our main objective is to speed up the creation of a European area of justice, security and freedom."
"The fight against crime, in all its forms, including terrorism, and today more than ever it is once again appropriate to repeat that terrorism is included, is, and will remain, at the top of our agenda."
"We should continue to pay particular attention to immigration and all the complex effects that it brings with it."
"Solidarity with those who are trying to find a better life for themselves and their families must go hand in hand with a firm and orderly management of migratory flows at European level."
"We need collaboration on border controls, exchange of information and common rules to govern the entry and re-entry of immigrants, and we also need to harmonise the rules governing the movement, handling, lives and conduct of all immigrants."
"Outside the EU, another of our main priorities is to extend stability and security throughout the continent and to the regions bordering on the enlarged Union."
"To achieve this, it is once again essential that we strengthen our partnerships with all neighbouring countries."
"Our third priority for 2003, Mr President, is a sustainable and socially inclusive economy."
"There are signs of recovery in the not too distant future."
"However, the pace and strength of this recovery will also depend on how resolutely the Union implements the Lisbon Strategy."
"The external dimension of this strategy is particularly important as it can help us to manage globalisation."
"Our contribution should be directed towards distributing the fruits of recovery to as many countries as possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, another of the Commission's political priorities is solving the issue of inadequate human and financial resources, which can no longer be deferred."
"The Annual Policy Strategy does not, therefore, simply identify our main political priorities, but also aims to ensure that the Commission has adequate resources for that task."
"As President Prodi said on 27 February, this Commission will not undertake any mandate without having the necessary resources."
"This is quite simply because it would set us up for failure."
"At this point we cannot properly prepare for enlargement without more staff."
"So, after a rigorous screening exercise, the Commission has included in the Annual Policy Strategy a request for 500 non-permanent staff."
"It will be clear to you that this is a rock-bottom figure, still well below what we need to carry out enlargement-related tasks in 2003."
"We all know that the current ceiling for administrative expenses does not allow sufficient resources to prepare for enlargement."
"So the Commission considers it essential to use the flexibility instrument."
"It is not enough, but it is all we have."
"We also have two other major aims: security and establishing a policy to promote a sustainable economy, which give the Commission more responsibilities."
"However, to avoid having to ask for yet more staff we have decided to approve initiatives only if they can be carried out by internally redeploying our existing staff or simply by terminating some activities that are being conducted."
"Mr President, this shows how seriously and rigorously the Commission is committed to its priorities, without ignoring budgetary discipline."
"On the financial resources side, I would like to point out that the Commission and the Budgetary Authorities must urgently find a structural solution to the chronic inadequacy of Heading 4, external relations."
"These tasks cannot be done properly under the current constraints."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the Commission is setting out the main areas of work."
"This debate will be followed by debates in each of the committees, which will be attended by the Commissioners along with their members."
"This will be the time to further define and prepare those main areas of work."
"In any case, allow me to thank you on behalf of the whole Commission for your constructive and practical contribution to ensuring the best possible management of our priorities for 2003."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency listened with particular interest to the presentation by the Vice President, Mrs De Palacio, of the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2003, which is the first phase of the cycle of planning and programming of the priorities set by the Commission."
"The idea is not only to identify those priorities but also to analyse the best way of rationally using the financial and human resources of the Union."
"I think it is particularly satisfactory that the priorities identified by the Commission, such as enlargement, stability and security, and a sustainable and socially inclusive economy, are very much in line with those that the Presidency itself and the European Union as a whole have defined and which have been confirmed by the European Council in Barcelona, about which the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Spanish Government, has just informed this House."
"The Presidency welcomes the Commission's intention to enter into dialogue on the strategy presented, in which the budgetary implications will have to be a fundamental element."
"There will therefore have to be careful preparation in order to link the debate on the strategic priorities with the budgetary procedure for 2003."
"The Council has already had some exchanges of opinion and considers that the General Affairs Council in May could include on its agenda an initial political debate on the Commission's strategic priorities for 2003."
"In this way the budgetary aspects, which in the Presidency's opinion should include the implications that enlargement could have in terms of expenditure such as the need for premises, could be analysed at the most appropriate time within the general framework of the budgetary procedure."
"The Presidency is not ruling out the first political debate on the Commission's strategy being followed, during next autumn, under the Danish Presidency, by a fresh discussion closer to the time when the decision will be taken on the Union budget."
"Mr President, the Presidency would like to repeat that it is prepared to support the strategic priorities proposed by the Commission and to look in detail at their budgetary implications at the appropriate time."
"Mr President, my group welcomes the fact that this debate is taking place this evening because this is the first time that we have been able to have an annual policy strategy debate this early in the process of the budget for 2003."
"The fact that the Council - although it might not be listening - is actually present in this debate is an important sign that the three institutions should indeed be working coherently together."
"My first point is that we are looking at a significant change in the process of doing things where, firstly, we have a definition of Commission policy priorities, secondly we are trying to ensure the right match between tasks and measures for 2003 and, thirdly, that we welcome this idea of having a strengthened institutional dialogue so that we can ensure that the budget is actually collectively decided."
"Of course, that debate starts here and now in March 2002."
"So, are the priorities the right ones?"
"It is still very early in the day to know that but the fact is that we have been able to find: enlargement, stability and security, and the sustainable inclusive economy."
"It is very difficult to find a subject which does not fall under those three but, in the light of the way in which this has been prepared, we in this House and our committees will find the right way in debates to put forward where we think the priorities lie."
"There will surely be debates, for example, on enlargement."
"Can the Commission, as it says, complete the linguistic and administrative preparations for enlargement during 2003?"
"Can it continue to implement the reform of the Commission so it will be entirely modernised by the end of 2004?"
"These are questions that we are clearly going to have to raise and the same applies to stability and security."
"The wish is expressed to set up the European Food Safety Agency and get it operational."
"As far as I know this decision has not yet been taken and, therefore, we need to be clear about what we are trying to do in these debates."
"Clearly, in the sustainable inclusive economy there are a whole range of different issues in terms of having the human and financial resources available."
"This raises the point of your 500 non-permanent posts, which we are going to have to examine in detail."
"To conclude, this debate is something which is to be welcomed."
"This document sets out a number of clear targets to be achieved in which we, in Parliament and the Council, will have to participate."
"Hopefully we will be able to end the year with the better matching of budget and legislative procedures which we have been asking for."
"I would conclude by noting that there is one major point on the availability of financial resources."
"It clearly says in the document that payments will be restricted, not just for the repayment of outstanding commitments but that payments should be contained elsewhere in the budget so as to make sure we do not go over the ceilings required."
"Therefore, 2003 will be an exceptionally difficult year but we have started early enough to find the right kind of solutions."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, the Commission defines the broadening of its point of focus as one of its priorities for the year 2003."
"Mr Elles has perhaps taken a somewhat cynical view of that."
"Nevertheless, I consider it right and proper, because the impression might otherwise be created that, when we conclude the treaties with the candidate countries in 2002 - and I hope there will be ten of these treaties - everything will have been done and dusted."
"This, however, is certainly not the case."
"It would also promote the ratification process and the assent procedure in this House if we had some initiatives from the Commission, particularly if they were scheduled for the year 2003."
"For example, the new Member States must be prepared for the assumption of full participatory rights within the European Union."
"Practice is also needed in the peaceful and amicable solution of conflicts."
"I hope this will not be confined to Cyprus; recent debates in this very House suggest that it is needed between Slovakia and Hungary or between the Czech Republic and Hungary, and even Austria and Germany are to some degree affected by it."
"The entire cohesion policy has to be transformed and restructured."
"Only today we had a hearing on the White Paper devoted to transport."
"It is good that the Vice-President of the Commission is present."
"If we really want to develop the trans-European networks and contribute to cohesion, 2003 will be a particularly busy year."
"A great deal of assistance must be given to the future Member States to enable them to adapt to Community standards of administration and justice, for example in the fight against fraud."
"And so 2003, especially in terms of enlargement, will be an absolutely decisive year."
"That should not be underestimated."
"But 2003 will also be a year in which we must try to provide answers to countries that are not candidates for accession but are considering the possibility of applying."
"Ukraine is one of those countries."
"We had Mr Shevardnadze here from Georgia too and had some discussions on that point."
"In Russia too the subject is discussed."
"In the last hour we have spoken about Croatia with a Croatian delegation."
"There are questions here that we shall be asked to answer."
"We have not taken any steps so far to draw definitive borders or to define what the Europe of the Union is to be, because there will still be a Europe beyond our frontiers."
"So on these questions too we shall have to find answers, or at least provisional answers, in 2003."
"Another task for 2003 is the development of some visions as to the nature of our intensified and institutionalised cooperation with those countries that will not be members of the European Union but will not be complete outsiders either."
"Russia is one example; the countries of the Mediterranean region are others."
"It is important that we develop new ideas, that we cooperate with those specific countries that are neither in nor entirely out of the European sphere."
"This particular cooperation will also be very important as a means of fostering stability and security, the second defined priority."
"In this respect, it has to be clearly stated that Europe must do its homework."
"We cannot always rely on the United States to intervene."
"Nor do we want to be constantly dependent on U.S. intervention."
"One part of this is certainly the need to resist the hegemonic aspirations of the United States, but we in Europe must also learn to assume a more prominent role ourselves, at least in our immediate sphere of interest."
"In this respect too, 2003 will be an important year, for example with regard to the funding of joint assignments."
"Madam Vice-President, in order to do what it intends to do, the Commission naturally needs two things. The first is money, about which my honourable colleague will speak shortly, and the second is innovative governance and regulation."
"Unfortunately, the Commissioner is speaking at this very moment to the President-in-Office of the Council, whom I also wished to address."
"Perhaps he would have a moment to listen."
"Mr Miguel, I wanted to say something to you."
"Maybe someone could give the President-in-Office a set of headphones so that he can briefly listen to what I have to say."
"I wanted to say something to you about the question of alternative governance and regulation."
"I am grateful for the reply that Mr Aznar gave, but may I ask you to convey to him that his answer, following on from a previous reply he gave us in this House, did shed a little light for us on the domain of international cooperation but was certainly not entirely satisfactory."
"The fact is that the suggestion put forward by the Commission and the speech delivered by Mr Cox, Parliament's President, in Barcelona made it clear that we need a political agreement between the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"When the heads of government deal with other forms of governance - which I welcome - I believe it is only right that the parliamentarians in this House should concern themselves with it too."
"The Secretary-General may prepare something, but decisions must be taken by political bodies, of which this Parliament is one."
"(Applause)"
"Two years ago I spoke in the debate on the annual legislative programme on behalf of the Liberal Group, and I was very critical of the old process which I described as the swapping of shopping lists between Parliament and Commission."
"Now we have a proper process, a proper interinstitutional dialogue."
"We have in front of us now a broad strategy tailored to the overriding political goal of enlargement and few of us would disagree with the broad picture and, indeed, the early attempt to attach budgetary implications."
"Now the real process will start with detailed consideration in Parliament's committees and this is what is paramount."
"At last there is meaningful involvement of Parliament and I have no doubt the committees will start to flesh out a final legislative programme."
"This is a welcome change in our working methods and should allow us to plan and prepare our legislative work much better."
"Added to these developments, the Legal Affairs Committee had an historic joint meeting with national parliamentarians, this morning, to discuss the EU legislative process and how Community law is implemented."
"There can be no doubt that colleagues in national parliaments need fair warning of what we will be dealing with and when."
"This will allow them to input to us or to hold their ministers in the Council to account in a meaningful way."
"It was clear from our discussion that those Member States who allow their national parliamentarians early involvement in the process have far less difficulty implementing Community legislation."
"Their citizens are more comfortable with the process and the final result has increased legitimacy."
"That is the real connection we are all striving to obtain with our citizens so there are thankfully new winds blowing through our legislative process."
"The convention may unleash a few more but I am glad to see that those wretched shopping lists have gone at the first blast."
"The annual policy strategy for 2003 contains some key initiatives on the development of a sustainable and inclusive economy."
"In particular, the Commission wishes to tackle the mid-term review of the CAP and the reform of the CFP."
"Together these two major policy areas swallow half of the total EU budget but both the CAP and CFP have failed to meet their core objectives. They have failed to safeguard jobs."
"They have failed to secure a fair standard of living for our rural communities and they have failed to achieve sustainability."
"With that record of failure radical reform is long overdue and I am pleased to see that such proposals are central to the policy strategy for 2003."
"Indeed, in mid-April, the European Commission will publish its legislative proposals for the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"The centrepiece of this reform package will surely be devolution, devolving fisheries management to key stakeholders in discrete fishing zones."
"Although these committees will only act in an advisory capacity, at least initially, by involving fishermen, scientists and marine ecologists they will mark a dramatic step towards decentralisation of power, away from Brussels, and back to the grass roots."
"At a time of collapsing fish stocks, diminishing fleets, lost jobs, decommissioning, tie-ups and lay-offs, such an initiative could not come too soon and is to be greatly welcomed."
"In the EU we have far too many fishermen chasing far too few fish."
"We need an overall cut in the capacity of around 40% of the fleet, but let me make a special plea to the Commission and to the Council."
"Please do not export our problems of over-fishing and over-exploitation of resources out of the EU and into third countries."
"Recent case studies in Mauritania and Senegal show that they have depleted stocks."
"In Mauritania, catches of octopus have halved in the past four years."
"Some species, such as sawfish, have disappeared altogether."
"I applaud the policy strategy for seeking sustainable and inclusive objectives but let us remember such objectives must apply outside the EU just as much as inside."
"Mr President, on the subject of the area of freedom, security and justice, the Commission reminds us first of all how the fight against terrorism must always be in the foreground."
"On this point we can only say that we fully agree."
"The barbaric assassination of Professor Marco Biagi in Bologna yesterday tragically confirms the need for this commitment."
"We must, however, declare that we also agree with everything that the President-in-Office, Mr Aznar, has said here today, which is that right now we have the means to overcome terrorism."
"Besides, all the European institutions have demonstrated great sensitivity and a sense of urgency in adopting the measures demanded by the sudden exacerbation of this kind of political crime."
"It is in other sectors that the area of freedom, security and justice is being slow to develop, certainly through no fault of this Parliament and, in fact, not primarily through any fault of the Commission."
"The European Union does not carry out the duties conferred on it by the Treaty of Amsterdam in the area of immigration and asylum because of the obstacles raised by the Council, its inability to reach an agreement on the Commission's proposals, and its decisions time after time to adopt individual repressive instruments that impoverish any policy in this area and by themselves make it inadequate."
"It is a political problem to recover the will and the ability to use the instruments of civilisation to address this complex problem, which involves international relations, joint regulations and instruments for border control, and taking joint responsibility for the costs we have to meet and also for the objectives of cultural and economic enrichment that the challenge of integration poses for us."
"It is also, however, an institutional problem."
"The unanimity rule is paralysing; the lack of codecision is antidemocratic."
"The principles on which the European Union is founded - democracy and the Rule of Law, and hence subjection to judicial control - need to be extended to all areas of action relating to the security and freedom of the citizens."
"Including Europol in the Union's institutional framework is just one example of this need."
"The Commission could very usefully contribute a well-argued set of proposals on these matters to the Convention on the Future of Europe, which has just opened."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again we have a paper from the Commission on the table, on which I merely wish to say that I am astonished time and again by the consummate skill with which Commission officials can fill twenty-eight pages without saying anything of real substance."
"This at least has the strategic advantage of ensuring that they cannot subsequently be compelled to honour their commitments."
"May I say, Commissioner De Palacio, that these remarks naturally do not apply to the chapters for which you are responsible but to other chapters in this and other papers."
"Nevertheless, this is what we have now, and so I believe we ought to comment on it."
"As far as the single market is concerned, I can say on the basis of my experience of past years in this House that we are still far from having a single market which works truly effectively in every area."
"Major deficits still exist."
"I believe that the Commission should focus on the elimination of these deficits as one of its top priorities for 2003."
"In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have just been debating the Directive concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services at second reading stage."
"It has emerged once again that insurance services are one of those areas in which there is still no functioning single market but only compartmentalised national markets."
"As I said, there are still considerable deficits."
"The Commission's reports have shown that we have the same problem in other sectors of the economy too with the implementation of freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment."
"We have a report from the Commission that has already been discussed in committee and will no doubt soon have further repercussions, a report which deals with specific deficits in the realm of freedom to provide services."
"Time does not permit me to go into the various specific examples, but I would urge the Commission to continue the systematic pursuit of this approach and to ensure that we ultimately have a genuine functioning single European market."
"Let me mention one last point that was also discussed this morning at the meeting with members of the national parliaments. In January, Parliament adopted a report on further steps towards convergence in the realm of civil and commercial law."
"May I ask the Commission, and especially the Commissioners with the relevant portfolios, to forge ahead with these efforts and to present a Green Paper or White Paper as soon as possible to give us a firm idea of the direction in which we are heading."
"This, I believe, is quite crucial as a means of ensuring that the single market not only exists and operates to the advantage of big business but that consumers and smaller businesses also have the opportunity to make full use of the options offered by the single market."
"We are building the single market first and foremost for the people of Europe, not for the sole benefit of large companies."
"Hence my plea to forge ahead with increased vigour and increased energy, even in the face of the opposition which, as experience shows, is always encountered in some Member States."
"Mr President, I have learned the wisdom and educational value of tempering criticism with praise."
"For this reason, Commissioner De Palacio, let me begin with a word of praise."
"It is gratifying that we have finally managed to engage in a very early and timely debate on a strategic plan and that this dialogue between the Commission and Parliament and the specialised committee within Parliament has been launched in sufficiently good time."
"I refer expressly to these two institutions, because the role of the Council, in my view, may be disregarded."
"In Barcelona, we saw that the Council sets its own agenda and does what it wants and acts as a higher-grade specialised council."
"That is why the dialogue between you, Commissioner De Palacio, as the representative of the Commission, and Parliament is the only one that counts in this context."
"And then comes the criticism, but I can even present that in a favourable light."
"Commissioner De Palacio, if you ever see a job vacancy that involves selling a defective product, apply for it."
"You would give it your best shot."
"You have tried to do your best for a document that I did not understand."
"I marvel at anyone who has read this document and understood the message that is locked within its sentences."
"I reflected on ways of sniffing something out of this text."
"Would a guide dog help?"
"Or how about a Saint Bernard that can detect signs of life below an avalanche?"
"Some kind of tracker dog is needed, Commissioner De Palacio."
"The Commission has managed to pepper this document with every conceivable reference."
"The term 'consumer protection' crops up, and the concept of sustainability pops up here, there and everywhere, wherever it can possibly be squeezed in - sustainable transport, a sustainable economy, sustainable everything."
"But the document did not reveal to me what you actually intend to do and what your priorities are."
"At no point could I grasp what your real priorities are."
"Yes, there is enlargement, and yes, there is sustainable economic growth, perhaps security and stability too."
"But how you intend to achieve these things, Commissioner De Palacio, is concealed beneath a veneer of ornate prose."
"So when you return to the Commission, tell your fellow Commissioners what we shall all no doubt be telling them personally: they need to do their homework better next year."
"The challenge for us as a Parliament is now to take this skeleton you have presented to us and flesh it out with meaningful substance."
"If this were a piece of schoolwork, it would be returned with the comment 'A good effort, but improvement is needed for next time'."
"And that is my message to you."
"Mr President, painstaking efforts are needed to find any reference at all to the political domain of agriculture and rural development in this 28-page Commission strategy paper for 2003."
"The word 'agriculture' is mentioned all of three times in the course of one three-page section."
"This is perhaps due in part to the fact that the codecision procedure does not yet apply to agricultural legislation."
"At the same time, we are called upon for the first time to participate in the strategic assessment of issues such as enlargement, the WTO talks, the development of the Budget and the mid-term evaluation."
"On enlargement, the plan is to conclude the accession negotiations with the applicant countries in 2003, and then enlargement could begin in 2004."
"We are all well aware of the monumental tasks that await the Commission, Parliament and the Council in the areas of agriculture and rural development in 2003."
"In this respect, enlargement will also be a top priority of agriculture policy in 2003 and will require great negotiating skills."
"Yesterday's hearing on this subject in the Committee on Budgets highlighted the amount of work that is still to be done."
"Close dialogue with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is essential, as is better use of the resources allocated to pre-accession aid."
"In the WTO context, agriculture also plays a key role."
"And so I say to our friends in the Commission that we expect you to provide us with continuous information and consultation on progress in the WTO trade talks."
"You yourselves refer on page 14 of your crazy paper to a decisive phase in these negotiations."
"On the Budget, following the result of the vote on the Färm report, or, to be more specific, the adoption by this chamber of Guideline No 9, care should be taken to ensure that the amended mid-term evaluation is taken into account as far as possible in the 2003 Budget."
"This quite simple precept will cause huge headaches, particularly in view of the fact that the Member States are becoming increasingly accustomed to receiving substantial ring-fenced rebates of unused resources from the agricultural budget; these bonuses are particularly welcome, since they can save some countries from the prospect of an admonitory letter from Brussels."
"The strategic imperative for 2003 must therefore be full and more efficient utilisation of the agricultural budget, including flexible use of resources for new rural development programmes."
"One very important requirement is that quality must play a more important role in the allocation of aid under the common agricultural policy."
"Even non-farmers can see the point of compensatory payments that are based on quality."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for this year's budget, I have a number of matters to address in that connection."
"First of all, I am really not as critical as Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"I think it is important for us now to acquire an annual policy strategy which also constitutes the Commission's guideline for next year's budget."
"At present, all the institutions issue their guidelines in the spring, and the hope now exists that the Commission will also base its draft budget on ideas from the Council and Parliament."
"If so, that would be a clear improvement."
"Secondly, quite a few MEPs have pointed out that we need to strengthen the link between the Commission's legislative programme and the issues concerning the budget."
"Up until now, we have all too often ended up in a position in which we have obtained draft laws and proposals for new programs and expenditure and for setting up new institutions and so on, with no account being taken of the budgetary process and the financial consequences."
"It is especially in the sphere of foreign policy that a variety of promises are given."
"There is still a fair amount to be done in this area, but this year's process is nonetheless a step in the right direction."
"Thirdly, we can at least be pleased about the section on interinstitutional cooperation."
"If it is going to be possible to create an EU that operates well, such cooperation and confidence are crucial."
"It is therefore a source of deep concern to us to learn now that discussions of the new budget regulation, designed to reduce Parliament's influence, are being held within the Council."
"The Council's budget committee is discussing reducing our opportunities to place sums in the reserve and to influence supplementary and amending budgets and so forth."
"If the Council continues along those lines, it will call the institutional balance into question in a way that Parliament will never accept voluntarily."
"Fourthly, I want to address a factual matter."
"It is gratifying that all the institutions are now highlighting enlargement, which is of course the most important task for our time."
"I hope that, by no later than the budget conciliation in July, we shall be able to agree upon how we are to handle next year's administrative expenditure in such a way as to facilitate the preparations, partly by providing aid to construction, working on the language issues, deciding what staff need to be appointed and determining what regulations need to be drawn up if we are to be able to accept observers in our political groups."
"If all the institutions contribute by regarding these matters as important, we shall in actual fact have a chance of reaching such an agreement by no later than July."
"That would be an enormous boost."
"Finally, I hope that, before the negotiations are completed, the Council and the Commission will also institute an exhaustive discussion with Parliament concerning the long-term economic consequences of enlargement."
"I really do believe in enlargement, but we must not conceal from the taxpayers the fact that there is a price to pay."
"That is a matter which must be taken seriously."
"Mr President, although it may have no effect, given the amount of movement in the House, I would like to thank you all for taking the time to read the twenty-eight pages, including Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"I think that the twenty-eight pages succeeded in highlighting the positive elements, as Mr Swoboda said."
"Because there are some tables in Chapter 3, paragraphs 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, that give more specific details on the political proposals for the coming year."
"I would like to say that we are at the beginning of the year; this is the start of the period of discussion and dialogue with the different committees by the different Commissioners, and then we will continue working so that throughout the autumn we can have debates, concluding the process in November with the formal presentation by the President of the Commission in the plenary."
"Once again, I would like to congratulate you all and thank you for your work, and hope that this experience, which we are beginning with this debate today, will benefit the functioning of the institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I hope that it will produce good results and that, in the end, we will feel that we have taken a step forward in interinstitutional cooperation."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Mr President, since I made a critical remark about the statements made by Prime Minister José María Aznar, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, who is represented here, for having explained - at least to me - that it is incumbent upon Parliament to send our political representatives to the interinstitutional working party."
"That has clarified the matter, and I wanted to pass on this explanation to the House."
"The next item is the vote."
"Motion for a resolution RC B5-0180/2002"
"Mr President, in the interests of furthering our schoolchildren's education, we should publish the European Parliament's enthusiastic motions for resolution on the various summits, along with the harsh criticism of the summit that was recently expressed by a witness who cannot be reproached, since it was Mr Javier Solana."
"The same applies to today's resolution as much as to previous ones."
"It sends the public into raptures."
"As far as we are concerned, we have seen the real situation and we say that a Europe, which is not a social Europe, is not our own."
"I did not vote against the Barcelona European Council resolution, Mr President, because I am a staunch pro-European: I am in favour of Europe."
"I did not vote for it, either, Mr President, because there is something in this document that I do not find convincing: above all, I am not convinced by something in the statement and the results of the Barcelona European Council."
"What am I not convinced by?"
"The fifteen Heads of State and Government in the Council have agreed to make workers work five years longer, from an average age of 57 to an average age of 62."
"They announced this brilliant proposal publicly."
"Bravo!"
"Well done!"
"But rather than making those workers who already have a job work longer, would it not be better to commit to getting the unemployed who do not have a job into work?"
"There are so many of them, and they are mostly young."
"The Pensioners' Party is therefore against raising the pensionable age, whether on a voluntary basis, as it should be, or on a mandatory basis, for as long as there is still a single person out of work in Europe."
"Mr President, the reason I and many Conservative, or European Democrat, colleagues abstained on the vote overall is that there is an unacceptable reference in Paragraph 37 to the UK/Spanish talks on the future of Gibraltar which in no way takes into consideration the views of the 30,000 Gibraltarians who clearly wish to retain their sovereign link with Britain."
"The UK Labour Government has little interest in defending their cause, and has informed Gibraltar that it will be marginalised and financially pressured into falling into line with UK European strategic goals if they do not support the outcome of the talks."
"It is my belief that if this becomes reality Gibraltar should seek self-determination or some sort of Andorra-type solution."
"If the Spanish government disagrees it should consider what its response would be if Portugal were to insist on its treaty right to have Olivenca returned by Spain or Morocco were to insist on Ceuta and Mellila becoming theirs."
". (EL) ?he Communist Party of Greece is delighted that hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest about EU policy, a policy of poverty and unemployment, of privatisation and liberalisation."
"These demonstrations are a sign of optimism and show that the grass-roots movement is stepping up its fight to overturn this anti-grass roots policy."
"The leaders of the ?U, for their part, have stated that poverty and unemployment will be combated by developing entrepreneurship, reducing state aid and increasing employability and flexible work and they have been quick to formulate objectives such as speeding up the reform of pension systems and pushing the retirement age up five years by 2010."
"This is the much vaunted ""social model"" which is supposed to bring about full employment and make the ?U the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world."
"Infighting has stopped the privatisation of the energy market from being completed at this stage."
"However, they are united on the Middle East, declaring that the Palestinian Authority bears full responsibility for combating terrorism and making friendly overtures towards Israel."
"They have maintained a guilty silence on American threats to Iraq and plans to develop new nuclear weapons, but have little patience with the lack of progress on the ""Euro army"", which will allow them to take over from NATO in the FYROM."
"The resolution by the European Parliament is a commendation of the anti-grass roots policy of the EU, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it."
"The Barcelona European Council held on 15 and 16 March is another of those 'technical summits' that takes decisions which pass by unnoticed."
"In this case, rather than decisions, the rules by which the Member States have to abide are being made progressively stricter by means of some far from democratic procedures."
"In the run-up to the Council, Mr Romano Prodi sent a letter to the Heads of State and Government, setting out what - and I quote from that letter - 'the Commission expects from the Barcelona European Council'."
"This is a particularly daring role reversal."
"The letter launches, in particular, an appeal to tighten up economic coordination, a subject on which I have already spoken during the debate, and also voices the requirement for a more timely transposition of European legislation by the Member States."
"The Council repeated these two points in its conclusions without questioning, in particular, the essential role of the national Parliaments in transposing EU law."
"(Speech shortened pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(PT) As stated in the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the United European Left, of which we are members, the Barcelona Summit addressed some extremely important issues, specifically with regard to pursuing and speeding up the privatisation, liberalisation and deregulation of the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors and important aspects of workers' rights. The summit also insisted that the Stability Pact continue to be strictly applied."
"Regrettably, the European Council once again attached the greatest importance to structural reforms of the labour market based on greater flexibility, greater job insecurity and wage moderation."
"It is also a matter of concern that the Council recommended a five-year increase to the average retirement age, which, apart from anything, betrays the dangerous route we are taking of threatening social protection, which must be maintained and strengthened in order to provide support for the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"Therefore, as stated during the magnificent demonstrations staged by the trades union movement that ran in tandem with the Council in Barcelona, despite the attempts, worthy of our condemnation, by the Spanish Government and police to break up and suppress these events, what is needed is a change of policy and not more of the same."
"It is crucial that we protect public services, put an end to liberalisations and to the increasing insecurity of the labour market, and crucial that we fight against neoliberalism and advocate a different type of society; a fairer society and one which demonstrates greater solidarity."
"Hence our vote against the joint motion for a resolution by the other political groups, which we do not agree with."
"With this vote, Parliament is being asked to ratify the decisions taken at the Barcelona European Council."
"We are being asked to agree to the full liberalisation of the energy sector by 2004, regardless of public service obligations based on the principles of continuity of service, equal access and treatment of all users, land planning and protection of the environment."
"We are being asked to give a free hand in the deregulation of air transport through the single sky project and in the continued liberalisation of the railways."
"We are being asked to agree to increase the average retirement age by 5 years and to establish a pension fund."
"We are being asked to approve structural reforms of the labour market introducing flexible working conditions, job insecurity and wage moderation."
"In fact, we are being asked to say yes to the liberal Europe that has no social element."
"No, we cannot vote in favour of the outcome of the Barcelona Council and we fully support the message sent out by 100 000 trade unionists and 400 000 protestors who peacefully denounced the 'Europe of capital' and called for a different kind of Europe and a different kind of globalisation."
". The Barcelona Council, despite the big talk by Tony Blair before it, was disappointing and timid."
"The Council promised in the past to put sustainability in the forefront of European Development."
"This Summit has paid no more than lip-service to this commitment."
"The so-called 'liberalization' favoured by Blair's right wing caucus has hit the rock of French immoveability in relation to energy production in the domestic sector, so it remains the case that Electricité de France can take over companies outside France while protected from converse interventions."
"The rhetoric of liberalisation too frequently cloaks policies toward the single market that are dancing to the tune of monopolistically inclined interests of vast corporations."
"Adam Smith's vision of a free economy unhampered by interventions of massive aggregations of capital is far from the reality that we see in the contemporary globalised economy."
"In relation to Gibraltar, no one can fail to welcome progress between Spain and the United Kingdom."
"But there is no reference to the people of Gibraltar."
"What has become of self-determination?"
". (NL) We cannot live without work, but that certainly does not mean that an increase in employment enhances our lives."
"This is where two opinions clash."
"According to the Left, we must ensure that together we produce what we want to consume, whereby we distribute jobs and income as fairly as possible and protect people from high stress levels at work and long working hours."
"The opinion from the Right, on the other hand, states that we must continuously pursue economic growth by forcing women with young children, handicapped people and many pensioners to do paid work."
"Only the very elderly and those who can live off the interest on their own capital are exempt from this."
"Economic growth is always upheld most forcefully by those who refuse to share their wealth with the less well-off and who, for this reason, want to deflect attention from the distribution issue."
"In order to preserve the status quo in wealth distribution between rich and poor, they call for everyone to get more."
"Today, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar, and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, are acclaiming the further liberalisation and integration of markets, cost reduction and a yet larger European share in the global economy."
"Too few in this Parliament focus on the damage which the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits cause to the welfare of people, public services and the conservation of the natural environment."
"The price is too high in my opinion."
"This is why I reject the outcome."
"- (SV) I have abstained from voting in the final vote on the resolution, which was adopted by 211 votes to 58, with 34 abstentions."
"The reason is that I object to paragraphs 25, 35 and 37."
"According to paragraph 25, the European Parliament wishes to have a review of 'the open method of coordination between Member States in areas such as pensions, healthcare and education, to ensure that the European Parliament is fully involved in the work of the Council and Commission in these areas'."
"Parliament thus brings open coordination into question as a method and wishes to introduce a process that abandons intergovernmental decision-making within these fundamental national areas of legislation in favour of the Community method and supranationalism, with the European Parliament as co-decision-maker."
"As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I object to that development."
"Paragraph 35, concerning Zimbabwe, should have been much more vigorous in condemning the widespread violence to which the opposition MDC movement has been exposed during the election campaign at the hands of President Mugabe's regime and of those who perpetrate outrages on its behalf, as well as in condemning the killings, including the continued, racially motivated murders of white farmers."
"Paragraph 37, concerning Gibraltar, makes no mention at all of the people of Gibraltar and of their expressed political will."
"Citizens are fundamental to a democracy."
"Two days ago, they manifested their clear and unambiguous rejection of attempts by Great Britain and Spain to decide the fate of Gibraltar without listening to the people."
"On this issue, the European Parliament is forfeiting the perspective of the people, and that is a serious matter."
"I wish to raise a point of order concerning the conditions in which the debate has been held."
"I would like to express my profound unease at the intolerable behaviour of Vice-President Vidal-Quadras, a member of the Spanish Partido Popular, in giving the floor to his political friend, Mr Salafranca, when under Rule 122 there was no reason for it, while denying me the right to reply to him."
"You can check it on the video, Mr President."
"This partisan attitude of Vice-President Vidal-Quadras ought to be condemned most firmly because the credibility of this House depends on it."
"I have taken note of your point, Mr Gorostiaga."
"That concludes the explanations of vote"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 14 March 2002."
"May I inform the House that I have taken the chair because Mr Cox is on his way back to Strasbourg from Great Britain, having travelled there earlier today to pay his respects to the royal family on the occasion of the death of the Queen Mother."
"We shall be observing a minute's silence in memory of the Queen Mother tomorrow."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a tragic incident took place in the town of Nanterre in France on the night of Tuesday 26 March."
"An armed man gunned down members of the municipal council during a council meeting, leaving eight councillors dead and fourteen very seriously wounded."
"May I express my deepest condolences and sympathy on behalf of the European Parliament to the town of Nanterre, to the municipal council and to the victims' families."
"I should also like to praise the courage of the members of the council who managed to overpower the intruder."
"Elsewhere, Juán Priede Pérez, the only Socialist councillor in the village of Orio in the Basque country, was murdered by two terrorists on 21 March."
"The House sent its condolences and sympathy to Mr Priede's family and to the Chairman of the Spanish Socialist party the very same day."
"We also sent a message of support to the Spanish authorities."
"In murdering Juán Priede Pérez, the terrorists demonstrated yet again that they deny not only the right to life but, in this case, the right to life of a man who had dedicated himself to the welfare of his fellow citizens."
"They even deny the right to attend local political events and the right to exercise democratic rights."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to join me in a minute's silence for these two incidents."
"(?he House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Mr President, I know that a resolution is going to be adopted on the problem of Israel and Palestine during this sitting, but I believe we cannot start it without remembering that there have been 200 murders in Palestinian territory and that the Palestinian people are being humiliated by the army of a State."
"I therefore believe that we need this sitting to begin also..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Nogueira Román, may I ask you to repeat your comment when we get to the debate on the Middle East."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I should like, through you, to thank President Cox for his visit to the UK today."
"In that context, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, may I say that a number of my British colleagues wish to participate at least in some way in the occasion of the state funeral of the Queen Mother tomorrow."
"That is to take place at 12.30 p.m."
"I have raised the matter in my group, which supports my request, that the vote tomorrow might be brought forward to 11.30 a.m. so that all British Members who wish to can at least watch the state funeral at 12.30 p.m."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you for the comments you made earlier and to say briefly to the House and to the citizens who are listening, that when terrorists become madmen and when madmen become terrorists and kill Members of Parliament, at a time when civilians are the target of increasingly ruthless attacks which seek to eliminate politicians and MPs, it is worthwhile recalling that these people, these MPs, are showing utmost courage to protect the public good."
"Mr President, I would like, respectfully, to point out that, very often, when we rise and observe a minute's silence, the people in the public gallery remain comfortably in their seats."
"Considering that those people are European citizens too, I feel that they should also rise and observe a minute's silence with us."
"Mr President, on a point of order, in connection with the point raised by Mr Evans, I too would like to thank President Cox for his visit to London today to pay his respects on behalf of the European Parliament on the occasion of the death of the Queen Mother."
"I hope that the Conference of Presidents can give positive consideration to the request made by Mr Evans that the votes be brought forward tomorrow morning, so as to enable those British Members, and other Members, who may want to watch the funeral on television to do so."
"Thank you, Mr Murphy."
"The draft agenda, as finalised by the Conference of Presidents of the political groups at its meeting on 4 April, has been distributed in accordance with Rule 110."
"Tuesday:"
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists has asked for the vote on the joint debate of the six discharge reports of the Committee on Budgetary Control to be held at noon on Wednesday."
"The Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Barón Crespo, who tabled the request for the vote to be moved, has the floor."
"Mr President, the postponement of the debate is proposed specifically in relation to the Morgan report referring to the other institutions."
"But of course the discharge is a joint vote."
"And the reason is that the Council has to take a step forward in relation to Parliament on the specific issue of the implementation of the foreign and security policy and its monitoring."
"The Council has a positive attitude and it has to respond to the Commission tomorrow."
"We believe that it is important to take this step and that to postpone the debate until Wednesday would help us to assess this positive attitude on the part of the Council."
"We have therefore requested this postponement which, furthermore, will help to make tomorrow's voting time shorter."
"Mr Barón Crespo, if I may be so bold, I shall take your intervention as being in favour of moving the vote to noon on Wednesday."
"No one wishes to speak against."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"Tuesday:"
"As regards the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East, which are scheduled as the first item on Wednesday, the High Representative for foreign policy, Mr Solana, has informed us that he can attend Parliament to give his statement after 5 p.m. on Tuesday."
"As this is the case, the agenda for Tuesday afternoon could be scheduled as follows: joint debate on defence and arms from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., joint debate on the situation in the Middle East, with statements by Mr Solana and the Commission from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m."
"I should inform the House that, if this change is accepted, the debate on the situation in the Middle East will replace Question Time to the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group supports the proposal to timetable Mr Solana's statement for 5 p.m. tomorrow, and to combine it with a debate, so that the time from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. would then be available for it."
"Members must also be aware of the fact - which we must view sympathetically - that Mr Solana cannot be here on Wednesday, as he will be on his way to meet the American Secretary of State in Madrid."
"We in Parliament have to accept this reason for his absence."
"I have, though, one request, and would be grateful if other groups could join me in making it."
"I am, in particular, addressing Mr Barón Crespo, as I do not want to place conditions on our agreement to defer the vote on budgetary control."
"We have, though, accepted your argument, and I ask you to accept, when we prepare a resolution on the Middle East, that the vote be held on Thursday rather than on Wednesday."
"Our group is not actually in favour of a resolution, but the Conference of Presidents took the contrary view that there should be one."
"As democrats, we accept that."
"We will also be joining in the negotiation of a resolution, although we already had a very sound resolution in the last part-session, and will be playing our part as the ground-rules of Parliament require."
"If, though, negotiations take place on Wednesday in Madrid between the European Union - represented by Mr Solana and Mr Piquet - on the one hand and Secretary of State Powell on the other, it must be possible for the results of their discussions to find their way into the text along with everything else."
"That will probably not be that straightforward in procedural terms, but the groups here should in any case be able to comment verbally on what comes out of Madrid."
"It is, then, my urgent request that we should not vote on the text of the resolution on Wednesday - that would in any case be too late for the talks in Madrid - but should vote on Thursday, when the results from Madrid will be known."
"I should be grateful if you could agree to that, for we too are accommodating when you bring to this House matters in which you have a justifiable interest."
"Mr President, please allow me to correct Mr Poettering on some of his information."
"There will not be a bilateral meeting between Europe and the United States on Wednesday in Madrid, but rather a summit chaired by the President-in-Office of the Council - Mr Aznar, a political colleague of yours - which will be attended by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, who is currently in Madrid, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ivanov, Mr Powell, Mr Piqué and Mr Solana."
"This summit will be dealing with a matter that this House has already voted on."
"We believe it is very important that everybody should be there, including, if possible, a representative of the Arab League, but that is yet to be confirmed."
"Therefore, the summit in Madrid on Wednesday is of particular importance."
"I am not going to go into the debate we are holding tomorrow, but I believe it is important and essential that Parliament can speak with a strong voice in defence of the role of Europe and try to offer a glimmer of light and a degree of hope during these tragic times."
"I therefore believe it would be politically timely for a resolution to arrive at the Madrid Summit alive and kicking, which is perfectly feasible."
"Furthermore, in its Standing Committee of 6 April, the Parliamentary Assembly of NATO, which is not known for its Socialist tendencies, tabled a resolution which I believe is in accordance with what we ourselves would propose."
"I believe and hope that we can achieve a resolution along similar lines."
"I am referring to something very dear to the PPE-DE Group, the Parliamentary Assembly of NATO."
"Therefore, I insist that, in accordance with the philosophy of President Cox, who is not here at the moment, but would advocate this, it is essential to keep up with events and therefore I believe it is especially timely that we should vote on Wednesday and that the result of the vote should be known in time for Madrid."
"Mr President, we should not lightly move Question Time to the Commission."
"It is all very well to play high politics in this House but to many of our Members Question Time to the Commission is extremely important."
"Indeed, much of our work of scrutinising of the Commission is done through Question Time."
"I accept the case on this occasion, since we wish to have representatives of the Council and the Commission present for the debate."
"However, I would appeal to my colleagues in the other groups that we do not make a habit of moving Question Time to the Commission."
"It is an important part of our work."
"Our view on the question of the vote is that we are in a very fast-moving situation."
"We will certainly know more by Thursday than we will by Wednesday."
"There is a good case on this occasion for taking that vote on Thursday lunchtime and not on Wednesday."
"Mr Watson, may I assure you that your comments on the matter of Question Time to the Commission have been noted."
"Mr President, I have just returned from Jerusalem and Ramallah and I would, above all, like to support the principle of tomorrow's debate, whether or not Question Time to the Commission has to be moved, although this is also an important part of our proceedings."
"This debate must be held in the presence of Mr Solana. My group and myself believe it is crucially important that the substance of our joint resolution provides a response to the unacceptably dismissive act of the Israeli Government with regard to Mr Solana and Mr Piqué, the representatives of the European Union, in other words."
"It is of secondary importance whether the vote takes place on Wednesday or Thursday."
"If I have to choose, I would prefer to take the vote on Wednesday for the reasons given by Mr Barón Crespo."
"But the main thing is that our position is unambiguous and is independent of the compromise reached and statements issued in Madrid."
"Mr President, I will be very brief for I fully agree with what Chairman Wurtz has just said."
"I would especially like to stress how important it is - and I am addressing Chairman Barón Crespo and Chairman Poettering, in particular - that, this time, Parliament adopts a resolution which is absolutely unambiguous."
"I feel that we, at least, have all the tools necessary to be able to speak with one voice and that it is important that we do so."
"My group would also prefer the vote on the resolution to take place on Wednesday, as Chairman Wurtz has suggested."
"Mr President, although, like the vast majority of this House, I naturally regard the tragic problem of the Middle East to be an absolute priority, as Vice-President responsible for Questions to the Commission and the Council and on behalf of all those who have asked and wish to verify what the Commission's position is, I would like to add my voice to what the Chairman of the Liberal Group, Mr Watson, has just said."
"We cannot cancel Questions to the Commission."
"Change the time, find the right solution, but Question Time cannot be treated as a joker which, according to the Commission or the Council's ability to come here, can be thrown away by Parliament."
"It seems to me to show a lack of respect to cancel these events and I trust in you and the House to maintain Question Time, even if we hold it at another time."
"Mr Puerta, may I assure you that there is no intention of losing Question Time to the Commission."
"It is just that there is a problem in this particular instance which I think we all understand."
"Nonetheless, your comments have been noted, as were Mr Watson's."
"Mr President, as this is the first time you have been in this situation, my reproach is not directed at you; in recent years, though, I have known many Vice-Presidents of this House who said in discussions of this sort on the issue of Question Time that they would endeavour to ensure that it did not happen again and that it was an exception."
"It is, though, increasingly becoming the rule."
"I can give you statistical evidence that this is a fact and so I ask you as a matter of urgency to put Question Time back at an hour when it is absolutely certain that it can take place."
"It used to be held at the beginning of the Tuesday evening sitting and was always on time."
"It has regularly been wrecked, every other or every third time, since being moved to the afternoon."
"Nowadays we are regularly stopping at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday through apparently not having anything to discuss until 6.30 or 7 p.m."
"We do not sit on Fridays, yet we do not have time for Members to exercise their elementary right, guaranteed by the Treaties, to ask questions. This is absolutely unacceptable, and I am asking not only that this be changed, but also for the restoration, as soon as possible, of the Question Time with Commissioner Busquin and others, which many of us have carefully prepared for."
"We do not want to be sent written answers drafted by civil servants, but to be able to ask supplementary questions, as is the custom in parliaments."
"Mr Posselt, as I explained earlier, we are in a very difficult situation in this particular instance."
"Your comments have been noted and I can assure you that there is no intention of doing away with Question Time."
"We shall now proceed with two votes:"
"The first is on whether we agree to hold the debate on the Middle East on Tuesday, as stated earlier."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"The second vote is on whether to hold the vote on the motions in question on Wednesday or Thursday."
"(Parliament voted in favour of Wednesday)"
"Mr President, I would like you to clarify an earlier point."
"You said we would be losing Question Time, but are we also losing the Commission communication at 5.30 p.m.?"
"You are quite right, Mr Provan."
"We shall also lose the Commission communication at 5.30 p.m."
"Wednesday:"
"I must remind you, now that we have taken these decisions, that the debate and the Council and Council communications on the Middle East will now be held on Tuesday afternoon."
"I have a request from Mr Leinen for the debate to be held on Wednesday."
"Mr President, extraordinary situations sometimes do call for extraordinary actions."
"I would have liked the President of the European Parliament, after the vote on Wednesday, to call for a lunchtime demonstration in support of peace in the Middle East."
"We have a wonderful atrium, which is at other times the venue for celebrations."
"We have a wonderful square in front of the building."
"All our aides, all our people here, would be able to join in."
"All we need is a microphone, and if that is too much of a problem, then I would do my bit to get one."
"I believe that an extraordinary action of this kind would send a strong signal that Europe is not willing to accept this spiral of violence in the Middle East."
"Those were powerful images on Wednesday of all days, the most significant day for a peaceful solution in the Middle East."
"I ask you, with your colleagues in the Conference of Presidents, to give some thought to that."
"Thank you very much for your comments, Mr Leinen, which I shall relay verbatim to the President of the European Parliament."
"Thursday:"
"As far as the topical and urgent debate is concerned, we have received a request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and from the Group of the Party of European Socialists for a new item entitled 'EU position for the next special session of the UN General Assembly on Children' to be added beneath the title 'Human Rights'."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Similarly, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have asked that the title of the fifth item be formulated as follows: 'Torrential rain in Tenerife and eastern Spain and climate change'."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"That finalises the agenda."
"Speeches on points of order"
"Mr President, on a point of order, perhaps the House would like to know that at the Joint Parliamentary Assembly held in Cape Town, which was ably co-chaired by Mrs Kinnock, we passed a very strong resolution."
"That is the good news."
"The bad news is that under the new draconian laws which have been brought in by President Mugabe, the editor of the daily newspaper which printed the resolution, in full and accurately, has been threatened and charged with a USD 2 000 fine - or two years in prison if he does not pay it."
"He has declared that he would rather go to prison than not tell the truth."
"Since this House is founded on freedom of speech, could the presidency write to Mr Mugabe and say that we would not expect any harm to come to this man and that we support freedom of speech."
"Mr President, I naturally support what my colleague, Mr Corrie, has said."
"This would be the first application of the Access to Information Act recently adopted by the Parliament in Zimbabwe."
"We should not underestimate the seriousness of the threats to these journalists on The Daily News."
"We should accordingly be very careful not to inflame the situation in any way."
"Therefore I would ask that we should perhaps consider writing to the Minister of Justice rather than to President Mugabe, and also that we should say that we are merely confirming the facts of what happened in Cape Town."
"In the current situation we do not want to say anything that does not sound neutral. I would just urge that we bear that in mind when the letter is sent."
"As you know, we held a minute's silence in memory of the victims of terrorism."
"Please let us respect the memory of the people we honoured."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I want to make a complaint about my colleague, Mr Helmer."
"He produces an electronic newsletter called 'Straight Talking' and in that he has written what I consider to be a very serious insult to Mrs Nicole Fontaine."
"He describes her views as socialist verging on Marxist - which I think would come as a surprise to Mrs Fontaine, as well as to others in this House - but the most serious thing he says is that the title of her memoirs should be 'Mein Kampf'."
"That is a serious matter and I would like to invite Mr Helmer, through you, Mr President, either to apologise and retract these remarks, or alternatively to explain them."
"Mr President, I thank Mrs Read for giving such a good plug to my electronic newsletter."
"If any colleagues wish to go on the circulation list, please let me know and I shall be happy to oblige them."
"Mrs Fontaine gave a speech before the Lisbon Summit in which she criticised the evils of capitalism."
"I therefore feel entirely justified in describing those views as socialist verging on Marxist."
"The remark I made about Mrs Fontaine's book Mes combats was, as I recall, that humorists in Parliament had been saying that the German edition should be entitled 'Mein Kampf', which is, I believe, German for Mes combats."
"Thus, I was merely repeating gossip, which I feel I am entitled to do."
"I would say to Mrs Read, my regional colleague, that the issue of the speech which Mrs Fontaine made before the Lisbon Summit was aired in this Chamber nearly two years ago."
"So she is a little behind the times."
"Mr President, I only wished to say that I sent a letter to Mr Cox last week to inform him about a disaster which struck the island of Tenerife, specifically the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where unfortunately, as well as the material damage, seven people lost their lives."
"I would be grateful if you could pass on our condolences to the Mayor of the city and I would also be grateful if on Thursday this House could support the motion for a resolution that some Canarian Members have tabled."
"Mr President, the Council has requested that urgent procedure be applied when it comes to special restrictive measures aimed at certain persons in terms of what is referred to as the fight against terrorism."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has an extra meeting this evening."
"I hope that account will also be taken of the fact that some of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have asked a number of victims of this terrorist legislation in the European Union to come here to the European Parliament on Wednesday, both for a press conference and a round-table conference."
"There are three of them: Swedish citizens who have ended up in a rat trap."
"This is a huge legal scandal, at least in my view and that of many others."
"In this connection, I would also say how genuinely sorry I am that the Council is unwilling to be represented at this round-table conference."
"I think it is downright disgraceful, given that these are in actual fact people who are not in a position to defend themselves."
"They have not even been charged with any offence, yet all their financial assets have been frozen."
"Mr President, may I inform the House that the international convention held in Nicosia on 5 and 6 March, to express solidarity with the Palestinian people and attended by 43 left-wing and other parties and organisations from 22 countries, adopted a resolution condemning Israel's all-out attack on the Palestinian people, the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian leadership."
"?his resolution also expressed solidarity with the peaceful forces of Israel and called on the international community, and the permanent members of the UN Security Council, the European Union and the Arab League in particular, to exert pressure on Israel to comply with both the recent and not so recent resolutions of the United Nations."
"One wonders how Israel can engage in this sort of barbarianism against civilians, including children, while the powerful nations on earth stand by and do nothing."
"One wonders where it finds the courage to beat up Greek Members of Parliament, deny entry to a Cyprus parliamentary delegation and even stop high-ranking European Union officials from meeting President Arafat."
"One wonders why the European Union does not use the means at its disposal to stop Israeli aggression, why it does not take financial measures, why it does not stop arms exports to Israel."
"Under these tragic circumstances, our failure to condemn Israel and our silence make us accessories to the crime of genocide of the Palestinian people and murderers of peace."
"Mr President, I will just come back to Mrs Read's remark and Mr Helmer's statements."
"Mr Helmer obliges me to make a remark that I actually did not believe I would ever have to make. I speak as one who, in this House during Mrs Fontaine's term of office, was often harshly critical of her."
"I find myself now constrained to say that when Mr Helmer writes in his newsletter that Mrs Fontaine's statements bordered on Marxism or socialism, I must contradict him in the most emphatic terms."
"Nicole Fontaine deserves many things, but to associate her with Marxism or socialism is false."
"It is, Mr Helmer, as if one were to associate you with clever remarks."
"That would be just as erroneous."
"I must say that we cannot allow Members or representatives of this House to be smeared in this way, for, alongside the facetious comment, the recommendation that a representative of Parliament should call her book 'Mein Kampf' equates her with historical parallels which make it unacceptable in any way whatever."
"I find that even in this House we have to be able to censure such a thing."
"I will just ask the following of the ladies and gentlemen in the PPE-DE Group."
"This House envisages that politicians of the same political orientation join together in a group - how can the PPE-DE's people actually sit together with such a man in the same group?"
"Mr President, with reference to the Israeli-Palestinian question, I would like to draw your attention and that of the Members to the fact that our fellow Member, Mrs Morgantini, who went to the occupied territories with a delegation of members of the Italian parliament and Italian trade unionists, was seized and used as a human shield by the Israeli army."
"I am quite aware that the situation is extremely serious and that this might seem an insignificant incident, but I feel that such treatment of a woman who, in addition to being courageous, is a Member of our Parliament, must be condemned."
"I would be grateful to the President of this House if he could send a message to the Israeli Government, protesting at the treatment suffered by Mrs Morgantini."
"Mr President, I am going to speak on the same subject as Mr Bigliardo but I have something different to say."
"I am sorry - as I believe we all are - that Mrs Morgantini has suffered such an experience, but not because she is a Member of the European Parliament but because she is a European citizen: in other words, I would be just as concerned for any other European citizen."
"However, even before Mr Bigliardo spoke, I wanted to ask that, in tomorrow's debate on the events in Israel and Palestine, the Commission call upon all the European citizens who are not officials of the United Nations, NATO or the European Union to refrain from indulging in macabre tourism out of curiosity and false solidarity."
"Those who go to a land where there is a genuine war taking place do so completely at their own risk and peril and cannot hope to involve the international community."
"They do not need any of this sort of tourism down there: our solidarity must be displayed within our own towns and countries and in parliamentary chambers."
"Two or three delegations of left-wing members of the Italian parliament have been stopped at Tel Aviv airport and sent home again: they did no more than visit the inside of the airport, creating further disturbance and generating further concern."
"I do not think there is any need for this."
"I therefore ask the Commission to call explicitly on the European citizens not to indulge in this sort of tourism."
"Mr President, I would just like to reply to Mr Schultz."
"He makes two points."
"The first point is a political point about Mrs Fontaine's attitude contained in her speech at Lisbon."
"There she made a speech attacking capitalism in very clear terms."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Helmer, we have, I think, discussed the matter in detail."
"You have had a chance to express your views and the honourable Members have had a chance to form an opinion on certain matters."
"Let us not now enter into a whole debate. I think we have exhausted the subject."
"Mr President, I would just like to make a brief observation, namely that the situation with Mr Helmer is one thing and the attack on another group is another matter."
"Firstly, anyone who is acquainted with the range of Europe's Social Democrats and their historical background over the past ten to fifteen years should not make statements about such diversity in the way that Mr Schulz just has."
"Secondly, there is no arguing about matters of taste, and on that we are once more in agreement."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I am rising to ask you to contact the Colombian authorities and to ask them to clarify the situation and to guarantee the safety of two fully accredited human rights workers who are in the Bolivar province of Colombia under the aegis of the Corporation of Professional Community Services (Sembrar)."
"They are two EU citizens."
"One is an Irishman, Gearóid Ó Loinsigh, and the other is a German woman, Gudrun Christa Kern."
"They are two fully accredited human rights workers."
"They travelled to the region on 13 March to meet, by appointment, the board of management of the South Bolivar Agri-Mining Federation."
"They ran into considerable difficulties, initially with the fifth brigade of the national army there, and subsequently having their hotel ransacked."
"I am asking through the presidency of Parliament that you contact the Colombian authorities and ensure their safe passage to carry out the work they have been asked to do by the Irish Government and the Irish NGO, in the case of the Irishman, and I am sure the same applies to the German woman."
"Mr President, I wish to follow on from what Mrs Doyle has said."
"Mr Gearóid Ó Loinsigh is a personal friend of mine and two years ago I travelled with him to Colombia."
"These people, who are working with a human rights organisation, were invited by the local farming and mining community to investigate human rights abuses in a particular area."
"As soon as they arrived in that area they were confronted by the army asking them why they were there, etc. Then they recommended that they stay in a specific hotel which was known to be frequented by death-squad personnel."
"Fortunately they did not stay there, but at midnight that night that very hotel was raided by death squads."
"Parliament has a duty to send a clear message to the Colombian authorities."
"This issue of death squads, of the paramilitaries, and of their backing by the Colombian authorities has to be addressed."
"The UN office in Bogotá, which is co-financed by the EU, has on about 100 occasions issued recommendations to dismantle these paramilitaries."
"The Colombian authorities are basically doing nothing but paying lip-service to these recommendations."
"The UN and Amnesty International have both confirmed that paramilitaries are involved in about 75-80% of human rights violations in Colombia."
"It is about time that the Colombian authorities lived up to international norms, and Parliament should send a clear message that if anything happens to these two human rights workers then they will be held responsible."
"The next item is the debate on the report (?5-0047/2002) by Mr Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision concerning security in connection with football matches with an international dimension [12175/1/2001 - C5-0067/2002 - 2001/0824(CNS)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, sport in general, and football in particular, occupy a very special position in society, both in defining behaviour and in the collective imagination."
"The crowds which regularly travel to big matches, and big international matches, in particular - as well as the number of television viewers - is quite simply staggering."
"Professional football today is highly popular; it is a massive game, a massive spectacle and, it has to be said, a massive business."
"Too often, unfortunately, the big matches - and especially the big international matches - are also the stage on which unacceptable aggression, rioting and violence are acted out with scant regard for sporting principles or the respect due to persons and property."
"Furthermore, no Member State totally escapes the risk of disturbances, even if some international matches are more sensitive than others and the supporters of some clubs or national teams are seemingly easier to control than others."
"It is precisely in order to more effectively prevent and control the risk of disturbances during international competitions that the Kingdom of Belgium took the initiative to put forward a proposal for a Council decision on which we are due to vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft decision is based on three observations."
"First of all, the number of football matches taking place at international level is currently increasing rapidly, such as the various European competitions, the European Championship and other tournaments, which, owing to the increase in the number of travelling supporters, entails greater risk of disturbances, or even violence, during competitions."
"The second observation is, in order to prevent disturbances and to maintain law and order in connection with football matches is to have, first and foremost, it is essential to have an organised and efficient system for exchanging information regarding the risks that some matches present - and more specifically, certain types of supporters who travel to matches - and therefore, secondly, to improve coordination between the organisations responsible for security."
"In this respect, we must recognise that the current system of cooperation between police forces, based on non-binding agreements and ad hoc contacts fostered at each match, has demonstrated its weakness if not its inefficiency."
"It is also unreliable, slow and inconsistent."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, the draft decision proposes that each Member State formally establishes or designates a police-run national football information centre to act as a single, central and direct point of contact between the authorities and the police force of the Member States responsible for ensuring security at international football matches or competition with an international dimension."
"Each national football information centre must therefore have the necessary resources and qualified staff."
"It goes without saying that the operational needs are not the same in Finland, Austria, France, Germany, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands."
"The various national information points that are established or designated must therefore function as information exchange networks providing data of a general nature - such as the number of supporters travelling, high-risk groups, the presence of hard core groups - and personal data, in other words, supporters posing risks to law and order and security."
"In adopting the proposed report, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs gave its approval to the broad guidelines of this proposal for a Council decision."
"It also approved 19 amendments, which all seek either to strengthen the operational nature of the network or, Mrs Buitenweg, to increase the protection of citizens when exchanging personal information."
"If it adopts the report, the House will demonstrate its will to combat hooliganism more effectively and, in doing so, it will help professional football to confirm its main purpose, which is to provide enthusiastic supporters with a high standard of play, thus preventing a handful of savages from turning stadiums and host cities into training camps for rioters or battle grounds for rival gangs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Deprez warmly on his report."
"It was not an easy task, because the Council continuously submitted updated versions."
"Despite this, he succeeded in presenting a sound report on this important matter in which citizens feel very closely involved."
"I wholeheartedly endorse his proposal as long as it deals with the proper exchange of information and better coordination with the bodies that are responsible for security at football matches."
"It would certainly benefit efficiency if information were to be centralised within one establishment for each Member State, which could then act as a port of call for all those involved."
"This is essential, and works very well in the Netherlands, for example."
"I should like to warn you, however, that the privacy and personal rights of the individual supporter may not be flouted in the process."
"Article 4(3) is of crucial importance."
"National and international legislation forms the basis for collecting, exchanging and using information."
"Acting against actual football violence should fall within the remit of the judiciary and not of sports bodies that organise football matches."
"Controlling football vandalism, however, is not only a matter of more effective police action."
"In my view, it is far more important to change the mentality of the supporter."
"Sport and both professional and amateur football fulfil a broad, social function."
"Experts have ascertained that football-related violence originates, for example, in the pursuit of masculinity and status and the battle for territory."
"This must change, and clubs, supporters' associations and the players themselves clearly have a role to play in this."
"In addition, the UEFA has a major role."
"This organisation knows - as no other - the problems which can occur, through its close contacts with the national football bodies and extensive experience in organising football matches."
"I should like to call on them to cooperate."
"I should also like to urge the national information points to closely involve sports clubs, supporters' associations and the UEFA in its activities, so that these can be implemented as well and effectively as possible so as to enhance security at football matches with an international dimension."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to respond on behalf of Mr Cashman who is a Socialist Group shadow on this report and cannot attend this evening."
"He would like to inform the House that the PSE Group welcomes this report and the measures in it intended to prevent the activities of hooligans and organised thugs at matches."
"We will, however, need to monitor the way these monitoring centres carry out their functions to ensure that the football community is fully engaged in the exchange of information."
"Most important of all is the need to ensure adequate resources both in financial and personnel terms."
"It would be wrong to raise expectations to a level which cannot be met."
"We can, of course, defeat hooliganism."
"The proposals indicate we have the will to do the job, but the resources must follow."
"Then I would like to intervene personally in this debate."
"I too would like to add my support to Mr Deprez's report and its amendments, specifically, his amendment 10 calling for closer cooperation and an organised exchange of information."
"If the European network of national football information centres is to be effective, then we need to address the current weaknesses in the system of information exchange and ad hoc contacts."
"On Friday, I visited the football intelligence unit in the Greater Manchester police service."
"Unfortunately, we have a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling football-related violence in my city."
"The assistant Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police has read this report and he welcomes the initiative in the light of what he calls ""different standards in dealing, for example, with Manchester United away fixtures and England away fixtures""."
"On Friday the unit was preparing for two key matches on Saturday."
"One of those was Oldham versus Stoke City: the last time these two teams had met, known hooligans had rampaged through the town, wrecking property and attacking people."
"In the UK we have pro-active football legislation to deal with our hooligan problems."
"This allows us to impose banning orders; so, when a hundred of those fans arrived in Oldham, they were immediately arrested because they are banned from attending any matches."
"Those banning orders also apply to international matches."
"The football intelligence unit has a sophisticated database of so-called 'football prominents', using the latest digital image technology to update and record cases."
"Let me tell you where the unit believes the EU information exchange system has to do better: 150 fans were deported from Charleroi in June 2000."
"Among those arriving in Manchester airport were Belgian nationals, some of whom may not have been involved in any hooliganism at all."
"Rounding up and deportation without prosecution does nothing to help the intelligence network on hooliganism."
"A list of, and report on, the deportees was then sent to the intelligence unit: very helpful as far as it went, but the report contained no information."
"Officers could not read it because it was not in English, and they could not act on it because the information did not allow for any further action due to prosecution or conviction."
"During Euro 1996, German fans arrived in Manchester."
"As a result of German data protection and privacy laws, no lists of known hooligans could be passed on to the local intelligence forces and the officers working in the unit therefore had no information accessible in a usable format to tackle the hooligans."
"So there is an issue here, Commissioner, in that we do need to standardise our information formats while recognising that there are different cultures on policing and information collection across the EU."
"Perhaps we need to consider some form of information protocol."
"This was the idea of my own football intelligence unit officers."
"We need to deal with hooliganism pro-actively not re-actively."
"On the issue of cost, which is an amendment tabled by Mrs Sanders-Ten Holte, no doubt it would be useful to have a study on whether clubs should pay more for the policing of hooliganism."
"The difficulty is, however, who pays those costs after hours in cities where football hooligans are still engaged in activities."
"In 2004 we will be hosting the final of the European championships at Old Trafford in Manchester."
"Our priority has to be to protect the law-abiding supporter and clamp down on hooligans who spoil the game."
"We need a practical, pro-active approach to information sharing for national monitoring centres."
"Their existence alone, Commissioner, will not guarantee the end of football hooliganism."
"The proposal to set up a European network of permanent, national football information points, in other words, to enhance cooperation between the Member States where the enforcement of law and order in international football matches is concerned, is a Belgian initiative which is based on the experience gathered at Euro 2000, the European national teams championship, which, as you know, was organised jointly by Belgium and the Netherlands in June 2000."
"The proposal and report are sound, and the initiative is excellent in my view. I should, however, like to make two observations."
"First of all, the proposal only applies, of course, to EU Member States."
"You may ask, what about the countries outside the European Union, many of whose clubs also take part in international competitions?"
"Turkey, Romania and Croatia also play teams of the EU Member States."
"I hear you say that candidate countries will obviously need to adopt the acquis communautaire, and that is right."
"But that is not now nor in the immediate future."
"For some of them, that is not until 2004 at the earliest."
"And then, what about the others? What about the non-candidate countries?"
"It may be possible to link up with the UEFA and with the national football unions, to find a way round this."
"Secondly, greater involvement and cooperation by the clubs and supporters' associations is important to improve the climate and the quality."
"And I believe that specific efforts must be made in order to achieve this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, major international football matches are the absolute high point for supporters; for law enforcers and local authorities, however, they are often expensive nightmares and, for the people living in the vicinity of sports stadiums, often a source of distress and a great deal of misery as a result of the damage caused to their front gardens, to cars, to pavement cafés etc. The list goes on."
"This Council decision is first of all directed at a hard core which, so far, has been able to exploit the loopholes in the exchange of information between the different police services."
"The effective coordination of the exchange of information is therefore not an unnecessary luxury."
"However, let it be clear that this is, first and foremost, a preventive instrument which must allow for effective risk assessment."
"Incidentally, Mr Deprez' report is very good."
"He managed to clarify the original text and also to tighten it up, by, inter alia, devoting more attention to the times before and after the games."
"A well-oiled network of 'football' information points must be able to deploy forces in a targeted and effective manner."
"The international football competition takes up a great deal of energy and resources of the police services involved, resulting in the risk that other tasks may be carried out to a lower standard."
"The key question surrounding instruments of this nature, however, is how the law-enforcing bodies themselves can be monitored."
"An almost self-evident first step in this is to inform the individuals involved about the fact that they have ended up in this database and to grant them access to this."
"A counter-argument could be that this could hamper the monitoring function of the police services and offer the people included on the database a tactical advantage."
"I, however, believe this to be a misapprehension about what actually happens."
"This is not purely about a self-evident right, namely that of knowing whether or not you are included in a database. It is also about issuing a clear warning which also has a deterrent effect."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking quite frankly, I can summon up but little enthusiasm for couch potatoes who sit in front of the telly or in a football stadium for ninety minutes watching a small round leather thing and about two dozen men in jerseys, leaving their seats in the meantime only to roar with enthusiasm, or wring their hands in shock."
"It is not that, though, with which we are dealing here, for the protection of fundamental rights -which I believe to be threatened by this proposal - only makes sense if it applies to all the people in a State, and not only to those whose thoughts and actions enjoy the State's approval."
"Within the so-called area of freedom, security and justice, the Deprez report aims at the actual gathering of more information on football hooligans."
"Over and over again during discussions on the proposal, the rapporteur disputed that this would, in the long term, entail travel bans, preventive custody and the infringement of fundamental rights, as no measures are envisaged over and above the collection of data."
"I will take an example from the country in which I was elected in order to make clear how, in my view, it will certainly not, in the long term, remain just a matter of gathering data."
"In the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, there has already been a legal document, according to which hooligans who are allegedly equipped for violence may have their right to leave the country restricted."
"A year ago, though, that was used, not against hooligans, but against people who were equipped to demonstrate and wanted to travel to Genoa."
"Some of those who had originally voted for this law have since said in the media that this was far from being what they wanted."
"They had, they said, voted for the law at that time only on the presupposition that it really only applied to football hooligans, and not to people who wanted to express their political views."
"I think this shows very well what can happen to documents of this sort."
"I would be surprised if this really were only about the gathering of data, for what is a database for if nothing is done with it afterwards?"
"It is very easy to see through the political manoeuvre that lies behind it."
"A new target group - the hooligans - has been found, which is well suited to legitimising police measures in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, and thus measures are justified which very definitely restrict the protection of fundamental rights and which are then extended to other people."
"This, then, means in the long term that this will not just be a matter of gathering data, but that travel restrictions, preventive detention and so on will very definitely find their way into this 'fortress Europe' policy, which will then be applied to other groups."
"If you want to give your approval to that, if that is your understanding of the area of freedom, security and justice, then you should indeed vote in favour of the Deprez report."
"Mr President, the Council's initiative and Mr Deprez' report plug a huge gap in legislation to prevent and suppress hooliganism and violence at football matches, which have taken on explosive dimensions over recent years as a result of the Member States' failure to apply efficient measures."
"Without doubt, the commercialisation of football and the profit motive are the prime cause of violent episodes at football matches."
"Brawls are no longer led by wild crowds of fans, they are led by organised mafias using fanaticism and violence to serve specific illegal purposes which have nothing to do with the love of sport."
"In short, it has been suggested that violence at football matches sells, it brings in a profit."
"Violence at football matches is organised and orchestrated nowadays, frequently using sport as a front for common crime, such as selling drugs and laundering dirty money, according to an investigation carried out in Britain."
"Over recent years, various groups of hooligans have been making blatant use of new technology, mobile telephones and the Internet, to organise their activities and, of course, to mislead the police."
"This being the case, we cannot create a European area of freedom, security and justice unless we first create a network of information points and reinforce police and judicial cooperation between the 15 Member States in order to suppress violence at football matches."
"Of course, the sports associations still have a crucial role to play in distancing themselves from hooliganism and teaching their fans the importance of friendly competition, collaboration, dialogue, respect for other people's differences and peaceful coexistence."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens will be a important opportunity to revive the Olympic spirit and the ideals of the Olympic truce and peace, as an alternative political proposal to the mindset and culture of violence."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank Mr Deprez, and indeed the Belgian State, for this excellent report and excellent initiative."
"It is true that the scourge of violence, often organised violence, has plagued international sport, particularly international football, for too long."
"We wholeheartedly support initiatives that are aimed at increasing cooperation between authorities in different Member States."
"They are a vital tool in the battle to keep sport clean and to keep it as it should be."
"We like you to consider one small, but important, textual amendment."
"The proposed decision is flawed in one respect: it appears to assume that each Member State is represented by just one single national team."
"This is not so, as you well know."
"My own country, for example, is represented by an independent Scotland team, despite the fact that Scotland is, for the time being anyway, not an independent Member State."
"We have a long footballing pedigree and indeed the first international football match ever played was the game between Scotland and England in 1872."
"Scottish supporters - the so-called 'Tartan Army' which is tartan, but not an army - have for quite a few years now had an unparalleled reputation for good behaviour and good humour."
"It is for this reason that I and my EFA colleagues have tabled three amendments to the Council text."
"They will not change the substance but they will give recognition to the distinctive footballing and indeed legal histories of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England."
"Do not speak about the national team, but about national teams."
"I see Mr Deprez accepts the point and I am most grateful to him for that."
"Mr President, the fact that three speakers have taken the floor on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is striking and, in my view, illustrates at least two points."
"Firstly that we, unlike Mrs Schröder, are very much interested in 22 men running in shorts after a ball. And secondly, that our group also wants to seriously address the problems surrounding these matches."
"I too should like to bring one amendment to your attention which has already been touched upon by my fellow MEP, because I hope that you are still prepared to endorse it."
"It concerns the amendment which stipulates that, if data is stored about persons who constitute a danger to public order, these persons should be informed of the fact that their data has been recorded."
"This is a different situation from that in the case of criminals, for example."
"I can imagine that, in the case of criminals, it is not helpful if, while the investigations are still under way, they know that they are being pursued."
"In the case of persons who constitute a danger to public order, however, it has a very preventive effect."
"They know that they are being monitored."
"As a result, anyone who has been wrongly registered can be removed from this register, but it also acts as an effective deterrent, in fact."
"If people know that they are being watched, they will think twice before misbehaving again in this way."
"I hope you will be able to endorse Amendment No 22, nevertheless."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"The next item is a report (A5-0036/2002) by Mr Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision setting up a European network of contact points in respect of persons responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes [11658/2001 - C5-0499/2001 - 2001/0826 (CNS)]."
"Madam President, following on from Mr Deprez's excellent report, it seems to me rather tragic that I have to address this House on matters which frankly, here in the twenty-first century, we should not have to be debating, let alone dealing with: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes."
"Only a few short years ago, I was the UK minister responsible for legislation, setting up the appropriate mechanisms for dealing with war criminals from a past era."
"It is therefore particularly sad that we have a situation where there are still many extremely evil people in the world who behave in a manner which is totally unacceptable to all decent people who believe in democracy and the freedom of individuals, as I do."
"I want to say a word or two about this report, because some people have commented that it is unnecessary to have a system of contact points in Europe to deal with these matters, that there is already plenty of cooperation at police level, for instance, and justice ministry level."
"Sadly, that is not the case."
"Although we had the statute for the International Criminal Court in July 1998, this is ultimately a matter which is still the prime responsibility of national governments and national criminal jurisdictions."
"The cooperation between national governments and national police enforcement authorities, for instance, is absolutely critical in bringing to book some of the rather more unpleasant people who we need to deal with, owing to the international and horrendous nature of their crimes."
"I remember, as minister, speaking to my Polish opposite number, Mr Miller, - who, coincidentally, is now the Polish Prime Minister - about certain war criminals."
"Although Poland is not currently a member of the EU, but hopes to be before too long, it was clear that there was much work which still had to be done in an attempt to produce a more cooperative effect between the different law enforcement authorities."
"One of the possibilities is, as my report suggests, to have contact points which are readily identifiable in the different nation states."
"Indeed, an amendment which we have tabled to the report makes it clear that we believe that we should not leave this as a vague proposition to be determined at some point in the future, but that it should be clearly the case that the contact points should be based in the police or justice departments of the Member States. That is the first point."
"It is also important, as was noted in the previous debate, that we look at the latest methods and make sure that there is a coordination of those methods in bringing about the necessary prosecutions and convictions."
"The issue of data, for instance, is most important."
"There were concerns shown by some people about the privacy of individuals and the rights of defendants that might be effected by a duplication or by a different approach to data matters."
"I am trying, in this report, to bring about consistency."
"I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino would agree that we need to have more consistency in a cooperative effort."
"I do not agree with everything that happens on a European basis, but here we have a situation where there is a clear need for cooperation at a level at which we are consistent in our approach. We also need to have systems in place which can be easily recognised and easily transmitted between the nation states that are concerned."
"Cooperation is the key to success."
"It is the key to success in the areas which Mr Deprez has spoken about."
"It is the key to success in the areas that I am proposing here."
"It is a necessary measure. This report underlines this need and, above all else, it shows the determination of all of us in the different states of Europe to get together to deal with the more unpleasant people who sadly still exist on this globe."
"Madam President, this Dutch initiative is fundamentally to be welcomed."
"An initiative of this kind towards European cooperation in more effective prosecution of crime deserves support, especially when the crimes in question are as detestable as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes."
"I aimed to keep the initiative on exchange of information among the contact points as simple as possible, something which the Germans and the Dutch supported in Council."
"That being so, I would have considered it right to refer, in Article 2(2) to the law on judicial assistance between Member States currently in force and laid down in bilateral and multilateral agreements."
"Whatever the rapporteur may think, such an agreement does indeed exist between all the Member States; it is the one that was adopted by the Council of Europe on 20 April 1959."
"Over and above that, there is a new judicial assistance agreement dated May 2000, which is adapted to more modern circumstances but has not yet been ratified by all the Member States."
"This new judicial assistance agreement would already represent a marked simplification, and would also make the creation of a new procedure superfluous."
"Now, the rapporteur was in agreement with the reference to the existing agreement, but was not willing to support the deletion of the procedure in Articles 3 to 6, which was to be newly introduced."
"As I did not want to risk the committee adopting such a contradictory report, I finally refrained from submitting the amendments I have referred to, but I still have serious misgivings."
"Equally, though, I would like to emphasise that I see the creation of a European network of contact points as extraordinarily important."
"I also hope that the success of this network and of this important initiative will not be impaired by procedural disputes."
"I congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report."
"Madam President, my group very much supports the report by Mr Kirkhope."
"It is very important in that it has not changed the spirit of the Dutch proposal, and we will be voting in favour of it."
"The creation of networks or contact points in each Member State for war crimes is extremely important."
"It is important that there is contact with the police and judicial authorities in order to facilitate cooperation in the Member States in relation to war crimes."
"This is exemplified by current developments in international law, and in particular the success of the UN tribunals on the former Yugoslavia and on Rwanda in tracking down and prosecuting persons who have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide."
"This action is attracting more public interest and support than ever before."
"There are cases where people who have committed crimes against humanity have more or less escaped unpunished - for example the Pinochet case - and there are other cases where a blind eye is turned to war crimes and to major international human rights abuses until the occasion arises when it is politically correct to challenge them."
"We have to challenge these abuses from the very beginning."
"It is important that this report is not aimed at establishing a central coordination department."
"The initiative basically leaves implementation up to the Member States, which must then supply information about the places that have been set up."
"The initiative also highlights one of the important problems, data protection, which can develop with the transfer of data and information."
"We also must never forget that data protection is an extremely important issue and it must not be left out of any of these debates."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission supports the Dutch proposal to create these contact points for crimes of genocide, because we feel that this is a reasonable proposal, which seeks to achieve a structure that is flexible rather than unwieldy."
"This proposal does not affect the existing legal mechanisms for judicial assistance, but represents an important additional measure in that it enables the Member States of the European Union to fulfil their obligations as laid down in the Statute of the International Criminal Court established in Rome by Convention in 1998 and which is ready to enter into force as soon as the necessary number of Member States ratifies it."
"Cooperation in this field between the States of the European Union, on preventing this type of crime, has already been subject to a common position, issued by the Council on 11 June 2001."
"We therefore feel that the initiative by the Netherlands is part of a coherent and consistent approach to these particularly odious crimes on an international scale."
"The Commission agrees with the emphasis placed by the rapporteur, Mr Kirkhope, whom I should like to congratulate on his excellent report, on the need for this type of cooperation mechanism not to affect guarantees for the protection of personal data or to endanger the rights of those on trial to a defence."
"Common rules apply here, primarily the European Convention on Human Rights and the Council of Europe conventions on such matters, and this is another example of issues which, together with those on which Mr Deprez has drawn up a report, we are considering as the legal base for guaranteeing the protection of personal data in the field of judicial cooperation in the European Union."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"The next item is a report (A5-0082/2002) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a framework programme on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union - Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters [COM(2001) 646 - C5-0694/2001 - 2001/0262(CNS)]."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission, in the person of Commissioner António Vitorino, on the excellent initiative that it has presented."
"We often criticise the Commission - and rightly so - but today it is only fair to congratulate it on the initiative that it has presented and which provides a positive response to the recommendations made by the European Parliament when it approved the Kessler report to bring together the five programmes covered by Title VI in a single framework programme."
"As we all know, under the terms of Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union is obliged to pursue the objective of providing its citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by initiating actions in conjunction with the Member States in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters too."
"This was the rationale underlying the creation of the five biannual financing programmes under Title VI that are due to end in December 2002 and that were - and still are - Grotius II, designed for legal practitioners, OISIN II, for Member State law enforcement authorities, STOP II, for those responsible for combating trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, Hippocrates, in the field of crime prevention in general, and Falcone, for those responsible for action to combat organised crime."
"The proposal we are debating here today establishes a single framework programme that is intended to bring together and provide a harmonised legislative and operational framework for all the actions that fall under Title VI of the EU Treaty, reflecting developments in Community programmes in general and the experiences of five years' work on the ground."
"Consequently, we have, in our opinion, managed to ensure that the actions we have supported are more consistent and have an even greater impact, to make possible a more effective use of financial resources, to prevent potential overlaps between the various programmes and to fill in existing gaps."
"Although I consider the approach that the Commission is following to be fundamentally correct, I felt it would be appropriate and sensible to table some amendments with the following objectives:"
"firstly, to make the programme's line of action clearer, and to make the wording more precise, not least because projects submitted are to be evaluated for conformity with the programme's objectives. In these circumstances vague, meaningless terms have to be rejected;"
"secondly, to give our endorsement to the inclusion in the programme of cross-border projects in the field of assistance to victims of crime, in addition to the promotion of police and judicial cooperation."
"We will, in this way, be promoting the effective protection, in the Member States, of the interests of victims in criminal proceedings, specifically through the creation of a network of contact points."
"It might also, for example, prove appropriate to provide for an independent evaluation to be undertaken on the implementation of the framework decision, accompanied by proposals for improvement for every country;"
"thirdly, to acknowledge that it is important and appropriate to involve the applicant countries, but also that it must be made clear that they must participate in both drawing up and implementing the project."
"Merely taking part in the project as what amounts to a 'consumer', cannot be considered to be sufficient;"
"fourthly, to state that the power of initiative to draft proposals cannot be confined only to the public sector of the Member States and of the applicant countries; it must be extended to NGOs, universities and other interested parties;"
"fifthly, with regard to financing, a maximum co-financing of up to 70% has been provided for although, in some cases, it could reach 100%."
"These are specific projects and complementary measures."
"A hundred per cent financing from the Community budget could be justified only in the case of projects which were in the very best interests of the European Union and which could not be carried out with a lower rate of funding."
"However, it should be emphasised, and I am sure that this is also the approach of Commissioner António Vitorino, that the underlying idea is to attempt to finance the greatest number of projects possible with the resources available;"
"my last but one point is that the Commission's proposal is consistent with this Parliament's desire to provide greater support for projects promoting the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, but it is rather difficult to accept a proposal that exceeds the existing financial perspective."
"Hence the proposal that this framework programme should operate in the period 2003 to 2006, following which it must be renewed in accordance with the new financial perspective."
"To conclude, I find it regrettable that the position of the European Parliament does not demonstrate the appropriate degree of prudence."
"I have therefore proposed that Parliament should be given the option of being involved, which will surely give it the opportunity to exercise its responsibility as budgetary authority in the best possible way."
"The construction of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the fundamental objectives of this Parliament, and therefore, its involvement is of the greatest importance."
". (DA) Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs for having incorporated most of the Committee on Budgets' amendments into the report."
"The proposal tabled by the Commission does in fact combine five existing programmes - Grotius II, Oisin II, Stop II, Hippocrates and Falcone - in one, and I think that the proposal is broadly in line with Parliament's wish to secure more aid for projects that can give people in the European Union an EU with greater security."
"Internal security is of course one of the priorities also emphasised by Parliament in the guidelines for the budgetary procedure for 2003 - next year - which were of course adopted at the last sitting here in Strasbourg."
"Part of the thinking behind the way in which the programme has been put together is that, in future, there should be a closer link between police cooperation and judicial cooperation. For the Committee on Budgets, this is, moreover, an aim with the not insignificant effect of making for a better use of financial resources."
"It is gratifying that the candidate countries too are to be given the opportunity to participate in those projects that are financed under the programme, but it must be clear that, as a budgetary authority, Parliament cannot accept a situation in which the financial estimates are exceeded."
"The programme ought, then, to be limited to the period 2003-2006 in its initial phase, and in that way shortened by a year."
"That means, of course, a corresponding reduction in the framework appropriation, and the programme can subsequently be extended."
"Finally, I think that it is important for the budgetary authority to be listened to if it should nonetheless become necessary to increase the appropriations to the programme, for the consequence of increasing the appropriations to this programme must not be reduced appropriations to other programmes also financed under category 3 of the financial estimates."
"Madam President, the Union treaty makes it our duty to create an area of freedom, security and justice for Europe's citizens."
"The Council proposal is an important step in this direction."
"Admittedly, it does nothing more than combine five already-existing programmes, but this combination creates homogeneity and clarity, which is particularly necessary in the difficult area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"The combination of the programmes can now serve to prevent overlapping and close loopholes."
"The creation of a single framework programme will also further improve the uptake of financial resources."
"Only cross-border criminal prosecution and enforcement can combat contemporary criminality, for those who commit crimes are taking extensive advantage of the freedoms of the European Union."
"The EU's citizens will also feel their sense of security reinforced."
"They know that there are no no-go areas for the law in its pursuit of criminals."
"They will be pursued right across the EU, and in like manner."
"It is in this context that the amendment on the publication on the Internet of the results of the investigations and studies cofinanced under this programme is particularly to be welcomed."
"This is a further step towards the greater transparency that we need in order once again to bring the advantages of European cooperation to our citizens' attention."
"Greater protection for victims is especially to be highlighted and much to be welcomed."
"It is the victims who have most to endure, but who are far from receiving the best protection and care."
"It must therefore be ensured that effective protection of victims' interests in criminal proceedings can be guaranteed."
"It is particularly to be welcomed, in view of EU enlargement, that the Council proposal can take into account the candidate countries and involve them in projects."
"What cannot, however, be accepted is the way in which the Council proposal disregards Parliament; in particular, Parliament's sovereignty in budget matters makes it necessary for it at least to be informed concerning the progress of the programme and not to get a report only as late as 2005."
"The rapporteur should therefore be supported in his efforts to bring about an amendment on this point."
"I would like, in conclusion, to congratulate Mr Coelho on his report, in particular on his success in achieving, as was necessary, more precise use of language."
"Madam President, this report is, of course, of little importance in the broad political scheme of things."
"From a financial point of view, we are concerned here with less than one per mille of the EU's annual budget, and the direct political consequences are cause neither for approval nor contradiction."
"What is at issue here is a programme on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union."
"As a lawyer and democrat, I have to say that cooperation and development are always to be welcomed and that they can be useful and increase our awareness, but it is very difficult to take the rhetoric seriously."
"The report's explanatory statement includes the following words: 'If the European citizen is to be offered an area of freedom, security and justice, we have to ensure that criminal investigations, prosecution and the execution of penalties can take place efficiently across borders?."
"It is as if freedom, security and justice had not been invented until these decisions were made, but the fact is of course that by far the greater part of judicial criminal investigation and police work is done nationally and locally."
"What we have here is a rhetorical device that is part of, or to be seen as a stage in, the process towards unified decisions in the fields of policing, the law and criminal investigation."
"Where the funding is concerned, it may be pointed out that EUR 65 million is not to be sneezed at, and it is one more item in the long list of programmes interfering with the EU's administrative procedure."
"I must not dwell any further upon this matter but just point out in conclusion what is so curious about the Commission's statement that these programmes have been assessed."
"In that case, they were assessed in 2000, irrespective of the fact that the majority of the programmes were not adopted until 2001."
"That really is an impressive act of clairvoyance which bodes well for the projects."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Carlos Coelho and by congratulating him on his excellent report. I must emphasise that the aim of this proposal for a framework programme is to rationalise and simplify the implementation of the programmes of police and judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters, thereby complying with the specific request made by the European Parliament in the Kessler report."
"As to the content of this framework programme, this covers all five of the previous programmes and also the implementation of actions linked to the plan to combat drugs, for which the European Parliament had created a specific budget heading, due to end in the course of this year."
"The programme covers all the fields that are and that must be subject to European action, which demonstrates the commitment of the public authorities and of the beneficiaries of the projects, with whom we are in close contact, and also reflects the results of the external evaluation carried out two years ago on, of course, the development of the programmes that preceded the evaluation."
"The Commission is sometimes accused of being a schizophrenic institution, but we have not yet reached the point of assessing things that have not yet been done ?"
"With this in mind, the basic legal provision was voluntarily confined to laying down the broad guidelines, because the Commission felt that the task of defining priorities more precisely must be left up to the annual programmes, year by year, in line with developments in the political situation and the actual requirements of the situation as regards crime."
"From this point of view, the amendments tabled to Article 2, emphasising one specific issue or another, are, I believe, hard to accept."
"The Commission takes the view that in the framework programme, objectives must be defined in general terms, leaving it up to each annual programme to define its priorities."
"Nevertheless, all matters and issues to which amendments have been tabled are, as I understand it, fully covered by the general wording of the Commission proposal and can be included in every annual programme."
"The framework programme also highlights the concept of partnership. This element is crucial, because projects must be developed not only through broad European participation, but also - and from their very inception - in the context of close cooperation between the main players involved in the various countries."
"The amendment tabled by the rapporteur that defines this concept of partnership more clearly is, therefore, totally acceptable to the Commission."
"As Mr Coelho stated, the countries that are candidates for accession can already participate in projects."
"The Commission would like to go further and, in line with European agreements, has developed a system of financial protocols that will enable organisations established in the candidate countries to be equally eligible to submit projects on the same basis and according to the same rules as Member State organisations."
"I therefore welcome the amendment also tabled by the rapporteur on this point, which proposes a wording that I consider to be fortuitous, because it further clarifies the concept of the eligibility of the candidate countries."
"With regard to the remaining amendments, the Commission can accept those that have an effect on the recitals and which enrich the text, or certain explanations, such as, for example, the more explicit reference to the inclusion of universities, NGOs and police academies as eligible organisations."
"In relation to the request to bring forward the interim report to June 2004, the Commission would propose that the date of June 2005 be maintained."
"Instead, we propose that the presentation of the annual report be brought forward to June 2004 so that the European Parliament can be informed as quickly as possible on the first results of the implementation of the programme to have already produced effects that are likely to be assessed."
"Finally, on the duration of the programme, I must admit that, in relation to other existing programmes in the European Union, the argument of 'a legal base providing for its implementation beyond 2006', in other words, beyond the lifespan of the financial perspective, has not been used."
"Bearing in mind, of course, that the financial envelope for the period after 2006 will always be dependent on the financial perspective adopted following 2006, we would, therefore, ask Parliament to ensure that the limitation on the legal base does not stop at 2006 and could cover actions programmed up to the year 2007, with the proviso, naturally, that a given financial appropriation will always be dependent on the new financial perspective."
"Lastly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the European Parliament for the support, the boost and the encouragement that they have given to this important task of rationalising programmes in a particularly sensitive area: the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters at European level."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"report (A5-0080/2002) by Mr Di Lello Finuoli, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law (renewed consultation) [15525/2001 - C5-0022/2002 - 2000/0801(CNS)]"
"report (A5-0099/2002) by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law [COM(2001) 139 - C5-0116/2001 - 2001/0076(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all quite familiar with the history of this framework decision."
"We are being consulted a second time because the framework decision, on which we first expressed our opinion two years ago, has been revised."
"In the meantime, however, the Commission expressed a general reservation about the framework decision, to the effect that environmental protection is covered by a large number of Community acts, most of which make provisions for administrative penalties, and that the issue should therefore be dealt with by means of a first-pillar instrument."
"The Commission insists that, given the environmental degradation in the Union, existing penalties are clearly inadequate."
"The proposal for a directive, which is the subject of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report, must therefore be seen as complementing the draft framework decision."
"According to the Commission, a first-pillar instrument must be adopted which takes precedence over a third-pillar instrument."
"That means that, when an area falls within the Community sphere of responsibility, it is legally impossible for the Union to adopt common rules by means of a third-pillar instrument without encroaching on the Community's powers."
"I would point out that Parliament agrees with the Commission on this point: in the sitting of 15 November 2001, with a procedure without debate, we adopted a recommendation on criminal penalties and Community acts, point 6 of which, to be precise, called upon the Council not to undertake any action concerning criminal law in the field of the environment before the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law had been adopted."
"Now then, these two documents - the framework decision and the directive - complement each other and are designed to be used together, so as to avoid inconsistency with two documents saying different things about the same subject."
"As you will see in the amendments, the framework decision refers precisely to the directive as regards the definitions and penalties, for we are convinced that the directive is the instrument we need, precisely because it is a Community instrument, if we are to protect the environment from destruction."
"I would like to draw your attention to an additional, very important consideration: whereas the directive appears to be based on the approach of preventive protection of the environment, that is protection which takes place before the environment is completely destroyed, the framework decision proposed by the Council would, in actual fact, only impose criminal sanctions once the environment has already suffered destruction or, at any rate, irreparable damage."
"Here, we do not, of course, have enough time available, but in committee we have already outlined this difference of approach quite clearly."
"I therefore stress that we must endorse both the framework decision, which has already been approved in committee, and the directive, for, as they stand, these two documents complement each other."
"If, however, we were to adopt a decision which was inconclusive as regards the basic approach or, worse still, if we were to adopt Amendment No 28 to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report, which completely rejects the Commission's proposal, we would cause the two documents to be totally inconsistent."
"We therefore need to agree on the complementary nature of these two instruments and adopt them both in their current forms."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Environmental Crime Directive will provide a new European legal instrument which is to contribute towards a more effective enforcement of the European environmental laws transposed and implemented in the Member States. The topic is an exciting one."
"Exciting, because the judicial system which is being selected is sound, but also because it will provide much material for the European legal experts in years to come."
"The view that the Member States must have at their disposal the option of criminal sanctions as a way of enforcing European environmental law is unreservedly shared by the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"However, we are divided about the way in which such a system of criminal sanctions for serious environmental offences must be formulated and introduced, and about the question as to who can be involved in the codecision process."
"Along with Mr Di Lello Finuoli of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I side with the European Commission and support an Environmental Crime Directive under the first pillar."
"With what is known as the Danish initiative, the Council has opted for measures under the third pillar."
"The members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are right to reject this decision."
"The thing that unites the Council, Parliament and the Commission is that we all wish to act upon the very explicit request expressed at the European Council of Tampere in October 1999 for common definitions, administration of justice and penalties aimed at a limited number of sectors of special significance, but where explicit reference is made to environmental crime."
"Since the choice of legal basis in the first pillar still elicits questions on the part of the Council, and on the part of some colleagues of my group, as I found out a moment ago, I will make a few enlightening observations which I hope, incidentally, will also convert the cynics."
"I will break these down into a few points."
"Why do we opt for the first pillar, and why do I recommend that the first pillar be chosen?"
"Firstly, with regard to the Danish initiative, the Council refers to Article 31, introductory line and letter e) of the Treaty on European Union whereby the authority for common action on judicial cooperation in criminal matters is given, and whereby e) provides for progressively adopting measures establishing minimum rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the fields of organised crime, terrorism and illicit drug trafficking."
"This clause is included in title VI."
"However, in accordance with Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the provisions of this title apply 'without prejudice to the powers of the European Community?."
"But also in Article 47, it is stated that the Treaty on European Union does not prejudice the Treaties establishing the European Communities."
"In other words, criminal law does not exclusively fall within the remit of the European Union."
"Case law of the European Court of Justice, to which, incidentally, I also make reference in the report, confirms that the Treaty on European Union cannot constitute a barrier."
"Secondly, the question which subsequently arises, now that there are no general barriers to arriving at criminal measures within the scope of the Treaty on European Union, is: what is the EC specifically capable of doing and what is it allowed to do?"
"If we look at Article 280(4) of the Treaty on European Union, which corresponds to Article 5 which enshrines the subsidiarity principle, then I note that in the field of environmental criminal law too, it should be ensured that EC legislation does not prejudice the organisation of the national administration of justice."
"Thirdly, it is therefore crucial that this directive should not be about specific provisions concerning criminal law, but that criminal law is used to make environmental policy effective."
"After all, the application of criminal law is in many areas an important coda for the enforcement of the rules, whereby, taking into consideration this subsidiarity, a certain level of harmonisation of criminal law enforcement can be useful for the implementation of Community provisions as a whole."
"Fourthly, the environmental crime proposal is based on Article 175(1) of the Treaty on European Union, which stipulates that the Council, according to the codecision procedure of Article 251, affects all measures which can help the environmental objective of Article 174, provided that this process is not hindered by subsidiarity."
"Fifthly, the proposal for a directive is based on environmental directives and regulations laid down on the basis of Article 175(1) and merely adds a criminal-law aspect to this legislation."
"The existing line is therefore extended, whereby the directive requires Member States to provide for criminal sanctions for activities which cause substantial damage to the environment."
"I based my assessment of the proposal and the submission of amendments on the aforementioned criteria."
"I did not alter Article 1 of the directive, which aims to lay down minimum standards for punishable offences."
"This enables Member States themselves to determine the punishment."
"In the definitions of Article 2, I also included incitement as an environmental offence, for which, incidentally, I used the Danish initiative as the basis."
"Thirdly, I included in Article 3 punishable offences which are now mentioned in the annex, with two minor changes."
"I unreservedly condemn Amendment No 22, because I am of the view that there is no legal basis for it."
"Fourthly, I have clarified the term 'framework' in Article 4."
"Instead of allowing the Member States to determine the punishment, it is preferable to use the term criminal sanctions."
"I have adapted Amended No 25, because subsidiarity plays a role here too."
"We can only invite the Member States to introduce measures such as confiscation if this element is specifically provided for in the Member States' own legal systems."
"This directive amounts to a fine balancing act."
"We, as the European Parliament, must be very specific, because I assume that the European Court will verify the facts, and we, along with the European Commission, will possibly head in that direction too."
"Finally, I should like to thank my fellow MEPs, not only those from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the rapporteur of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, but also my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and all shadow rapporteurs."
"We have worked in unity and, even if the contribution now appears very technical, it is founded on extensive policy, which is not only important to the Commission, but certainly also to the European Parliament."
"We are serving a worthwhile goal, namely improved environmental protection."
"Mr President, I simply wish to say that at 7.30 p.m. an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs will begin, for an urgent consultation that the Council has requested."
"I have asked for the floor in relation to the two subsequent reports and I believe that the same is true for several members of that committee who are here at the moment."
"I have taken the floor so that our reason for leaving the Chamber may be recorded in the Minutes and to say that, as coordinator of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the committee, I have no choice but to leave, and I hope this demonstrates that we should avoid this type of situation."
"We fully understand your situation and this will be noted in the Minutes."
"Mr President, in thirty years there has been a huge increase in the number of standards relating to the environment, with more than fifty times the number of national agreements, protocols and similar instruments in this area."
"Within the UN we have more than five hundred of these sorts of agreements, and there are more than a hundred directives within the framework of EU Community law."
"In general they are flawed in that they are not sufficiently specific and their implementation has been inexcusably ineffective."
"In the end we need criminal sanctions and for that reason it is now important that we should lend our support to this Commission proposal for a directive."
"It is considerably wider in scope, more coherent and will prove more effective than the Council framework agreement, which suffers from the usual weaknesses in environmental regulation and whose legal basis is furthermore clearly flawed."
"The proposal for a directive, which is based on the EC Treaty and Article 175(1), is the correct instrument in this instance and, pursuant to Article 47 TEU, the Community legal instrument under the first pillar must clearly take precedence, as the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has stated in more detail in its opinion."
"Mr President, the two excellent reports before us are abundant proof of the need for thorough institutional reform integrating the Union's responsibilities in matters of judicial, criminal and police cooperation, which currently fall under the third pillar, into the Community framework."
"This European Parliament has been calling repeatedly for this and I hope the Convention on the future of Europe itself and, therefore, the Intergovernmental Conference on reform of the Treaties, will put forward such a proposal."
"Only thus will it be possible to avoid future counterproductive disputes and institutional conflict, and, most importantly, will we be able to act effectively to protect the citizens of the EU."
"Quite clearly, some of these rights - such as the right to a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment, which is enshrined in Article 37 of the Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, are not being adequately safeguarded by the Member States for lack of effective Community intervention."
"None of the Member States has ratified the 1998 Council of Europe Convention on the protection of the environment through criminal law."
"Even the many Community directives on the environment fail to provide sufficient protection because of failure to apply them and frequent failure to comply with them encouraged by the lack of effective penalties."
"The Commission's proposal for a directive requiring the Member States to introduce penalties therefore deserves our full support with the incorporation of the useful amendments advocated in the Oomen-Ruijten report."
"Although the Commission, Parliament and the Council Legal Service itself have, on several occasions, stressed that the protection of the environment is a fundamental Community objective pursuant to Articles 3 and 6 of the Community Treaty, that the proper legal basis for the protection of the environment through criminal law is Article 175 of the Treaty and that Community law prevails over Union law, the Council is attempting to adopt a framework decision on the same subject that does not just integrate the proposal for a directive but interferes with it, limiting its field of application and scope and making the issue no longer subject to the procedure of codecision with the European Parliament."
"The Di Lello Finuoli report quite rightly states that this framework decision must be consistent with the directive, must wait for it to be promulgated and must refer to it, without repeating points already covered by the directive but, where necessary, incorporating them."
"I hope that Parliament will adopt both reports and I call upon all the Members to reflect on the need to avoid similar damaging disputes in the future and to achieve full communitisation of the third pillar."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party also welcomes this proposal for a Commission directive, in the same way as it welcomed, equally favourably, the draft framework decision by the Council in December 2001."
"The Liberal Group would, of course, like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello as well."
"These two initiatives are a practical response to one of the people's major concerns: 88% of European citizens want the European Union to take practical measures to protect the environment."
"This is one of the findings of a Eurobarometer survey carried out less than a year ago and which my fellow Member Mr Coelho mentioned earlier."
"In response to acts of ecological delinquency, the Liberal Group supports the position defended by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, namely that the Community framework under the first pillar is the most suitable."
"We believe that a directive is the most appropriate tool for establishing a European list of environmental crimes and a common foundation of criminal sanctions."
"As for the more specific content of this proposal, I believe, as most of my colleagues do, that incitement, as well as the act itself to breach European environmental legislation, must be punished."
"Similarly, we should use general terms when referring to breaches of the law, in order to avoid ecological crimes from being swallowed up in a potential legal loophole."
"Having said this, and due to the dispute on the legal basis between Parliament and the Commission, on the one side, and the Council, on the other, I believe it is crucial that we take swift action, that we reassure our citizens by taking repressive measures against these modern-day polluters, because, today, and it seems with regard to the environment in particular, the reason why the law is toothless and benefiting unscrupulous individuals is that it is not being implemented."
"To take an example, most of our Member States have strengthened their criminal weaponry."
"This is a positive step."
"At the same time, it is worrying to note that in the same Member States, criminal cases involving the environment represent only 2% of the total number of all litigation."
"That is why we must use this dissuasive tool at Community level to ensure current regulations are applied, but also so that we are more effective in combating the organised networks which have made pollution their chosen new weapon."
"Mr President, criminal law concerning environmental offences is still a bit of a mockery in the Member States."
"As a result, it cannot possibly be used to fight the deliberate pollution of our environment effectively."
"One of the reasons is that the European directives are not implemented, observed or enforced."
"Experience has taught us that the present sanctions for infringements of European and national environmental legislation are inadequate, to put it mildly."
"It appears that criminal sanctions are the only instrument that can act as sufficient deterrents in order to ensure that environmental legislation is observed."
"European environmental legislation is there for a good reason, since we are facing cross-border effects in the case of, for example, air and water pollution."
"In addition, the transportation of waste to locations where waste is not processed in an environmentally responsible manner has many negative implications."
"The internal market could also be distorted as a result."
"For these reasons, I am endorsing an international approach to environmental crime."
"I take the view that the present directive is a suitable and effective instrument in order to achieve this."
"This is convincingly supported in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report."
"The question remains whether we need a framework Council decision for this."
"Finally, I shall be voting in favour of the directive, but I am tempted to vote against the draft framework decision, unless Commissioner Vitorino can convince me that the framework decision is absolutely vital for the entry into force of the directive."
"Mr President, the Commission is today proposing a directive which requires the Member States to provide for criminal sanctions to punish a number of particularly serious breaches of Community environmental law."
"No one is denying that we must improve our protection of an environment which is suffering increasing degradation and that we must use severe preventive measures."
"The problem, in our view, however, is the Commission's intention to use the Community instrument - namely, the directive - based, in this case, on Article 175(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community - to do this."
"This Article provides for several joint actions to protect the environment, but it fully respects, in accordance with the general spirit of the Treaties, the autonomy of the Member States in the area of criminal law."
"The claim that the right to provide for criminal penalties is implicit in the Community responsibility for environmental protection on the grounds that it is an essential part of its implementation and cannot therefore be separated from it is utterly unfounded."
"If criminal penalties are implicitly provided for in Article 175(1), why are they not also implicitly provided for in all the other articles of the Treaty which allow Community law to be drafted in a number of areas?"
"We will eventually reach a situation where we are disregarding a fundamental principle of the Treaty, namely national competence in the area of criminal law."
"And if we disregard this principle, we will edge slightly further towards the concept of a centralised Union which is not what we want."
"This does not mean that we must take no action at all - quite the opposite, in fact!"
"The Danish Presidency presented a draft framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law, which proposed enforcing stricter penalties whilst also respecting the freedom of the Member States to establish their legal basis on the third pillar, which is on the purely intergovernmental part of the Treaty."
"This option is much more suitable and this is the option, Mr President, that we should choose."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why are the proposals now put before us so important?"
"Some Member States have indeed so far neglected to adequately back up Community regulations on environmental protection with the threat of sanctions."
"It was thus that the number of violations in the environmental field identified by the Commission rose from 612 in 1999 to 755 in 2000."
"As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to add that such cases are increasingly brought to light as a result of petitions being submitted."
"It is our EU's citizens themselves who have developed a feel for environmental concerns and who increasingly report such offences or who turn to us in search of help for frequent lack of protection on the part of their Member State."
"It would, then, be great if governments could demonstrate something like the same degree of environmental awareness as do their citizens."
"In 2000, the Commission took Member States to the European Court of Justice in connection with 39 cases, and so it is time for us to respond on an EU-wide basis."
"In doing so, it is not our intention to annul national criminal law - the directive applies only to activities in defence of Community environment law and the regulations by means of which the Member States have hitherto transposed it."
"We are laying down only minimum requirements for the protection of the environment through criminal law, so that the retention or creation of stricter safeguards is left to the Member States."
"What this directive combats above all is environmental pollution that is attributable to private individuals or corporate bodies, in which respect inducement must incur a penalty in the same way as active behaviour and failure to act where there is a legal duty to do so."
"Environmental offences still appear to be regarded as excusable peccadilloes in some Member States."
"That must come to an end."
"The directive, like the framework decision, is necessary, appropriate, and proportionate to that purpose."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are numerous European directives and regulations that aim to protect the very many diverse aspects of the environment."
"We all know, however, that a number of these texts are 'dead letters' due to a lack of effective penalties."
"The general public believes that, most of the time, the use of the polluter pays principle to impose financial or material sanctions is insufficient and it is all too aware that these penalties are a poor deterrent given the enormous profits which can be made from the activities that cause the greatest amount of pollution."
"We also know that some environmental damage is completely irreversible and cannot be made good."
"These considerations therefore justify the adoption by the Member States of provisions to penalise non-observance of European environmental requirements through criminal law."
"That is why - together with my fellow European Socialists - I am fully supporting the Commission's initiative."
"However, we must not underestimate the main difficulty that we must face here, in other words, the problem of the legal basis."
"For my part, I support the point of view that this matter falls squarely within the Union's areas of competence under the first pillar and therefore requires the adoption of a framework directive endorsed by the House."
"This is also the meaning of the recommendation adopted by Parliament in November 2001."
"It is worth reminding the Council that, had it finalised its draft framework decision under the third pillar, this would have certainly have been against the political will of the European Parliament."
"Furthermore - and because we are committed to strengthening environmental legislation by applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions - we must adopt a sound text, which is above all legal argument and which is unlikely to be condemned by the Court of Justice."
"This means that we must pay particular attention to the subsidiarity principle and the rules on competence that are laid down by the Treaty."
"Although the Community has the power to require the Member States to adopt criminal sanctions if substantial Community standards are breached, it does not, however, have the power to define the types and levels of sanctions to be applied."
"That is why we must show particular care when referring to concepts such as extradition, which specify how serious the offences and sentences are."
"I am, however, reassured by the wording which was adopted more recently by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"By the same token, the Community has no competence to adopt provisions whose efect is to approximate national criminal provisions."
"Therefore, to mention the concept of incitement - which does not exist in all the Member States' legislation - is to seek to bring the national provisions closer together, which, in my view, considerably weakens the legal validity of this text."
"Aside from these comments, I would like to reiterate my full support for the adoption of this text and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"We believe that this text sends out a strong political signal in respect of a crime that our fellow citizens regard in an increasingly poor light."
"Mr President, following the events of 11 September there was a real international will to streamline and improve systems of extradition in connection with terrorist crime."
"Whilst it is true that terrorism may have an environmental impact, for example the release of pathogens or the deliberate poisoning of water, this report goes much further than terrorism."
"I agree with Mr Berthu that we must resist attempts to extend the EU's sphere of influence into the judicial area, environmental or otherwise."
"I am particularly worried about the amendments which talk about extradition or about the surrender or confiscation of profits as first pillar powers."
"The advice of Parliament's legal services is that there is no legal base under Article 175 for this measure."
"Why do we pay these lawyers to give us advice and then ignore it?"
"I am keen to see Member States cooperating to adopt measures under the third pillar to combat environmental crime, for example in common definitions of criminal offences; but the British Conservatives will vote for rejection of this report as amended because it has no legal base."
"It talks a lot about subsidiarity in the recitals, but the articles themselves fly in the face of the principle of subsidiarity."
"The European Union would be better advised to divert its energies to an area where it does have legal powers to bring errant Member States before the European Court of Justice for non-compliance with existing directives, as Mr von Boetticher suggested earlier."
"Mr President, if the Community wants to take seriously the task of protecting the environment, it cannot and must not limit itself to the mere enactment of protection standards."
"It must also make it its business to see that the relevant regulations are complied with."
"If the machinery of mere sanctions is not sufficient, it must be possible to bring the big stick of the criminal law to bear - only, of course, in important and exceptional cases and with due regard for the division of secondary responsibilities, both in matters of environmental protection and - indeed, above all - in matters of criminal law."
"Thus far, almost all the groups in this House approve this Commission proposal and the amendments to it by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which we can warmly thank the House's rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"Some of us fear that this proposal opens the door too wide, paving the way for uniform European law on the environment and perhaps eventually even for a European environmental agency with powers comparable to those of the FBI."
"Such concerns are groundless."
"None of these things is envisaged."
"The right tool has been chosen - a directive to be transposed by the Member States - and an array of amendments ensures that it does not trespass upon the core area of the competence of the State and of the civil and criminal courts."
"These are virtually the words used by Amendment No 30, which makes explicit reference to extradition, for example, being envisaged only where there is provision for it in the Member State's own legislation."
"By this modus operandi, we are using the right instruments in pursuit of an important Community objective."
"The proposals made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy should therefore be approved."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello Finuoli for their excellent work on two texts that cover the same subject: the proposal for a directive and a draft framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law."
"Both reports contribute significantly to an important European-Union-level debate."
"The extraordinary European Council meeting in Tampere in 1999 agreed in that common definitions, common incriminations and common sanctions should be established in a limited number of sectors of particular importance, and among those sectors it highlighted the environmental crime issue."
"As the House will recall - and several Members referred to it - in 2000, Denmark presented an initiative for a framework decision on combating serious environmental crime."
"This framework decision is based on the rules of the Treaty on European Union and therefore belongs to the third pillar."
"In 2001 the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on the same subject, which is based on Article 175 of the European Community Treaty."
"Both proposals pursue the same objective. They seek to improve the implementation of Community environmental law and have the same starting point: we all recognise that there is a lack of effectiveness in the protection of the environment in our Member States."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has taken a more ambitious approach by proposing a directive. The Commission has pursued this line for a number of reasons."
"The Community has, within given competence parameters, the power to regulate behaviours in order to achieve a Community objective."
"The Commission has never contested that, as regards concrete criminal sanctions, the Community cannot purport to act in the criminal area in isolation."
"However, to the extent that this is necessary for the achievement of Community objectives, the Commission is convinced that the Community can oblige Member States to provide for criminal sanctions where criminal law guarantees that Community law is enforced effectively."
"The Commission believes that the sanctions currently established by Member States are not enough and that they do not guarantee full compliance with European Union law."
"The Commission is not seeking an interinstitutional conflict."
"The key aim of our proposal is to create an additional guarantee of impartiality and to give authorities greater scope for cross-border investigations of environmental crimes."
"Mr Blokland, this is the reason why it is necessary to have a framework decision together with the directive."
"We can provide for the provision of criminal sanctions in the directive, but the concrete scope of those criminal sanctions must be included in the framework decision."
"The framework decision has the leverage to allow the judicial authorities of the Member States to pursue cross-border investigations on environmental crimes."
"Whether measures concerning criminal law should be based on the rules of the European Union Treaty or of the European Community Treaty, is not just an interesting legal question for European lawyers, it is of fundamental institutional importance, in particular as regards the role and powers of the European Parliament, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice and the legal effects of European legislation in this area."
"I can fully subscribe to the arguments that have been put forward by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"I would like to inform you that the Commission has never called into question the fact that matters of judicial cooperation belong to the third pillar."
"The draft framework decision is therefore to be seen as a complementary text to the directive."
"All the amendments tabled seek to transform the draft framework decision into a complementary instrument to the Commission proposal for a directive."
"All the fundamental aspects of the issue are covered by the Commission proposal for a directive."
"The Council framework decision will deal with three relevant matters: liability of legal persons, jurisdictional competence and issues concerning extradition and prosecution."
"We respect subsidiarity because the framework decision put forward by Denmark very closely follows the Council of Europe Convention concerning environmental crime."
"To date, nobody has accused the Council of Europe Convention of being against the principle of subsidiarity."
"The reports by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Di Lello Finuoli follow exactly this same line."
"On behalf of the Commission, I therefore welcome the opinion on the draft framework decision by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"As far as the specific amendments to the proposal for a directive are concerned, I am glad to inform you that the Commission can accept all the amendments suggested with the following exceptions: Amendments Nos 8 and 9, 10, 11 and 13, 19, 20 and 27, 21, 24, 25, 28 and 29."
"Overall, I am very grateful for Parliament's significant contribution to improving both texts on which the House is going to vote."
"I would like to thank again the rapporteurs, as well as Mr Wuori, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, for their valuable input and support, especially as they all had to work within very tight time limits on a very complex matter."
"I hope that the reports will receive across-the-board support tomorrow from this House."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
". (NL) I should like to ask the Commissioner a question."
"I gather from the committee meetings that it actually would be possible for the European Commission to accept all the adopted amendments."
"I should like to find out from the European Commission tomorrow morning why it does not in fact adopt certain elements."
"This marks a slight departure from the usual procedure, but since the question is interesting and if the Commissioner would like to give an answer, I shall give him the floor."
"Mr President, I could specifically mention each of the amendments that the Commission cannot accept, but if the honourable Member agrees, I will give her in writing the reasons why we cannot accept the list of amendments I have just read out."
"There is at least one amendment for which this is easy to understand: Amendment No 28."
"It rejects the Commission's proposal in its entirety."
"This is one which, I am sure, the Commission will never accept!"
"There is your answer."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"report (A5-0085/2002) by Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision adopting an action programme for administrative cooperation in the fields of external borders, visas, asylum and immigration (ARGO) [COM(2001) 567 - C5-0553/2001 - 2001/0230(CNS)]"
"report (A5-0078/2002) by Mr von Boetticher, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative by the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Spain and the French Republic with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Decision amending Article 40(1) and (7) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at the common borders [11896/2001 - C5-0563/2001 - 2001/0820(CNS)]."
"Mr President, the topic of the ARGO proposal is a very interesting one."
"However, it struck me during the reading of the Commission proposal that the draftsmen had already covered themselves quite well against any kind of resistance that might be expected from the Council."
"In other words, it is my feeling that, in transferring tasks from the third pillar to the first pillar, too many concessions are already being made to technical devices - or even gimmicks - designed to organise things in such a way that the Council bureaucracies still remain in command, while the powers of the European Parliament and the European Commission remain a mere formality."
"This is a hesitant attitude which, in my view, befits a Council Secretariat more than a federal government in the making."
"The Commission is the guardian of the treaties and of European values and, in my opinion, it should fulfil this task in an assertive manner."
"I, with the help of the Parliamentary committee, have tried to strengthen the Community dimension of the proposal on a variety of scores."
"We therefore want to give the Commission a boost, especially where the Commission's right of initiative is concerned."
"The implementation of ARGO cannot only be a task of national government offices."
"It is, for example, very odd that in the case of the enormously successful Odysseus, NGOs etc were able to contribute, but not in the case of its successor, ARGO."
"This is why I value the reinforcement of the Commission's right of initiative."
"This must be emphatically underscored for, via the Commission, others too can share in the success of ARGO."
"In addition, ARGO cannot simply be a case of collaboration by national bureaucracies."
"It requires Community guidance, so that the intentions of the directives can be monitored as objectively as possible."
"Once again, the Commission is the guardian of the treaties and of everything it has presented in directives."
"I was also somewhat annoyed at the way in which both implementation and control are being relinquished, particularly under the pretext of transparency."
"In my view, transparency hardly ever has anything to do with clubs of officials, but always with representatives of the people."
"Using the word in another way undermines it completely. That is something we must avoid at all costs."
"So, on the basis of transparency, we cannot justify monitoring of the procedure by clubs from the national bureaucracies, while the national parliaments and the European Parliament remain outside."
"I would make particular reference to Article 3, point e)."
"According to normal parliamentary and rule-of-law principles, the key points of the policy should be indicated and drafted by the executive power, the Commission, and should be approved and monitored by the representative of the people, the European Parliament."
"After all, we also have powers in the field of the budget."
"The implementation details can then be given shape by means of national recommendations, as suggested in the proposal."
"Moreover, a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities is needed to establish who monitors what."
"In my view, the Commission and the European Parliament should be responsible for the Community aspects, while the national authorities and parliaments should take care of national aspects."
"Finally, I should like to say something about the EU's external borders which will very shortly be moved to coincide with the external borders of the underprivileged candidate countries."
"In my opinion, ARGO should actually think ahead and should do the groundwork for bringing about communitisation, or common responsibility for the external borders, and preferably on time, for these countries will be joining in only a few years' time."
"I have also seen an amendment with which we struggle. This is the amendment from liberal quarters, which concerns people who are persecuted, but not by government bodies."
"In most cases, we only talk about those who are persecuted by their own governments for their political beliefs."
"I think that this, in general, is only fair."
"If people are persecuted in their own countries by non-government bodies and they can still live safely elsewhere in the country, then they need not necessarily be brought to Amsterdam."
"They can simply stay in Turkey or Russia."
"In addition, we would always argue in favour of regional reception. Accordingly, I do not endorse the amendment tabled by Baroness Ludford which favours reception in the European Union, via asylum legislation, of those who could also be sheltered elsewhere in their own countries, and we set great store by making this clear."
"Finally, the European Parliament is asking the European Commission to adopt an assertive stance, and I hope that the latter will interpret this as a shot in the arm."
"Should the Council refuse, there is still time to broadcast the fact at home."
"rapporteur. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dismantling of our internal borders and the police cooperation associated with it, as well as the securing of our external border, will be among the greatest challenges to face the European Union in the new century."
"Mr Oostlander, in his report, has earned our gratitude by referring in his report to the need for a common immigration policy on the external borders."
"My report, though, covers the future development of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement in the area of cross-border surveillance."
"Where the internal borders have already been dismantled, the national police are able, after consultation with the police of a neighbouring state, to observe suspects who are active on both sides of the border."
"Together with hot pursuit, the instrument of cross-border surveillance has thus to date, offered the most effective option in enforcing the law across borders."
"It was only last week that it became clear in Germany just how necessary such an arrangement is, when hostages were taken following a bank robbery and the culprits fled over the border into Poland and then into the Ukraine."
"Although there was good cooperation in this instance, an arrangement such as the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement would certainly have made enforcement even easier."
"The Council proposal is intended to extend the range of offences liable to cross-border surveillance by adding to them organised fraud, offences in connection with the trafficking in human beings, the laundering of proceeds from organised crime and dealing in radioactive materials."
"The question remains in my mind as to why we do not also fall back on the catalogue of terrorist offences that we adopted only a few months ago, which I see as having been a very important decision, and one that we should incorporate into this proposal."
"I therefore felt that Mr Buijtenweg's proposal, and the proposals made by other Members, had something positive to add."
"We otherwise find ourselves increasingly lost in a thicket of innumerable and different regulations on judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"We will in the future have to work at standard penal frameworks significantly more than we have done in the past."
"At the same time, the fact is overlooked that the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement has to date suffered not only from a narrow scope of application, but also from bureaucratic obstacles."
"I have therefore proposed a number of systematic clarifications, which met with wide-ranging support in the committee."
"We should, then, have the courage to achieve real new developments and move forward with the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement."
"The number of times that cross-border surveillance has been used has tripled in the time since it was introduced."
"The most frequent obstacle, according to the officers engaged in its implementation, is often the lack of a right of arrest."
"Officers carrying out surveillance duties on foreign territory have hitherto had to watch impotently as crimes were committed."
"They are not permitted to intervene, but can only inform their colleagues with jurisdiction in that state, who tend themselves to be stretched to their full capacity already."
"By the time they, in their turn, intervene, the culprits are, as a rule, over the hills and far away."
"I therefore propose that it should also be possible for foreign police officers engaged in cross-border surveillance work to detain culprits until police officers of that state arrive, if, firstly, an extraditable offence has been committed and, secondly, if that State's own police are no longer in a position to prevent the offence being committed."
"It is no doubt impossible to get our European citizens to understand why foreign police officers may observe, but are unable to intervene when the situation becomes critical and a crime is being committed."
"In this respect, we should be significantly better at adapting our laws to the realities of this Europe of ours, which is growing together."
"The Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, however, continues to develop, it is my firm conviction that there is a need in a Europe that is growing together, for the European Union to have real police competences."
"Within the framework of the Convention, which, as is well known, is looking to reshape the Treaties, we will not only be able to discuss what competences we might have to relocate in the Member States, but we must also specify the areas in which we additionally need primary competences at a European level."
"The combating of organised crime, and across borders at that, is one such area, one where we as a Parliament must emphatically make the point that, in order to facilitate control by Parliament and by the public prosecutors, we need a primary police executive for a limited sphere of activity."
"Mr President, I believe that the administrative cooperation programmes within the immigration policies and connected areas are of great importance."
"Today we are debating the ARGO programme, the ultimate aim of which is to provide a guarantee of homogenous treatment for third-country nationals."
"I would like to point out that, in the fields fully or partially covered by this programme, there are very many directives, regulations and other instruments in force, and that this Community acquis must be applied consistently, guaranteeing equal rights to third-country nationals."
"There are some extremely important aspects which the programme should take into account: it is essential that we implement actions to prevent illegal immigration, actions against the counterfeiting of documents and essential actions in the field of consular cooperation."
"The objective of establishing a common policy in this area is a great challenge and its success largely depends on the Union becoming an area of security and freedom."
"In a few years, my country has gone from a country of emigration to a country receiving a large number of immigrants and at the same time is experiencing problems resulting from its status as an external border of the Union."
"Although it is not an innovation - since it continues the previous Odysseus programme, with certain new approaches - the ARGO programme is a key element."
"An increase in appropriations is a sign that we are taking a serious approach to the effort we must make to ensure that the national administrations act homogeneously, applying best practices."
"I agree with the approach of the rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, and I congratulate him, because his report contains proposals which improve the text and make it very clear that the Commission and Parliament must play a leading role in the implementation of the programme."
"Mr President, much has been achieved in this field under Commissioner Vitorino, but there is still a very long way to go."
"It is therefore right and proper that the objectives of the current Presidency include making progress with the Tampere and Laeken commitments on asylum, immigration and border control policies."
"This requirement does not only stem from the present reality of immigration in the Union, but also from the citizens' desire for a genuine political Union."
"Mr President, I greatly welcome the ARGO action programme."
"It is my firm conviction that it is only through greater cooperation between the authorities of individual States that the existing discrepancies in the application of Community regulations can be removed."
"Proof that the inequality of treatment in the Member States has to be done away with is provided above all by the great number of petitions addressed to Parliament."
"In recent years there have been 468 petitions alone on the subject of inequality of treatment in this area."
"It really is time to do more about this issue."
"Another improvement in comparison with the present Odysseus programme is the explicit inclusion of the visa issue, another area that has seen the submission of numerous petitions."
"The electronic exchange of data is of particular importance to cooperation across Europe, and I call for the creation of a common database for the whole of Europe, a database that must be accessible to the competent authorities in the Member States - if need be, to third countries as well - and also to the competent agencies of the European institutions."
"In this context, the protection of privacy and the confidentiality of information must be safeguarded unconditionally and to the fullest extent."
"Alongside that, we must ensure that the authorities in the individual States provide information within an appropriate period of time when asked to do so by the Committee on Petitions."
"This obligation is the sole protection for the petitioner's legitimate expectations."
"Delays in passing on information, which have occurred up to now, cause petitioners unacceptable detriment, something which can, in my view, be prevented only by the Committee on Petitions being enabled, in cases of urgency, to bring negative conduct by the authorities to the public's notice."
"Bad publicity is no doubt something that every public body wants to avoid."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what these reports and this action programme show is that the EU is on the right road, the road towards being a union of security, and is demonstrating that security begins at the border."
"If we want our internal borders to be open, our external borders need surveillance systems that work, and we also need compensatory elements along the lines of cross-border surveillance."
"That is underlined here with broad strokes of the pen."
"It is for this purpose that we need the new ARGO action programme."
"This is not only because the money from Odysseus has been used up. It is also because it must be our objective to build up and create an equal level of security on all our external borders, including those we will have in the future, in order, on the one hand, to safeguard ourselves against illegal immigration, organisations that traffic in human beings, and international organised crime, and on the other, to have available to us opportunities for monitoring, assistance and legal immigration and also for preparation for the grant of asylum."
"It seems to me particularly significant that such measures as the establishment of unitary standards for the use of information technology are highlighted, or that emphasis is laid on the fact that, at the end of the day, we are endeavouring to create common core training, that is, to achieve a common standard of training and qualifications."
"We should also be trying to tackle our future need for border security operations composed of experts from several Member States."
"I consider it significant that - as formerly with Odysseus - the possibility is envisaged of the candidate countries also being able to participate in the programme, whereby we are guaranteeing that they will be optimally prepared for greater security in the greater European Union that we share."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to concentrate on the ARGO programme and begin by thanking Mr Oostlander for a good report."
"At the committee reading, a number of proposals went through which further strengthened the programme's common dimension."
"Mr President, it cannot be emphasised enough how important it is for the EU to acquire a common approach when it comes to asylum issues."
"It is important, then, for the administrative routines to operate similarly everywhere."
"Those who try to come to Europe must be treated respectfully, humanely and equally."
"They must not be shunted like mere objects between the various Member States, as unfortunately often happens at present."
"Events in recent years indicate very clearly the need for common programmes and common funding within the sphere of asylum."
"Just as other MEPs have stated, there is a need for education, the exchange of experiences and the development of common practice."
"The candidate countries, which will form the EU's new external borders, are also important in this context, of course."
"Unfortunately - and this, I think, is something that deserves to be pointed out - the EU's refugee and asylum policy has in recent years been characterised mostly by directly opposite tendencies."
"The Member States have often acted short-sightedly and without proper consideration, with catastrophic human suffering as a consequence."
"Sometimes, the thought arises as to whether certain Member States have competed in setting aside humanitarianism and the rule of law."
"As Mr Oostlander pointed out, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled an amendment concerning a further definition of what precisely constitutes a refugee under the Geneva Convention."
"The latter certainly constitutes the mainstay of asylum and refugee policy, but it makes sense to adapt one's practice to changes in the real state of affairs."
"As Mr Evans pointed out, experience in recent years has shown that this is so."
"Refugees must be able to seek protection both from the State and from persecution in their own countries, and a further definition is therefore needed."
"We therefore propose such a definition, and we hope that this House can also accept our proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ARGO programme is supposed to ensure that the EU's external borders continue to be secure against intruders."
"The model for this fortification of the EU's borders is Germany's system of bulkheads on its border with Poland."
"This strategy comprises well-trained police officers, high-tech apparatus, the efficient cooperation of the various authorities, and, to an increasing extent, the involvement of private security companies and informers among the population. I know you will think that crazy, but I will tell you what I think of it in a moment."
"The ARGO programme is meant to ensure the establishment of the same level of fortification on the EU's new eastern border prior to removal of controls on the newly-created internal borders in accordance with the Schengen Agreement."
"It is no secret that apologists for a European policy of repression see this as the nucleus of a European border police force."
"The action programme aims at the creation of effective bulwarks against the migration into the EU of unwanted refugees, who can scarcely find a way in without the help of smugglers."
"Greater sealing-off will - as is intended - lead to higher prices being charged in the market for this sort of assistance and make it more hazardous."
"All the stances taken up in favour of refugees but against people-traffickers are, at best hypocritical and at worst help to close off borders with fatal results."
"The planned amendments to the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement are also in line with the ARGO programme's objectives."
"The re-armament of the police on the external borders is accompanied by ever more competences for the police in the interior."
"Where, as in this case, it is cooperation by the repressive authorities that is at issue, it is interesting that the role played by borders is relegated to the background."
"In principle, the planned amendment of the Schengen Agreement envisages nothing other than to hand over more powers to foreign police officers in cases involving cross-border surveillance."
"In future, it will not only be suspects that will be under observation, but also their friends."
"The initiative is therefore pursuing the European government's objective of making a priority of the implementation of repressive security measures rather than the guaranteeing and securing of human rights and freedoms."
"Mr von Boetticher and the Commission thus furnish a further example of the folly of believing that security can be created by more repressive police action."
"Both initiatives thus contribute to a development that directly leads from a neoliberal state characterised by competition to a police state bearing the stamp of authoritarianism and an obsession with security."
"They represent a further step on that road - the road that leads towards a European panopticon."
"Mr President, a few comments on the Oostlander report."
"I too would like to thank the rapporteur, but I feel I have to express a few comments on the subject of the right to asylum, a humanitarian principle that no civilised person could fail to support but whose bounds must be very clearly set if we are to avoid the severe, real danger of it being used for the totally unacceptable purpose of facilitating the entry of illegal immigrants into European Union territory."
"The document before us states that it aims to avoid asylum applicants being moved between States within the Union, but we harbour some doubts as to whether this can be achieved with minimal standards such as those contained in the proposal, considering, not least, the right accorded to the States to provide greater assistance for asylum applicants."
"In this regard, I would like to point out two of the proposal's shortcomings."
"Firstly, recourse to the judicial authority is provided for in many cases for the concession or refusal of subsidies, housing, healthcare etc., and this means making an infinite number of people dependent on state welfare and binding the host State by law to providing facilities which, in many cases, it does not even provide for its own citizens."
"Secondly, application of the principle of the free movement of the applicant and their family will then clearly lead to asylum applicants having less chance of being granted asylum and being more likely to attempt to cover their tracks, with the number of untraceable illegal immigrants increasing as a result."
"These are serious, practical problems."
"In effect, many rules treat the situation of the applicant as if this status had already been ascertained, for example by regulating access to longer-term activities such as professional training."
"To sum up, the effect of the document needs to be modified so that it does not become a hindrance instead of being a directive providing practical, effective protection of people who have the right to asylum."
"This is what we fear, that it might become an obstacle to preventing illegal immigration, which is a serious, disturbing phenomenon."
"Mr President, the proposal for the ARGO action programme falls short on crucial points."
"It is, though, to be welcomed that the proposal for Odysseus' successor programme allocates funds, among other things, to improving the training of officials, but what use is a programme of training, exchange and cooperation if no change is made to the overall conditions that have prevailed to date?"
"The situation cannot go on in which asylum seekers are turned back at the EU's external borders by the relevant border authorities, as they have been hitherto."
"The situation cannot go on in which they run the risk of going down a chain of deportation and ending up back in the country where they were persecuted."
"As the Commission proposal for a Council Directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States envisaged, their applications for asylum must be examined by an independent authority in the Member State in question."
"Asylum seekers must be able to have recourse to the law when administrative decisions go against them."
"That is the least that we can expect of a state founded on the rule of laws such as our own."
"Let us not forget that border officials can be as well-trained as you like, but all that good training is of no use if they are entrusted with tasks that cannot but overwhelm them, such as deciding on the welfare or otherwise of asylum seekers."
"Mr President, cross-border surveillance is a strictly regulated procedure, which enables the police officers of one Member State who are keeping a suspect under surveillance, to continue their work, if necessary, by crossing a border into another Member State, having made a request to the latter for assistance."
"The draft decision before us today on the proposal by Belgium, Spain and France improves this procedure, notably by adding to the list of offences which justify its use."
"The responsible committee of the European Parliament is also proposing to add terrorism to this list, which seems wise."
"We are, however, somewhat perplexed by the parliamentary report."
"By tabling other proposals for amendments such as that seeking to extend the right of surveillance to some private locations or to allow police officers, in some cases, to bypass surveillance and arrest suspects, the committee responsible appears to be giving the impression that it wants to transform cross-border surveillance into the beginnings of a right to multilateral intervention within the framework of a Union that has no internal borders."
"This kind of move must obviously be rejected, Mr President, as it would, in time, cause confusion as regards responsibilities and the disadvantages would be far greater than any anticipated benefits."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Oostlander and Mr von Boetticher, for their excellent reports."
"The first proposal before us today is a proposal for a financing programme that aims to promote cooperation between the national administrations responsible for implementing Community rules under Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty."
"The ARGO programme will supplement the legislative initiatives that have already been launched or are due to be launched on the basis of Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty."
"I agree with Mrs Kaufmann in recognising that the programme must be examined along with the legislation, and I hope that we will be able to agree on legislation."
"However, we must also acknowledge that in areas such as these, European legislation and its transposal into national law are not enough to harmonise practices."
"A very important area is the practices that the national administrations follow when they are monitoring the external borders, issuing visas or examining asylum applications and immigration issues."
"As several of you pointed out, the ARGO programme will replace the Odysseus programme."
"However, there are considerable differences between the two that need to be very clearly defined."
"First of all, ARGO is a programme for administrative cooperation."
"That is why it focuses in greatest detail on the national administrations and the services responsible for implementing Community legislation based on Articles 62 and 63 of the Treaty."
"It is wrong to claim that these are simply programmes for cooperation between police forces because, in the area of asylum and immigration, there are extremely important tasks which fall to the civilian administration services of the Member States."
"In this case - and I must stress this, as it may be an issue on which Mr Oostlander and myself do not agree - the national administrations are the key players in this programme."
"Indeed, when we have reached agreement on legislation, the national administrations of the Member States will have primary responsibility for applying the European legislation."
"However, this programme does not rule out the national administrations which receive ARGO funding being able to delegate responsibilities for implementing the programmes in question to non-governmental organisations which propose implementing projects and programmes on the basis of the programme's objectives."
"The legal basis of ARGO not only establishes general objectives, it also defines more precise objectives in each of the following areas: external borders, visas, asylum and emigration."
"ARGO envisages new forms of action such as the definition of better practices, techniques for collating, analysing and disseminating information and actions in third countries."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, as regards the monitoring of external borders, the Schengen acquis was split, within the framework of the European Union, with important aspects coming under the first pillar and also important aspects coming under the third pillar."
"Hence the difficulty in correctly distinguishing between the Community aspect and the intergovernmental cooperation aspect, a distinction that is necessary if we are to target them properly."
"In any case, I would like to thank Mr Oostlander for the support he has given to the Commission's proposal and to assure him that we can support, in spirit, many of the amendments that have been proposed, particularly those that seek to strengthen the role of the Community and those seeking to supplement or to strengthen the administrative cooperation objectives."
"Our priority is to ensure that the Council adopts the programme as soon as possible, so that the Commission can, this year even, launch the procedures necessary for the implementation of the programme and the proper implementation of the budget allocated for this year."
"With regard to the second proposal, which relates to the amendment to Article 40 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, an amendment proposed by Belgium, Spain and France, its objective, as Mr von Boetticher points out, is to grant, under certain conditions, the police force of the Member States the right to continue to keep under discreet surveillance a person suspected of being involved in an extraditable offence if that suspect crosses a border."
"I hope that this stresses the improvement - which I believe is significant and practical - that this amendment represents for the work of the law enforcement services."
"As the rapporteur has noted, cross-border observation is an instrument to maintain public order and safety which, with the removal of common borders between Schengen countries, will become extremely important."
"I would also like to stress that, whilst the proposed change will facilitate enquiries, it will not change the legal framework applying to them, since the national authorities will, of course, only be able to act within their own national legislation, as well as that provided for by the Schengen Convention."
"I am sorry, but we have a long way to go before we become a totalitarian State."
"To sum up, the two initiatives and proposals before us and on which considerable work has been done by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs should enable a great deal of progress to be made in areas which I believe are crucial for the area of freedom, security and justice which is gradually taking shape."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0081/2002) by Luís Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (COM(2001) 447 - C5-0403/2001 - 2001/0182(CNS))."
"Mr President, when someone knocks on Europe's door, fleeing violence, war or civil war, that person is a refugee under the terms of the Geneva Convention and is applying for asylum in the name of fundamental human rights."
"That person cannot, in all honesty, be told that he or she has got the wrong street or the wrong house and that it is not here but somewhere else, somewhere in another country, whose name someone will give them, if they insist and insist and if they ask..."
"It is to put an end to these and other situations that we frequently see in Europe that the Commission has drafted this timely proposal for a regulation, a type of road map for the right to asylum, which states, for each situation and specific case, who must provide an answer and where, which country must examine an application for asylum and, when all is said and done, what door will open to the anguish of a refugee who wants only to see someone with whom they can speak."
"The very nature of the problem explains the scope of the initiative."
"We will not be resolving the entire asylum issue, but we are certainly taking a step forwards."
"As rapporteur, I take pride in having done everything I could - and my conscience is, therefore, clear - to ensure that this initiative would be approved, supporting the Commission in the fight that it will still have to engage in with some Member States. Not many, I hope."
"I therefore wish to thank the Members of this House and my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and most particularly and with great feeling, Mrs Eva Klamt, the draftsman, without whose effort and understanding it would have been extremely difficult for us today to hope for the approval of this Commission initiative."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Klamt."
"The fact is, Mr President, that we have been lawlessly adrift in a sea of good intentions."
"There have certainly been laws, ratified by those countries that want to, and which apply in some places and not in others; some doors open and others close, and it is this murky area in which a little law is mixed up with no law at all that gives rise to dubious dealings, tricks, skilful manoeuvres and escape from the authorities."
"And this is how illegal immigration and the organised networks start, with the growth of mafias and crime, involvement in which is inexcusable but which is only possible because States, consisting of well-intentioned individuals, have never agreed on minimum standards for actually making one State responsible for examining an asylum application."
"The Commission proposal is a brave one."
"First of all, it guarantees that an application will actually be examined; it will prevent the confusion caused by multiple applications and refugees being left in limbo, and subjects these laws to its own vigilance and to monitoring by the Court of Justice."
"Basically, it is grounded in the principle that each Member State is responsible for the illegal entry or stay of a candidate for the right to asylum in its territory, thereby forcing each State to improve its mechanisms for combating illegal immigration."
"This responsibility, based on objective facts, can only be overridden by additional criteria concerning the importance attached to family group unity."
"Consequently, minors accompany the asylum application of the adult and unaccompanied minors are transferred, according to the wording that I propose, to a State where they have any relative willing and able to look after them."
"Similarly, entry or residence criteria can be dispensed with in order to guarantee the unity of the family group when one member has already applied for asylum in a given Member State."
"Finally, Mr President, what we are looking at in the initial proposal and in the feasible amendments, and whatever the result of the vote on these may be, is the broadest possible concept of the family: it covers marriage and de facto unions, where the law of any State recognises such arrangements."
"This would eliminate discrimination on the grounds of gender, recognising a family link for elderly relatives and minors and extending it to other children and other relatives where it can be proved that they lived with or were dependent on a successful applicant in the country of origin."
"And also, for humanitarian reasons to do with health or other matters, the asylum applicant can, according to the wording approved in my report, go to any relative as long as the State in which the application is made accepts this."
"Mr President, the important thing is to ensure that the application for asylum and the refugee who makes this application are given an answer and that the European legal system serves the rights of applicants and Member States' obligations and prevents a lack of legislation leading to an upsurge in racism and xenophobia."
"This initiative ensures that we will meet these three objectives and, therefore, I believe that it will be endorsed."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur. Next, I would like to point out, in a spirit of realism, that the Member States have often chosen to forget a very simple but obvious fact: that throughout history, no matter what the geographical circumstances, no barrier has been able to prevent people in search of refuge finding a way to cross the border or the barrier itself."
"I feel, however, that this report does justice to the problem and seeks, first and foremost, to find a sufficiently sound solution, not least with a view to finding a better alternative to the Dublin Convention itself."
"This is therefore an important contribution which will undeniably improve on the regulation."
"I have to say that, with regard to the current situation, the report seeks to find a balance between two conflicting requirements: on the one hand, it attempts to prevent abuse of asylum procedures and, on the other, it attempts to provide effective access to the procedures for determining the refugee status of those who genuinely need it."
"At the same time, there are new criteria and new derogations that we welcome, aimed particularly at preserving family group unity in one Member State."
"The same applies to the responsibility placed on a Member State which does not take effective action against the illegal presence of third-country citizens on its territory, making liability equivalent to that of a Member State which fails to control its borders properly."
"We therefore feel that the Council must introduce a 'fair and efficient' asylum procedure and a 'clear and workable' method including these new provisions on the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application."
"Lastly, we welcome, in particular, the fact that Article 27 of the regulation, Mr President, bans any discrimination based on sex, race, skin colour or even age, a criterion whose introduction we feel to be necessary and particularly progressive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Commission for their balanced and pragmatic proposal and Mr Marinho for his report and for his willingness to cooperate in a constructive manner."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs adopted this report by a large majority and thereby confirmed the rapporteur in his views."
"The Commission proposal represents a perceptible advance on the Dublin Convention and is thus an important step towards the establishment of a common European asylum system."
"The most important innovations are:"
"Firstly, the emphasis laid on the responsibility of the individual Member States when such Member States permit persons who have entered them illegally to remain in their national territory."
"Secondly, the adaptation of the procedural time limits to the time limits for the granting and revocation of refugee status, ensuring that applications for asylum can be processed speedily."
"Thirdly, the introduction of provisions aimed at maintaining the unity of the asylum seeker's family."
"The procedures for determining which Member State is responsible are also intended to serve the purpose of sharing burdens fairly."
"The making of the application in a specified Member State must not, therefore, create a fait accompli; that is, it must not determine responsibility."
"This requirement is taken into account by the measures intended to simplify procedures and simultaneously speed them up, while maintaining the principle of responsibility, as does the planned less onerous burden of proof when determining which Member State is responsible."
"It was thanks to a compromise with the rapporteur that we in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs were able to adopt a report that disregarded impractical and unacceptable amendments."
"This opens up the possibility of the Commission, Parliament and the Council finding together a rational way of deciding on the responsibility of Member States in asylum matters."
"The excluded amendments, which envisaged a widening of the family circle and the deletion of essential parts of the Regulation, were now reintroduced."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats rejects these amendments, particularly as regards their indiscriminate extension of the family circle, which would include, for example, dependant family members outside the nuclear family."
"In the same way, when we vote tomorrow, we should give a clear rebuff to the idea of deleting essential parts of the Regulation."
"Let me repeat: the Commission proposal is realistic and balanced."
"It offers an array of improvements in comparison with the Dublin Convention."
"There are no grounds for trying to recast this draft in a form that will, at the end of the day, benefit neither the applicants for asylum nor the Member States."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the content of his report and the way in which he has worked and established a dialogue with other groups in the House, which I believe has been positive, and I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its initial proposal."
"We must remember that we are saying to refugees that only one country of the European Union is going to consider their application for asylum."
"This is equivalent to saying that fourteen of the fifteen European countries are not going to appear on the relatively short list of democratic and prosperous countries in which a persecuted citizen can legitimately request asylum."
"I believe that this gives the countries of the EU and the Union itself the serious responsibility to offer, in exchange, firm guarantees of security to these people in various respects, which must take the form of respect for them and their families, the rapid adoption of a decision which is favourable to asylum seekers, the prohibition of all forms of discrimination and guaranteed access to justice for those people, with a view to referring that decision to the State responsible in order that their case may be re-examined."
"I also believe that this proposal is a necessary step, which requires others in order to make full sense."
"I believe that we can state that this House must support this proposal so that progress can be made in the direction indicated previously."
"We can see that the European Council has problems making progress with this harmonised and European asylum policy and that it finds it difficult to take these steps and I believe it is very important that tomorrow this House gives strong support to the proposal in the way I have indicated so that, amongst all of us, we can urge the Council to assume the responsibility it accepted in Tampere."
"Therefore, as the rapporteur has said, my group and I are going to ask for this report to be approved with the amendments which have already been approved in committee and with a few of those that will be tabled in plenary."
"Mr President, Commissioner, last week I visited Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Serbska."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is only ten years since the atrocious killing and massacring of innocent people was begun in the middle of a Europe which we had all promised would never again see mass graves containing desecrated corpses."
"That was not to be the case."
"Mass graves are being found today and the remains of corpses identified."
"I myself saw the remains of 500 people laid out in a line in industrial premises."
"Mr President, never before have the EU's shortcomings been more evident."
"When the refugees began streaming in, the EU acted slowly and was completely powerless to act."
"What was lacking was a common approach."
"Mr Marinho's report, like the Commission's proposal, is therefore extremely important."
"I want to praise the rapporteur for the work he has put in and for the sensitivity he has shown."
"We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party accept the basic principle contained in the proposal, relating to the way in which asylum seekers are to be regarded, how the issue is to be dealt with and what exceptions there are."
"However, we wish to make the rules more predictable and to increase the consideration given to the wishes of the individual."
"A number of the proposals were also very properly accepted by the committee."
"Allow me to mention a number of important points."
"Increased account must be taken of individual wishes concerning the country of asylum."
"These are people we are dealing with!"
"The rules determining which country is responsible must be characterised by the rule of law and by predictability."
"In the case of an asylum seeker who is still a minor, a person other than a relative and who has close links with the minor must be able to obtain custody of the child if it is in the latter's interests."
"The country of asylum responsible can therefore be decided in terms of such factors."
"It must be possible for asylum seekers who have family members in a particular Member State to have their applications examined in that country."
"Appeals concerning which country is responsible for examining the application must have a delaying effect so that asylum seekers are not moved to another Member State during the waiting period."
"It must only be possible to release personal data concerning asylum seekers to the Member States concerned and not to all the Member States, as proposed by the Commission."
"Allow me to highlight especially Amendment No 12, which Mrs Klamt also touched upon."
"It is our view that partners and cohabitees, irrespective of gender, should be counted as family members in Member States which treat unmarried and married couples equally."
"The Commission is unclear about this point, and clarification is needed in this area."
"It is my hope that the House will be able to support this proposal tomorrow."
"In conclusion, I want to put a direct question to Commissioner Vitorino."
"In my view, the type of abuses that go on at Sangatte near the Channel Tunnel, with people shunted about and responsibility divided between different Member States, should be rendered impossible by the proposal you have produced."
"What are you doing to ensure right now that there can be no repetition of the events at Sangatte?"
"What are you doing, in conjunction with London and Paris, to ensure that this proposal can become a reality straight away?"
"Mr President, part of the answer to that last question would be that, if there was a legal method of entering the UK to claim asylum, a lot of the problems would be solved at Sangatte."
"In dealing with the Marinho report before us, however, my group has criticised the Dublin Convention for a very long time for a number of reasons, not least because to us it mixes immigration controls with the claiming of asylum, and the two things are not necessarily the same at all."
"We are well aware that people choose a particular Member State as their country of destination for a large number of reasons."
"It may be a country they have heard of."
"They might have family links there."
"There may already be a considerable community of people from their own region in the area."
"The country might have a reputation for dealing fairly with asylum seekers rather than treating them as potential criminals and keeping them restricted."
"It might offer work opportunities. It might be because of former colonial ties."
"There might be a language link."
"There are all sorts of reasons."
"There is extensive research showing that asylum seekers settle better, enjoy better mental health, acquire the language of the country of residence more quickly - especially the children - if a number of the above conditions apply."
"But we know that asylum seekers generally want to contribute to the societies that admit them and do not want to feel like unwanted jetsam condemned to live on charity and tolerance."
"Positive motivation, then, is extremely important to a successful asylum policy."
"For us, Dublin seemed to be based on the premise that the first 'safe' country was good enough."
"It was also based on the premise that the government then had a duty to deal with those asylum seekers and effectively keep them there."
"We know that there have been all sorts of problems, both administratively and in terms of human rights, as a result of the Dublin Convention."
"The new proposals at least recognise the importance of the family, even if the criteria for definition of 'family', does not go far enough; my group has tabled amendments because we do not believe that the nuclear family is the only viable model."
"However, the proposals are still based on the premise that a Member State is somehow answerable to all other Member States for their failures to control entry and borders."
"Not surprisingly, countries with extensive sea or land borders close to countries of origin will be the major points of entry and are thus expected to bear the major responsibility for asylum seekers, bailed out presumably by the refugee fund."
"My group does not agree with this approach which is why we have tabled amendments designed to de-link immigration controls from dealing with asylum applications."
"If we are really fulfilling the duty that Mrs Terrón i Cusí spoke of and we are creating a high-standard, effective and fair common asylum policy - which sometimes I doubt - then the positive factors determining the country where the application is lodged can only act in an additional positive way."
"If we are not creating that, then people should have the right to choose where they seek asylum."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the Commission proposals and support the rapporteur and the report as it was voted on in the committee."
"However, I find the amendments tabled by the Greens and others absolutely unacceptable and counterproductive."
"If accepted, they would bring about the rejection of the whole report, and so I hope that it will be the original report that will be supported, with the Commission proposals."
"I will also tell you why in a few points: You Greens want to extend the concept of the family as far as it will go, far beyond the nuclear family and to the point of including de facto family members and friends."
"By doing this, you will only promote immigration."
"What this is about is help for refugees."
"You also want to introduce options for applicants for asylum, so that they will be able, as it were, to decide for themselves in which Member State the procedure is to be dealt with."
"By this, you are offending against the principle that the first Member State with which the application is lodged is to be responsible for examining it and the principle that burdens should be shared, something that we can achieve indirectly, and you would end up exacerbating the situation in countries which are, in any case, already struggling with the greatest integration problems."
"You also want to do away with the instruments provided by the Commission and the rapporteur to combat abuses in situations involving false or invalid documents, expired visas and so on."
"In doing that, you would not only be accepting abuses, but even promoting them and, with that, promoting non-compliance with existing legal standards."
"Under no circumstances could we accept that."
"If, in addition to that, you make all appeals have suspensive effect, you would thereby be hindering speedy and sure decisions and good solutions."
"In this House, as in the committee, I can definitely tell you once again that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support the Commission proposals and those made by the rapporteur."
"If, though, your amendments get a majority, or if even just one of them does, we intend to vote down the whole report."
"Mr President, I wish first to pay tribute to the work put in by our rapporteur, who has made very great efforts to live up to the ideal of optimising the EU's asylum policy."
"His guiding concern was, unmistakably, the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"He has taken very seriously the task enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I only hope that we will all do likewise."
"I think it right to speak at length about the Member States' responsibility in receiving applications for asylum and about which Member State should process them."
"All this not only benefits the EU's citizens, but also the refugees, who then know exactly where they stand."
"The increased threat of terror and the general rise in movements of refugees worldwide mean that we must at last give people a clear picture of what possibilities there are for them in the European Union."
"It is therefore right that we should give careful thought in this draft Regulation to what is meant by families joining their head, and make this quite clear."
"It is also very much the right thing to help bring families together, and it is important that this should be done."
"Both these things contribute to a coherent policy on asylum."
"We want every State to have the right to act in accordance with its national legislation, but this is not meant to stop anyone learning from other Member States."
"We want to share in granting asylum and preventing abuses."
"Not everything has to be the same from one State to another; we should be learning from one another how to protect refugees and how abuses can be prevented."
"Another reason for us now to be discussing the apportionment of responsibilities among Member States is that the first candidates for accession will be joining the EU in the foreseeable future."
"One thing is clear, namely that the EU must, as far as possible, have its policies on internal affairs, asylum, and immigration well in hand before the new members join."
"We cannot face the new members with an incomplete asylum policy."
"Much in the accession process will be difficult enough for them."
"It is now, even before the first new States join us, that we need to create rules across the EU on precisely what Member States' responsibilities are towards refugees."
"If we manage to get all the Member States to adhere to common rules, our work on this report will have given the project of an enlarged European Union and a common judicial area greater certainty and more success."
"This proposal for a Council regulation gives us the chance to evaluate our experience of the Dublin Convention and let it have an influence on new legislation."
"I hope we will all succeed in doing that."
"Mr President, it is certainly necessary to improve the workings of the Dublin Convention and to transpose it into European Community law, with European Court and Parliament oversight."
"We must stop the problem of refugees 'in orbit'."
"Asylum seekers are not parcels to be passed around: they are real human beings who may or may not be entitled to humanitarian protection but, in any case, need to be treated with respect and dignity."
"Most will be exhausted, many disorientated, frightened or frail."
"It bears repeating time after time that the chief responsibilities of Member States are to process asylum claims expeditiously, to rapidly integrate those who are accepted and to remove those who are not."
"This does not mean cutting corners since cases decided sloppily or unfairly risk taking longer in the end because of appeals."
"This is not, in turn, to challenge the right of claimants to make appeals."
"One of my group's amendments would make appeals have suspensive effect."
"If they do not, and the claimant is transferred, they will not be able to keep in contact with the procedure or their lawyer, which is unfair."
"My Group also aims to further strengthen the provisions on family unity."
"One of our amendments would give greater rights of reunion to unmarried, including same-sex, couples."
"We are also sympathetic to the amendment from the Green Group, although I fear that this has less chance than ours."
"There must be further progress by a convergence of family law developments at national level, and EU immigration and free movement rules, in recognising unmarried partners as family, especially, but not only, those in registered partnerships."
"I very much hope the Socialist Group will support the very reasonable ELDR position."
"I understand the motivation of those wanting individual choice of the applicant to be the determinant of where an asylum claim is processed, rather than the State responsible for entry."
"But, alas, it cannot be feasible until there is a fully functioning common asylum and immigration system in which there are no artificial distortions influencing that choice."
"It also confuses asylum with immigration."
"The asylum system is based on urgently needing protection."
"If it is determined exclusively by choice of destination, we risk ultimately undermining its integrity."
"This new proposal has a clause which would oblige a Member State to take responsibility where it had knowingly tolerated people illegally on its territory for at least two months."
"This would cover the Sangatte Centre near Calais."
"I urge the French Government to recognise the logic and imperative of this, though I understand they are resisting it in the Council."
"We are going to have to face up sooner rather than later to the need to have an immigration route as well as an asylum route into the EU, as well as tackling the traffickers."
"But the situation at Sangatte cannot be allowed to fester."
"The Centre cannot be closed: that would be inhumane and just displace the problem."
"But it is disruptive and dangerous and the UK needs to recognise that this is its problem too."
"There must be a bilateral solution, urgently required, supported by the new Dublin II but reached through pragmatic bilateral agreement."
"Mr President, we must be aware that this is a proposal for a directive which only establishes minimum application criteria."
"That means that its greatest merit is certainly the great flexibility it gives the Member States in allowing them to apply part of their national legislation and part of the Community legislation."
"However, it could be said that this directive is a case of shutting the door after the horse has bolted."
"In many countries, particularly Italy, indeed, this type of action has been in use for a long time now in the face of what is in fact a genuine immigration crisis."
"In this regard, I feel that, once again in a debate of this kind, not everyone has a clear understanding of the distinction between the three types of asylum application and therefore between the persons lodging the applications: in actual fact, there are political exiles, refugees fleeing emergency situations and the usual immigrants seeking work."
"Clearly, these are three very different cases and the solutions needed to regulate these situations will therefore also be very different."
"This directive also refers to ARGO and Odysseus: two programmes, father and son, with the same goal, programmes which combine - successfully I am glad to say - legality with a rigorous approach."
"I have heard some decidedly excessive views expressed in this debate."
"Someone even went so far as to say that we could move towards a police state."
"Quite frankly, this is not so: I heard no such fear was expressed in the debate before that."
"However, it must be said that if a rigorous approach means not a police state but, first and foremost, a guarantee of the proper implementation of procedures for granting asylum; if being rigorous means first and foremost distinguishing between irregular immigrants and illegal immigrants and criminals, distinguishing between honest immigrants and drug smugglers and slave traders, well then, if this is the case, I welcome the rigorous approach, a carefully considered rigorous approach; not least because the well-meaning people have nothing to fear from us being rigorous and asylum seekers will receive only a welcome, understanding and help."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of asylum has come to occupy a prominent place on the political agenda of the European Union and of its Member States, especially following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which conferred new competences on the Community, opening up new possibilities for action on a European scale."
"The proposal that we are debating here today is part of the dynamic of establishing a common European asylum system based on the full and broad application of the Geneva Convention, which is intended to create a clear, more simple and workable method, for determining which State is responsible for examining an application for asylum submitted in a Member State by a third-country national in the context of an asylum process that is intended to be fair and effective."
"The proposal lays down innovative provisions that are designed to end a process that has proven to be extremely slow, by stipulating shorter deadlines for procedures and making them more effective by improving cooperation between Member States, attempting in this way to create a system that is fair and humane for asylum seekers, which is of the utmost importance, not only for asylum seekers but also for the Member States themselves. Also by creating a uniform set of regulations, directly applicable throughout the European Union, thereby guaranteeing that each and every request for asylum is actually examined, and at the same time preventing multiple applications being made in a number of States."
"I welcome the efforts made by the rapporteur, Luís Marinho and by Eva Klamt, who have sought to produce a text that is balanced and which fulfils the stated objective."
"What is needed now is for us all to work together to prevent woolly amendments being adopted that could negate the balance of the text reached in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Mr President, it is very easy to feel powerless faced with the asylum situation we have in Europe."
"It is easy to feel powerless faced with the fact that so many people need this protection, but also faced with the inability we have in many quarters to integrate asylum seekers and immigrants into our Member States."
"That is a very important question, and I therefore wish to begin by thanking my colleague, Mr Marinho, for all the work he has put into this report."
"I also wish, of course, to thank the Commission for its proposal."
"I want to emphasise what Mr Marinho said about how important it is for the Member States to take this issue seriously now and to exchange words for action."
"The proposal concerning responsibility for asylum applications is a small, but very important, step in developing a common asylum policy in the EU."
"In spite of the Schengen Agreement and the removal of borders within this area, there are big differences between the Member States when it comes to the ways in which refugees are received and to asylum seekers' ability to obtain residence documents."
"It is therefore especially important to asylum seekers themselves that there should be a shared approach to receiving refugees and to processing applications."
"It is therefore gratifying that the EU can now go a step further than the Dublin Convention did."
"Shorter processing times reduce the risk of lengthy waiting periods, with all that these entail in terms of uncertainty for asylum seekers."
"The proposals for strengthening the rights of children when it comes to their own families are especially important."
"Children who are left alone to flee from war and oppression must receive all the support we can give them."
"An important contribution to this is the extended concept of the family which we now have the opportunity to take a decision on."
"Finally, I want to point out that it is important that we have respect for the choices people make as to their family circumstances so that, in this area too, we try to put different forms of partnership and cohabiting on an equal footing."
"Mr President, it is important that the excellent Dublin Convention, which is the basis of the proposal for a regulation, should be updated so that it corresponds with the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"There may, however, be a danger that we will not be improving the situation, but destroying what has been achieved."
"There have to be clear rules regarding which Member State is responsible for examining any given asylum application."
"When dealing with applications it is important that the deadline is as short as possible."
"The more efficient the European system is, the better for all concerned."
"It is not right that genuine asylum seekers should have to wait around for a long time for their applications to be dealt with solely on account of bureaucracy."
"Member States must be able to handle applications for asylum and requests for reception more efficiently."
"One month is the absolute maximum in humane terms."
"The custody of minors is not always a straightforward matter if the biological parents are unable to take charge themselves."
"It is not necessarily a good thing for the child either if just any relative can volunteer to take charge of him or her."
"This could also aid unlawful entry and thus also jeopardise the interests of genuine asylum seekers."
"The concept of custody must be clearly defined."
"There are great differences between the south and the north regarding the notion of family."
"What is the nuclear family?"
"Is it the parents and children, or all possible relatives extending as far as second cousins?"
"The debate on the directive on family unity is still continuing; it is therefore unreasonable to define what constitutes a family separately in each directive."
"The directive on family unity must be swiftly implemented."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation to replace the Dublin Convention with an instrument of Community law is, as laid down by Article 63 of the Treaty, part of a series of measures requested at Tampere and which includes, in addition to this regulation, three proposals for directives on, respectively, common minimum standards on asylum procedures, common minimum conditions on the reception of asylum seekers, and the admission criteria to refugee status or on subsidiary forms of protection and the content of the refugee status."
"Before these proposals were drawn up, broad consultation was carried out, on the basis of the working document issued by the Commission services, in conjunction with the Member States, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and non-governmental organisations."
"Thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Marinho, whom I would like to congratulate, the European Parliament will also contribute to this dossier."
"It is true that if we worked within the framework of a single, fully harmonised asylum system, the most practical solution would perhaps be to recognise the responsibility of the State in which the application was made."
"However, we do not have this single system."
"We are currently working within a framework where harmonisation is based on common minimum standards."
"We must acknowledge the fact that since harmonisation is, at present, very limited, the most practical and most effective solution is to accept that the State responsible for the entry of refugees onto the European Union's territory must be the State which has the final say on the asylum application, and this must be done in a spirit of solidarity and loyal cooperation."
"The Commission's proposal is therefore based on the same principle as the Dublin Convention."
"The responsibility for examining an asylum application lies with the Member State which played the greatest part in the applicant's entry into or residence on the territory of the European Union, subject to exceptions designed to protect family group unity."
"We must acknowledge, however, that the Dublin Convention has not had the effects that we anticipated."
"We must take on board the lessons of the past."
"That is why the proposal includes a number of innovations, such as new provisions emphasising each Member State's responsibility vis-à-vis all its partners in the Union when it allows illegal residents to remain on its territory; much shorter procedural deadlines to ensure that applications for asylum are processed rapidly in the interests of genuine asylum seekers, and so that applicants will not have to wait too long before they receive a decision on their asylum application; extended deadlines for implementing transfers of those concerned to the Member State responsible so as to allow for the practical difficulties arising in connection with such transfers and new provisions aimed at preserving the unity of asylum seekers' families, in so far as this is compatible with the other objectives of asylum and immigration policy."
"In answer to Mr Olle Schmidt's question, first of all, this allows for the existence of clear rules on the responsibility of the Member State; secondly, it gives clarification, which has been added to our proposal, on the standard of proof required for determining the State responsible, and finally, it stipulates rules on the subsidiary responsibility of the State which is negligent."
"The Commission is aware that no system used for determining responsibility in asylum matters can claim to be perfect."
"As Mrs Sbarbati points out in her report for the Committee on Petitions, we have attempted to find a balance, which is fairly difficult, I admit, between, firstly, the legitimate interests of the Member States in combating the phenomenon of 'asylum shopping' and the same individual submitting multiple applications in order to remain on European Union territory for as long as possible and, secondly, the interests of asylum applicants to have their application examined within reasonable time limits and so that they are not kept apart from their family members for lengthy periods, when there is no real reason why their application should not be examined in the same Member State."
"The Commission is able to accept the amendments which were proposed by the rapporteur and which, in our view, improve the text."
"They also make the Commission's intentions behind this text more effective. It will come as no surprise, I am sure, when I say that the Commission is not in favour of the amendments that were inspired by another logic, which, however respectable, mar the proposal and contradict the Commission's clear intention to draft a practical, reasonable, effective text in the shortest time span possible."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, the Minutes are correct but I should like to make a comment."
"Yesterday I was present in Strasbourg, and from the moment I arrived I had meetings through till after 9 p.m."
"I did not, therefore, sign the register in the plenary chamber, so when we look at the Minutes my name is not there."
"Some organisations publish details of Members' attendances; however this is a classic example of how sometimes when they say that Members have not attended the plenary part-sessions it is simply that they have not signed in in the Chamber on that day."
"I should like this put on record."
"Members should bear this in mind when those records are published and it appears that the record of attendance does not correspond to the reality of the situation."
"Thank you, Mr Wynn."
"Your comment will, of course, be included in the Minutes."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I should like to ask you to ask the President of Parliament to register our complaint to the French Government, to the Mayor of Strasbourg and indeed to Air France: some of us were unable to get to the start of the plenary session yesterday because Air France cancelled one of the only direct flights from the UK to Strasbourg."
"That meant a lot of us had to fly via Nantes and did not arrive until 9 p.m."
"We were the lucky ones."
"I understand the President of Parliament was also affected."
"If the French Government insists that we meet here for 12 sessions a year - and I have not been one of those complaining about it - please let us get to the plenary session and indeed get home from the plenary session after the votes at 6.30 on Thursday evening!"
"It is absolutely ridiculous that Members of the European Parliament cannot take part in debates."
"I was due to speak in one of those debates yesterday, as I know other people were."
"Would the President please contact the officials and ask them to do something about it?"
"Mrs Lynn, I will, of course, pass on your complaint."
"President Cox was also affected by this incident, as you know."
"We shall notify the French Government."
"Having said that, it appears that, rather than a single party being responsible for this problem, which we all condemn, several parties are to blame."
"We shall therefore pass on your complaint to all those responsible for this incident to prevent it from happening again."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, we can agree to this request for urgent procedure if this is dealt with at the second April part-session, when we will also know how the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market interprets the law."
"Although we do not agree with changing the legal basis, we are prepared, subject to these conditions, to discuss this at the second April part-session."
"Madam President, this proposal for a Regulation implements Resolution 1390, adopted on 16 January of this year by the United Nations Security Council, pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations."
"With regard to the 30 days required for signatory States to adopt the measures that correspond to the implementation of the aforementioned United Nations Resolution, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs yesterday voted in favour of the urgency procedure and for there to be a procedure without report, that is to say, that it should pass directly to plenary with time for amendments to be tabled by the political groups."
"I would ask the Presidency to set a long deadline for the tabling of amendments to take account of these circumstances."
"I would like to make two further observations."
"The first is that, in order to implement Resolutions such as Resolution 1390, the European Union should take two different types of action: one which corresponds to the second pillar, common foreign and security policy, and another within the framework of the EC Treaty."
"Yesterday, the Commission almost unanimously came to the conclusion that Parliament should work on the development of instruments in the second pillar, in other words, the development of the common position that is being adopted at this time."
"And, if Parliament is not involved, it should at very least be kept informed, for what is laid down in the Treaty is one issue, and common sense and the idea that this House is the true representative of citizens' interests is quite another."
"My second observation is that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has expressed a great deal of concern in this regard and will formally request that the Council and those Member States that form part of the United Nations Security Council make use of those procedural mechanisms needed to correct possible non-justified inclusions of names of natural or legal persons in these lists."
"This is currently the cause of much public concern in EU Member States."
"Finally, we would ask the Commission not to force us to take this kind of action."
"Parliament cannot seriously be expected to support this decision with only five days notice, for it is not really a question of issuing an opinion, but of supporting this United Nations Resolution, when the Resolution was passed on 19 January."
"We would ask that in future we be more rapidly involved in the process of drawing up this type of Regulation in order that this Parliament can provide its support with full knowledge of the facts and not, as in this case, in a truly unbalanced effort."
"Mrs Frahm, you asked to take the floor."
"Are you speaking for or against the request for urgent procedure?"
"Madam Palacio, I do not understand why you have let the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs accept this procedure."
"I do not understand why the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is to deal with a list of names without knowing how this list has been drawn up and without knowing how it can be altered."
"If the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs had taken its tasks seriously, it would have refused to deal with such a matter until it knew how the list of names could be altered."
"To win the respect of the Commission, it is not enough simply to agree to work at the Commission's pace."
"This is something that should have been rejected."
"Is there a Member to speak in favour of the request for urgent procedure?"
"Madam President, in support of the urgent procedure, and to specifically respond to this point, I would like to repeat that this is not a case of Parliament giving its opinion on a list."
"The matter in hand here is whether Parliament should support a decision made by the United Nations Security Council."
"This is an act adopted by the United Nations Security Council that the signatory States and the European Union - as representative regional power in some cases of signatory States - should support, but in which it cannot participate."
"Chapter VII(40 and41) of the United Nations Charter makes reference to the fact that the Security Council can implement any measures it deems necessary and that the signatory States must - for this is a mandatory act - apply them."
"Therefore, any amendment of these lists falls to the Security Council."
"What the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is asking - and we will implement it - is that the Council, as representative of the European Union, and the Member States that form part of the Security Council, keep an eye on the arbitration of procedures and mechanisms within the United Nations Security Council with the aim that, if there is any natural or legal person included in this list that should not be there, an exception can be made."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the members of Committee on Budgetary Control for their kind cooperation with me in preparation of this report, both individually and by group."
"I want also to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her regular attendance at our meetings and for the help and expertise that her staff provided."
"I especially want to thank the staff of our own Committee on Budgetary Control who were most diligent and expert and generous with their time, despite being moved around a lot recently, which is not very helpful."
"Nevertheless, I could not be more full of praise for them."
"I also want to thank Mr Bourlanges, who laid out the strategy for this report."
"We started out with 65 paragraphs and ended up with 95."
"I am not going to try to summarise the report because it would take far too long."
"I am going to mention its principal features."
"The main feature of this report on the budget for the financial year 2000 was the surplus of EUR 11 billion (or 14%)."
"That figure requires some explanation."
"Firstly, more than EUR 2 billion came from revenue."
"I do not think that any national government would apologise for having taken in too much revenue."
"Another factor is the reserve of EUR 800 million."
"Again, the reserve is there not to be spent if possible."
"It should not be included in the surplus."
"When other details are taken into consideration, we had a real surplus of around 9%."
"Of that 7.2% could be said to come from the Structural Funds."
"If the Structural Funds are taken out of the calculation, there was no problem with the rest of the budget."
"On the Structural Funds, the regulations were completed in mid-1999."
"The new Commission came in at that time."
"It was never a possibility, considering the detail and the complications of this regulation, that our objectives for spending in the year 2000 could be achieved."
"This brings us to the point of the difficulty of these regulations."
"Most member governments did not submit their framework plans until the year 2000 itself."
"Some of them were not admissible at that time because of the difficulty of understanding the regulations."
"So, there was a problem."
"I would like to underline the fact that a German official told me that in the six-year programme ending in 1999, there were 60 000 projects in Objective 1 areas of Germany alone."
"That gives us some idea of the extent of the problem of administering these funds, and there are about 500 staff members in the relevant Commission Directorate-General."
"The question of the Structural Funds has to be looked at in depth."
"All the institutions of the Union have to apply themselves to simplifying the regulations by which we implement European regional policy before the new programme comes in and before enlargement in four years' time."
"My next point is the topical question of fraud and irregularity."
"It is the duty of the Committee on Budgetary Control to identify failure in administration and propose solutions."
"That is why the message from the Committee on Budgetary Control must always be critical and risk sounding rather negative."
"The final responsibility for failure always rests with the European Commission, but the national governments spend most of the money."
"When we talk about the failure of the Commission, we are talking about its failure to control the national governments and the regional authorities, which is not always an easy task."
"The EU at all levels is a partnership with the national governments."
"If the Commission can be blamed for anything it is for failing to do its own public relations work, to stand up for itself and to stand up to the national governments when they are in breach of the regulations."
"In the discharge procedure we expect to make a political decision on the performance of the Commission."
"We in the Committee on Budgetary Control do that on the basis of a report from the Court of Auditors and the Commission's annual financial statement."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control passed the discharge by a vote of something like 17 to 4."
"That is a resounding vote of confidence in the work that the Commission has done in the year 2000."
"However, we have not overlooked the weaknesses in the system and our motion for a resolution proposes changes and improvements both in planning and administration."
"We are looking for better cooperation between the Court of Auditors, Parliament and the Commission in the implementation of European policies and more efficient spending of European money."
"The last point I want to address is the failure of the Court of Auditors to give a statement of assurance."
"We should point out that it gave a statement of assurance in relation to revenue and administration."
"We have set out our solutions in paragraph 44."
"We would like to see figures for the rate of error."
"We would like to see figures which would enable us to compare one year with another."
"But we would like the statement of assurance of the Court of Auditors in relation to the revenue side of the budget and administration to be clearer."
"The only information we have about the rate of fraud and error comes from the Commission's statement for the year 2000."
"It would appear that the rate of fraud and error is about EUR 2 billion, or about 2.5% of the entire budget."
"Of this, about 10% of traditional own resources seems to involve a serious problem."
"If that is taken out of the calculation, the rate of fraud and error, as best we can make it out, is about 1%."
"I tried to establish how other States deal with this problem and I find the only comparable systems are in the United States and the Netherlands."
"By the standards that they apply, I want to state categorically that the Commission would pass with first-class honours: our rate of fraud and error is below what is acceptable in those countries."
"So while we have readjustments to make and recommendations for improvements, at the same time we do not want to overemphasise the negative aspects of our report."
"Finally, I would like to see us aim for a situation where the Court of Auditors would present us with a statement which could be read in reasonable time by members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"We could then prepare a statement that could be read and understood by Members of this Parliament, by members of national parliaments and students of European politics."
"We have failed to do that so far."
"I hope that my successors will achieve something that can be understood by European citizens."
"Madam President, I should like to recommend that we give the Commission discharge for the Development Fund, and I should like to ask Mrs Schreyer to communicate this to Mr Nielson, as I can see that he is not here today during this important debate."
"I threatened along the way to have the discharge decision postponed if the Commission could not supply any results."
"In fact, it has done so."
"There are still a few problems, but we shall have to look at those in a follow-up report."
"I have focused in particular upon quality in the form of the number of follow-ups of audit results this year."
"What concerns me is that the Commission has no overview of how many audits have been carried out, where and by whom."
"One of my first questions to the Commission was: 'How many audits did you carry out in the year 2000?'."
"The first answer was twelve, and that - I think - was extremely few, considering that there are 70 ACP countries."
"The Commission then found a few more reports."
"The thought occurred to them that a number of reports had no doubt been produced out in the delegations, and Mr Nielson assured the committee that 73 audits had been carried out in 2000."
"I then asked for a list of these audits."
"It proved to be a list containing very sparse information, which did not leave me much the wiser."
"However, it provoked a lot of amusement - especially in the Court of Auditors - when it was seen what was being presented as audits."
"Moreover, almost half of them were from Malawi, and it turned out that these were to be deducted from the number of audits, leaving 52 and not, as Mr Nielson had promised us in the committee, 73."
"It may well be that 52 audits are enough, but it is worrying that the Commission does not have a better overview of how many audits are carried out and by whom."
"There are no central records, and there is no general view of the activities 'out in the field'."
"The Commission has nonetheless convinced me that it is not necessary for the audits to be carried out from the headquarters in Brussels."
"I have therefore withdrawn my original demand for at least 50 audits."
"However, the more financial responsibility that is farmed out to the delegations, the greater the demands that are made in terms of oversight and coordination to be exercised by headquarters."
"I have also asked the Commission to give me a better explanation of why the remaining millions of euros mentioned in the Court of Auditors' annual report have still not been claimed back."
"It is two years since this was noted, and still nothing has happened."
"I asked DG AIDCO's director-general if, on the basis of the auditing system and the information received from the delegations, he could issue a statement to the effect that the EDF funds are used in accordance with the principles of 'sound management'."
"I have still not had an answer to this question."
"I could have put the question to Commissioner Nielson if he had been here today."
"However, it may of course be that Mrs Schreyer can help me."
"There has been a lot of criticism of the way in which the ACP's secretariat has operated."
"Extremely critical audit reports have been prepared, and there have unfortunately also been some court cases in Belgium leading to convictions for not complying with legislation."
"That is not, I think, something that we can live with in the EU."
"New management is now in place, with which I have had some incredibly productive meetings."
"I hope that matters are improving, which is why I have said that we are now waiting to see what the outcome of the Court of Auditors' decisions will be, whereupon we shall have to address the issue again."
"I also wish to make a couple of observations about Mr McCartin's report on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"I think it is a splendid result, and I should like to commend him for having listened to my many amendments and for the fact that they have been incorporated."
"That is one of the ways in which we can persist in following up the previous discharge decisions, and that is something extremely important to do."
"There are, however, two important matters I have been left in ignorance of. When will the disciplinary proceedings taking place at the Stockholm office be concluded, including on the part of OLAF?"
"And the same question applies to the IRELA case from Spain, which we have talked at such length about."
"I should also like to say a couple of words about the discharge decision where Parliament is concerned."
"Mr Virrankoski has carried out an outstanding piece of work that is both incisive and well balanced."
"In connection with the discharge decision where Parliament is concerned, it is not easy to understand our asking for transparency."
"Everyone here is on the ball, especially when it comes to their own money."
"I should like to say that I am deeply disappointed at the secretary-general of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who has written round to all the other groups, saying that it would be a disaster if there were to be transparency in connection with our accounts."
"We criticise the Commission for not being open but, when it comes to ourselves, we close our eyes."
"I really do think that the PPE-DE Group's Secretary-General should be deeply ashamed of ringing round and asking for there to be total secrecy concerning taxpayers' money."
"That is something we cannot live with."
"I should also like to say that one of the things that strikes me is the desire to close down the Finance Inspectorate."
"When the figures for 2000 are examined, it can be seen that there were errors in seven per cent of the documents."
"I think this shows that it must be possible for the impending internal audit to be independent."
"However, I would still say, forget about closing down the Finance Inspectorate."
"With regard to the discharge decision where the Council is concerned, I should like to say that we stand by the committee's observations and decision."
"I cannot countenance some members of a group being made to toe the line, with the result that we have to change the decision we voted in favour of in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"All things considered, I am going to recommend, however, that we give discharge in all the areas."
"Things are going well, in fact much better, and that is something we can only be pleased about."
"Madam President, the work of the European Coal and Steel Community in recent years has been guided by the knowledge that it would cease functioning this summer."
"It has been decided that the work of the ECSC should be discontinued: half a century is enough."
"In its final years of operation the ECSC functioned like a bank."
"It borrowed and lent money."
"The Commission was responsible for administering its finances, and it is now the Commission's task to discontinue the bank's work, call in its loans and pay off its debts."
"Its credit balance exceeds its debts."
"It would appear that there will be a surplus of approximately 1.1 billion euros after the ECSC has been wound up."
"In accordance with decisions taken earlier on, this surplus is to be invested profitably in the financial markets."
"Some of the assets are to be used to set up a separate Coal and Steel Fund, out of which money will be allocated for research in these areas, in accordance with the principles proposed by the Commission and approved by the Council."
"The yield from assets is intended to benefit the coal and steel sectors, which had to pay levies to the ECSC to fund its work."
"That is only reasonable."
"In this connection we have to remember that the money in the research fund was collected from the old Member States, and that it must first and foremost be used for research in these countries' coal and steel sectors."
"However, if we consider how very important these sectors are in the economies of many of the applicant countries, it is only reasonable to call on the Commission to initiate talks with the old Member States in order that the new members might also share in the information obtained from research in this way."
"The Commission must invest the assets left over after the ECSC ceases to function to ensure it obtains the greatest possible return."
"If choices have to be made between safe investments and taking risks, then risks should be avoided."
"It is important to be able to predict what sort of return the Commission can expect on its investments."
"For the first time, in connection with this year's accounts, we can have information on yield from the investment of the ECSC's assets."
"In 2000 the average rate of yield was 4.72%."
"This sort of information is an important step in the right direction, but further steps have yet to be taken."
"With regard to subsequent years there is every good reason to state a benchmark target rate of return, on the basis of which the auditors can assess how successfully the target has been achieved."
"Similarly it will be important in the years to come to assess whether the ECSC's old activities are being wound down in the way that was planned."
"The Commission intends to keep on more than thirty officials to be specifically employed in the distribution of the ECSC's estate."
"That would seem to be a large number."
"In the years to come Parliament must monitor the situation to ensure that the assets left over from the European Coal and Steel Community are not used to maintain needless bureaucracy on the part of the Commission."
"The Court of Auditors has submitted a statement of assurance in which it recommends the granting of discharge."
"Parliament can endorse their opinion."
"Madam President, there was a very high level of implementation of the European Parliament's budget for the financial year 2000."
"The utilisation rate was 99.28%, and the ratio of payment appropriations to all commitments was 91.05%."
"The high degree of implementation was partly the result of the end-of-year mopping-up transfers, where funds were transferred to pay for Parliament's buildings."
"In this way we were able to reduce the future costs of renting."
"In the future this sort of practice should be done away with and we should budget strictly for actual estimated expenditure."
"Parliament's accounts are abstruse, however."
"For that reason, the report proposes that the way they are presented should be clarified and that, more specifically, there should be a clear breakdown of capital investment with regard to buildings."
"The main points of focus in the budget for 2000 were the promotion of activity based management and better allocation of human resources."
"Activity based budgeting and management has begun to improve, but, as the report states, the results are still modest."
"Power of decision and responsibility must be delegated further downwards, and each member of staff's personal responsibilities must be clarified."
"We furthermore have to change to a form of administration in which it is the results of actions that are assessed and not so much the way the administration is organised."
"Only in this way can we make the administration more efficient and make savings."
"In this respect the recommendations of the Rome-PE report should be implemented and internal financial control improved."
"We must be able to redeploy human resources more flexibly and put an end to functions that are unnecessary."
"The current system is too rigid and set in its ways."
"This is also linked to the question of inequality between women and men."
"The European Parliament is still a very old-fashioned place to work in."
"In the last eighteen months eighteen people have been appointed to posts in categories A1 - A3."
"Of them, just one was a woman and seventeen were men."
"The report criticises this and calls for the introduction of quota arrangements until a normal state of affairs is reached."
"Political groups are also connected with the matter of administration."
"It is in accordance with the principles of activity based management that the groups' internal autonomy should be developed."
"For that reason the report requests that this special feature should be taken into account in one way or another when the Financial Regulation is amended."
"The report insists that the groups should present their balance sheets and financial statements more clearly and that they should be published."
"Furthermore, there must be improvements made to asset management and inventories."
"In addition, the responsibility of the group as party to agreements in general and as employer in particular must be legally clarified so that the European Parliament is not always ultimately accountable."
"Regarding Parliament's two places of assembly we state that just the variable costs of meetings alone at Strasbourg are 33% more than in Brussels."
"In addition there are considerably higher costs mainly due to the fact that there is double the number of buildings in Strasbourg."
"Shortening the length of a part-session produces savings of just 1%."
"This matter would perhaps be worth looking into by the Convention dealing with Treaty reform."
"The biggest single problem is the cost of the Louise Weiss building in Strasbourg."
"No agreement has been reached concerning the final investment costs with the project's promoter, SERS."
"The dispute concerns the completion date and that is to be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"In addition there are disputes over work, additional work and unnecessary work."
"There are also disputes between the promoter and the subcontractors."
"It may take as long as ten years to resolve the argument completely."
"Considering that Parliament did not want two meeting places, but agrees to meet in Strasbourg under great pressure from France in particular, we must insist that the dispute over the construction costs of the Parliament are resolved immediately."
"The city of Strasbourg and the Alsace Region have the controlling interest in SERS, owning 60% of the shares in all. They must therefore wield their power."
"Furthermore, France must take responsibility for seeing to it that the European Parliament does not need to be party to the disputes and can pay for its work premises immediately and acquire title accordingly."
"It is unfair that Parliament should continually have to remain vigilant to ensure that it is not being billed for costs that are unjustified."
"With these observations the report proposes granting discharge to the Secretary-General in respect of the implementation of the 2000 budget and to the Accounting Officer in respect of the accounts for 2000."
". Madam President, with that long list you make it sound as though I have been extremely busy."
"I would like to concentrate on those institutions that you have just mentioned."
"The exercise, of course, considers the expenditure, and assesses the effective use of European taxpayers' money relating to those institutions."
"There is also reference in this report to the Council, which I will touch on later."
"Generally speaking there were no great concerns relating to the Court of Justice although we will clearly be following up some of the requests we have made to it on more detailed issues."
"We grant discharge to the Court of Justice."
"The Court of Auditors seems still reluctant to name Member States found wanting, and I warn the Court again that we will not rest until this request is complied with."
"More consumer-friendly reports would be welcome, as would a declaration of interests by the Court on the Internet, as is currently carried out by most of the other institutions."
"The Court must never feel itself to be too grand to conform to the standards we have learned to expect from other high-profile public servants."
"We grant discharge to the Court of Auditors, however."
"The new Ombudsman budget is very small, so any money not spent will perhaps be disproportionally reflected in percentage figures, but it is something that the Budget Committee needs to keep an eye on when they are setting the Ombudsman's budget."
"We grant discharge to the Ombudsman."
"The Committee of the Regions is also a relative newcomer to the European scene."
"It is good to see some shared expenditure with the Economic and Social Committee although at times this does not go far enough."
"A future report by the Committee on Budgetary Control may perhaps examine the value for money and impact assessment of this institution."
"Both the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions performed quite well in relation to the Belliard and Montoyer buildings and played quite a good game with the poor set of cards that were dealt to them unfairly by Parliament."
"We grant discharge to the Committee of the Regions."
"I turn now to the area where the report's focus lies, and that is on the Economic and Social Committee: a committee which has been in existence since the beginning of this great project."
"Whilst the report recognises the Economic and Social Committee can act as a forum for interest groups which would otherwise not be able to make their voices heard in the EU context, developments over recent years - including, for example, the social protocol - must now be considered."
"Do we see some duplication here for example?"
"We have concerns that the information does not filter down to the grass roots."
"The massive costs of financing this institution, which will reach almost EUR 100 million after enlargement, also gives us great concerns."
"Even amongst some trade unions, which are recognised by and which use the Institution, there is criticism."
"One prominent British trade union was prepared to say 'that the Economic and Social Committee appears to be redundant; we would be content for it to be abolished'."
"Another worrying aspect of the ESC came in their reaction to this report which claimed that the concept of value for money of a body established by the European Treaties is highly questionable and politically unjustifiable."
"Try telling that to the taxpayers of Europe!"
"I think it is pretty obvious, when you see reactions like that, there is not much accountability going on within the Economic and Social Committee."
"The Budgetary Control Committee is recommending that discharge be refused to the Economic and Social Committee for the years 1996 and 1997."
"This is a historic move and it is not taken lightly."
"Only on two occasions before has the discharge been refused; once of course which led to the forced resignation of the Commission in 1999."
"It may perhaps seem strange that we have waited until now to assess the accounts and expenditure for 1996."
"However, it has taken until now to receive objective clarification on irregularities relating to payments of members' travel allowances."
"The whole sequence of events from the fraud itself involving 59 members of the Economic and Social Committee amounting to over EUR 1 million, to the scandalously relaxed attitude of Economic and Social Committee managers and their efforts to cover up the problem, to the botched and unprofessional approach of OLAF, the European Fraud Office, all reeks of incompetence, procrastination and amateurism."
"It has taken six years to get to the bottom of this fraud that occurred in 1996."
"This situation is a disgrace."
"It has meant that there has been no chance of prosecuting those involved, as the Courts have said that too much time has elapsed."
"There have been improvements since then however, which is why we do grant discharge to the Economic and Social Committee for 1998, 1999 and 2000."
"It is important that the Convention on the Future of Europe should take heed of the message in this report."
"I turn finally very briefly to the Council."
"Traditionally we have lumped this together with the Commission expenditure."
"This year, however, the Court of Auditors has prepared a critical report on the workings of the common foreign and security policy."
"This again is a fairly new area for the Council."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has asked for answers and clarification on some of the issues on which the Court of Auditors has concerns."
"The Council is discussing that this morning, so we are waiting for the results from the Council before we take a vote on this."
"I hope you will bear that in mind when it comes to the vote."
"I hope that the Economic and Social Committee will deal with the fact that we have not given them discharge with the gravity that this issue deserves."
"Madam President, I should first of all like to echo the words of thanks to the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control and to Mrs Schreyer."
"In my view, cooperation has been excellent this year."
"I should also like to thank the two draftsmen of opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, common security and defence policy, for their very pleasant and smooth cooperation. Finally, of course, I should also like to extend a word of thanks to the representatives of the decentralised bodies to whom we can grant discharge today."
"This discharge does in fact concern three bodies: the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions in Dublin, the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) in Thessaloniki and the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo, based in Thessalonica and Pristina."
"The Court of Auditors has closely examined the financial accounts of these three bodies, and in all three cases it has reached the conclusion that the annual accounts for the financial year 2000 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"As your rapporteur, I have been looking into what we said in the discharge report for 1999."
"In the first two cases, we recommended that an external evaluation be implemented and an Action Plan be submitted."
"As far as the Foundation in Dublin is concerned, we enquired last year whether it would not be preferable to work more closely with the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work."
"We asked CEDEFOP for verification of how cooperation with the European Training Foundation in Turin could be improved."
"Now I have to inform you that the Foundation in Dublin has faced some delays in implementing this request."
"The external evaluation has just been completed, the Action Plan has only recently been discussed, but the request has now been complied with, it has been presented for discussion and I, as rapporteur, will naturally remain in contact with the representatives of the Foundation in Dublin to ensure that the discharge report for 1999 is carefully observed."
"As far as CEDEFOP is concerned, this exercise has been fully completed and I have good news on this front."
"It is nice to have some good news on a discharge for a change."
"CEDEFOP has indeed fully complied with our request and a cooperation agreement has now also been concluded with the Foundation in Turin."
"In my view, it is partly thanks to the pressure exerted by our institution, the European Parliament, that considerable progress has also been made on behalf of the European taxpayer in this area."
"Finally, I also have positive news about the European Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo."
"We must remind ourselves of what the situation was like."
"The challenge in Kosovo after the war was enormous."
"Not only due to the trail of material damage and human suffering left by the war in Kosovo, but mainly due to the damage which the Milosevic regime caused in Kosovo for more than a decade, which was typified by a chronic under-investment in resources and permanent violations of human rights."
"And I should like to emphatically praise our people in the field, the people of the European Agency for Reconstruction, but also the people of the Kosovo task force who went out there immediately after the war."
"The work they did there, sometimes under very difficult circumstances, was incredible."
"The Court of Auditors and everyone who reads the annual reports and the three-monthly reports can see for themselves how incredibly efficient our management has been over there."
"We have learnt from our mistakes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course, and this too is a positive message."
"I was your rapporteur for a special Court of Auditors report about the actions taken by the EU in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"We made mistakes there, we learnt from these, and this is how we managed to take effective action in Kosovo."
"I should like to finish off with a remark about the situation in Kosovo."
"The energy sector is the most important area in which we are investing, yet it is also typified by an inherent paradox."
"An incredible amount of money is being poured into the supply of energy, and yet electricity failures occur almost on a daily basis."
"This is a paradox for the population, and in my report, I urge for more efforts to be made in order to make it clear to the people in Kosovo that energy-saving measures will need to be stepped up, and that energy will also need to be paid for in order to achieve a more sustainable policy."
"Finally, I have received reports about misappropriations at the Kosovo Electricity company, but it is too early to draw any conclusions."
"I have asked UNMIK to draft a report on this, as it is UNMIK that is ultimately responsible, and I think that we will have to incorporate the results of this report in our discharge report for 2001."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the year 2000, EUR 82 billion was spent via the European Budget, made up of hundreds of thousands of different cash movements - payments to researchers and research institutes, grants to students, premiums to farmers for cattle or for set-aside, food aid for refugees, payments for the provision of building materials in Kosovo or for the fight against Aids in Africa, subsidies for the extension of rail networks in the EU, for the building of business parks and so on."
"This shows the heterogeneous and multifarious nature of the European Union's tasks to which these financial resources go."
"It shows, too, what varied demands are made on good budget management and proper monitoring."
"One might add what Mr McCartin has emphatically underlined, namely that the Commission has central administrative responsibilities only for a small part of this and that in other respects, in the Member States, thousands of payment offices for agricultural expenditure, as well as hundreds of ministries and agencies, are responsible for implementation, that is, for receiving applications for funding, examining them and granting them."
"Mr McCartin, your report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the Budget for the financial year 2000 reflects the wide range of the Commission's activities, the risks and sources of error specific to each of them, the measures that need to be taken and also, of course, the deficiencies in the way the Budget was managed."
"It is indeed very comprehensive, and the Commission is very grateful to you for the great balance that this report demonstrates."
"Let me, too, thank you for your speech and for your committed involvement in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The Commission welcomes the Committee on Budgetary Control's recommendation, by such a large majority, that the Commission should be given discharge in respect of the 2000 Budget."
"Notwithstanding that, the report and the resolution, indeed, do anything but quiet the Commission's conscience."
"The report makes 144 demands of the Commission, ranging from the demand that it should submit reports on administrative measures it has taken, to the demand that it should amend laws."
"I cannot, of course, discuss all these demands now, but I would like to pick out a few of them."
"I would like to start by thanking you, Mr Blak, on behalf of the Commission, for your work on the Development Fund and for the recommendation of discharge, which, in accordance with your own tradition - one that I greatly value - comes with numerous demands attached."
"You, Mr Seppänen, have played a positively historic role as rapporteur for the European Coal and Steel Community budget, and I will also thank Mrs Morgan and Mr Virrankoski."
"Even though your reports deal with the ways the other institutions implement their budgets, they are elements of the general European Budget."
"Mr Staes, your report, which the Commission warmly welcomes, is one that I should like to return to later."
"The Commission wishes to express its thanks to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, for managing the whole discussion of the discharge so well, and, of course, the secretariat and the whole committee for their hard work."
"One of the 2000 Budget year's results that got a very critical reception from the Committee on Budgetary Control was the large Budget surplus of EUR 11.6 billion, which, however, was welcomed by the Finance Ministers of the Member States."
"I have, in fact, nothing to add to Mr McCartin's description of the positive development on the revenue side."
"One should naturally welcome a situation in which growth rates are higher than first expected."
"What should, in fact, be seen in a more critical light is the issue of how outgoings were less than estimated in the Budget."
"We are not talking here about agricultural or administrative expenditure, where expenditure being lower than estimated really does mean that savings have been made."
"In the case of the Structural Funds, though, outgoings have been deferred for a period of time."
"Not all the regulations that were required could in fact be adopted in time, because it was so late in 1999 that decisions were taken on the agenda, as also described by Mr McCartin."
"Even today, though, in 2002, we have to record that the programme has been poorly implemented."
"Conclusions must, then, be drawn from this for the next aid period, and even the present aid period cannot be untouched by change."
"Mr Blak has drawn attention to the fact that the European Development Fund had, in real terms, a substantially greater turnover of resources in 2000 than in the preceding year, so this represents a positive development."
"It is also clear, in view of the immense need in many ACP States that the underutilisation of resources is not about there being any lack of need, but often about a lack of definite projects."
"The Commission has, then, in part, gone over to subsidising these countries' budgets to a greater extent. On the one hand, this is right and proper, but, on the other, it does require new approaches to monitoring."
"Let me again point out, with reference to the forwarding of information in the discharge procedure, that the Commission always immediately posts on the Internet evaluation reports on the various programmes and the different Budget items, and that the figures on the implementation of the current Budget are sent by electronic means to the Committee on Budgetary Control on a weekly basis."
"The Commission is convinced that the agreement with Parliament on the forwarding of confidential information has proved its value."
"I must reiterate, though, that both the Commission's and OLAF's reports are covered by the rules on data protection and the protection of the confidentiality of investigations."
"The Commission has also, in response to a query from the Committee on Budgetary Control, produced a further breakdown of the reports from the Member States on errors and demands for repayment in connection with the Structural Funds."
"Tighter controls have meant that these have been notified in greater numbers, although the Member States are often not yet monitoring to the extent prescribed."
"Mr McCartin, you have made critical comments on this in your report."
"Your criticism is one that I share."
"It is though, very doubtful that those Member States with federal structures will be happy to be told, as is proposed in the report, that they must change the way their competences are allocated as regards the monitoring of European funds, as this is often enshrined in their constitutions."
"This really does raise some very serious issues."
"One significant topic in discussions during this discharge procedure has been - and still is - the methodology on the basis of which the European Court of Auditors decides whether or not to grant a Statement of Assurance."
"The Commission welcomes the Court of Auditors' willingness to discuss proposals for a changed approach to the creation of indicators for financial management that are capable of being checked and compared over a period of time."
"Both the report on the Commission's budget and Mrs Morgan's report demand that enquiries be made into the incidence of errors in each Directorate-General."
"The Court of Auditors has already made it clear that this is not in accordance with its present method of sampling, as it would require substantially more random samples than the Court of Auditors is able to carry out."
"I would, though, point out that the reform of the Commission saw the introduction of new monitoring standards and that the annual reports on the activities of the Directorates-General have to contain details of which standards have been complied with and how this has been done."
"We will be checking with the Court of Auditors what amounts can be derived from these reports and from the Directorate-General's statements for the purpose of establishing indicators that can then be compared over time."
"Mr Staes, in your report on the discharge of the Director of the European Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, you express your agreement with the Court of Auditors' favourable judgment."
"I have several reasons for picking up on this."
"One is that experience with the reconstruction agency has shown that decentralised responsibility, meaning more on-the-spot decisions, is the right way to go."
"Another is because press reports have, in part, given the impression that accusations of mismanagement in energy supply had already been substantiated."
"You have again made clear that this is not the case, but that the situation continues to be unsatisfactory, and have also shown how things stood in the year 2000, when they were absolutely desolate with regard both to this power station and also to the fact that - like everywhere else in the former Eastern bloc - electricity bills were not being paid."
"It is also of significance that the position with regard to ownership of the power station was unclear, which meant that it could not be privatised, and that it was of enormous importance in terms of safeguarding jobs."
"That, too, had to be taken into account in a very thorny and politically unstable situation, in which there will, of course, have to be further developments."
"I am very glad that the Court of Auditors has thoroughly audited the Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, and done so at a very early juncture."
"They were on the spot themselves."
"The overall result of the audit by the Court is a very positive one, which is significant in so far as this work in the Balkans, and the work in Kosovo, will, in the years to come, be of great importance for policy not only on foreign affairs, but also specifically on the Budget."
"I would like to touch briefly on the observation and demand you made concerning the agricultural sector, especially on agricultural export refunds."
"Even while the discharge procedure was running its course, it was possible for some understanding on several points to be reached between the committee and my fellow-Commissioner Mr Fischler, something that also shows that the atmosphere between the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Commission has undergone positive change in the direction of directly critical, but constructive cooperation."
"It is not only I, myself, but also, no doubt, most of our citizens, who welcome the way that Parliament is now demanding decisions on the reduction of live animal transports, which are indeed often carried on only to get export refunds."
"I hope that this plenary sitting will see the completion of the discharge procedure for the 2000 Budget."
"Work is simultaneously in progress on drawing up the 2003 Budget, which is expected to be the last Budget for an EU of fifteen Member States."
"When the EU is enlarged, the Budget will once again become more complex and more multifaceted."
"Until then, the Commission will use the time available to support the candidate states in their preparations for enlargement and for participation in the European funds, monitoring the introduction of the necessary measures, and itself further reforming its administrative procedures."
"That will call for a degree of impetus from Parliament, but especially for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you for your cooperation in the past months and will conclude by alluding to an old saying from the world of football, to the effect that the Commission is very well aware that one discharge being over always means that you have another one to face."
"Madam President, for the Committee on Foreign Affairs there are two key issues in this discharge: transparency and implementation."
"On transparency, I had an interesting time when I asked Parliament's officials if they could let me have a list of what the Commission had done on the 2000 budget in relation to those items to which Parliament had adopted amendments to the budget, in terms of both amounts of money and also remarks."
"I was told that, even if it were possible, it would take several months to find this information."
"That is totally ridiculous because, if Parliament adopts amendments to the budget, it is elementary that there should be a mechanism to follow up on those amendments to know exactly what has happened."
"The fault lies in part with Parliament, because we do not scrutinise and follow up the budget as we should."
"I do not blame the Committee on Budgetary Control but the individual committees which do not often take that responsibility."
"The fault also lies with the Commission because we need greater clarity of information in order to analyse budget implementation."
"There should be much better dialogue between Parliament and the Commission to identify very clearly what action has been taken on European Parliament priorities."
"I suspect the Commission far too often simply ignores what Parliament amends in the budget."
"We need to be able to indicate that."
"On the common foreign and security policy, we need greater clarity: we are not clear on who does what."
"That is why I support the idea of an interinstitutional agreement setting out exactly the Commission's role in the CFSP."
"On implementation, there was for the 2000 budget again a very high concentration of commitments at the end of the year for Latin America, Asia and so on."
"The imbalance between commitments and payments continues to give cause for concern, as indeed do the remarks of the Court of the Auditors in relation to the TACIS programme."
"I recognise the improvements the Commission has made - in particular the use of the website to provide information - but we have to focus on transparency and implementation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that I presented to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and which it unanimously adopted, begins by calling on the Court of Auditors to make specific mention of Title B5-8 on the area of freedom, security and justice in its annual report and to devote to this area a minimum of attention, which it has so far failed to do."
"As far as the implementation of the 2000 Budget is concerned, we note that although the implementation rate is incredibly low - 50% for commitment appropriations and 70% for payment appropriations - this cannot be attributed to poor management or a lack of will on the part of the Commission. It is essentially due to the fact that the Council of Ministers adopted the legal bases too late, which means that a number of items given budgetary appropriations had to be postponed."
"We noted with satisfaction that, during 2000, the Justice and Home Affairs Directorate-General increased the number of audits completed on its services."
"Sixty-four were performed in 2000 compared to 44 in 1999."
"We also noted that the amounts recoverable or reduced payments as a result of the audits has increased more than 10% of the total value of contracts."
"Which means that we believe that the Commission should step up its efforts, if necessary using contractual penalties to combat the improper use of subsidies or the overstatement of actual costs."
"Lastly, we noted with satisfaction that the Court of Auditors stated in the report that the management of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia has improved."
"There are, however, some anomalies, particularly as regards, for example, the appropriations granted for staff recruitment."
"The average cost of recruiting a member of staff at the Lisbon monitoring centre is EUR 2 780 compared with EUR 6 610 for the Vienna monitoring centre."
"Having said this and all things considered, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has no objection to granting discharge in the sector for which it is responsible."
"Madam President, our committee covers 120 budget lines, some very large indeed, including the research programmes Tacis, Phare and Meda."
"The implementation of those lines has been heavily criticised in the past."
"My first point is about the expenditure in 2000 of the Synergy programme, which is a programme to further international cooperation in the energy sector, and one strongly supported by the European Parliament."
"I am sure you can imagine, Commissioner, our astonishment and dismay when the Commission abandoned this programme in the year 2000, cancelled a call for tenders already published, causing huge inconvenience, and proceeded to spend no money at all throughout the year 2000."
"I cannot emphasise strongly enough that this is unacceptable behaviour and that the relevant Commissioner is well aware of our views."
"I am pleased to say that remedial action has been taken and we look forward to an enhanced programme in this very important sector."
"I turn now to the Tacis programme on nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union."
"This has regularly been severely - and rightly - criticised in the past."
"It is work which is carried out in difficult conditions, in an area where slackness and inefficiency in the implementation of budgets was traditional."
"We note with pleasure a marked improvement and look forward to reassurance about the safety of nuclear installations in the former Soviet Union."
"I would like to thank colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control for their cooperation in helping us to undertake the very important work of scrutiny on which our committee, could spend all its time on if we wished to."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to focus my attention on the agencies."
"It is there that we urgently need more efficient and transparent monitoring and controls."
"I say that not only because the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has responsibility for four of the agencies, but also in view of the fact that the number of agencies is constantly increasing."
"Today there are eleven agencies, but there will soon be 14 of them, for, as you will be aware, we will also have agencies for the safety of food, and for safety in travel by air and sea, once the issue is resolved of where they are to be based."
"As already mentioned, our committee is responsible for four agencies, in Dublin, Bilbao, Thessaloniki and Turin, and we have, in principle, no problems with them, but this does not alter the fact that there is a fundamental problem with Parliament having only one discharge procedure for four agencies."
"Yes, the agencies do now have their own rapporteur on the Committee on Budgets, and Mr Kuckelkorn has already achieved a great deal."
"Nonetheless, though, we do need all the agencies to be treated on an equal basis, and so, today, I call on the Commission to draw up proposals to put all the agencies on an equal footing in the discharge procedure."
"To do this we must, above all, make appropriate changes to their legal basis, without which the future will find us still incapable of auditing the agencies satisfactorily when the Budget comes round, and that cannot be in anybody's interest."
"Cooperation between the committees of this House also needs to be improved."
"The guidelines for the agencies drawn up in 1998 should therefore be examined from four angles: with a view to ensuring appropriate control machinery in the specialised committees and transparency in the Budget procedure, reinforcing the requirement for mutual information and clear demarcation of competences between the committees involved."
"Our committee will be drawing up proposals in relation to this."
"Let me, in conclusion, again warmly thank Mr McCartin and Mr Staes for their support so far in this regard."
"Madam President, first of all could I put on record my thanks to Mr Bowe who was the budget rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment for the first half of the mandate."
"The general approach to the discharge procedure is to look at the percentage of the budget line that is spent."
"If 95% or more is spent then a tick is put beside that item."
"If less than 80% is spent there is a black mark."
"But if we have the information at our disposal we should look more carefully at the achievement of goals with this money, rather than purely the fact that the money has been spent."
"For example, on the fifth environment action plan only 70% of the budget was spent."
"The reason for this is that there were not sufficient good projects; in fact some calls had no response at all."
"We should not give money to bad projects."
"However, there is one slight caveat to that: I hope our bidding systems are not becoming so bureaucratic that some potential bidders with good projects are put off from bidding at all."
"I will mention public health budget line B3-4301 on combating cancer."
"In 1999 there was a substantial under-spend on that and I am pleased to see that in 2000 it was almost fully committed including the overhang from 1999."
"It would be verging on the criminal not to deploy resources allocated for combating diseases such as cancer."
"It is true that the environment budget of EUR 200 million - that is GBP 125 million - was only half spent in the year 2000."
"The reason for this was the Life projects, which make up half this budget, and which could not be spent in 2000 because the legal basis was not determined in conciliation until July 2000."
"I am pleased to see that the five-year project has been telescoped into a four-year project instead."
"Despite the substantial under spending in the budget that is largely due to the Life III lines, and bearing in mind that the Court of Auditors have not voiced concerns, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy recommends that discharge be granted in respect of the 2000 budget for the budget lines within its competence."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I thank the rapporteur, Mr McCartin for his report and efforts and, in particular, for the way in which he highlighted the major concern of my committee, namely the slow rate of implementation of the Community's structural funds."
"As he so rightly highlighted, that is the bulk of the problem in terms of the surplus that this Parliament is addressing. The question to which my committee failed to receive a satisfactory answer from the Commission, was why do we allow such a situation to develop in the first place?"
"It was predictable that in the first year of the structural fund programmes rates of implementation would be very low."
"Yet we were faced with wholly unrealistic budget forecast expectations and scenarios which, by definition, could not be fulfilled. So we are dealing with a situation where, in many areas, there has been almost no expenditure whatsoever under certain budget lines for the Community's structural funds."
"We believe this makes it much more difficult for this Parliament and my committee to scrutinise the budget adequately and rigorously."
"As a regular item on our committee agenda, we have now decided to focus on budget scrutiny and, at each discussion, we invite the Commission and the Council to participate with us in a thorough review of expenditure within the structural fund area."
"But that job is made very difficult by these wholly unrealistic budgets."
"The Commissioner must explain how we are expected properly to evaluate a budget which is in itself extremely questionable."
"Our second concern really relates to the second point the rapporteur made in his opening remarks - the way in which the structural funds are currently managed."
"We share his concern that the regulations are overly complex and make our job, as a Parliament, of scrutinising the budget very difficult."
"So we have a double problem there."
"Many organisations, individuals, groups, associations and communities that are eligible for structural funds fail to receive their fair share because of the over-complexity of the application process."
"We, as a Parliament - and the other authorities charged with monitoring budgetary expenditure - have a problem in that we cannot adequately monitor expenditure to ensure value for money."
"My final point concerns the trans-European networks."
"We reiterate our view that the Commission is right to focus on fewer projects but we oppose the fact that the Commission is now planning to make a EUR 60 billion addition to the trans-European network transport budget line."
"We invite the Commission to comment on how they can ensure value for money when they are planning such a massive increase in expenditure."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Blak on having finally taken the decision to propose, in his report, the discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 2000 financial year."
"The Commission, and particularly Commissioner Nielson, have made a great effort to keep Parliament informed on expenditure from these funds. Developing countries that are beneficiaries of these funds deserve the adoption by Parliament of the discharge already approved by the Court of Auditors."
"For this reason, the Socialist Group and the Committee on Development, for which I am rapporteur, support this discharge."
"However, we would ask the Commission that in future more funds be earmarked for social development and that these be more clearly reflected, as proposed by the Committee on Development, in both the budget and the EDF."
"We hope that next year we will be able to analyse the figures for EU aid in accordance with the OECD's Development Aid Committee system, which will allow us to measure the impact of Community funds on the promotion of social development more accurately."
"With regard to the amendments tabled by Mr Blak himself, we have to reject those which refer to access to documents and the revision of the interinstitutional framework agreement, not because of substantive issues, for the agreement is not actually proving to be very effective, but because we cannot question, in each report by the Committee on Budgetary Control, the validity of an agreement that has been negotiated, signed and voted on by this Parliament with the participation, let us not forget, of members from that very committee."
"The Courts have also stated their opinion in this regard."
"We therefore understand that that matter of access to documents should not be raised in a report."
"On the other hand, we support the other amendments regarding audits and the management of the business development centre."
"This exercise in the discharge of the EDF, which we ritually tackle each year, should serve as an illustration, once again, of the ridiculous situation where Parliament inspects the discharge of funds that do not figure in the Community budget, the amounts of which we are not consulted on and on whose expenditure we are only informed of a posteriori."
"The EDF, implemented by the Commission and theoretically controlled by Parliament, should be included within the Community budget as a fundamental quantitative and qualitative element of development policy."
"We believe that at this time of reform of the European Union, we have the perfect opportunity to remind ourselves of this fact and I would encourage all political groups to communicate this proposal, which Parliament has supported for many years, to the Convention."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is one of Parliament's prime functions to scrutinise and control the EU's Budget, and, in doing this, greater attention urgently needs to be given to how the equal opportunities policy is to be financed in the European Social Fund's 2000-2006 programming period."
"The Spanish President of the Council, in his presentation to the committee, expressed the intention of giving equal opportunities policy a fixed place as a mainstream function in the complex of employment and social affairs."
"That has also become a necessity, as the figures show that only 6% of the resources in the European Social Fund are allocated to special measures relating to equal opportunities, whereas Parliament had asked for 15%."
"The underutilisation of resources and the great extent to which resources have been transferred is a consequence of the problems accompanying the Structural Funds' initial operations in the programming period 2000-2006."
"Procedures for structural measures had to be rationalised and simplified, as they are too complex at both Community and national level, and we must now work on preventing the recurrence of such difficulties when the new programmes are to be set up in the future."
"The evaluation report on the Daphne programme became available only yesterday."
"What particularly interests me in it is the reasons for the low take-up of the payment authorisations in the Budget year 2000."
"What is most important is that women play an important role in sustainable development, and gender issues should therefore be taken into account at every stage of planning, implementing and evaluating development cooperation."
"I therefore request clarification as to how it is that payments for this accounted for only 59% of resources."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities focuses on just a few Budget items, but they are all the more important for enabling the objectives of equal opportunities policy to continue to be pursued in the EU."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report Mr Blak has presented on discharge for the European Development Funds clearly shows the particular problems faced by European development policy."
"There are manifest problems originating in the Commission's system and in the way it works."
"Hence it cannot be acceptable that there should be, at the end of 2000, a sum of EUR 6 billion available and yet unused."
"It cannot be the case, in view of the increasing destitution in many ACP countries, that the Commission is unable to manage to get the funds made available to those who are in need of them."
"The Commission has made a start on changing the system in these areas."
"It has, since the Cotonou agreement, been going further down the road of giving aid in the form of sectoral budget support programmes."
"Put in simple terms, that means that the Commission has more faith in the recipient countries' responsibility."
"That is, in itself, a way of going about things that should be welcomed."
"The only thing is that this trust must, of necessity, be counterbalanced, in the event of misuse, by a consistent demand for the money to be returned."
"It is such consistency that is evidently lacking, as the Court of Auditors noted that, whilst the Commission carries out audits, and also spots abuses, not one cent of the EUR 14 million referred to by the Court of Auditors had been reclaimed or retrieved."
"Here, the Commission must summon up the courage to state the reasons for this."
"Either this is the fault of its own incompetent administration, or there are general political reasons for refraining from demanding the money back."
"I take the view that this will prove to be the scratch test for the new system of finance."
"If greater trust is placed in the recipient states, that presupposes that the recipients are fully answerable for any misuses."
"Everything else strikes me as inconsequential and as not in the long-term interests of the recipients."
"Here, the Commission must come to a definite decision and must not go down the road of least resistance, more comfortable though that would no doubt be."
"We are left with criticism of a few of this EDF process's anachronisms, with which we have long been acquainted and which ought to be done away with as quickly as possible."
"If Parliament is to give discharge, then it is Parliament to which budgetary and legislative power over the EDF's resources should be conceded."
"The Statement of Assurance, too, which is given by the Court of Auditors in its report on the EDF, must, like the Statement of Assurance on the General Budget, involve a complete audit and must not stop at the point where the funds leave the Commission level."
"Here, too, is the explanation of why there is a favourable Statement of Assurance relating to the EDF."
"The existence of two different Statements of Assurance is not only confusing, but also deceptive."
"I turn now to the discharge for Parliament's budget, where Parliament must be especially careful to avoid the least whiff of the suggestion that it might treat its own funds with less rigour than it treats those of others."
"I wish to expressly emphasise the demand in the chapter on personnel policy in Mr Virrankoski's report that the meagre representation of women in positions of leadership should at last be ended and that there be a serious attempt at an equal opportunities policy."
"Parliament's Secretary-General bears personal responsibility for this."
"Parliament must set an example if it does not want to lose its credibility."
"It is something more than sad that the Secretary-General has not seized these opportunities throughout the long years he has been in office."
"I also think that Parliament must play an exemplary role in creating an independent internal audit department, meaning that the auditors would not be subject to directions of any kind from the Directors-General and the Secretary-General."
"We also welcome the right to make reports directly to the President of Parliament."
"The report on the discharge of the Parliamentary Budget must neither cover up omissions and deficiencies, nor should it be misused in order to have internal problems dealt with elsewhere, which is what seems to be the objective of several amendments that have been reintroduced in the meantime."
"In particular, the Financial Regulation is not suited to solving problems within Parliament."
"These we have to sort out ourselves."
"Transparency, regularity and responsibility for one's colleagues are principles which, as Mr Blak said, are self-evident in the Parliamentary context."
"They are not suited to the settlement of party-political disputes, and there should not, therefore, be constant and self-tormenting calls for them."
"I will conclude by asking you to support my Amendment No 8 to Mr McCartin's report. It instructs the President of Parliament even now to defend Parliament's rights under Article 276 of the Treaty establishing the European Community before the European Court of Justice in the event of the Council again proceeding to restrict them."
"Mr President, my predecessors on the floor having almost all exceeded their speaking time by at least a minute, I crave your indulgence if I have to do the same."
"When this discharge procedure began last December with the Court of Auditors' report, I pointed out that we were now entering a stage in which we are talking about the systematic problem of the European Union's Budget policy and are less concerned with chasing after every potential or actual scandal."
"Two aspects indicate this, namely the comparatively small number of amendments before us to all the reports and the broad majorities by which they have been adopted, likewise the way that the prospect of this debate on the discharge has made comparatively few waves in the press."
"I would, though, like to say something very definite on the subject of Parliament."
"I want to pick up a point mentioned by Mrs Stauner, who spoke immediately before me."
"It is indeed true that it would be desirable for Parliament to be able to settle legally and entirely autonomously all the matters concerning the way it manages its budget."
"It would be marvellous, and I would support it, but the one problem with it is that no separation of Parliament's financial policies and the groups represented in Parliament is provided for in the European Union's Financial Regulation."
"It is, though, such a separation that we need."
"I would remind you that, two years ago, on the occasion of the Court of Auditors' report on the groups' financial policies, we had a great debate in this House, in which certain dubious financial practices on the part of individual groups reflected on the institution of Parliament as a whole and all Members of this House were seen by those in the galleries and by the press as having to answer for things which were in fact the responsibility only of individual groups."
"I would not wish to be made answerable for certain questionable financial practices that might well go on in other groups, and I likewise assume that, if something goes wrong in my group, Members belonging to other groups are not made answerable for them either."
"Mr Virrankoski's report now gives us the opportunity to take a significant step towards separating the responsibilities of Parliament's authorities and of the groups."
"It is a step that we must take."
"I warn against standing up and saying: How did we come to this pass, where we let the Commission, in a legislative proposal on the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation, prescribe what we should and should not do?"
"We would then be creating a tremendous sham conflict with the Commission, in which we would show off our wondrous strength, and one side-effect would be that the separation of the responsibilities of the House authorities and the groups would be deferred for ever and a day; another side-effect - perhaps an agreeable one - would be that certain things that were done in the past, could be carried on with."
"For example, if a group dismisses a member of its staff, he or she protests his or her innocence to the House authorities and takes Parliament to an industrial tribunal."
"Or when accumulated and transferred leave entitlements of group staff amounting to astronomical sums have to be paid out of Parliament's budget, whilst it is actually the groups who should accept responsibility for it."
"So I warn against using sham conflicts to bring about such a situation in this House."
"If this situation is to be avoided, we can provide a draft solution by tomorrow."
"If, though, the situation really does arise at the end of the day in which the present state of affairs perpetuates itself, then we will call those who are responsible by the names they deserve."
"Mr President, for the first time in many years, it looks as if this Parliament will once again be granting discharge to the Commission by 30 April, as prescribed."
"This is to be welcomed, in my view, and this is why I should like to congratulate Mr McCartin - and the other rapporteurs too, in fact."
"As far as the Commission's attitude is concerned, I have the impression that the Commission has made every effort to accommodate the many questions asked by Parliament within a very short space of time."
"What is most striking about this budget is that once again there is no positive statement of assurance."
"And this is the first budget for which the new Commission is responsible."
"We, the Liberal Group, as well as others, have said time and again that we need indicators to establish whether the situation has improved or not."
"If we keep hearing every year that there is no positive statement of assurance, how should we explain this to the public if we subsequently keep on granting discharge?"
"I should once again like to draw the Commission's attention to this problem, and ask the Commission, if the Court of Auditors refuses to develop an indicator, which is what now seems to be the case, to come up with an indicator of its own which, for example, highlights the fact that a margin of error prevails in a Directorate-General, the extent of this margin, and the extent of this in other sectors."
"The Court of Auditors can then verify subsequently whether the technique is sound."
"This will give Parliament a tool to assess whether or not a situation is improving."
"This seems to me to be a priority for the year to come."
"Another point already mentioned by Mrs Jöns is that we have noticed a steady increase in the number of agencies."
"Virtually every agency has its own financial rules accompanied by a complex discharge procedure."
"This is difficult for the many agencies."
"Would it not be possible for the Commission to develop a uniform model for all the agencies?"
"This too would simplify inspection by Parliament."
"Another point concerns the clearance of accounts."
"We, as the Liberal Group, have tabled an amendment which extends the period which lapses before it becomes final from 24 to 36 months."
"This allows us as Parliament to challenge the decisions by the Commission for a slightly longer period."
"And in our view, it is perhaps necessary to increase the financial corrections once again."
"The maximum is 100%, but what is stopping us from applying more gradations, which would provide us with another way of measuring upward or downward trends?"
"In addition, we take the view that the computerisation of customs offices in Europe should be prioritised, especially in the new countries."
"What specific action is the Commission taking to reinforce Europe's future external borders, and what can we as Parliament do to improve the situation on this score?"
"Finally, I should like to bring up a topic which has already been mentioned by various speakers, namely the European Union's new foreign and security policy."
"Indeed, it looks as if an entirely new policy is being developed which could well escape Parliament's attention."
"This is unjustified in the opinion of the Liberal Group."
"We think that an agreement must be concluded between the Commission, Parliament and the Council about a new interinstitutional accord, thus allowing the expenses made by the Council in this respect to be better monitored."
"Mr President, I too would like, on behalf of my group, to thank all the rapporteurs for their good work on the discharge of the General Budget this year, and make just a few comments."
"We greatly welcome, for example, the way that Mr McCartin's report addressed the issue of export subsidies."
"We will be giving that more of a cutting edge by means of an amendment, as it is our opinion that the subsidy of live animal transports still leaves too many openings for fraud involving subsidies that make no sense whatever to the EU's taxpayers."
"We consider this issue to be extremely important, and one where things need to be further tightened up."
"We will be supporting Mrs Morgan in giving the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs discharge for the last few years but still not for 1996 and 1997."
"We consider it extremely important that our committee should strongly reiterate that these years saw mismanagement of travel expenses and, even more important, that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs dragged its feet in clearing up this fraud, and that not enough was done to prepare the case for OLAF."
"This must continue to receive critical attention, and we must strongly reiterate that rather than cloaking the issue in silence."
"I would also like to express support for Mrs Morgan's demand that the Council be given discharge in the area of foreign and security policy, and also in internal affairs policy, all of which increasingly result in operational expenditure."
"I am, though, far from satisfied with the way in which the Council has dealt with these matters in the past, and I fear that it will still not give us a satisfactory answer."
"We must, then, again press home our view that this discharge must be for real."
"The 'gentlemen's agreement' no longer applies."
"On this point, a definite decision has to be taken."
"In conclusion, I wish to express my agreement with Mr Kuhne, who spoke before me."
"If we are to criticise the Council in the course of the discharge procedure, we in this House must handle our own discharge very carefully."
"The administrative and group budgets should have been separated a long time ago."
"I wish, though, to urge the Council to at last come to some decisions on the parties, where we in Parliament are not competent to act."
"We need the Council to at last decide on a party statute, which would be a practical response to public criticism on this point."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by commending my colleagues in the Committee on Budgetary Control, together with the committee's chairman, and also thanking those who participated in the committee and in the groups and who have carried out a very notable and thorough piece of work."
"This splendid work has led the majority to recommend giving discharge."
"Because of the little time available, I am unable to go into details concerning these many matters, just as others cannot either, but I would refer you to the excellent observations made by my colleagues, Mr Virrankoski, Mr Blak and Mrs Morgan."
"I shall concentrate on Mr McCartin's report on discharge to the Commission."
"I should like to quote from two recitals. Recital L reads: 'whereas 2000 was marked by a significant increase in the volume of fraud and irregularities identified by Member States and OLAF?."
"Recital P reads: 'whereas, in considering budget implementation in 2000, the fundamental question is to establish, firstly, the Community management features which should be the basis for effectiveness but are deficient, and, secondly, the components within the system which are conducive to fraud and irregularity?."
"There then follows a long list of incisive observations which, on being read, give the impression of our being concerned here with a South American banana republic."
"The EU was not established just a couple of years ago. This system has been in place since 1957, and it is wholly unsatisfactory that, year after year, we should write these reports, clearly and emphatically pointing out the errors, but that nothing improves."
"Next year, we shall write something which, for a change, resembles what we are writing this year, and then still give discharge."
"It should be noted that the criticism in Mr McCartin's report is just as severe as that in the report on the 1996 accounts, which brought the previous Commission down."
"Financial management and the legislation itself are unacceptably bad."
"In my country, a government characterised by management of this kind would be overturned, and the officials responsible fired."
"It is not good enough for so much of European taxpayers' money to disappear due to fraud and irregularities."
"People will simply not put up with it. This cannot be the price of cooperation in Europe."
"The only logical conclusion is, of course, to vote against giving discharge to the Commission."
"Mr President, the enormous budget surplus in 2000 to the tune of EUR 11.6 billion illustrates that budgetary management still leaves something to be desired."
"In the Structural Funds, under spending is even starting to have structural implications."
"In our view, unspent amounts should be returned to the Member States, at least after two years."
"This could help these Member States reduce their national debt, for example."
"We therefore support Amendment No 9 tabled by Mr Heaton-Harris."
"The management of the Structural Funds requires substantial improvement."
"The complex Community regulations must be simplified."
"Coordination between the Commission and the Member States is well below par."
"Financial inspection is riddled with loopholes, both ex-ante and ex-post."
"The current financial correction system must also be changed as a matter of urgency, because it encourages Member States to cover up irregularities and fraud instead of reporting dirty tricks."
"We have known this for years, but the Commission and the Member States are still doing much too little to improve the situation."
"We are disappointed that the pre-accession aid programmes are not achieving their objectives by a long chalk."
"The findings in the special report drawn up by the Court of Auditors are disturbing."
"The fact that it is unlikely that the candidate countries will be able to implement the various aid programmes during this calendar year is unacceptable to us."
"I would ask the Commission to inform us of the present state of affairs."
"The reform of the European Commission which was initiated in 1999 is still not evident in terms of specific results in 2000."
"I trust that the Commissioner will now have some insight into the results achieved over the course of 2001."
"We would be interested to find out whether she would be prepared to share some of the information."
"There is also considerable under spending in aid programmes for development cooperation."
"Duplication with Member States' policies may be partly to blame for this."
"Would the Commission map this out for us soon?"
"In our view, the subsidiarity principle should be taken seriously in EU development policy."
"Finally, I have made the shocking discovery that each part-session in Strasbourg costs approximately EUR 11.5 million extra per week, quite apart from the environmental pollution they cause."
"This Parliament is forced into this situation solely in order to honour the wish of one Member State."
"It would therefore be fair if this Member State were to reimburse this House to the amount of the total estimated annual additional costs of EUR 138 million."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is customary for a speaker to congratulate the rapporteurs and this is something that I am very happy to do."
"I would like to congratulate them all, with one exception."
"I shall not name the person, since we are all friends and acquaintances here, but I cannot congratulate one rapporteur who has had his report adopted unanimously and who is tabling four amendments on behalf of his group."
"I do not think that this is acceptable behaviour - and I shall say no more - because, when they see the name of the rapporteur, Members will think that he has made technical amendments to a text that received a unanimous vote."
"I believe that a rapporteur should be honest with his fellow Members and with himself."
"He drafts a report, which is unanimously adopted by the members of his committee - of which I am one - and then I notice that he has tabled, on behalf of his colleagues, some amendments that have a different aim."
"I think that this behaviour is totally unacceptable and I now urge my fellow Members and the political groups to reject these amendments."
"A Member cannot be both rapporteur and the author of amendments - he is either one or the other."
"I agree with tabling amendments to other reports, but not to one's own report."
"That is why I regret that I am not able to congratulate this Member on his work."
"With regard to the other reports, I would like to raise two further points."
"The first point is to Mrs Eluned Morgan, a dear friend."
"This is 2002, the third millennium: the world is making progress, facts of law are often set in stone, so why persist in refusing the 1996-97 discharge to the smallest institution in the European Union?"
"What will our citizens think when they find out that we have granted discharge to all the institutions, but we are delaying discharge from seven or eight years ago to the Economic and Social Committee?"
"We have blamed and accused ECOSOC for the facts that came to light and enough is enough."
"For goodness' sake, spare us the embarrassment of being haunted by this scandal, because if we must be haunted by a scandal - I assure you, Eluned - we can all drag up past scandals all over again."
"This is not the right approach."
"Lastly, regarding the report by Mr McCartin - whom I would like to congratulate in particular - I want to stress that we can, of course, go over all the cases in all the Member States and highlight them, but we must not get hung up on specific cases."
"I therefore call for paragraph 60 to be deleted immediately and I strongly urge the Members to amend the words in paragraph 60 which relate to a Member State that I hold in great esteem."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs, especially Mr McCartin, who has taken a reasonable amount of flak from me."
"I should also like to congratulate Mrs Morgan on her discharge report."
"I was not in the Chamber when she made her comments about ECOSOC, but I am sure she is now with me in calling for this organisation not only not to get discharge but actually to be disbanded because it is a waste of money."
"My primary job here on behalf of my group is to talk about the Staes and Seppänen discharges."
"This is very easy because they are two very good reports written by two very good parliamentarians."
"Regarding the McCartin report, I want to put on record, especially for people in the public gallery, some of the simple facts which we should be talking about."
"There is still no positive statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors."
"This is the seventh year running."
"There probably never will be one because they have got themselves into a very tight corner now."
"How can they give discharge to an organisation where 5% or more of the budget is lost through fraud, mismanagement or waste and 14% of the budget, at least, is running as a surplus?"
"Nearly 20% of the budget is not spent correctly, as we would like it to be."
"This is not a record to be proud of."
"The discharge report by Mr McCartin contains a number of quite scathing points and highlights ongoing problems within the Commission."
"And yet Mr McCartin comes to the conclusion that he should recommend discharge."
"Quite correctly, he notes that the majority of the EU's budget is administered in the Member States."
"However this does not absolve the Commission of final responsibility and accountability."
"The buck stops with the Commission."
"It is its responsibility, as stated in Article 274, to implement and oversee the Community's budget."
"Once again this is a year in which it has failed to manage and control the Community's budget properly."
"My party's representatives in this House were elected on a whole host of pledges, the main one being to sort out the accounts of the European Commission and other European institutions and make sure that the reform process that most people in this House are pleased to see going forward is actually driven through and achieves results."
"As much money is now being lost through fraud and mismanagement of funds in the 2000 budget as when we made the pledge in 1999 to try and sort this out."
"John Wiggins, a former member of the European Court of Auditors, is quoted in a British newspaper saying that the situation in the Commission is unchanged."
"Things have got to change."
"The European Parliament's legal services wrote a note to the Budgetary Control Committee on 5 November 2001 giving an opinion on whether not granting discharge should lead to the fall of the Commission."
"It states that undoubtedly refusal to grant discharge is the expression of serious political sanctioning of the Commission."
"Its legal effect, however, is not such as to compel the Commission to resign."
"That is covered by a special procedure laid down in Article 141 of the EC Treaty."
"In voting not to give discharge to the Commission, we are actually making sure that the Commission knows firstly, that we do not want it to resign and, secondly, that we want it to sort the problems out."
"If nothing has changed by this time next year, if there is still no positive statement of assurance, if there is still 5% and more waste, mismanagement, fraud and disappearing money, and if there is still a huge budget surplus, then we will be getting to the stage where we will have to say to the people in the public gallery and the people who put us here that nothing has changed in the European Commission, the reform process is still ongoing - and is the slowest process ever - and we have failed in one of our core tasks which was to sort these problems out in the first place."
"That is not a record to be proud of and not something I am prepared to stand before my constituents and say."
"Mr President, I am sure it is no reflection on the quality of Mr Heaton-Harris' speech that the public gallery emptied while he was speaking."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs involved for their work on this vast subject."
"In my opinion, the discharge procedure is a fundamental part of our work and is one of the distinguishing powers of our institution: the power by virtue of which we verify, year after year, that the good intentions and resolves, and also the expectations of the citizens who elected us and for whom we are responsible first and foremost, are fulfilled."
"This subject is both extremely technical and extremely political, and the consequences for both sectors of decisions taken in haste or under emotional stress can be - and, unfortunately, do often turn out to be - disastrous."
"That is why I feel that we should ask ourselves before the vote, each year, not so much whether everything has been done perfectly but rather whether we are going in the right direction, whether we are setting ourselves the right priorities, whether, in the executive action of the Commission and - to a much lesser extent - all the other institutions, there is evidence of the intention to implement the will of the two arms of the budgetary authority as well as possible."
"Concentrating especially on Mr McCartin's report and, therefore, on the Commission's budget, I feel that three points warrant particular emphasis; indeed, the rapporteur himself has already stressed them."
"Firstly, the financial year 2000 has been characterised by an exceptional level of overspending with regard to the budget, which shows that the budgetary forecasts were severely short of the mark."
"Secondly, although 2000 marked the start of a new programming period for the Structural Funds and preacession aid which stretches until 2006, this cannot have been very successful given that so many difficulties were encountered in implementation."
"Lastly - and this point may well be more important than the previous two - the rapporteur was right to point out the need to establish, on the one hand, the features of Community management which should be the basis for effectiveness but are deficient, and, on the other, the components within the system which are conducive to fraud and irregularity"
"These are, in my opinion, the areas we must address if we are to achieve proper, sound implementation of the budget in the coming years."
"Mr President, the EU's institutions continue to provide opportunities for major irregularities in the conduct of financial affairs."
"The reason for these is still the weak points in the legislation, cooperation between national authorities that is poor or utterly lacking in coordination, and excessive laxity in monitoring and in imposing penalties."
"This is again confirmed in the reports before us on the discharge procedure for 2000."
"The Court, for example, did not name Member States that were negligent."
"These Member States, whose lax monitoring undermines the combating of fraud, should not only be shown up, but should also make good the damage their laxity causes to the EU."
"OLAF's work in connection with the travel expenses affair was equally inadequate."
"In order to stem fraud, though, we also need radical reform of Europe's VAT system, for example, by abolishing the deduction of tax within the enterprise chain at national level as well, as it at present strongly favours VAT fraud."
"Mr President, I would like to start my speech by thanking and congratulating the rapporteurs for the work they have carried out, with a particular mention to Mr McCartin, who has done some magnificent work in a very short time, the result of which is a good definition of the form the discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2000 should take."
"There are still some problems, however."
"Generally speaking, there is a unanimous call for the modernisation of public authorities and for the process to be further simplified, which would give rise to greater transparency and better public understanding as a whole, whilst bringing this important process closer to the EU citizens."
"Whilst we gave our support to the rest of the reports, I would like to make a particular reference to a report on which our group, the Group of the Europe People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, abstained - the Morgan report."
"With regard to this report, we do not agree with the rapporteur or with the committee outcome in several regards."
"We understand all that has been said in this House with regard to the irregularities of the Economic and Social Committee in 1996 and 1997."
"This period, when there were some administrators who did not do their job properly, when many investigations were carried out, when documentary proof was requested and that which was available was surrendered seems like a long time ago."
"It is true to say that today there are new administrators and new procedures; there is now no problem, as demonstrated by the 1998, 1999 and 2000 discharge."
"We do not believe that we can accept this slur on an organisation which cooperates with the other institutions, such as the European Parliament, particularly when the current administrators have done all they can to clear up all of these irregularities."
"We believe, however, that the best thing that we can do is to draw a line under this whole affair, put this case of poor administration behind us and to give the Economic and Social Committee a new opportunity to maintain a good relationship with Parliament in the future, a good relationship with Parliament and to properly represent all social administration - as it has up until now - and for it to be one of the most effective bodies in the European Union - one of the oldest, if not the oldest - of all those we are analysing today in this report."
"This is a discrepancy that we therefore hope will be cleared up when we vote in plenary."
"We also disagree with the rapporteur's proposals with regard to the Council."
"We believe that the Council discharge should be approved."
"Foreign and defence policy are recent issues."
"We have to look at things from a different perspective."
"I believe that the rapporteur could take steps to facilitate a more appropriate solution by taking the opinions of the Group of the Europe People's Party into account."
"If this is not the case, we will have to vote against the report."
"We hope that this matter is cleared up and that, if this is not the case, this part of the report can be sent back to the committee, in order to facilitate the development of the aforementioned foreign and defence policy for, as I say, we should not continue with the current approach, given that we have to achieve a better understanding and a better clarification of procedures carried out to date."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to congratulate all our rapporteurs on their excellent work and to offer my sincere thanks to the Commission for its cooperation."
"I should like to emphasise the constructive and genuinely European attitude demonstrated by our fellow Member, Mr McCartin, and the support given by the staff of the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture."
"The McCartin report is an important part of the process of reforming the common policy."
"I hope that the remaining European institutions take due account of this, preparing the necessary measures for the phasing out of refunds for farm exports and ensuring that these refunds are used instead for the purpose laid down by the Treaty, which is to ensure a reasonable standard of living for the rural population."
"I should like to say, however, that where fraud in the food industry is concerned, we need to go considerably further."
"Speaking of dairy products - a sector that is quite crucial to the Azores - I cannot accept a situation in which farmers live in a state of constant fear of being fined for overproduction while European criminal organisations are falsifying tens of thousands of tons of butter with the complicity of the major European dairy product groups and while the dairy industry is receiving subsidies for powdered milk, which is basically whey, while major dairy produce companies are selling the equivalent of hundreds of millions of litres of what purport to be dairy products, but are, in fact, counterfeit products that are not made from milk."
"Nor can I accept that the Commission has had very little or nothing to say on this issue!"
"In addition, if we look at other fields, such as oil, wine, or even meat, the picture is not very different."
"Fraud in the food industry, which is often perpetrated in order to obtain export or disposal refunds, is now one of the greatest problems facing the budgetary control of agriculture."
"We therefore urge the Commission to rapidly establish an initiative in this field that will enable this state of affairs to be brought to an end."
"Mr President, at the outset I feel I should refer to the news of further decommissioning of arms in Ireland."
"I welcome this news, particularly in the present climate of political hostilities in various parts of the world."
"It is a clear demonstration that the political process and the peace process are well under way."
"Why do I link that with the budget debate?"
"Well, in discussing the budget, it is important to note the important role that the European Union and the European Parliament have played in this peace process through the International Fund for Ireland, the establishment of the Peace and Reconciliation Fund, INTERREG and the removal, through the Single Act, of the economic border which affected the border region for many years."
"So it is relevant to refer to this."
"I would like in particular to commend my colleague, Mr McCartin, for his thorough and comprehensive work on the very important matter before us."
"The power that we have in Parliament, which we share as the Union's budgetary authority, is perhaps the greatest responsibility that we have."
"We are talking of EUR 100 billion of public money."
"We have a duty to subject this expenditure to the highest standards of scrutiny."
"Parliament may have the final say in signing off the accounts, but it is important to recall that 84% of the Community budget is managed within the Member States."
"It is also important that a strong culture of openness and cooperation exists between the Commission, the national, regional and local authorities."
"Of course, the largest part of the budget goes to the common agricultural policy, one of only a few truly common policies in the Union."
"It has served us well and must be maintained and defended."
"I am concerned at some suggestions that export refunds should be ended and I reject any notion that export refunds are somewhat inherently conducive to fraud."
"I remain convinced that refunds constitute a fundamental element of the policy; they play an important role in the management of agricultural markets and must be defended at WTO level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start with the observation that we have six reports, all of which recommend discharge - with the exception of one part in Mrs Morgan's report, which we have already discussed. I think that is something we have not seen for a long time."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteurs most warmly, but would also like to mention that the highest levels of the Commission were represented in many of our meetings, and this made management easier - something mentioned by you, Mrs Schreyer."
"To give or withhold discharge is actually the greatest power Parliament possesses, in which Parliament is superior to the Council, and that is why it is a highly political instrument."
"Let me emphasise that again."
"This time, the judgment on the way that the Budget was managed in 2000 was indeed lenient, especially, too, in the report on the Commission."
"So I would just like to mention three points, and briefly."
"One is the issue of the large surplus that remains."
"I am less concerned about whether this money reverts to the Member States or is set off, than that it should not be used to achieve political objectives, especially in the areas of structural policy and enlargement, and that makes me very vigilant."
"There is room for improvement here, and another surplus of this sort for 2001 will not be acceptable."
"The second point is the Statement of Assurance that the Court of Auditors did not grant."
"This instrument is evidently not that fully applicable."
"It is very difficult for us, in the absence of percentages of errors, to judge whether errors have been committed, and how many."
"The third issue I wish to address is that of monitoring, in which field the Commission, being responsible for the Member States and also, already now, for the candidate countries - one can take Chapter 28 as an example - must take great care that the European Union's financial interests are effectively safeguarded."
"I therefore see the Green Paper on the creation of a European public prosecutor as showing the way ahead."
"Mr President, considering this first discharge procedure for the new Commission somewhat dispassionately, we observe two explosive things: firstly, a gigantic Budget surplus, a massive underutilisation that actually shakes budgetary truth to its very foundations."
"One cannot but wonder for a moment why we spend months here on the Budget process if 14% of a Budget is not utilised."
"I know, as we all do, that the underutilisation in 2001 was even greater than it was in 2000."
"If, against that, we set the fact that the same year, 2000, also saw a doubling of the irregularities and frauds that were recorded in this Budget, then, in Budget matters, the first year of Mr Prodi's Commission seems not to have been much of a success."
"But, Mr McCartin, this does not mean assigning the debt to the Member States!"
"Commissioner Schreyer has already referred to the desire to make use of the time for enlargement, in order to prepare these countries for it."
"So I ask the same Commission what is happening about the implementation of pre-accession aid in the context of agricultural policy, which was demonstrably not implemented at all in 2000 and 2001."
"The same Commission proposes to the European Union that enlargement should take place in 2004."
"How, then, is that to be done?"
"Either the countries desirous of joining are - to put it in plain language - too stupid to collect money they have been given, or the Commission is not in a position to devise pre-accession programmes that are, at the end of the day, capable of being implemented!"
"Today already, Commissioner, we can take it for granted, for example, that a programme such as IACS, that is, all the agricultural monitoring systems about which we have had so much to say, cannot be implemented for years on end if these countries are onboard, one of many reasons being that the Commission has overslept and missed the pre-accession programmes."
"I think it highly important, Commissioner, that we should, in the years to come, not spend all our time speculating about who should hand over which documents to whom - if any at all - and estimates differ as to how great this agreement between Parliament and the Commission is."
"What this is about is that you at last grasp that you are accountable to the European public for all of what you have utilised - or, in this instance, not utilised - right down to the last cent."
"Then, it is to be hoped, we will enter the new culture of political management in Brussels that Mr Prodi has, admittedly, promised us, but which has not, to date, been discernible."
"Mr President, I would like in the first instance to commend the rapporteur for his work."
"His years of experience and expertise in this field make him eminently qualified to deal with such an important matter."
"The largest part of the budget, of course, goes to fund the common agricultural policy, and this is an important community measure which must not be undermined."
"This summer the Commission is due to publish its proposals for the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy."
"This was agreed in Berlin."
"It is very important that this review is not used in any way as a means of reforming the policy at this particular time."
"This must be deferred until agreement is reached on agriculture at the world trade talks."
"Suggestions, for example, that export refunds should be ended, would have disastrous consequences, particularly for Ireland where we export up to 90 percent of our entire agricultural production."
"Mr President, the report on the implementation of Parliament's budget is highly controversial."
"Although I cannot deal with all its contradictions, I cannot but denounce the truly futile calculations it contains with reference to personnel and other costs at our various places of work."
"All of these are intended to run Luxembourg and Strasbourg down as places of work, to glorify an unhealthy emphasis on the centrality of Brussels and to undermine the decisions under the Treaty which laid down Strasbourg and Luxembourg as places of work."
"These were enshrined in the Treaty and cannot therefore be altered by Parliament, thank God!"
"Nor should they, of course, be eroded without further ado, be it by the administration, by the bureau, or by a small majority in Parliament using devious means and our calendar of part-sessions."
"It strikes me as positively perverse for this report to welcome a reduction in the number of journeys on official business that our officials take from Luxembourg to Brussels and back, and for it to be boasted that, in 2000, EUR 2.8 million was saved in this way, ignoring the fact that these figures conceal enforced transfers of lower and middle-stream officials from Luxembourg to Brussels, which their families find traumatic and socially and financially intolerable."
"Someone has also forgotten to state what additional costs are incurred through sending hundreds of officials to Strasbourg from Brussels every month, instead of from Luxembourg, thus, of course, resulting in greater expense."
"The intention which comes to light is a disconcerting one."
"In the report, Strasbourg gets more of the same treatment when it is mentioned that the variable costs of the five-day part-sessions in Strasbourg are 33% higher than for those in Brussels."
"I would like to propose that creative accountant for the Guinness Book of Records!"
"What is certain is that Parliament's nonsensical decision to cut the Strasbourg part-sessions down to four days led to the costs per day of the part-sessions now being substantially higher, quite apart from this plenary not having the time to deal properly with business, especially with legislative texts!"
"What is praised for being good value turns out, in the final analysis, to be substantially more expensive."
"The ratio of price to quality is quite simply wrong, and that is what I wanted to take this opportunity to say loudly and clearly!"
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to echo my fellow Members' comments and thank and congratulate Mr McCartin on his report."
"Mr McCartin took on this report at short notice, as I myself was due to draft it, and he has worked on this task in a very able and rigorous manner."
"His report is a balanced, reasonable and positive piece of work."
"I would personally like to praise him and I sincerely hope that the report is adopted."
"Mr McCartin is right to recommend the discharge."
"The problems raised are not so much problems regarding the timing in the implementation as problems related to an increasing lack of realism, as has been said, between, on the one hand, the financial perspectives that were set in Berlin and the budgetary forecasts that the Commission sets on an annual basis, and, on the other hand, the genuine needs arising from the implementation of the budgets."
"We must take steps to correct this imbalance."
"As regards the Morgan report, I support Mrs Avilés Perea's comments on the fact that we cannot support the refusal to discharge the Economic and Social Affairs Committee's budget for the two consecutive financial years since this body made a considerable effort to improve the situation and because it is never a good idea to respond to the positive reform which has got underway by maintaining sanctions."
"I therefore believe that the committee's positive efforts call for a positive response on our behalf."
"As regards the Virrankoski report, I support the comments Mrs Lulling made earlier on the problems raised by paragraphs 25 and 33 of the resolution."
"We may well agree to have a single place of work for Parliament in Brussels, but, until the Treaty specifies otherwise, if the Treaty provides for several places of work, it is our duty to ensure that this work can be carried out in the appropriate conditions."
"Paragraphs 25 and 33, however, seem to insidiously call into question the provisions of the Treaty."
"Mr Van Hulten told us that the Treaty was desired by one single Member State, so I leave you to draw your own conclusions from this."
"The Treaty is the expression of a collective will, the expression of political balance and we must all respect this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you very briefly for your many contributions, observations and suggestions during this discussion."
"I would like to suggest that the specific questions raised by the rapporteurs of the individual committees should also be discussed in those committees with my colleagues."
"We have agreed a new procedure for working together on setting priorities for next year, in which context, during April and May, there are to be many bilateral discussions between the relevant committees and the Commissioners."
"When talking about the priorities for the forthcoming year, one must also, of course, draw on the experience of past years."
"The Commission will of course, in the coming months, be working on the other issues and demands raised in the reports and will give an account of this work in the follow-up report."
"We have indeed seen that these discussions have, much more than in the past, focused on structural issues in budget management and implementation, and also on reliability testing."
"These issues will no doubt leave their mark on joint discussions in the coming months."
"As regards the methods used by the Court of Auditors to produce a Statement of Assurance, it goes without saying that we are prepared to look deeper into this concept and the idea of a single audit, in order to enhance and improve the coordination between the Court of Auditors and the checks carried out on the spot by the Internal Audit Service on behalf of the Commission."
"Turning to enlargement, the admittedly great delay in the agricultural programme has shown that it is sometimes necessary to give priority to the requirements of monitoring."
"This has necessitated great restructuring on the part of the candidate countries in which the individual paying agencies are now gradually being accredited."
"We hope that this year will then see the start of disbursements to the farmers."
"Let me again thank the rapporteur, Mr McCartin, the other rapporteurs, and the whole Committee on Budgetary Control for their work and for their recommendation that discharge be given."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves today at the second reading stage of a draft Regulation that I regard as being of great significance and which in particular makes one thing clear, namely that, particularly through the committed involvement of the responsible Commissioner, the lack of what should long ago have been a matter of fact in the field of air travel has, in recent months, at length been successfully made good. I refer to the fact that air travel should know no frontiers and regulations and safety measures affecting air travel should naturally, therefore, also be without borders, meaning, in this instance, that they should be organised, as is appropriate, on a uniform basis across Europe or at least throughout the Member States."
"The regulation we are reading for the second time establishes an agency for aviation safety and ensures that assessments will in future be made uniformly as to which aircraft are to be built in accordance with which criteria before being licensed to enter service."
"It is obvious that the uniform assessment of designs makes this step significant in terms of air safety, but it is in my view also self-evidently essential to the aircraft industry, which has hitherto had to apply for authorisation in each individual Member State, but will in future be in a position to sort these problems out with one authority and with one agency, and get the relevant certification from them."
"The task of the Aviation Safety Agency will be to approve aircraft, certify them and oversee their operation."
"At the same time, supervision of the flight crew, as also maintenance and other measures, all of which are factors in aviation safety, are in future to be regulated by law, something for which we clearly expressed a desire during discussions in committee and during preparations for second reading."
"Let me repeat the clear message that this regulation's principal objective is the creation of a uniformly high standard for aviation safety in Europe."
"There are of course further objectives or knock-on effects associated with this, which can be described quite briefly."
"These are, on the one hand, greater cost-effectiveness for the aircraft industry, and on the other, which I consider equally important, the fact that it will be guaranteed that relevant standards will be interpreted in a uniform way, thus promoting and enhancing the Community's position in the world, that is, with especial reference to the American situation."
"The committee's concern was that the Aviation Safety Agency's general political independence, for the issues involved are exclusively of a technical nature, in which decisions are to be taken by authoritative experts and specialists rather than by politicians in Parliament or the Council."
"It was also important to guarantee the Agency's autonomy, meaning that the Executive Director really is the head of the authority and, at the same time, that the Management Board is in a position to lay down appropriate guidelines for the Agency and influence the way in which it works."
"I know that this puts us into a conflict situation with the Council and the Commission, but I believe that our numerous discussions have brought solutions which of course ensure that the Commission's responsibility is made clear, that it will continue, so to speak, to supervise the Aviation Safety Agency, but that it is clear at the same time that the Aviation Safety Agency must also take responsibility for itself in its area of expertise."
"I am confident that a conciliation procedure will be avoided, that we will be able to activate this regulation with the Council's agreement, and that the Agency will indeed be able to start work twelve months after that."
"We have, in my judgment, taken a great step forward in the area of aviation safety."
"I will take this opportunity to thank all of those who set this legislative project in motion and supported it, especially my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Transport and Tourism."
"I also thank the Commission and the Council for their willingness to seek compromises, and now hope that today's vote will enable us to complete this report, and that we will then begin a new chapter in the history of aviation safety in Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, on his report which now brings a sensible compromise to the original Commission proposal."
"It is fair to say that all of us in this House would have fully supported the creation of a pan-European body dealing specifically with the certification of aeronautical products, which is eminently sensible and which I fully support."
"However, my own view was that the scope of the original Commission proposal was too broad and there were a considerable number of concerns regarding the issues of sovereignty, the regulatory framework and in particular the autonomy of the proposed agency."
"It must be emphasised that, as with national civil aviation authorities which quite clearly deal solely with safety matters, this agency should not be drawn into dealing with other aspects, such as environmental and competition issues."
"In addition, I would expect it to work along similar lines to those of national civil aviation authorities whose responsibilities are as independent regulators."
"Although I received a comprehensive response from the Commission regarding the future of the national CAAs, their role still needs to be further clarified in terms of their future scope and remit."
"It should also be emphasised that efforts should continue to be concentrated on achieving uniform applicability of ICAO, JAA and Eurocontrol standards that are already in existence."
"The safety agency should not seek to parallel and create unwilling distortions of the current ICAO-based safety framework."
"Finally, as we would expect independent experts to run this agency, it would not be in anyone's interests should there be undue political or Commission interference, thereby potentially rendering the issue of safety a secondary factor."
"My group believes that guaranteeing a high and uniform level of safety and environmental protection in civil aviation is the key objective in setting up the European Aviation Safety Agency and drafting attendant legislation."
"This is a major and logical step on the way to a comprehensive European aviation policy."
"Common rules create clarity and predictability, but can, at the same time, prevent duplication and thus save money."
"Uniform European rules are in the interest of industry, but they must also enhance consumer safety, of course."
"As far as we are concerned, the scope of the Agency may be broad, starting with certifying aircraft types, then extending the scope to include other elements, such as training."
"Needless to say, we must make effective use of existing national capacities and build in a transitional period to move towards a fully-fledged Agency, although this period should remain limited."
"We are not keen on a dual-track policy involving competing bodies."
"So-called third countries must be persuaded to participate in improving safety agreements."
"For this purpose, the European Union must develop a pro-active policy."
"It should be reasonable, yet unyielding."
"We must avoid leaks in the safety system due to a lack of sound agreements with countries that fall outside the scope of the proposed legislation and of the Agency."
"In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, we adopted the rapporteur's compromise amendments."
"We too would like to see this matter brought to a prompt conclusion."
"So we are calling on the Council and the Commission to respond in the same cooperative spirit."
"The PSE Group praises the rapporteur's determination where the Agency's independence is concerned."
"This is a key point for us too."
"Safety, not the request for competences, must be top of the list."
"Independence does not mean that the Agency is not accountable for its actions, and the European Parliament wants to take an explicit part in this."
"We will assume our responsibility, even today, in setting up the Agency, but we should also be allowed to carry out our task as the European Parliament in a well-informed manner."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Mr Schmitt for the excellent work he has done in preparing this report."
"The formulation of common rules for civil aviation traffic and the establishment of an Aviation Safety Agency are important steps forward in the area of improved air safety."
"Other important goals are improved levels of environmental protection, and the promotion of fair competition and proper certification processes."
"To achieve these goals the Aviation Safety Agency must function as independently as possible."
"The necessary acts must be applied uniformly at both national and Agency level."
"Commonly applied rules will lead to greater cost-effectiveness and a reduction in superfluous administration."
"The longer transitional period contained in the common position is necessary to allow time for the Member States to replace the current complicated regulatory and certification procedures with certificates."
"Most air traffic accidents are due to human factors."
"As aviation becomes ever more technically complex the compilation of data and information exchange are of paramount importance in the improvement of civil aviation safety."
"Although air traffic has always been a relatively safe form of transport, its growth, as well as airport and airspace congestion have increased the risk of accident."
"Close cooperation between Member States for the purpose of raising levels of civil aviation safety will be an important precaution as air traffic grows."
"The safety of European airspace is in the interests of everybody."
"In my opinion we should move towards a compromise as quickly as possible and avoid conciliation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, with the creation of the European Air Safety Agency, the European Union is proposing to achieve and maintain a high level of safety and environmental protection, which are of genuine importance to European society and also to European integration."
"We do, of course, support this idea."
"I should like, in any event, to say that safety and the protection of the environment are closely connected to the distribution of airports, which is suffering, in practical and serious ways, as a result of the trend to centralise airports that is prevailing in most European States and which is being promoted by central governments, which, for political reasons and reasons of power, are concentrating investment in capital cities, and by the so-called flagship companies, which, for the same reasons are centralising their flights and sending them into the same airports."
"Consequently, most of Europe, just like my own country, Galicia, is suffering considerable hardship through being deprived of decent lines of air communication, traffic is becoming concentrated to an extraordinary degree in the air corridors that link the capitals, and the communities that live near to these central airports suffer the consequences of the noise and the bottlenecks."
"All of this militates against the sustainable development that we must try to achieve from the points of view of both safety and economics and from the social and environmental angles."
"I would say that we are, therefore, facing a serious problem, which we must start to resolve."
"Mr President, Mrs de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, transport safety is an area in which combined efforts on the part of the EU countries can save thousands of lives."
"We in Europe enjoy high levels of air safety but the growth in traffic continually obliges us to take more effective action."
"I would however say, regarding this, that it is incomprehensible and even disgraceful that this proposal has not been made until now and was not put forward ten years ago."
"In fact nations have been going their own way and politicising at the expense of human life."
"National pride must make way for rational cooperation."
"An Aviation Safety Agency could also be an example of EU integration at its best, provided that the pitfalls of bureaucracy are avoided."
"In this we should learn from the United States of America, where they trust in people."
"The concentration of information and harmonisation of standards are essential for the prevention of accidents, but regulations should not normally be tightened up only after accidents have occurred; instead, there should be a systematic analysis of present and future risks."
"That, again, will not succeed unless all the Member States have the same tools at their disposal."
"Our world is expanding at an ever-increasing rate, although this Chamber might not always be willing to admit it."
"The Aviation Safety Agency should make decisions that apply to the world as a whole, whenever that is possible."
"We should also support Article 2E proposed by the Council, as nothing good ever comes from enforced decisions."
"Incidentally, I think that Parma would be a suitable location for the Aviation Safety Agency."
"Parma's excellent food, such as its ham, would guarantee the contentment of the authorities working there and, hopefully, some equally mature decisions for air safety and the private individual in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's resolution on the Aviation Safety Agency is one of the first of many decisions that we have to take in the area of air transport."
"A lot is moving in the skies above Europe."
"The crisis in air transport following 11 September appears in the meantime to have been almost overcome."
"Movements of aircraft are expected to double again by 2015."
"The restructuring of air transport is in full swing."
"The political response to these challenges is represented primarily by the Single European Sky and the optimisation of capacities at airports."
"The present time demands continuity in the midst of change."
"Safety in the air must be the highest priority in air transport."
"Previous strategies to harmonise technical regulations have not been able to keep up with the breakneck pace of developments in the air transport sector."
"This is another reason why we need the European Aviation Safety Agency, which is to be the heart of a future unitary safety framework."
"I am glad that we have found a European response in this sensitive area."
"We can chalk it up as a success in our negotiations with the Council and the Commission that it will be only a year after the Regulation enters into force that requirements for the operation of aircraft and for the approval of aircrew are timetabled to be drawn up, and that these measures are also to be applied to aircraft from third countries."
"Safety aspects of airports are also to be included."
"Turning to the agency's accountability, Parliament has succeeded in giving it greater independence, including from the Commission."
"It has also been laid down that Member States are to make an appropriate contribution when external delegations of the Agency are set up on their territory - a contribution which I think Parliament will take to be financial in nature."
"As a whole, discussion of the EASA shows that what we actually needed from the Commission is a framework directive on European agencies that would respond to the horizontal issues concerning a unitary structure for agencies."
"It is still unsatisfactory that the problem of budgeting for agencies' income could not be resolved as the Committee on Budgetary Control would wish."
"The Aviation Safety Agency will be followed by others, dealing for example with the safety of railways and ships."
"I consider this overall strategy to be suited to advance the integration of European transport markets."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schmitt's excellent draft report puts us on the right track, but we are still not quite at our destination."
"There must be safer air travel, at least within the EU, and its safety must know no frontiers."
"That is our objective."
"One of the key elements in achieving this objective is an Aviation Safety Agency that is capable of guaranteeing a uniform and high level of safety in the air on its own responsibility and with good organisation."
"Well-organised, sole responsibility is the key word."
"Parliament must continue to insist, whatever the Commission's supervisory responsibilities might be, that they remain of a supervisory nature and that the Commission and others do not make themselves out to be co-designers of all the details."
"It is not only in the well-known proverb, but also in this present instance, that too many cooks spoil the broth."
"We MEPs must therefore continue to insist, and do so over and over again, on the agencies being as independent as possible, and, for example, on the Agency's Executive Director having an important role internally and not just externally."
"So we want other directors of the Agency to be appointed on the proposal of the Executive Director and hence on his responsibility."
"There is something else that we want and need - legislation in force as soon as possible, so that the agency can take up its role in the service of greater safety in the skies of Europe with the minimum of delay."
"We therefore hope that we will quickly agree on a common document with the Commission, but above all with the Council as well."
"In its amendments, then, Parliament has been quite deliberately restrained where we believed that this common ground might be endangered, and we hope that the others will now join in too in search of this unity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I shall, like most of my fellow Members, praise the efficient work of the rapporteur, Mr Ingo Schmitt, who has worked in a constructive manner with the Council and the Commission."
"As a result, we have a balanced compromise text and one which gives us every opportunity to avoid conciliation."
"I would like to stress the quality of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the need to make up for lost time."
"We have already waited too long."
"In the area of transport, as in many other areas as well, it is our duty to ensure that a similar, high level of security is provided in the Member States."
"It is also high time that the aeronautics industry benefited from a single certification for placing its products onto the market."
"I hope that the European Aviation Safety Agency will be able to start work in the very near future and it must be able to provide a single certification for the Airbus A 380."
"This will represent the completion of many years of work by engineers, staff and employees and it is evidence of what Europeans can do, what they can achieve when they work together."
"It is a powerful symbol."
"The first test flight of the A 380 is planned for 2004, the first commercial flight for 2006 - just around the corner, in other words."
"In order to fulfil its tasks, the European Aviation Safety Agency must be independent and rely on skills and qualifications that can be found in the Member States."
"As we know, the European Agency must not be used to coordinate the work of the existing national agencies."
"We must firstly strive to be efficient, and, in this respect, it is easy to understand that for certification work, the European Agency must work in conjunction with the major European design and manufacturing companies."
"I think that the regional agencies would be a good way to enable this to happen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Europe must offer practical advantages to its citizens."
"To do this, we must provide the same level of security, for a single sky, and a single certification in a single market."
"The text before us today is an important step in this direction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, on his work in full cooperation with the Commission and the Council."
"This cooperation will allow us - we hope - to approve this text for the establishment of the Agency, foregoing the need to go to conciliation."
"The main objective of the common rules in the field of civil aviation and the establishment of a European Aviation Safety Agency is to maintain a uniformly high level of safety throughout the European Union, and to better protect the environment, as mentioned by the last speaker a few moments ago."
"Using this system, we will also be able to simplify the current procedures for aircraft certification, which will stimulate the internal market and the competitiveness of European products, as several speakers have pointed out."
"The main instrument of the new system will be a common European certificate that will provide access to the whole European market and serve as a basis for recognition agreements."
"As you are well aware, as this point has been highlighted throughout this debate, European industry is hoping that this Agency will be able to issue a certificate for its next star product: the Airbus 380."
"The proposal therefore constitutes a considerable step forward, given the objectives it pursues."
"Furthermore, this is also a true innovation in the field of Community integration, if we take into account the fact that up until now the civil aviation sector has been principally characterised by State sovereignty and intergovernmental cooperation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you approved the Commission proposal at first reading with several amendments. Many of these amendments have been accepted by the Commission and integrated into the Council's common position."
"At this second reading, the rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, wanted to insist on certain issues that had not been included in the common position."
"The contacts established between the three institutions, which all want the European Aviation Safety Agency to be successfully established as soon as possible, mean that we have now reached a solution which is acceptable to all."
"Therefore, I hope that today Parliament as a whole will be able to confirm its support for this text so that the approval of the Regulation can take place next June, with the establishment of the Agency from Summer 2003."
"With regard to the amendments, I would like to point out that the new amendment, Amendment No 29, could compromise the fragile balance we have been able to achieve, as well as the expected timetable."
"Consequently, the Commission cannot accept this amendment."
"I would like to point out that Amendments Nos 1 and 4 have caused us many problems. These amendments are proof of the European Parliament's will to rapidly extend the Agency's areas of responsibility to all sectors relating to safety, particularly with regard to licences for personnel and air operations."
"With regard to the fundamental issue at hand, the Commission is of the same opinion as Parliament, but, on behalf of the College of Commissioners, I would like to say for the record that the Commission has several reservations with regard to any wording that could interfere with its right of initiative, as set out in the Treaty."
"Therefore, the acceptance of Amendment Nos 1 and 4 can in no event be taken to imply any restriction of this right of initiative, inasmuch as these measures were already set out in our own work programme."
"In the specific context of this issue, the Commission therefore accepts the amendments and confirms its will to put forward these proposals, whilst underlining the fact that this was already set out in our own timetable and pointing out that in no way can this be considered as any kind of restriction of our right of initiative, as set out in the Treaties."
"The Commission can fully support the other amendments."
"Many of these improve the text of the common position or clarify its content."
"The Commission can also unreservedly support those amendments which increase the powers of the executive director and the provisions that aim to facilitate his or her appointment."
"We can accept the amendments that aim to strengthen the Agency's autonomy, specifically Amendments Nos 9 and 11, and it seems completely reasonable that the Commission, not having the necessary technical knowledge, should not change the content of technical standards without the prior cooperation of the Agency."
"These amendments have been written in such a way that Commission's right of initiative is preserved, for which I would like to thank Parliament."
"Parliament, exercising its role as the budgetary authority, wanted to introduce an amendment, No 2, in which it calls for the establishment of common rules with regard to financial or other contributions that States often contribute in order that agencies may be set up in their own territories."
"The Commission does not object to this."
"Finally, Parliament also wanted to send a clear political signal by means of Amendment No 16, whose objective is to limit the period during which both Community and National certification systems can function."
"The Commission considers that Parliament's arguments are justified, and for this reason, we can accept this amendment."
"Lastly, with regard to Amendment No 15, Recital D, the Commission, like the Council and the rapporteur, understands - and I would like to stress this issue - that access to these locations must be strictly necessary and not indiscriminate."
"I believe that with this in mind this issue can be settled."
"Developments on this issue mean that we can expect the Regulation to be quickly approved and I would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work and Parliament as a whole for its approval, like the Council, foregoing the need to resort to conciliation."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few minutes, at 12 noon."
"The sitting is adjourned until Question Time."
"This morning in London the funeral takes place of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, a woman whose century of service to Britain during Europe's most turbulent century has won for her a very special affection in the hearts of the British people."
"I ask you, colleagues, as a mark of respect for the deceased Queen Mother, to observe one minute's silence."
"(Members rose and observed one minute's silence)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor only in order to point out a small textual error that has crept in during the proceedings."
"It is in Amendment No 15(1)(d)."
"The word 'relevant' needs to be inserted before the word 'premises'."
"There are different versions of the text; in some of them the word is completely absent, whilst in others it has become 'any'."
"I therefore ask for it to be corrected to read: 'relevant premises, land, or means of transport.'"
"Would the linguistic services please correct the text as requested by the rapporteur."
"I now call upon the Commission to inform us of its position on the amendments."
"Mr President, I thank the rapporteur for his clarification, which I had also indicated in my speech."
"In other words, we accept all of the amendments except for No 29."
"In this way we hope to maintain the interinstitutional agreement, which will therefore allow us to approve the European Aviation Safety Agency."
"Mr President, before we vote on this particular report, I think that it is important that Members are aware of the legal advice given by our own legal services, which was not available when we voted in committee."
"This makes it quite clear that certain aspects of this report fall outside the scope of the Community's responsibilities referred to in Article 175."
"The good news is that voting for Amendment 28 will solve all those problems."
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the following. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the amendments adopted today - with thanks to the plenary - have been adopted by the European Commission."
"Yesterday, at the end of the debate, the European Commission said that it refused to be responsible for five or six amendments."
"The way in which this was done at the end of yesterday's debate is objectionable in my view."
"Why?"
"Because only the rapporteur is informed about the reasons why legally correct amendments are not adopted after all."
"I therefore take the view that the Commission should justify its behaviour."
"We cannot tolerate things being done one way one day and a different way the next for no apparent reason."
"Additionally, the Commission should, in my view, reconsider the amendments that have now been adopted in a letter, and all my fellow MEPs should receive a copy of what should actually have been said in the debate."
"Thank you very much."
"A representative of the Commission is here and has heard your speech, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"I hope she will be able to respond to your comments."
